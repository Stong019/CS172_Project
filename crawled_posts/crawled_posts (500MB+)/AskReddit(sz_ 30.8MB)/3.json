There is ***nothing*** more satisfying than pulling up to a red light and seeing a car a kid beam the shit out of their sibling in the back seat.\n\nRelated, we were extremely aggressive about our punch bug games while in my car. Something about calling punch bug while in a bug made the whole thing a lot more fun. We'd keep a running tally for weeks until someone forgot the totals and we had to start over. \n\nAlso, kids just love beetles anyway. I used to get so many comments and questions about my car, but my favorites were from little kids. God, I miss that car.\n\nEdit: Another fun fact I\u2019d forgotten! 2000s era bugs had dashboards made of this plastic that smells identical to crayons when it gets warm. So after sitting in the sun all day it would smell like a box of Crayola. People would accuse me of leaving crayons in my car, but I eventually found out it was the dash.

I was in the parking lot at a Walgreens and this little girl was staring at me. I think she thought she was seeing a real life Barbie. She walked right into one of those giant columns made of brinks. Face first. Giant smack. She of course immediately started sobbing. And her sister just stared at me like - look what you just did!!! It was equal parts shameful, shocking and hilarious.

On this scouting trip, the two had decided to liberate Zwolle together, but were spotted and Arsenault was killed. Major, enraged, killed two Germans while the rest fled. On the outskirts of the town, Major intercepted a vehicle, disarming the soldiers there. He told a French speaking soldier that all the Canadian artillery would be firing on the town in the morning, and decidedly let the Nazi free to spread the rumour, even returning his weapon as a total alpha move.  \n\nThat night, Major decided to single handedly liberate the town. Arming himself with many weapons, he made explosions and noise, making it sound like the entire Canadian army was there. Several times that night, Major went back and forth from Zwolle to the Canadian base taking 8 to 10 German prisoners each time. \n\nAt one point, Major located the Gestapo (high ranking Nazis) headquarters and raided it himself. He killed several SS officers and the rest fled. By morning, Major discovered that the Germans who had taken Zwolle had entirely retreated. \n\nI should also mention that Major was a sniper who had only one eye from a phosphorous grenade explosion years prior and remained in the military because he insisted he only needed one eye to aim his weapon and that to him, he \"looked like a pirate\".\n\nThe Dutch town of Zwolle was liberated. By a one-eyed sniper. He has several other legendary acts, but this to me was his best.\n\nEDIT: Some details, including the return of a Nazi's weapon.",

His extraordinary assault lifted the pressure from his company for the moment, allowing members of his platoon to comply with his motions to advance and pass him more grenades. \n\nWith a chain of his comrades supplying him while he stood atop the hill, he furiously hurled a total of 2 cases of grenades into a main trench and other positions on the reverse slope of Hen Hill, meanwhile directing the aim of his fellow soldiers who threw grenades from the slope below him. \nHe left his position, where grenades from both sides were passing over his head and bursting on either slope, to attack the main enemy trench as confusion and panic seized the defenders.\n\nStraddling the excavation, he pumped rifle fire into the Japanese at pointblank range, killing many and causing the others to flee down the trench. Pursuing them, he came upon a heavy machinegun which was still creating havoc in the American ranks. With rifle fire and a grenade he wiped out this position. By this time the Japanese were in complete rout and American forces were swarming over the hill. Pfc. Craft continued down the central trench to the mouth of a cave where many of the enemy had taken cover. A satchel charge was brought to him, and he tossed it into the cave. It failed to explode. With great daring, the intrepid fighter retrieved the charge from the cave, relighted the fuse and threw it back, sealing up the Japs in a tomb. \n\nIn the local action, against tremendously superior forces heavily armed with rifles, machineguns, mortars, and grenades, Pfc. Craft killed at least 25 of the enemy; but his contribution to the campaign on Okinawa was of much more far-reaching consequence for Hen Hill was the key to the entire defense line, which rapidly crumbled after his utterly fearless and heroic attack.",

            "I lost my job on March 13th a day after my birthday, I work in a planetarium on a college campus delivering lectures (that I make) about astronomy and physics. As we got closer and closer to shut down we began losing shows (many shows are field trips from k-12 schools) and on friday we were told to cancel our last remaining public showings. I'm terrified now about what I'm going to do financially and I'm even more worried about the consequences of the decisions I will have to make. Not only do I work at the college but I also attend classes there as well to study astronomy and physics. My big concern now stems from a little backstory so here we go. I left my old job in retail almost a year ago to the day after trying to work up the courage to change my life for years. I decided to go back to school to change my life and because of this decision I was able to land basically my dream job at the planetarium. I have been nothing but happy this last year, that is until recently when I was laid off because of coronavirus shutdowns. Now my decision is to try and weather the storm and wait until I can go back to work, or get a job in retail again (I have recent enough managerial experience that would make this pretty easy) to pay the bills. This worries me because it feels like the opposite of progress and I'm worried I wont be able to get back to school when the pandemic ends. Dont really know what I'm gonna do but I have a couple side hustles that might pan out enough to get me and my family through this. Sorry for the long post but this is basically the only time I've talked about this to anyone besides my wife.",

The \"weakness\" question is being asked in a workplace, and so your answer should pertain to the workplace, not your personal life. Saying \"well I just can't resist brownies\".... that's not an answer as it pertains to the workplace. The interviewer is both assessing your ability to reflect on personal development AS WELL AS your self-awareness within the workplace. They want to know if after they hire you, you have the social maturity to keep work at work, and home at home. Their also trying to gauge whether or not your going to be a future pain in their ass. So yes, give an honest answer, but still an answer as it relates to your profession. If you need an \"Office\" reference think \"How would Jim answer this question?\", not \"How would Dwight answer this question?\"\n\nHere's a good example:\n\n\"*Sometimes I get distracted at work, so I've recently started using an app to regulate my screen time.*\"\n\nIt's honest, it's related to the workplace, it's short and concise, it's a real issue, it shows that you're working on your issues.

            "My boyfriend who has zero history of seizures narrowly escaped dying from one because my overthinking led me to break into his house when he didn\u2019t answer the phone.\n\nMy overthinking had begun a few nights prior. He mentioned that he but his tongue in his sleep and woke up with a bloody pillow and sore mouth-  but he had no memory of it happening. That for some reason led my overthinking brain to question \u2018Wow, did he have a seizure and not realize it?\u2019 He has zero history of seizures, and we had been together multiple years (didn\u2019t live together but spent nights together) and I had never seen a hint of a seizure. But for some reason, this stuck in my mind. \n\nFast forward two days. We usually don\u2019t hang out in the morning because he likes to sleep in late, but on this day we had an appointment to go see a specific dog at the shelter I was thinking of adopting. \n\nHe wouldn\u2019t answer the phone that morning. I called multiple times before I went to his place, but he never picked up. I started getting a bad feeling but quelled the \u2018He\u2019s having a seizure\u2019 thought, because that was clearly SO unlikely, meanwhile making an action plan for that very scenario. \n\nI got to his house and he wouldn\u2019t answer, so in a completely NOT ME crazy girlfriend move, I climbed over his fence. Luckily his door was unlocked. \n\nI found him unconscious and unresponsive, lying in his back with the sticky remnants of foam all around his mouth. \n\nI jumped into action- I rolled him on his side to help curb aspiration, put a pillow under his shoulder to keep him in that position, and called the ambulance.\n\nHad I not hopped the fence to get in- had I not driven over when he didn\u2019t pick up the phone- had we not had plans to meet up hours earlier than we usually did- he would have been dead by lunch. His kidneys were already shutting down by the time he reached the ER. \n\nIf he had never mentioned biting his tongue in his sleep, I don\u2019t think I would have been overthinking at all. No crazy worries about seizures would have pushed me to go over and find him.\n\nTurns out to be a weird brain disease that\u2019s bizarrely endemic to New Mexico kind of- cerebral cavernous malformations .\n\nSeveral days later, after we got home from the hospital, I got a call from a friend who said the dog, against all odds, was still at the shelter- as in the very dog we were supposed to be seeing that day. I had given up hope on getting her, pushed it out of my priorities while he was hospitalized- but they had forgotten to take down my 24 Hour Hold sign on her cage, so no one inquired about her. \n\nShe\u2019s now our miracle dog and is the sweetest animal I\u2019ve ever owned. My boyfriend wouldn\u2019t be alive today if we hadn\u2019t made an appointment to meet her.",

            "I found a nickel-sized lump on my fifteen month old daughter\u2019s temple, freaked out, obsessed over it, researched it exhaustively, and concluded it was a dermoid cyst that had worn through the skull. I was told by a pediatrician that it was a bone bruise that would fix itself over the course of three to six months, no imaging was needed, and I shouldn\u2019t make an appointment at the children\u2019s hospital because it would resolve on its own. I got an X-ray done anyway and the radiologist confirmed every one of my suspicions, but the pediatrician still said to wait and see because that\u2019s what you do with dermoid cysts and it was definitely not through the skull despite what the radiologist said. Made an appointment at the hospital anyway, and the surgeon swore up and down that although it was a dermoid cyst as I\u2019d suspected, it would not be through the skull since in all his years of practice it never had been. Well guess what? It WAS through the skull, and it was pressing on the membrane between the skull and the brain, a hair\u2019s breadth from breaking the membrane or pressing on the brain. A couple more weeks of waiting and my daughter could have had seizures, a brain infection, lasting damage. I overthought it and now she\u2019s a happy, healthy three year old.",

            "This was at 9 years old. We had driven home and seen the beginning wisps of smoke for the California Cedar fire in 2003.  \n\nNaturally, I assumed the worst, and packed up all my clothes and spent about an hour making a travel cage for my guniea pigs. I tied their water bottle to the side so they could drink, packed up their food and their favorite furniture just in case. \n\nI then spent the next few hours monitoring the fire on the news and out in the distance from our window, periodically asking my parents if we needed to evacuate. \n\nAt some point in the night the fire sped up like crazy and was literally on the hillside across the street. I went in to my parents room and said \u201cthe fire is across the street are you sure we shouldn\u2019t evacuate?\u201d\n\nAt this point we all went crazy grabbing important documents and supplies and as we were about to lock the doors and drive I realized I forgot my guniea pigs. My parents told me it was too late and I didn\u2019t have time to grab them, but when I cried and explained I had them packed up, I was able to grab them and go. \n\nThe house ended up ok thanks to a neighbor putting out embers before they took, but we were gone long enough my pigs wouldn\u2019t have made it. \n\nTLDR; helped save my family and pets from a fire because I was an anxious child.",

Like, I would be up in front of class and then randomly get an erection and it would just pop out of my fly, in front of the whole class lol. It\u2019s making me laugh just typing this out. \n\nYou know that episode of South Park where Jimmy keeps getting random stiffys? That was basically my life. Usually I would just tuck it in my waistband and wait for the storm to settle but I still had the huge fear of it popping out of my fly because I forgot to zip it up. \n\nSo what did I do? I started wearing my boxers backwards so that even if I forgot to zip up my fly, my schlong wouldn\u2019t be exposed. It was a pain to use the urinals but honestly I got used to it pretty quickly. \n\nFlash forward a couple months and I was at the movies with a big gathering of people. It was basically a big group of girls and my group of guy friends. Each guy and girl paired up and made sure to sit next to each other. I was paired with the girl I had a huge crush on. We shared a popcorn and soda and it was a huge moment for me. \n\nBriefly into the movie, I got one of those damn random boners and I quickly but discreetly stood up and did the ol waistband tuck. When I sat back down, I could feel it pop out through my zipper. THANKFULLY, my backwards boxers kept it from saying hello to my \u201cdate\u201d but I still panicked and had to cover up in hurry. She noticed but I think we can all agree that a sixth grade boy\u2019s erect penis hiding under a layer of underwear is better than just sprouting out bare in the middle of a crowded movie theater. \n\nAlso, she never said anything to her friends about it.

Prior to a football game, at the warmup area, he called me as I was about to head to the game, saying that someone in his section had a problem with their instrument, so did I have a loaner?\n\nNow the thing about being a clarinet player is that everyone you know calls you every time they see a cheap plastic clarinet for sale at a garage sale or the like. So over the years (especially when my son was in jr. and sr. high) when I saw one of these for $50 or $100 I grabbed it.

We were signing the contract for the event and I kept thinking that it was quite remote, so I asked: \"how much time does it take for the ambulance to get here?\" \n\nI became the laughing stock of both families. My (then future) mother in law, who was present at the meeting, literally fell down from the chair laughing. The wedding organizer, remembered it for weeks, telling about it everyone we met.

Every family dinner all the aunts and uncles were \"checking\" if the ambulance was present. You name it. The entire package.\n\nStill I couldn't get rid of this weird feeling.

I was set and was able to give the family with two kids across the walkway of me some fruit (I had apples and some tangerines) and allowed the kids to use my sketchbook to draw in (it was a ratty old thing).\n\nOverthinking and over-preparing can be tedious but worth it when it comes to situations.",

            "In college I was on my university\u2019s equestrian team. I\u2019d been riding long enough to know that anything that can go wrong, will go wrong at a horse show, especially if you\u2019re not prepared for it. My car was always full of gear, and I was always poked fun at for it, but I saved so many team mates butts. Your crop broke? I got you. I always carried two. Got horse slobber all over your show coat? I got you. I always carried two extra pairs of show pants and there was at least one show where both of them were needed. Then there was also the situation where the billets broke ( a strap that helps hold the saddle on) on one of the horse\u2019s saddles and it was either a dressage saddle or mine. We made it work with mine. Who brings their own saddle to an away horse show? I do because you never know what you\u2019re gonna need.",
            "**I want to add a trigger warning to this before I dive in to protect those who have dealt with abuse**\n\nGrowing up, my dad really instilled the fear of not being prepared in my head.

The last one is what came in handy.\n\nUnfortunately, one of the worst case scenarios befell our family two years ago. My oldest daughter disclosed that she had been molested by my then FIL. I went into full auto-pilot here: took my daughter to a safe room, had family pick up my dog and youngest daughter, made sure she didn\u2019t wash her hands. When she had to use the restroom, I asked her not to wipe. We didn\u2019t change her clothes, we didn\u2019t have her brush her teeth. \n\nThe DNA evidence they were able to collect off of her put him in prison and will keep him there. \n\nSurprisingly, this has helped my overthinking.

Then, get a can of tuna and plop it in a cake pan and put that in the car.  Cat problem solved!

            "Honestly, this whole pandemic. I have struggled with severe germophobia my whole life, and as a little kid, I found out what a pandemic was and was really scared of the idea of one happening at some point within my lifetime. The more I read up on pandemics and their history as I grew up and lived with that fear, the more likely I came to feel it was. \n\nWhen Covid was just a thing in Wuhan, I had heard it could be transmissible for weeks before it showed any signs and symptoms, and in the modern day of fast, worldwide travel constantly occurring on a mass scale, I right away felt like \u2018there\u2019s no way this thing won\u2019t become as uncontained as possible in no time\u2019. \n\nI right away started to say that it was going to spread worldwide, be a serious issue, and that people here (in the States) wouldn\u2019t handle it well or act reasonably and would panic and buy everything off of the shelves at first and then immediately not take it seriously at all and call you weak if you do take it seriously. Every one I know laughed at me, rolled their eyes, and told me I\u2019m a crazy germaphobe. And then literally every single last detail of every single thing that\u2019s happened here in the US - from how bad it got exactly to the early panic buying days to the politicizing of the virus and the way Trump used that to his advantage to how long it\u2019s been around and how things might start wrapping up and getting back to normal a bit if we can vaccinate - all happened EXACTLY the way I called it play by play like a year and some months ago. \n\nSo idk if I\u2019d call everything that\u2019s happened \u2018unlikely\u2019 really, but at the mental level (and even partially the level of resources/taking precautions the experts tell us to take well before the experts began to tell us to take them - I already had masks/etc. and was social distancing before that was a \u2018thing\u2019 here), I\u2019ve kinda been gearing up for this my whole life in some ways.",

            "Keep in mind the mail carriers don't have air conditioning in their vehicles. There was one that got baked alive in California last year. The collection drivers don't have A/C as well, but they don't hit the residential areas for the most part.",

            "My father has been a postal worker for decades. What makes him smile the most is when people just reach out and be nice and friendly. He would always tell us stories about the people who would put a smile on his face. Notes/cards go a long way. But also just say hi and ask them how their day is going.",
            "Former mail carrier here, #1 get a bigger mail box lol. Water and treats are nice, but a box they don't have to get out at to deliver things is the gift that keeps on giving.",
            "Cold drinks and maybe a bag of chips or something. I\u2019m a current carrier and seeing that stuff can completely brighten our day. Also just saying hi, or leaving a note saying thank you. \n\nI have a customer who plays tic tac toe with me. That\u2019s pretty fun. \n\nHonesty anything helps and please be friendly and understanding if something is late or missing. As of right now a lot of this stuff is out of our control. It\u2019s coming straight down from up top and there isn\u2019t a lot we can do about it ourselves.\n\nEdit #1: I also agree that a big mailbox is an amazing option especially if you order a lot of small packages, but don't feel like you have to replace your mailbox. If something happens to your box or you're looking for a new one, consider getting a larger box. \n\nEdit #2: To speak on things being out of our control. What we really need is for people to realize exactly what is going on with the post office and to be informed about it.\n\nThe biggest thing right now isn't the mail in ballots. Yes, this is an important topic, but it's what's behind it that is even more important. \n\nThat is the De-Classification of the mail. The new Post Master General wants to and is actively trying to De-Classify the mail. This will have dire consequences.\n\nRight now mail is classified as 1st Class (Medication, Medical Docs, Bills, Letters, Court Docs, Taxes, Ballots, etc.) 2nd Class (Newspapers, Magazines, Media, etc.) and 3rd Class (Ads, Coupons, Farmer's Market Booklets, etc.) \n\nThis is so important because with the classification of the mail comes the standard that this mail must be delivered. \n\nWhether it be Sun, Snow, Rain, Wind, Virus, Riots, Pandemics, etc. Your mail will be delivered. \n\nWith the declassification of the mail, there is no standard. The precedent that the mail must be delivered, now no longer has any weight behind it. \n\nWithout classification, the Post Office, can and will delay the mail. If it isn't ready it doesn't go out. It may not even leave the facility. This right here is so important because this will impact everyone in our country. From Grandma to the largest corporations in the country.\n\nPlease know that your letter carriers and other postal employees are fighting with their unions to combat this potential catastrophe. Know that if your mail is late or delayed, your mailman will apologize, try to smile,\nand hope he/she doesn't upset your day. Know that we are doing our best for you and fighting for the survival of the post office.\n\nEdit #3: Thanks for the gold & awards. I more of a lurker than a poster, \nbut this is something I know about, and I really wanted to share it. I appreciate everyone taking the time to read this, so that you know what is going on. Thank you again.\n\nEdit #4: Some Postal Facts - https://facts.usps.com/",

            "A little thank you goes a long way. I can\u2019t tell you how many people have stopped me to ask if we\u2019re all doing ok, if we\u2019re worried about our jobs, or just to say the public is ready to fight for us. It\u2019s turned bad days around completely just to hear people are aware, listening, and appreciate us. \n\nEither hand your carrier a cold drink or snack and thank them, or leave something in the box with a note. Guaranteed to make them smile. Some of the carriers in my office are also taping any thank you notes up at the time clock to share the love.",
            "Here's a short list of everything I can think of that would make our lives easier. This doesn't necessarily apply to everyone, but here it is anyway.\n\n1. It's extremely hot in my city right now. So some ice water would be amazing. Some people put up signs to take cherries, pears, or apples from their trees - that's super helpful, since I don't carry food with me and the sugar helps especially on hot days.\n\n2. Keep your dogs inside. If they're outside, make sure I can access your mailbox without them getting anywhere near me. If your dog is sitting outside\nand I think there's a risk, you're just not going to get your mail. Also, if you're going to meet me at the door, keep your dogs under control. I've had two dogs burst through the door because the owner didn't put enough physical effort into restraining their dogs. One of them was friendly and I got plenty of kisses, but the other one would have at least hospitalised me if there hadn't been a gate I could get behind and close. Keep. Your. Dogs. Inside.\n\n3. The pandemic is still a thing. It's awesome to just hand you your mail because it saves me the trouble of walking up what is usually stairs to put it in your mailbox, but there's still that risk of infection.\n\n4. This goes for Canada, but I'm not sure about other countries. If you don't want flyers, put a little notice saying \"no flyers\" or \"no junk mail\" or something like that. They're all the same thing, so synonyms cover everything - no need to put \"no flyers or junk or unaddressed mail\" or whatever. Here's the big thing though: some people like to put it under the lid of the mailbox, and that not only makes it difficult to see when I'm delivering, but I can't see it until I lift the lid. That means I'm walking up to your house to deliver a flyer, even if you don't have addressed mail, whereas I could have just walked past your house. Making it visible from the road is really useful.\n\n5. Small mailboxes, anything with a rusted lid, that sort of thing - it all makes it more difficult to open and place the mail in. I admit, this point is just me being picky. Metal mailboxes aren't fun to touch in 30 degree weather. Big ones that are properly fixed to the wall/surface (some people's just fall down because they're attached with some loose screws), easily accessible, that kind of thing. If I got really picky, I'd ask for your addresses to be easily visible near the mailbox and from the road, and for mailboxes to be in convenient locations.\n\n6. Crossing the grass just makes our lives infinitely easier in so many ways. It does depend on your lawn and what kind of house you live in, but just in general, three steps instead of forty. Super helpful. So if you don't want us crossing the grass, which I do get, what about a stepping stone or two? I actually live on an acreage myself, and we use regular trails on the grass. Where we walk has turned to moss and small plants, and some people who come out here ask how we got it like that. Honestly, we just walk on it. The plants are native to the area, but they can't really compete with your lawn. One or two steps a day won't kill your grass, but even if heavy traffic does, you'll have more interesting plants growing there eventually anyway.\n\n\nI think that's everything!\n\nEdit: Please don't answer the door naked.",
            "Former letter carrier for nine years on a walking route. I know winter hasn\u2019t arrived yet, but when it snows, please make sure you shovel your stairs. Most people did, of course.\n\nAnd not that I ever expected it, but whenever there had been any significant snowfall, every once in a while a customer would shovel a narrow path across the lawn...mail carriers are instructed to cut across lawns whenever they can...but traversing a little shoveled path even for one house was one of the nicest gestures that anyone had ever done for me\u2014always made me smile.",
            "Tell us it\u2019s okay; vote out this dictatorship! Leave cold water in the mailbox. Stay 6 feet back. Tell us if your moving or going on vacation. We actually look out for your home and report if we see something not right while your gone. Most of us are former military with a strong sense of duty and commitment to people! We look out for the elderly.... we frequently look out for them and personally have found people having a stroke, heart attack and called 911 and waited with them until ambulance arrive; often are the only human contact for elderly and disabled people! Law enforcement frequently asks us about things we may have seen on our routes.... we love cards and drawings from kids, we love your dogs and know almost all our customers on our routes...a simple thank you or sticker on your mailbox that says \n\u201cWe stand with You USPS!\u201d We love our Mail Carrier",
            "I\u2019m sure this will be buried but honestly... please just be nice to us.\n\nI know that sounds pathetic but I have one or two customers a week flat out yell at me for something I have no control over. We can\u2019t track their missing package without tracking, a storm came through and blew their flimsy mail box lid open and got their mail wet, overseas parcels are spending longer in customs because of the pandemic. Those are all things I have been yelled at about just this last week. We have zero control over any of that. We deliver whatever comes to the office every day and that\u2019s all we can do.\n\nBut as I\u2019m sure most of your are normal humans who wouldn\u2019t treat others like that, I\u2019ll agree with the rest of the carriers in this thread! A smile, a frozen bottle of water (it gets 110\u00b0 in our trucks daily) and if you\u2019re really feeling generous, a large mail box if your order a lot! \n\nBut regardless of all of those things I still love my job. I still love the happiness I see when I\u2019m bringing someone a gift or a long awaited card from someone special. \ud83d\udc97",
            "Nothin against the delivery peeps as it\u2019s a super hard job with deadlines and no AC, but don\u2019t forget not all postal workers are delivery. My wife worked in one of the last coding centers left in the US and let me tell you that place was a nightmare from the get go. Micro managed, extremely shady practices on time off (sick, PTO and VTO), tyrant managers that would burn you in an instance if it helped their careers, a joke of an HR, write ups for sitting wrong in a chair or being 30 sec late from you 5 min break, and a Union that\u2019s basically toothless. Wife had a mental breakdown and couldn\u2019t work there anymore and I didn\u2019t blame her after seeing the shit going down for the last 9 years. Remember these are the people who make sure your letters are sorted to the correct destination, they need our support too.",

            "Clear out your box daily.  \n\nInclude your unit numbers if applicable. \n\nDon't ask me about \"x\" item. I don't know where it is. I'm delivering what I have.",
            "Im a PSE (processing clerk) I am one of the many people that sort your mail for the carriers to take out. On a daily basis, we sort through about 5,000 packages to be sent out that day. Theres an average of 6 clerks working those packages to go to about 40 routes. We get our 1st (of 4 truck loads) Truck at 4am. And per our new PMG Dejoy, we MUST be done sorting by 9am so that it can all go out. And the 5,000 doesn't include any of the thousands of letters, magazines, or media mailers that need to go out too. We don't get to take a break until all of it is sorted. So things that can muat a clerks life easier:\n\n1. Make sure you address is properly formatted the way it is on your street signage. THIS ALLOWS OUR PASS MACHINE TO READ IT AND GIVE US THE PROPER ROUTE.\n\n2. DON'T PUT TAPE OR MARKINGS OVER THE BARCODES\n\n3. When the window clerk asks you if there's any certain items in your package to be aware of (liquids, weapons, food), its not because we don't want to carry certain items, its for our safety! Things break open in the mail all the time. And sometimes things leak onto many other packages because of it. And we can't open your mail to see what's leaking so it all has to be processed through HAZMAT before we can sort it.\n\n4. Junk mail: you think its annoying when you get it. We think its annoying to sort it but we have to do SO much more of it than you could even imagine. So before you decide to stick something back in your mailbox to Return to sender, please take a look at the mail piece to see if its worth it. Usually in the top right corner, there's a small box with the mail classification in it. 99.999999% of junk mail is listed as Presorted Standard. IF it says that, and you say return to sender, its going to end up in our UBBM (which is fancy for recycling bin) and that has to be sorted piece by piece by a clerk to make sure nothing in it was incorrectly thrown. Its a long process. So if you must Return to Sender stuff, please make sure it says First Class or has something along the lines of ELECTRONIC SERVICE REQUESTED on it. \n\n4a. If you tell your carrier that you don't want certain kinds of mail pieces (such as ad mailers, phone books, political UBBM), or if you only want mail addressed to certain names put in your mailbox, most carriers can and will sort that stuff out before the even leave the PO to start their route. \n\n5. Foreign packaging SUCKS. Most of the time we have to manually look up what route its supposed to go to and is very time consuming, its slows us down while we're sorting. So if your mail is delayed, that's probably a big part of it.\n\n6. Since COVID, there has been a huge influx of online ordering. Certain days that used to be a one man sort day now take three people. We deliver Amazon packages on Sundays here and that used to be about 400 packages to sort. Now its 1200 to 1400. Thats a lot to do and it requires a totally different set up to sort those. \n\n6a. Due to the huge influx of online shopping, we are understaffed and underequipped to handle it. Many of us work an average of 56 hours a week over 6 days to get your mail to you as quickly as we can.\n\n7. In the past 2 weeks, we've had 2 carriers quit part way through their route because they couldn't handle it. Its not easy work. So if you've been lucky to have the same carrier(s) for a long time, you should know that they enjoy the work they do. \n\n8. In 2011, USPS started using Career / Non-Career designations for employees. Its very similar to how a professor can be tenured. Career workers have contracts, they get better pay, hours, and benefits, and Non-Career workers are meant to be like a temp but with a 360 day service. Its 360 days on contract, then 5 days off before a contract can be renewed. UsPS can decide not to renew your contract too. So you can't even guarantee you'll still have a job after a year. And the average time to transition from non career to career is 2 years. \n\nWe all have to work quickly and efficiently to get as much done as well as we do. UsPS has not taken a cent of tax payer money since the early 80s! So the whole defund USPS is a little wonky. Our PMG asked Trump for a loan to help manage the influx from COVID. To help us cover the cost get proper equipment and employees to handle the situation. \n\nI hope this helps!",

            "I have a good story. A USPS truck broke down right in front of my driveway. I couldn't pull in. So I just parked in the neighbors driveway.

I have managers and their managers breathing down my neck. I don\u2019t need a \u201cI don\u2019t want it if it\u2019s a bill\u201d joke from you. Just a \u201cThank you\u201d or \u201chave a good day.\u201d \n\nAlso don\u2019t move your damn box without at a minimum asking me. If your box is damaged or so small I have to fold shit replace it. If your box door is hard for you to open with 2 or 3 fingers replace it. Usually my hands are so full I have 1 or 2 fingers to lift the lid or open it and place the mail. \n\nGet rid of your damn mail slot! Nothing annoys me more than a mail slot. Nobody wants to steal your Subway fliers. It just makes our job unnecessarily harder.  A box at the bottom of stairs is a miracle. Or along the sidewalk. Imagine how many stairs I climb a day. If you save me 5 I\u2019ll love you forever. \n\nBy now you should have an idea roughly what time we come to your house. Turn your damn sprinklers off if they are on our walking path.

            "I work at one of the processing plants and what we need right now is for everyone to fully understand what's going on . The mail in ballots issue is only a small part of a much larger problem. The new post master Louis Dejoy is a Trump supporter, Trump hates the post office because of the deals we cut Amazon to deliver some of their packages because he also hates Amazon. Dejoy now wants to implement changes to the post office that will do nothing but further bury the post office and help sway the election.. From removing the classification of mail meaning now no mail has a delivery standard which will delay mail delivery. To cutting any and all overtime for all employees which means if your mail carrier has too much and can't finish their route on time then they just go back and leave the mail for the next day. Some mail won't even leave a processing facility because they won't send late trucks. All of this is being done because people like Trump want to post office to fail so they can privatize it and turn it into a business for money. The post office is not a business it is a service to the American people that doesn't turn profit it charges what it does to cover cost of operation and thats it. Thats the way its been for 200+ years and greedy men like Dejoy (Who has tons of money invested in the post offices competition) what to kill that. The post office is completely self funded. We do not receive government funding and havent since the 80s and are currently in a financial crisis.  90% of the money problems the post office has is because of a pre retirement funding bill that was put in place in 2006. This Bill causes the post office to pre fund all the retirement money for its employees 75 years in advance! 72 Billion dollars a year the post iffice has to pre pay for employees who aren't even born yet. We have been asking for years for congress to overturn this legislation but it falls on deaf ears. What we need is for the American people to understand that there are forces out there that are trying to kill 200 years of service and history so they can make money. What we need is people to spread this information and let their voices be heard. Currently there is a hash tag you can use on other social media platforms #SavetheUSPS that are being used to get the word out. Please show your support for the post office and help us get this Postmaster Dejoy out of power"

As the Information Age progresses, the quality of institutional education has dramatically reduced but the expenses of education has risen dramatically.

For that reason, the quality of education received is vastly poor since people will be enrolling regardless of any pressure to improve themselves.",

            "Not a doctor but worked in health care for nearly 20yrs. While taking a break from the ICU (due to it being emotionally draining)  I worked in home health for a bit. I had a patient who clearly had munchausen syndrome. On a daily basis she would call her insurance to see what things would be covered if she was diagnosed with this or that. She called her Doctor's office an average of 5x during my shift with her, she would report all kinds of non real symptoms. She pestered the doctors into do exploitive laparoscopic surgery, of course nothing was found. One day I walked in and she was rubbing her incisions with rotten cabbage *trying* to get it infected.  She wasnt seeking pain meds (except to sell) really she was just as happy with antibiotics or stool softeners, anything, as long as they wrote her a prescription and she got to go to the pharmacy where she did a whole song and dance for them too, claiming allergies and reactions. \n\nShe always increased the exaggeration of her story too. One time she fluttered her eyes (after making sure I was looking) and said she lost consciousness in that half a second. She called the doctor and claimed she lost consciousness for 5mins, she called the insurance and claimed it was 10min, she called the pharmacy and claimed it was 30min, then she called 911 and told them she woke up on the floor after loosing consciousness for 4hrs.\n\nThe worst thing about her was she was a mom. Her son was 28 at the time and by all the stories of his childhood illnesses and all her saying how he is severely disabled I knew she basically fucked up his childhood with munchausen by proxy. She portrayed him as being severely disabled and that's why he would never find a wife...I met him, he was healthy and of average intelligence. He wasnt looking for a wife, he was gay, but she refused to accept that.  \n\nWorking with her was so miserable that I took a couple years off from any and all healthcare after that.",

There were lots of times that you\u2019d go a full night without being woken up, or maybe just a call from the acute care inpatient wing. \n\nLocums were short term contracts for places that didn\u2019t have full time medical staff for whatever reason.

            "Pediatric neuropsychologist. Got a referral for more or less consolidation care. Patient was 13, wheelchair bound, required therapeutic oxygen, seizures, arthritis, musculoskeletal problems, suspected autism, completely nonverbal, severe behavior challenges, the list goes on. He was being followed by at least 8 different specialties, clearly none of whom were communicating with each other, and med list was ~18 prescriptions long including some incredibly heavy duty stuff (opioids, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, that sorta stuff).

She was convinced her son had all these disorders, told him he was going to die any day. He got a Make-A-Wish trip, donations, etc.\n\nHe was removed from her custody and taken off most of his meds. Within a few weeks he was out of the wheelchair playing basketball, no oxygen, super talkative and friendly, no behavior problems. He did have a pretty significant intellectual disability, but there's no way to say if that was organic or the result of the prescription cocktail he had been fed all his life. Hopefully with some good therapy and a stable home, he can continue to make progress.",

            "Not a doctor, but am a UK based midwife. \n\nHad a patient who had been in and out of hospital throughout her pregnancy with episodes of heavy bleeding. This was her 6th baby so she was a fairly well known patient in our unit. The issue was no one had ever seen her actively bleeding, she\u2019d call saying that she had bled down the toilet but flushed it, and all the examinations we did came back completely normal with mostly no evidence of any bleed whatsoever, on occasions during speculum examinations we\u2019d see the smallest amount of blood. \n\nI was caring for her during a shift where she yet again called to say she was bleeding, walked into her room and found her jabbing around her vagina with a sharp object to make herself bleed. She had been doing it the entire pregnancy, the reason she gave - because she had 5 noisy children at home, needed some rest and knew we wouldn\u2019t admit her to hospital if it wasn\u2019t for a good reason. She would do it any time her being discharged home was mentioned. We ended up having to complete a perinatal mental health referral and consult with the safeguarding midwives as she was putting herself and baby at risk of serious harm.\n\nEDIT: So this got a lot more attention than I ever expected. There\u2019s a lot of questions regarding birth control and questioning her parenting so thought it best to add an edit. This patient was not by any means a benefits seeker, they were a hard working and loving family that had full time jobs. She had been booked in to have her tubes tied but found out a week before the procedure that she was pregnant with this baby. She just couldn\u2019t cope during the pregnancy, and became very mentally unwell. She did not realise the implications or understand the face that she was causing massive harm to herself and her baby. She was referred to our perinatal mental health team and treated for psychosis. They also had a lot of input after she had her baby. She ended up having a c-section and was sterilised at the same time at her request. By all accounts she is doing very well now. \n\nAlso thank you very much for the slivers!",

Steve had to be in the medical field somehow. Probably a nurse or tech. He was fairly tall and skinny.

You can think of aortic dissections as the main pipe carrying blood starting to break. They're bad.\n\nSteve didn't only claim to have Marfan's, he stated that he had a dissection in the past and it was done by Dr BFD at BFD Medical Center (real surgeon and real institution, I'm removing the name). He then would come in with a classic story for dissection. He'd say he had a tearing chest pain radiating to the back.\n\nSteve took it to the next level. He'd flex his arm when the blood pressure cuff was on one arm, then relax on the other. This caused vastly different blood pressure readings in each arm, and this is another classically taught finding in dissection. In addition to this, the bastard would say that he had an anaphylactic reaction to contrast dye. He did this in an attempt to force us to pretreat him with benadryl and steroids, which took 8 hours. During those 8 hours, he'd request opiates after opiates before getting his CTA done. He also would get nauseated, requesting phenergan.\n\nFor those who don't know, IV dilaudid, phenergan, and benadryl is the best ride the hospital can really put you on. They all potentiate each other. Highly reviewed by opiate junkies everywhere.\n\nI got Steve on his third visit. The two prior visits showed no dissections. Steve was dumb enough to come in during normal business hours, and I managed to get ahold of this surgeon.  Surgeon said he'd never taken care of the guy, and that he'd gotten multiple calls about him.\n\nI still offered the CTA to the patient. I told him he'd be getting zero opiates though. He left in a fit.\n\nFuck steve. No one has seen him since. I'm sure he's at a some new hospital now.",

It seems her goal was mostly attention from medical professionals (she had lots of issues), but we also had to be careful to make sure she wasn't fishing for a lawsuit. Patients like her are why doctors document everything meticulously.\n\nSo the patient wouldn't admit to making things up all the time.

It has typical features and if these features are violated, you want to be careful that you aren't mis-attributing the behavior.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe most common incorrect diagnosis of \"faking it\" that I see as a hospitalist is psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. People will come in with debilitating loss of function that doesn't have the normal appearance of a seizure, will have a negative EEG, and will get told that they're faking it. In actuality, these folks have a poorly understood temporary loss of function that's every bit as real to them as epilepsy, it just isn't epileptic in origin. Establishing the diagnosis and having a conversation with the patient about the non-existent risk to them in these events is often curative by itself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou have to be really careful when deciding that someone is \"faking it.\" In my world, at least, it's often incorrect.",
            "When I was at boot camp in the military (I am in Europe) we were having a one week survival drill outdoors in the winter time (this was in the Arctic so you knew it was going to suck). A buddy and me decided to report in sick with fever and went to the infirmary. Young civilian nurses did the triaging, one by one we were sent to a room with an old school thermometer covered in plastic and lube and asked to insert it in the backside. She left the room giving us a few minutes to insert it ourselves. That gave us a minute to take the thermometer out of the plastic sleve, warm it on a light bulb and then desperately shaking it when it spiked beyond human temperature, getting it down to a reasonable fever temperature and put the sleeve back on before the nurse returned and we had proof we had a fever. We both did it and it worked!\n\nWe had a a few great days in the sick bay getting pampered by nurses, joking around  and flirting with the nurses as awkward as 18 year olds does. Every morning the doctor made his rounds, so we repeated the thermometer routine and blew hot air into the pillow to warm up our forheads so they were warm and \"sweaty - until thursday morning. The nurse came in, gave us the thermometer as usual and said the doctor would be visit in a few minutes.  On her way out the door, she smiled and added \"And by the way guys, if you still have a fever, you will not be released until monday, because the doctor has the day off on Friday and there are no doctors here on weekends\". We were miraculously fever free and healthy again and were dismissed that morning in time for the weekend leave. \n\nThinking back on this, we were young and just wanted a few days away from the monotonous training and cold. And I still sometimes send a warm thought to that nurse who obviously knew we were faking it, but played along.",

One of my friends (25M) used to come over to my place to study. I was a naughty kid growing up, and one Saturday night he came over, and we drunk a whole bottle of Bombay Sapphire...we were 14. On the Sunday his mum came over to pick him up for the morning church service. On Monday he didn't show up to school, three days went by...a week...two weeks. After two weeks of his absence I called him and he told me the funniest story.\nWhen he went to church the day he left, he said he had to throw up so he ran out of the church to a tree and threw up, his mum saw and threw him in the car and took him to the hospital. Sidebar: His family was the type to disown a family member for having sex before marriage. Back to the story, he gets to the hospital and throws a fit because he doesn't want his blood tested. The doctor just diagnoses him based off of his symptoms, and says he has the flu. Gets sent home and is feeling ill for a week straight, after that his parents are convinced he doesn't have the flu, but he instead has dengue fever which was going around the island at the time. He refused treatment and stayed home pretending to be sick the entire time. After two weeks he was able to return to school.\n\nIt's been 11 years and we still talk, his family still thinks he had dengue fever to this day, when in reality he was hungover and probably got alcohol poisoning from our Saturday night bender, he still won't tell his mum \ud83d\ude02",

The by proxy was a mom who brought her toddlers (two of them) in stating they were vomiting blood. They were transferred to a pediatric ward even though they seemed fine. That mother was known to us as being psychiatrically unstable. I list this as a worst because those poor kids barely have a chance at a normal life.\nThe other was a Munchausen who was exposed after numerous episodes of septic shock requiring pressors. She was missing digits because of prior Levophed infusion (I am being intentionally vague re which limb etc because HIPAA * edit, originally misspelled HIPPA). We unmasked her true disease when, for the 5th time in 3 months she suddenly became severely hypotensive (like 50 to 60 systolic, lethargic then unresponsive) about an hour into her ER evaluation. Something was fishy, since intake vitals and exam were not too bad. Started a Narcan drip and, boom, bp normalizes. Even though drug screen was normal, we figured she was dosing herself with Fentanyl (street) after intake in the ER. From that point she tried this trick several times, each time fixed with a Narcan drip. Called surrounding hospitals, all of which had treated her recently, to let them know.",

Too many teen girls buy them and can't afford the allergy meds and food and just leave them to suffer.\n\nOne visited the clinic last week, collapsed and died because of 'an extra long walk in the sunshines.\n\nDon't do it. Let this breed disappear and buy a dog with a nose, please.\n\nEdit: read about their problems before buying one (don't buy one) get awesome pet insurance and treat every problem seriously and immediately.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachycephalic_airway_obstructive_syndrome\n\nEdit: Thank you kindly for the awards dear people! Appreciated but while imaginary internet points are lovely, a bit part of this is education. I want to look down the lens of the computer screen and talk to you. \n\nYes, you. The person feeling lonely I quarantine browsing Craigslist and Kijiji and Gumtree at puppies. Damn, those frenchies and pugs are cute right? You can't help what you  like. I think fat cats are cute. Very wrong as someone who works in vet! But I don't encourage it, I educate people on he health benefits of a slender kitty and my own cats are on strict diets.\n\nDon't feel bad for looking at pictures of playful pugs and persians but I ask you to consider carefully when you reach out with your wallet.\n\n1) There are many brachycephalic breeds but I called out frenchies because right now they're the fad breed. One appeared in Modern Family and suddenly every one wanted one.  Just like Beverley Hills Chihuahua, in the three years there will be a glut of these in rescue groups and no one will want them because they're sick and expensive and OMG that kids cartoon has a Yorkie in it I really want one mommy!   \n\n\n2) Because they're an 'it' breed right now and because everyone in quarantine thinks now is the perfect time for a puppy the unethical backyard breeders are churning them out on a factory line. I've participated in twenty cesareans this year and all of them is either a Frenchie or a bully breed (another fad breed we have concerns about). Two mother's died on the table and another at home from dystocia bred by randoms who delayed too long before coming in and were trying to make a quick buck. The other c-sections were harrowing close shaves that I dread.\n\nAll the ethical breeders out there have their litters booked until September. They're also setting their prices high because they want those desperate for a particular breed to see rescue groups as a viable option. So chances are that if you're buying now you're buying from a quick buck breeder.\n\nAnd those dodgy breeders are looking really good right now. The good, ethical breeders are $4000 and not available until next year. And rescues... I know. They do many marvellous things but they are strict! I've known them to turn down wonderful owners for miniscule things. You can jump through all the hoops and still be turned down. Craigslist breeders don't ask questions and you get to cuddle your puppy!  But these guys suuuuck. Don't put money in their pockets.  \n\n3) People are telling me their Frenchie's and pugs are healthy. I'm happy for you. But they're the lucky ones. For every healthy one born you're condemning 4/5 to a life of scratching and wheezing.   \n\nAnd they still have breathing problems. When you buy into the breed you're saying 'Yes, that cute face is more important than their comfort.'  \n\nWhat if your mother had a choice between breathing properly and blue eyes, and she picked blue eyes. I liken it to when you have a cold and both nostrils are clogged. Yes you can enjoy life, smile and laugh and enjoy food with your friends and play tennis... But it sucks. Aren't you relieved when that cold is gone? Imagine living your life like that. You have that choice when you pick your puppy.\n\n4) The fact is you won't love your puppy because they're a pug or a Frenchie. You'll love them because they're yours! They're your sweet comfort after a long day. When you have the choice between supporting a non-brachycephalic breed with a nose and a history of unethical breeding practices, would it really change your love for your pet?\n\n5) if you have your heart set on a pug or Frenchie type dog  look into crossbreeds like puggles (beagle or jack russel cross) or Boodles (Poodle.) They're cute and they have a nose. They can breathe.\n\nAt the end of the day, I just want dogs to breathe.\n\nAlso Ragdollharleyjane has a wonderful post for those who are in the 'You're wrong!!!\" Side, spoken with far more thoughtfulness than I. https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gp6zld/what_golden_nugget_of_information_do_you_have_to/frmbjht?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share",

The persian general, king xerxes, was sent a message from one of the greek generals claiming that he had defected and that the entire athenian population would be evacuating the next morning and that this would be a perfect opportunity to destroy the greek fleet as the ships would be full of civilians. Xerxes trusted this information and sent his much larger fleet into the territory only to find the full brunt of the grecian military in perfect position to destroy the entire persian fleet. Xerxes was forced to flee back to persia and they never attempted an invasion again (well except that one time).

She doesn't care about rules or boundaries so why should I?  And I did something terrible.  I flirted back at him.  \n\nThings started to escalate.  He would ask for nude pictures, he sent me graphic videos.  Then he started planning for us to meet and have sex, always in public places.

No matter what our friendship was like, I should have told the truth and gotten her help even if it got her in trouble.  It took me a long time to realize we were both being preyed upon and I'm not sure if my friend ever saw it that way.",
            "It honestly never clicked for me until I was MUCH older myself. I just thought I was super mature and that\u2019s why it wasn\u2019t weird that I was 14 with a 19 year old boyfriend. It was a super toxic relationship, he cheated on me, stole from me, lied to me and lied about me so much. He pretty much only came around when he wanted sex and would tell me whatever he thought I needed to hear to keep stringing me along. In my na\u00efvet\u00e9, I thought this was just how \u201cgrownup\u201d relationships were.  So I stayed, until I finally got fed up at 18 years old! Isn\u2019t it funny that when I was finally old enough to date him, I no longer wanted to??? \n\nI thought I was cooler than the other girls in my grade because my boyfriend was a man. Looking back, I\u2019m sure I was an easy lay as I didn\u2019t require much from him in return like people his own age might\u2019ve. And as I got older, I wondered if he ever felt odd having sex with someone who was so clearly a child. I also wondered how none of his friends (they all knew my real age) thought it was weird or called him out on it. I think that\u2019s the \u201csystem\u201d they speak of when they say this kind of behavior takes a village of people who were not willing to protect the child. The irony of it all is that Karma has blessed him with three daughters and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s had the scary thought, more than once, that another \u201chim\u201d will come along and treat his girls the way he treated me!\n\n\nEdit: To everyone saying 5 years isn\u2019t a big age difference, five years didn\u2019t matter when I was 18 and he was 23, but I was 14 when started dating, and when we starting having sex. I was a freshman in high school and he was a sophomore in college. He could buy cigarettes and vote and go to nightclubs or join the Army, I was riding my bicycle to friends\u2019 houses because I wasn\u2019t even old enough for a learner\u2019s permit.\n\nTo the people saying they have friends who are 19 and they are 14 or the like, I can\u2019t speak on your friendships but I can tell you, he and I weren\u2019t friends, we were having a sexual relationship which in all 50 states falls under the criminal code for statutory rape.\n\nTHANK YOU for the award, kind stranger!",
            "I was 16, a school teacher of 30 years used to touch me and text me stuff. I didn't really realize it was bad untill some years later when he married a girl form my class. I didn't tell anyone because I was scared that people would think that it was my fault.",
            "I was 17 and having a \"relationship\" with my 45 year old teacher (whilst I was in school). My Dad was dying of terminal cancer and I needed someone to lean on. The police found out, but I didn't want to disclose any details - watching my Dad die was enough trauma, let alone having a full on police investigation. He is no longer allowed to teach, but never was prosecuted. I tried to go for counselling, but they said they would have to inform the police of whatever I said.. So I've been trying to deal with it by myself. He hit me and sent me death threats and I never reported him.",
            "So, I posted this in a thread called \"Redditors that have called off their wedding, why?\"\n\nI called off my wedding 3 months before it happened. Why? I was a 17 year old (I'd have been 18 at the time of the wedding) about to marry a 26 year old man that had been dating me for 3 years. I was a victim about to marry her abuser.\n\nThe engagement ring, which I did eventually find out was fake (he has money. Lots of it, but that didn't matter to me) was to buy my consent/silence/whatever as he stuck his dick in everything that moved. He was an alcoholic, a narcissist, a pedophile (seriously, I wasn't a 14 year old that looked like an 18 year old. I was a 14 year old that looked like a 12 year old.)\n\nI loved him because I thought he was saving me from my horrid situation with my family. My mom and I moved in with her boyfriend, only to find out too late that he was an abuser. He'd take me away from it, even if it was just for a little while.\n\nI was so messed up. I ended up living in a boarding house when things finally broke in my abusive household because, of course, I was 17 and he didn't want me to move in until I turned 18 (his career depended on a squeaky clean image.) I ended up pregnant, having a violent end to my pregnancy that resulted in my daughter's stillbirth.\n\nDespite this all, I loved him. But he started picking at my appearance. I was \"gaining too much weight\" even though I was at a healthy weight for my age/height. I had gotten hips and breasts... so we talked about dieting. I stopped eating. I drank water when I'd get hungry. Everything had to be low fat/no fat, low calorie/no calorie, and sugar free. It worked. I went from \"healthy\" to \"underweight.\" What made me realize that I wanted out was a box of chicken wings.\n\nI ended up moving back in with my mother after she was able to escape her ex. We lived near an indoor flea market/farmer's market that had the most amazing food vendors. I love food, and this diet was killing me. I was fucking miserable. So, I decided to have a cheat day, and I went and ordered a box of hot wings from the chicken place in the farmer's market. As I sat down with my favorite movie, eating my favorite food, I realized that the extreme dieting would always be my life. I also realized that he wanting me to be so unhealthy wasn't right. I was tired all the time, cold all the time, hungry all the time. I decided, while happily munching on that box of wings, I was done.\n\nI called him, told him that I was done. It took me another 3 years to truly be done, but the very expensive wedding was done and over. He never got any deposits back. It took me almost a decade to realize that he wanted me to look like a 14 year old forever. I was also always dismissive about the age difference, citing that I was mature for my age. I now realize it didn't matter. I was a child.",
            "not a woman but when i was under 18 (i think i was 16) i joined a guild on wow and the guild leader groomed and pressured me into sending him nudes and being naked on webcam. when his gf found out she told the entire guild that i was a home wrecker. i really thought the guy cared about me, but he joined in and said i was desperate and it was sad that i was so into him. he blocked me and ruined my reputation on that server. He was in the army and i think 28. pretty sure those pictures got passed around and it is absolutely vile that these 30+ grown adult men were distributing child porn of me and laughing about it. \ni blamed myself for the longest time but telling my story to horrified faces kinda made me realise how fucked up it was.",
            "Ooh this question was made for me lol. I had this internet boyfriend (when dating/talking to people online was still taboo) for going on two years I believe. He lived in British Columbia and was I believe 31 at the time, while I was in California and I think 13 when I first started taking to him. I was going through a bunch of crappy things during that time at home, dealing with constant fighting/domestic violence amongst my parents who tried getting back together, dealing with self-esteem issues and self-harm, contemplating suicide or running away. He was of course there for me to talk and listen and always offered a place at his home if I ever decided to run away. Even offered to buy any plane tickets for me if I just said the word whenever I was ready. He would always talk about the life we could have if I did run away and such.\n\nI thankfully never did run away, but the summer I was entering into high school the stars all seemed to align for me to finally meet him. I had always gone to summer camp with the YMCA in elementary and middle school, but high school aged kids had a two week caravan instead. That year it just so happened that the caravan was planning on driving from Los Angeles to Vancouver, BC and all the way back. I immediately told my mom I wanted to go and we got my spot reserved.\n\nHe was definitely excited about finally meeting and the plan was to hopefully have me sneak out of the campsite and spend time back at his place before bringing me back. We also discussed sex and I agreed to lose my virginity to him when we met. I was worried about him getting in trouble, but it just so happened that the age of consent at the time in Canada was 14, so he assured me he would be fine. \n\nThe night came and I snuck out of my tent to meet him and I forgot the reason why, but he didn\u2019t have his car for some reason, so the choice was to take a taxi back to his place or stay at the campsite. I was worried about getting caught offsite so I figured we could just hang out somewhere away from everyone. We found a picnic bench and I thought we could sit and talk for a bit, but he was just trying to get right to work. He was suggesting to have me lose my virginity on top of this picnic bench out in the open, and there was some random person\u2019s tent maybe 20 or so feet away. All they had to do was open their tent and they would be facing us and see everything. He was adamant about us doing it there because there was no other option and my dumb self gave in to the pressure. So I lost my virginity at 14, in another country, outside on a picnic bench to this loser of a 32 year old. It was pretty terrible since it hurt, wasn\u2019t the most pleasant environment, and he lasted maybe a minute. I had instant regret, but at least no one came out of that tent or walked by while it happened.\n\nEdit: Wow! Thank you for the golds you awesome humans! My first award too! And thank you to everyone who has left such kind and insightful comments. I really didn\u2019t expect this story to be seen, let alone touch so many of you. You guys are amazing \ud83d\udc9c\n\nEdit 2: Wow guys, thank you for the additional awards. For some reason I\u2019ve found myself emotional with a leaking face. While it could be due to all the ridiculousness that 2020 has thrust upon us so far, I think it\u2019s more so this unexpected outpouring of support and maybe me coming to some hard realizations. Just know, I\u2019m genuinely touched and thank you all.",
            "I was 16 \"dating\" my 23 year old supervisor from work at a fast food restaurant. It started like the normal story, I thought I was mature, he made me feel special, etc and it was fine for a few months. He seemed sensitive, he had been engaged and had his heart broken before and did seem genuinely pretty sweet. We would stay after work talking and I'd try to sneak over to his apartment when I could.\n\nAfter maybe 6 months of dating, the owners of the restaurant found out and fired him. They didn't fire him for that, but found another excuse to get rid of him pretty quickly. After that, he couldn't find another job and I felt responsible. I gave him a couple hundred dollars a few times to help him make his rent but after another few months, he had to move in with his dad.\n\nAt this point, I started college (I went early) and he was living about an hour away from me. My parents didn't want me to see him when I still lived at home, so we spent a little more time together once I was at school. He still wasn't working and was pretty unhappy overall. He always talked about how much he loved me and wanted to get married, but I knew all along I didn't want to, I just felt so guilty leaving him.\n\nAfter we'd been dating for over a year, he moved several states away to live with his brother and try to get his life together. He got him a job and everything was going pretty well, we were doing long distance, and he kept trying to convince me to transfer schools out there. After a month or two of him being gone, I finally got the courage to break up with him. He became very depressed and even suicidal. He came back to visit and I saw him twice, both times, I had to stop him from doing something harmful to himself. I always reached out to his family or friends to make sure they knew what was going on, but eventually I cut off all contact.\n\nI looked him up a few years ago - he's married, has two kids, and is apparently a pastor or youth pastor.\n\nEDIT: For those asking, I did report it anonymously to the church.",
            "Well we didn\u2019t really date. I was 8, in Mexico with family. Not the fancy resort Mexico. The run down, cobble stone street, horses are the main transportation, type of town. I was looking for my sister who had gone to a corner store with a cousin. There were multiple so I was screwed. See, she was the type to go to at least three and then at the final one, pick her items and go back home. I took off. I went to the farthest one and would just loop back, no biggie. I was walking on the street, and a car pulls up from behind me. He stops and rolls down his window and asks me to come to the car. I do and he asks where the nearest school is. I tell him it\u2019s down this street we\u2019re on and then a right about 5 blocks down. Keep going straight. You\u2019ll see it. He said thank you. I said of course and went to walk away but he said wait and opened his door. He told me to come around, because he essentially had me pinned to a small chain link fence. I got around the door (as if I were to get in) and he had his pants and underwear down, length in hand. He asked if I had ever seen one. I shook my head, not knowing what to say. He told me to hold it like he did. I was too scared to say no so I did. He then showed me how to move my hand and let me do it. He eventually released and he cleaned my hand off. He said I should get in, he\u2019d give me a ride to the store. A guy on a bicycle came and started yelling at the guy in the truck. He was saying not to touch his sister ever again or he\u2019d cut his hand off and he walked me down the street and around the corner and sat with me while I broke down. He said he was sorry and didn\u2019t know what else to do. He saw it happen from up the street and rode his bike as fast he could. Eventually I gathered my composure, gave him some money for a beer, and ran home. I think about it now. I could\u2019ve been taken and never heard from or seen again. I thank that guy every day. I have never told anyone this but wanted it off my chest.",
            "My cousin in GA got with a guy when she was around 13 and he was around 26. She had 3 kids with him. He slept around with anyone who was willing including his 1st cousin, her mom (my aunt) and her sister. He took advantage of her and fucked her self esteem so much that she always takes him back. Her 3 kids now all have kids too. She is raising most of her grandkids. I feel sorry for all of them. Some parts of Georgia are like a 3rd world country.",
            "I was 14, he was 21. He knew me long before we \u201cdated\u201d though. Since I was 12 he spent lots of time making me feel older than I was and listening to my problems and comforting me. He constantly joked about dating me or my friends and we always laughed about how he would end up in jail one day. I thought it was a joke. At least until I became really sad, and I sought out some comfort from him. He took advantage of that and it escalated really quickly. He guilted me into sending him pictures every day while we \u201cdated\u201d and it wasn\u2019t until it was too late that I realized what was happening. I recently got back chat logs from that conversation *edit: (conversations I had with him)* and I had to stop reading it because now that I\u2019m older I can see every fucking tactic he used to manipulate me for all those years. It hurts. I didn\u2019t even start to think about it as grooming until I heard he \u201cdated\u201d another friend of mine, and even though I felt protective of her it was only a year later that I thought of him as a predator and realized that we were not the only ones, and that there were even younger girls.\n\nEdit 2: Although reporting him is the right thing to do, I am not in a mental place to do so. Those of you determined for it to happen are good people, and I appreciate you, but I won\u2019t be focusing on him for a long while. I\u2019m sorry that I couldn\u2019t protect my friends or his future victims, but I will not be putting myself through that process at this time. Thank you for your support regardless.",
            "I was 13 and my parents had a friend who was 24 that started hanging around the house a lot. I developed a big crush on him and ended up losing my virginity to him. I thought we were in love and going to get married. My parents found out and I never saw him again. Didn't realize how creepy it was until I had my own kids.",
            "I did this a lot as a child/teenager. Though all but one relationship stayed online, they were all still very sexual in nature. \n\nI never really realized they were predators and the ones at fault due to how my mom handled me being groomed and abused by a 40 year old man in the 5th grade. I got hardcore grounded and told not to talk to him, he got off with no punishment whatsoever. So I kept sneaking back to him. He made me feel important and special and mature.\n\nAnd then there were the guys I dated. A lot of guys in their 20s when I was 15 or younger. I was just a source of nudes and sexting for them. But it still made me feel needed. Then I started dating a 40 year old man when I was 16. That's the one who broke the online barrier. He took my virginity. He ended up killing himself when he was caught molesting a 10 year old. I still couldn't bring myself to understand he was a predator; I had been hella groomed.\n\nIt took a lot of therapy and medication to realize these people were the ones at fault. They were predators. I was a kid.",
            "I was 15 and he was 28. I would skip school to go to his flat and watch him smoke weed and have sex. At the time I thought he was really cool, even though he had no job and sat around doing drugs all day and he had been in prison before.\nThere were older guys there sometimes too, one evening called my mum pretending to my a friends dad and getting permission for me to go on a fake sleepover. \nHe got back with his girlfriend who was a couple of years older than him and had a daughter, he didnt tell me and I turned up there with a friend and there were a bunch of people there drinking. I had to pretend I hadn't been sleeping with him so she didnt beat the crap out of me. She went to the shops and the older men were telling me to suck his dick before she came back. I left and never came back. \nHe broke up with her after a while and got together with a girl 3 years younger than me, so I believe by this time he was 29 and she was 13. \nI was completely delusional about the entire thing. \nNow I'm 28 and I couldn't possibly imagine being attracted to a 15 year old. He was clearly a paedophile and I was gullible enough to be groomed. \n\nI also had an experience with someone that I found out after was known for being a paedo. He was about 24 when I was 15. I also slept with a man in his 30s when I was 16. After we had sex, he asked me to remind him what my name was. That was a crucial moment in me realising I had to have more self respect and this wasnt cool. \n\nI consented to these at the time, but as a minor I wasnt old enough to consent and it really messed up my ability to trust men. My dad wasnt around much when I was a child, which was not his fault but I guess that has always made me search for a father figure in a partner. Now I am in a long term relationship which a guy 4 years older than me who I've known for 12 years and is a great, regular guy with a steady job and is the least likely person in the world to ever assault me.",
            "Is it ok if I comment? I\u2019m a man but I had an older boyfriend as a teen and didn\u2019t realise till later on he was a predator.\n\nEdit for event\n\nSo this was around the same time a sexual assault and rape had occurred and it put me in a vulnerable place where I leaned to someone for comfort. \u201cIf this person loves me it means I\u2019m not dirty\u201d I guess he figured out I was in a vulnerable spot. \n\nI was part of a few local clubs and there was this person who showed up to one of them that everyone befriended. He claimed to be seventeen years old and for some reason I was too dumb to realise he didn\u2019t change his age throughout the years I knew him. \n\nNow during the time I felt vulnerable I started talking to him more often. I was doing some work for him whenever I had time and what not. I somehow ignored the first red flag of his toxicity after he told me I was getting fat. He dated a female friend of ours previously and it ended badly with details I can\u2019t really remember but he tried guilt tripping her with cancer related fears. \n\nI spent the day with him one day and I ended up walking to his house. He mentioned he moved house with his mother before because a 16 girl offered to \u201ctake his v card\u201d then spread a rumour that he attempted to rape her. At the time I thought she was a bitch but now it seems possible he attempted something. \n\nHe was complimenting and putting on my favourite movies and genres and telling me his mother wouldn\u2019t hear us. I accepted and just let him touch me. He even encouraged me to perform sex acts on him. I was pretty much thinking \u201che cares about me so it\u2019s ok\u201d throughout the thing. \n\nAfter a few weeks and a disaster of a date I was seeing red. I broke off our relationship or whatever it was to him and he got pissed then paranoid then guilt trippy. He even asked something that terrified me which was \u201cdid you find out about the camera?\u201d \n\nHe claimed it was on charge but somehow turned on and started recording me when I was taking off my clothes for him. I called it bullshit and demanded he show me that there was no footage of me anywhere. After that I blocked him however he still continued to come after me. \n\nAn account added me which was posing as a Japanese student. Hentai DVDs were sent to me as \u201cfinal birthday presents\u201d and I got suspicious when the Japanese student had an exchange with a \u201ccute guy\u201d. I immediately traced the photo of this student and it came back with a decent search. I scrolled a bit to find it came from a Korean teenager\u2019s blog that had been abandoned months before. \n\nI contacted the fake account and immediately told him I knew it was him and I knew what he was doing. He deactivated it. I sent the screenshots to my friends and two reported that he told them he\u2019s a \u201cbit of a pedophile\u201d and someone in his mid twenties told me that the guy refused to date anyone his own age and had claimed he wants to \u201cdate all the school children he wants\u201d. \n\nAfter that he seemed to just disappear from both social media and in real life. I didn\u2019t see him or hear from him again and no one was speaking about him or seemed to know anything else about him. I figured he might\u2019ve found out we were all talking about him and he high tailed it before we got any ideas. \n\nDidn\u2019t realise till 19 how fucked up he and other people were towards me during my teen years. He was the only one out of a few predators I actually cared for and looked to for comfort so it kinda hurt in a different way.",
            "As a father, the comments scare the shit out of me.",
            "I dated an older woman when I was a teen. She was in her mid 20's, I was still a minor. When we broke up, she told me she'd been stopping her friends from coming after me, but now she wasn't going to stop them anymore. She proceeded to make my life hell, and even faked her own death to make me look bad. She stalked me online for a while after that. I don't know if she still is, but I can't deny the possibility. I don't feel safe. Don't know if I ever will.",
            "All I can say is that I am floored by how many horrible tales of abuse are in this thread, all the same story each time.",
            "I know this will get buried but I'd like to tell my story anyway.\n\nI was 18 and started dating my 34 year old coworker, Tom. I don't know why I even liked him, but for some reason I was drawn to him. He was charming, good looking, always willing to help people, talented, smart. When I was first getting to know him he acted perfect in every way, no matter how hard I tried I could never find any flaws in him.\n\nI had a rough upbringing with an absent biological father and a mom and step father who treated me like garbage most days. Tom always knew how to help me forget about my shitty home life and make me feel like a million bucks- he would buy me gifts, tell me how special I was, take me out to nice dinners. To a naive 18 year old, he was just a sweet guy with good intentions. Fast forward a few months and I realised how wrong I was.\n\nTom and I had begun to secretly date behind my parents back because I knew they wouldn't approve. After about a month of being together they discovered our relationship and kicked me out, forbidding me to see him. Well lo and behold, I ended up moving into Toms place because I had nowhere else to go. \n\nThe second we lived together and he knew I didn't have a way out, that's when he started abusing me. It was never physical abuse, was always verbal and emotional. Honestly, I think I would've preferred physical abuse. It would have hurt less. \n\nThe abuse ranged from belittling me and telling me I was worthless to killing my dog infront of me simply because he felt like it. He would tell me I was useless, lazy, and stupid. Would tell me that the reason my biological dad abandoned me was because I was an incompetent piece of shit who will never amount to anything. He would tell me my family didn't love me and that I should just kill myself because no one actually gave a shit about me anyway. Sometimes when he was in a particularly bad mood he would take my sentimental belongings and break them infront of me and then laugh at me when I cried.\n\nI put up with this shit for 2 whole years, and the entire 2 years I wished I was dead. I had no friends, no family I could fall back on. He had completely beaten me into the ground to the point where I believed everything he said. Eventually I gathered the courage to leave, but it took a lot and took WAY too long. \n\nI'm 25 now and engaged to a wonderful man who treats me the way I know I deserve. I still have residual issues from Tom that I am trying to work through- I have good days and bad days. To any young girls reading this, please remember that you are worth so much more than you think. Don't date any guy who gives you the time of day, ESPECIALLY if he's significantly older than you. Chances are, he's an abuser who is looking for an easy victim. Stay strong and stay smart, don't be like me.",
            "My best friend in high school dated a teacher and the school found out somehow. I don't know if she is thinks of it like this though. I for sure do.",
            "I was 16 with a 21 year old \"boyfriend\", he was actually a long time family friend who went to high school with my cousin of the same age and knew that whole part of my family. My cousin introduced me to him when I was spending the day with him(cousin). The three of us hung out all day, I have no real memory of how we stayed in contact. It was either thru Myspace or we exchanged phone numbers.\n\nEither way we started \"dating\" and at least outwardly my whole family approved of it. No one ever took me aside and was like \"this isn't okay\" no one told him to get lost. My mother was a raging alcoholic and also doing coke at the time and I feel like I was only \"dating\" him to get easy access to my own alcohol and occasionally other drugs.\n\nIt didn't seem weird to me when he wouldn't tell his family my real age, he told them I was 18. I believe that all of his friends knew, we hung out frequently with them and none of them said anything to me either. I don't honestly know if anyone else thought this was weird for the nearly two years I was \"dating\" this man.\n\nClose to the end of our relationship I was becoming more and more depressed and liking him less and less. He was becoming more and more abusive. He began putting me down a lot when no one else was around, insulting my intelligence even though he was the one dating me, then when I'd lash out around other people he'd make it so he was the \"calm\" one. Eventually one day he got angry that I had worn a mini skirt over top my swim suit around my very gay friends, and his response to this was to choke me against the arm of my couch.\n\nI didn't leave him then, it took him raping me while I was unconscious from my medication a month later for me to be willing to leave him. I tried to call someone I believed could help me but they didn't answer (for other insane reasons) so I attempted to tell my cousin (this guys friend) he'd been abusing me and he refused to believe me. So at that point I just kept it to myself. Very few people in my life know what happened in the end and even now at 30 no one has gone \"yea it was weird when that grown man was dating you.\"\n\nI try to message girls I see posting on reddit privately and tell them it's not normal and they should find someone they trust to get help to get out of the \"relationship\" they're in. I don't know if any of them have taken my advice but I hope so.",
            "First one, I was 13/14 he was 18. I was the freshman he was the senior. I had incredibly low self esteem and he made it easy to pretend I didn't. I managed to befriend the seniors and all that. Obiously I had never been sexual with anything, he pressured me slowly but firmly, sexting, to pictures, phone sex, cam sex, then essentially everything physical but penetration and finally convinced me to have sex with him, but once he took my virginity he was out. \n\nSecond one, I was 16 he was 22. He swooped in after the last one. I lived in a small town I thought he was so cool. He'd bring me lunch at school I'd hang out at the University with him. Again with the self esteem issues I thought it was sooooo hard to believe anyone would be interested in me at all much less a college guy. Made me feel seen in a place I didn't feel heard. \n\nThird and last one, in my opinion the worst one. He attempted to date me when I was 16 and he was 26. I said no, he wouldn't let up for a few months. He tried again at 17 he was 27 and at 19, he was 29 this was when I finally relented. And for the first time could truly see the huge mistake I had made. He was the controlling type, I couldn't see my friends more than him. I was 19! I wanted to be out. He'd anger if I said I'd be going home to have dinner with my family (I was home from college and at my parents) instead of eating with him  He was the type to apologize with expensive gifts often. He'd come check up on me in college, stay in my dorm. I have no idea how my roommate was okay with this. \n\nI woke up when he was getting into the throwing stuff and punching the wall phase in his anger towards me. That fight was because he wanted kids so badly and I had made it clear I at least wanted to finish school first. My stupid ass wasn't on BC and he was actively trying to get me pregnant. When I found out about the broken condoms I lost it and he thought punching the walls near me was the answer to change my mind. \n\nI was so scared of what he'd do if I broke up with him that I took a few weeks of manipulating fights and situations so in the end he'd be the one breaking up with me. I was so incredibly grateful I was actually able to get out without the situation being worse. \n\nUnfortunately, these situations have me very hesitant to attempt a real relationship. And at 25 I've only been in one long term relationship. I have a very unhealthy view on relationships. Working on it, but it's more difficult than I expected.\n\nEdit; Details and a word\n\nEdit numero dos; I didn't expect to have my most upvoted comment be on a topic like this. But also my first award! So thank you. \n\nI wish there weren't this many responses on a thread like this one. It's much too common of an occurrence. I hope everyone is doing better now after experiences like these.",

            "I was 16 and desperate for affection after being the unpopular, weird kid throughout school, and being diagnosed with depression at 14. Between 14-16, I had a few online relationships with men in their mid-20s, who would send me letters to my home address from overseas, and occasionally sex toys. I felt very mature and wanted.\n\nI was 16 when I went to an interstate meet-up from an online group I was involved in. I spent the day flirting heavily with a guy who was about 24. He knew my age, I was convinced age was 'just a number'. He came back to the house I was staying at, but took fancy to the girl who lived there with her ex. They were all a similar age. He bedded down in the loungeroom with me, and I thought I might have sex with him - that was what I wanted at the time - but she came into the bed and they started getting into it beside me. Then her ex came home. I'd never met him and did not find him attractive. He said \"oh, cool! Cuddle pile!\" and jumped in bed with us. I let him have sex with me because I was so upset that the guy I liked was pretty much ignoring me. The next morning, the ex declared we were dating, and I accepted that. I also accepted when he decided that we 'mutually' wanted to break up. I just wanted to be wanted.\n\nAnother friend from the group, who was 30, the next year flew me over to his state for a dirty weekend, which I thoroughly enjoyed at the time, but looking back, I shudder and feel bad about all my past experiences.\nMy parents were unhappy about my 'relationships' with these older men, but I was determined that I knew better. Looking back, I wish I'd listened. And I hope my 12yo daughter will listen to me when I try to keep her safe, but I fear it will be as futile as when my parents tried to keep me safe.",
            "I had actually turned 20 a few days before, so technically not a teenager, but I married him when I was 22 and he was 38 despite every red flag and every person who begged me not to, because I was a stupid kid and thought I knew everything. I\u2019ve been trapped in an abusive marriage ever since, and I\u2019m 39 now. Thing is, I didn\u2019t realize it was abusive until about 5 years ago and now I\u2019m well and truly trapped. \n\nPlease, young women who date older dudes \u2014 listen to people\u2019s concerns.

            "When I was 12 I would go into yahoo chat room and wait for older men to talk to me. After I flirted with them for a while I would get their number and then incessantly call them and leave answering machine about them being pedophiles so their family could hear. I aged myself a little here with the yahoo chat and answering machines.",
            "When I was 17 I was befriended by a guy almost 17 years older than me. We were friends for 2 years and he pursued me relentlessly. I never fancied him but we did become really close and I cared a lot about him. I had a really hard time when I was younger and tried to commit suicide at 17 so when he promised me unconditional love (which I had never had), and showed me all this attention, he eventually wore me down. He made a move when I was 19 and I didn't say no. We were together for 2.5 years. \n\nI can't say he was a predator exactly but when I reached my late 30s the thought of being with a teenager actually made me want to vomit. A change of perspective was a real eye opener as I had always explained that I was more mature than he was so the age gap didn't seem that big. But when you're 17 your opinion of time is so different to 20 years later.",

            "Ooooh boy. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was 14 and he was 23 years old. We met through friends (he hung out with high schoolers, of course) and started dating. He would take me out to bars (girls can definitely look older with make-up done but there was a lot of people looking the other way) and out to parties and back to his apartment - where we had plenty of sex, of course. He had some interesting proclivities and I learned a lot of things I didn't have a clue till then that some people did in the bedroom. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe made me feel desired and special. Like, this full grown man could have any sophisticated, adult woman he wanted but he was interested in me. \n\nEventually, his parents caught us having sex in his living room (we were idiots) and somehow it came out how old I was. Not sure how, maybe they got suspicious or they had seen him with young girls before and they called my mom. \n\nHe was shipped off to live with his aunt in another state and my mom beat the crap out of me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI realize now he was NOT special, himself. He was just a gross dude who liked young girls who were cowed and afraid and wouldn't say no to the things he wanted to do.",
            "My parents found out and threatened to have him arrested if he ever contacted me again. I was 13 years old and he was 21 at the time. At the time I was truly in love with him and try to initiate contact with him after the fact. He wouldn\u2019t talk to me. I was super pissed at my parents at first but looking back now I am truly glad my parents got me out of that situation. Thankfully we never went further then kissing and slight fingering, which is absolutely disgusting looking back, but I\u2019m glad I wasn\u2019t penetrated. The guy was mentally unstable.\n\nETA: I just realized how fucked up my childhood actually was.",
            "I had (just) turned 18, he was 26.\n\nHe flew across half the world to see me. I didn't want him to. Guilted me in to being with him. When I told my mum I felt uncomfortable being pressured, she too guilted me about him coming so far for me. Overall super fucked up.\n\nBut the most disturbing thing is how pressed he was on getting married - this man REALLY wanted us to tie the knot, have babies, STRAIGHT AWAY. I had to remind him I hadn't even finished high school yet... That didn't bother him the slightest bit. He was dead set on us getting married, moving to his country and having a family asap.\n\nLooking back, I can see that what he really wanted was to completely isolate me from everything and everyone I know (worth mentioning - he was somewhat racist towards my people, and wasn't big on the idea of coming back to my country) and seal the deal of me being 100% dependant on him by bringing some babies in to the picture. And you know what? It felt so much like everyone felt that's what I should do, that I nearly went through with it.\n\nI shudder at the thought of what could have been.",
            "I (20F) was 16 when my Anglican priest (37M) first showed interest in me, even though I was attending another church and met him at a youth event he organized. He was married at the time. He singled me out and built a relationship of trust with me and my family. It started with him asking me about my sexual activity so I could \u2018seek forgiveness\u2019. He did this with other teenagers too, acknowledging that we would slip up but could be absolved if we confessed our sexual sins. The frequent pastoral care sessions, the questions about intimacy, and the excessive online messaging was grooming me to be spiritually and emotionally dependent. He would divulge very sordid details about his marriage and parishioners\u2019 lives, and told me that no one else understood him or cared for him like I did. He also had this idea that it was every woman\u2019s kink to fuck a priest and get him to sin. He said he was going to hell anyways but couldn\u2019t live with himself for falling hopelessly in love, blaming me for it. When I was 17, he initiated oral sex in his home during a pastoral care session, telling me that it was consensual at my age (it turns out it is a federal crime in my country, if the person is in position of power) and he loved me. One month later, he took my virginity on Valentine\u2019s Day.  \n\nFast forward through a three year relationship of spiritual, emotional and sexual abuse, and\n I got the strength to leave the relationship. He had the idea that I would graduate from university and throw away my life to have children for him (he was still married). Well, when I wanted nothing to do with him anymore, he sent his friends from within the church and even his wife after me to try and get me back, saying they had never seen a purer and stronger love than what he had. He met my parents in secret to warn my parents that he had concerns I was having unprotected sex with a stranger (I wasn\u2019t), and dm\u2019ed people close to me that he just lost his best friend in the world and did nothing wrong. He also posted on Facebook he was getting surgery for testicular cancer and continued to ask for prayers, even after being dismissed from the church. \n\nAfter a month of this, I went to the police with another victim of his from the same parish, and they pressed criminal charges of sexual exploitation and grooming of a minor, and criminal harassment. The case is still ongoing, and sadly enough he is still contractually paid by the Anglican Church so he\u2019s battling it with a lawyer (although he is no longer working for them), but I have hope that justice will be served and one day I can come forward publicly with my story, so that other young people do not fall victim to any form of abuse by people in power.  I\u2019m finally in a loving relationship with someone my own age and going to therapy to unravel the trauma and the nightmares, although I\u2019ve lost all relationship with the church because of my so called \u201cfriends\u201d\u2019 support of him this whole time.",
            "My mom was 17 and my dad was 26 when they got married.....they were divorced before I was 2, and it was a baaaaaaaad marriage. My dad loved his cocaine and beer, and my mom loved...well, his best friend.",
            "Buckle up because this is a wild ride. When I was in the fourth grade, I was doing a musical in my school district and had the biggest crush on this guy in the 10th grade. He was nice to me, I thought he was cute, nothing crazy. Fast forward seven years, I'm 17 and a senior in high school and he was 23. We crossed paths on the town bus and it all went downhill from there.\n\n We became FB friends and it very quickly went from catching up to suddenly we're dating and he wants to spend his life with me. You'd think that would have been a red enough flag, but wait, there's more. He was also a pathological liar and told me he was dying of pancreatic cancer, and used this excuse to tell me we should have sex (luckily we never did). He also claimed that his car got vandalized, he was homeless, he got kicked out of school, he was in the military, he was this and that. He also had a daughter, and often when he spoke of her he'd call her \"ours\" which was weird since I'd never even met her. He always tried to get money out of me and nudes. He used to plan out our life together and talk about kids and all this. But he would also disappear for periods of time and I wouldn't hear from him, only for his excuse to be that either he was in jail, in the hospital, or a couple times he would post on FB about threatening to kill himself. One of the times he disappeared for a while I was on a school field trip and he called me on the bus ride back home, telling me all about how he was in the hospital and thinking about me all the time and I was the reason he was still living and asked me to marry him. My dumbass was so touched. Then about a month later he told me he had to go to Montana for an experimental cancer research thing. Never heard from him again. But a few weeks later saw him walking down the street.\n\nAnyway the good part of the story comes after that. I found out that while we were \"together\" he had blocked me on FB and had an actual girlfriend the whole time. Oh and I also found out that currently he's in jail for being a pedophile. (Anyone surprised?)",
            "How common is this shit???? There are way more stories than I was expecting.",
            "Ohhh shit! Here\u2019s my time to shine a light on how FUCKED UP predators are. \n\nBackstory, I\u2019m from a town of 400. I liked books, never took gun safety or snowmobile classes, was super sick as a kid and couldn\u2019t be in sports, and didn\u2019t get along with my classmates. \n\nSo when Facebook first started, lots of groups were out there, older men younger women blah blah. So me, finding men like Pierce Brosnan and George Clooney more attractive than Channing Tatum, turned to these groups. \n\nI had men messaging me all over the place. A high school shop teacher, a retired truck driver, a media personality, a principal, and so on. And I was a horny kid, read Harlequin romances since I was 12, like I was desperate to feel the \u2018passion\u2019 that happened in between the lines of these books. \n\nSo there I was, sixteen, and had men fawning over me. I\u2019d talk dirty with them and we\u2019d share pictures and talk about they\u2019d come and we\u2019d \u2018make love\u2019. All that bs. \n\nFor four years I \u2018dated\u2019 the retired truck driver. He lived hours away so we never met until I was a freshman in college. I mean, the man was gross, married, and had me combed into being wrapped around his fat cigarette scented finger. \n\nWe holed ourselves up in a shit hotel when I should have been partying and going to classes and learning what a hangover was, not rolling around in bed trying to get a 68 year old hard because he had low testosterone. \n\nFour years he had me so convinced he was my only love I\u2019d ever have. And that when I graduated I\u2019d drive to his home, turning my back on everyone and everything I\u2019d ever known. When I would want to hang out with friends he\u2019d say I was a slut and I was fucking all the guys. I wasn\u2019t, was literally hanging out with friends. So a few months before graduation I came to my senses and realized how fucked up it was. I did hook up with a guy who was my age and I ended up dating for a few years, but had savior complex because he knew my original plans. \n\nBut anyway, retired trucker gets the email because he didn\u2019t know how to text and only had Facebook, that I\u2019m done and how fucked up it was that he was doing that. He wrote me begging me to come back and how I was just mad he wouldn\u2019t be at graduation. I told him no again and said that would be it. That fucker mailed letters typed out on an old ass computer about how I should enjoy my last night on my knees and how I was going to bleed when he got ahold of me. \n\nI was so scared I couldn\u2019t tell anyone, not even savior complex. So I went to the police station and told the cop my story. He said an international restraining order is hard to get but he\u2019d call the guy and try to scare him off. \n\nWon\u2019t lie I was a little heartbroken when I heard how sad he was but cmon guy was almost seventy and I wasn\u2019t twenty. He never contacted me again and I actually found his obit a few months ago. \n\n\nI have way more stories of small stuff with him and other guys, if you want just ask.",
            "Does it count of I was 19? Ex was 33 when we met.  We were together for 7.5 years.  I came from an abusive home so this older, more \"mature\" man seemed so interesting and wanted to take care of me so I was all about it.  I should also mention that I look VERY young for my age (I regularly get mistaken as being as young as 14, I am 27 now).  He was into ageplay, so in bed he was always wanting me to act like I was like an 8 year old girl and he was my dad or older brother.\n\nYeah, he turned out to be a pedo and has tons of CP on his computer, cell phone, and laptop.  I tried going online and reporting him anonymously but nothing ever came of it.  I don't really want to go report in person because I'm scared no one will believe me because I'm his ex, and I don't want to get dragged into a court case or anything.",
            "I didn't realise it was fucked up till I was 16 and realised even at that age I wasn't attracted to 14 year olds, the age I was when it happened. The day that man raped me (even though I gave consent it was still rape please don't try and convince me otherwise) I was trying to get out of it. Because it was in a shopping centre, I was hiding in a WHSmiths and texting him saying I wasn't sure. I went out and walked right past him for him to not even acknowledge me. He knew HE KNEW it was wrong.\n\n(big trigger warning I get detailed here) \nAlthough my gut and my brain were telling me to just leave, I relented and went to a Costa with him. He scoped out the area with me following like a pathetic little lamb. He had the audacity to finger me, a CHILD, in the stair well. He got me to sit outside the disabled bathroom and to enter after a minute but I couldn't move so we switched. No one intervened. I was reached for the handle to run when he entered. He was pretty silent the entire time to not alert anyone. I had a panic attack during it and dissociated pretty hard after that. I'll never forgot those feelings. I felt alone. Empty. Disgusted. Shame. He smirked at the blood on the condom. Afterwards he just left me to go home, one of his tactics to make me come to see he was that he'd already bought a bus pass so why go home so early if it was that big of a deal. Afterwards I went back to that same WHSmiths and cried. Again, no one intervened. \n\n It was really difficult to process what happened. I resorted to joking about it at first. My friends slagged me off behind my back saying I lied about the entire thing. \n\nIt was quite a difficult journey to even realise I was raped, one I'm still on if I'm honest. Once I realised the severity, I've tried to reach out to younger girls on social mediaI see wanting attention from older men to warn them that losing your virginity shouldn't be rushed. It's an experience most of the population will experience and you have to chose when that's okay for YOU. Do not let anybody tell you that you are too old when you're in your teens because it's not up to the random people. Listen to your heart, brain and gut. \n\nTo anyone reading this who is a young teen preparing to meet an older guy please please please don't. Men being attracted to young girls should NOT be normalised. I STILL suffer flashbacks and panic attacks 4 years after the fact. Those men do not love you. They see you as some sick fetish. As soon as I gave that man my virginity he stopped talking to me. \n\nDo not be another victim for statutory rape. These creeps should, and do, know better, yet they still take advantage of insecure young girls and boys. Please reach out to somebody, there will always be somebody to listen. And listen to yourself. If your mind is telling you it's wrong, it's probably wrong.",

            "Not sure if this counts but when I was 18/19 I was \u201cdating\u201d a man that was 33 for a brief period of time, maybe a month or two? We met through a mutual friend at one of those Dave and buster type places  and he ended up driving me home/sleeping with me that night. I put dating in quotation marks because our \u201crelationship\u201d consisted of him coming over to my apartment whenever he pleased (he didn\u2019t have a key and would get extremely loud if I didn\u2019t open my door right away) and having oral/vaginal/anal sex, usually while watching tv, eating whatever was in my refrigerator at the time, drinking beers that he brought (those were his beers, and if he though I had drunk any of them he would pull me over to the fridge by my hair to question me. I really think this was foreplay for him), and then watching some more tv and leaving whenever with no indication of when/if he would be back. He was always rough and made me call him daddy, even though i had never expressed interest in a daddy/daughter dynamic. He would consistently film me giving him head even when I asked him not too, I am certain I am floating around on some porn sight somewhere. Relationship ended after he invited his friend (male) over and coerced me into having a threesome with them. I finally got the courage to tell him to fuck off forever after they left and asked one of my male friends to stay with me for a few days on the couch in case he showed up. Apparently this guy though I had been enjoying our relationship though and never came knocking on my door again. He told me he just liked you get girls because they were more \u201cobedient\u201d. He started dating another girl from our friend group (she was 17 and still in high school) shortly after this incident. Huh. I had forgotten about how shitty that was.

I wised up when he tried to pull off the condom without me noticing and never fooled around with him after that, but we remained friends for awhile after that. \nBy the time I was a senior in high school I could confidently look back and say he was lame and there was a reason girls his age weren\u2019t interested, but it wasn\u2019t until about a year ago (I\u2019m 30 now) that I came to the realization he wasn\u2019t just a loser but a creep!",
            "Different situation but i think it applies, I started dating my boyfriend when i was 18 and he was 25. we met at work and our boss set us up, although neither of us were actively pursuing the other. my family freaked out thinking he was an abuser and weirdo for wanting to date me at such a young age, but really we just met when that 6 year age gap looked really sus. i\u2019m now 22 we\u2019re still together. he never pressured me into anything, and has been the most supportive and loving boyfriend i could\u2019ve ever asked for. his friends thought it was weird for a bit too but now that we\u2019re both in our 20\u2019s and it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s not a toxic situation, it\u2019s all good. sometimes people with age gaps fall for each other :)",

            "I was 14 and he was 18/19. We met on habbo hotel and were \u2018dating\u2019 and then it moved onto MSN messenger. He went by the name of Craig and he said he was from Southend.... I would send him topless pictures and often go on webcam.\n\nWe discussed meeting in real life and then red flag number 1 comes up (although I was far too trusting to realise): he admits his name isn\u2019t Craig it\u2019s something else and he isn\u2019t from Southend, he is from a North West city - I was in the North East. He explained this away by saying he was just protecting his identity as should anyone using the internet but by admitting the truth it meant he really loved and trusted me.\n\nWe arranged for him to come to my house (where I lived with my parents) for my week whilst I was off for half term break. My parents were fully on board with this.... to this day I will never understand why and I vow never to repeat their mistake. It was agreed that me and my mother would pick up him up from the train station after my last day of school (still in uniform) and he would stay in my bedroom and I would stay on the couch for the week.\n\nDuring that week, I would sneak up to my room after my parents went to sleep and would sneak back down in the morning. I lost my virginity that week. He didn\u2019t have any condoms and afterwards he joked about cumming in me.  Who the fuck makes a joke like that?! \n\nAfter he went home we \u201cdated\u201d for about 8 months and met up another time. \n\nDuring one of our telephone calls I heard another woman in the background and he said it was his friend \u2018V\u2019. One of his other friends had already tried to warn me about \u2018V\u2019 and my boyfriend sleeping together however I brushed this off as lies. \n\nWe eventually broke up because I developed a crush on someone my own age and honestly I couldn\u2019t be bothered to continue with how mind fucky he was, acting very manipulative. Once I broke it off he became vicious towards me and then more information came out that \u2018V\u2019 was actually pregnant with his child. I ultimately blocked him from every corner of my life and I haven\u2019t heard from him since.\n\nI think he now has 2/3 children with V and seemingly are still together. \n\nLooking back now, I know it was wrong and I know I should have been protected by my parents. Going forward I know how to do better than them.",
            "24 year old brother of my friend used to come around when I was a 14 year old babysitter. He would buy alcohol and bring cigarettes and weed and then feel me up on the couch when the kids were in bed.\nThe kids parents were fucked up enough themselves that they never batted an eyelid. My brother put a stop to it when he found out. He was 21 at the time but he knew the dude from school and told both our parents. Smart move. He got his arse kicked twice over.",

            "I had just turned 18, and my ex (we lasted 2 weeks) had a friend who started coming on to me. He was 27. He convinced me he was on my side when my ex and his friends started talking shit behind my back. I was a stupid kid (I wouldn\u2019t call myself an adult at that age as I was very socially underdeveloped) and let him use me, twice. Both times he stopped talking to me right after. I shouldn\u2019t have let it happen the first time, and I definitely shouldn\u2019t have let it happen the second time. He tried to swoop in a third time several months later, but by then I had already gained my senses and was in an actual relationship.",
            "I was 17, he was 30. We worked together. He had a wife and 2 kids and I stupidly believed he would leave his wife for me because he complained about her constantly. I should have told his wife because he ended up parading his little family around in front of me when we had a company picnic and then afterwards had the audacity to text me to meet him in the employee lounge to fool around. For being a dumb kid, I at least had the sense to know that he was a shitty person after that little charade and I let him sit there waiting for me for nearly an hour. I should have told his wife. I still think about it and I'm disgusted with myself and with him.",
            "Started partying at 14. Got introduced to a group of guys in their 20s. No idea how my friends met them. Obv we thought it was cool to party with them cause they had parties and could buy booze and cigarettes n stuff. I got involved with one of them. They constantly lied about their age so I didnt actually know how old he was. It started at 20 then rose to 23,24, he could have been late 20s for all i know. Another guy lied about his age telling us he was early 20s then we saw his license and he was 30. You know its fucked when guys are lying about their age to be younger instead of us lying to be older. Anyways I didn't really think about it even though there were so many signs to suggest they were losers but you just miss so much shit at that age. Its like I couldnt comprehend it. Its only when I got into my twenties did i realize it was fucked up because I just thought about if one of my 24 year old guy friends brought a 9th grader to party with us. How seriously fucked up that would be and then I finally understood how fucked those guys were and how dumb I was.",
            "This might get buried but this was around 2013.. I was 15 and talking online to a YouTube star who was in his early twenties who lived about 4 hours away from me. He asked for videos of me twerking and dancing in specific outfits. And would pressure me to send them when I was uncomfortable. I\u2019m embarrassed he had these videos of me and out of fear he would leak them I sent more and more, all via email. \n\nHe was caught and prosecuted as a child sex predator. Girls came forward and had stories similar to mine after I had graduated high school. This was around 2017/2018. A friend of mine sent me the article and she said \u201cisn\u2019t this that guy you were always texting?\u201d  I never told anyone about the videos, but I talked about how I was starting to see this guy. I really thought I liked him and this was just how you pleased someone who didn\u2019t live in your same city. \n\nI called the newspaper to try to get information on the lawyers so I could join in and share my experience, but I chickened out talking to the lawyers. I was so afraid of what would come out, embarrassed thinking about if the videos ever saw the light of day, shamed at what I had done.. I\u2019m still racked with guilt that I didn\u2019t step up and share my story but even now I can\u2019t admit it to myself I was a victim of his."

            "I was going to say a shovel, but it looks like people have already said spoons. What is a spoon but a very small shovel? What is a shovel but a very large spoon?\n\nAre you asking if there's an invention that does its job so well that nothing else can do the same job better (like how a light bulb can give off more light than a candle, but so far we haven't produced anything that emits light better than LEDs)? Or are you asking if there's an invention that perfectly solves a specific problem (like if you want to keep dry while walking in the rain, you best choice is an umbrella)?\n\nThings that come to mind are: AM/FM radio (it is about as efficient as it's going to get.)\n\u2022The pencil and pencil sharpener (I don't really see how they can improve them.)\n\u2022 The match and lighter.\n\u2022 The umbrella.\n\u2022 The hammer.\n\u2022 The bucket.\n\u2022 The T.V. remote.\n\u2022 The fishing pole.\n\u2022 The hinge.\n\u2022 The spring.\n\nEDIT: WOW! I'm so surprised how much debate there is about the T.V. remote! I just thought of it and the other things I mention on their most basic principles, and the evolution of the items: how did the hammer come to be as we know it? Ancestors of man coming across a problem which required the use of blunt force, and uses a stone. The stone is eventually attached to a handle for more control, the stone is eventually replaced with metal (likely bronze) formed with a more flat and even shape to insure equal force is applied over a given area as well as more even ware. \n\nAlso not having to worry about the metal breaking into shards like a stone. The way of attaching the hammer head to the handle went from tieing with strips of leather to wedges. The handle went from bone to wood to composite materials, and continuously redesigning the handle for the most firm and ergonomic grip. The metal went from bronze to iron to steel. Also somewhere down the line a claw was put on it to allow you to remove and reset the nail. \n\nYou need to apply blunt force to something? Your first go to item is likely to be a hammer. Honestly, I don't see how you can make any more advancements to the hammer. The T.V. remote has gone as far as it can go. It started of as a simple 4 button design (channel higher, channel lower, volume, and on/off) more features were added over the years (mute, last, menu, info, record, fast forward, rewind etc. etc.) now they are moving to voice control, and apps, so while I don't think T.V. remotes will be completely phased out, I see no more improvements to them (touch screen? Why bother?)\n\nMatches- can you get them to burn slower?\nLighters- fluid based lighters led to eletric and rechargable. Are we gonna make them solar next?\nPencil and Pencil Sharpener- some people say mechanical pencil is superior, I disagree. Its an alternative, but not necessarily better. Mechanical pencil 'lead' is very fragile, and doesn't glide on the paper like the wooden pencil does. The pencil sharpener, be it electric or the hand crank mechanical, shapes the pencil to a fine point to use as much of the pencil as you comfortably can.\n\nAM/FM radio- is effected by weather conditions, obstructions between the broadcast and the reciever, and the curvature of the earth. Repeaters allow for signals to travel farther for the purpose of simulcasting, but there's a reason why satellite radio is becoming the go to format.\nThe bucket- you added a handle for easier carry. Regardlees of shape, size, the material it's made out of, or the material inside the bucket. All buckets are made for the purpose of holding/containing something. \n\nI'm not trying to say that these thing are the be all end all for their intended purposes. Say you want to catch fish: obviously with one fishing pole, you can only catch fish one at a time, while with a fishing net you can catch many fish at once. So obviouly you would want a net more than a pole. The fishing pole's design isn't likely to improve. What more can be done for it? \n\nLook at unnecessary inventions like fireworks: There's nothing to improve about them because they serve no purpose to begin with, they solve no real problems, there's nothing benificial about them.",

            "This one might be a bit obscure just because I've only ever met one other person familiar with it, but Google's Project Ara modular smartphone was looking like it could've been the end all be all of smartphones.\n\nBased off the Phonebloks idea of having a Lego-like hot-swappable module phone, the idea was that you could switch out any components of the phone on the fly. Camera, fingerprint scanner, even different quality screens. Conceptually, it really looked like it could take over the phone market, as it would lead to people not having to buy whole new phones anymore, but rather replacement or upgraded parts to a phone they already liked, thereby reducing costs and increasing utility. \n\nYou don't want a phone with 5 cameras that inflate the cost unnecessarily? Just buy a one camera module. You want a 1440P Super Amoled screen to replace your 720P regular screen? Buy one and swap it in.\n\nHowever, like many Google projects, it died off for myriad reasons and the longstanding era of $1000 dollar smartphone slabs lived on.",

            "Hydrogen cars were a promising new form of motorized vehicle. They were supposed to be incredibly good for the environment, emitting only water as the exhaust. They exist, but not like how some people imagined. I was a pretty big hydrogen car believer at the time. There are some hydrogen stations, but mostly centered around California. Thing is that the hydrogen is quite expensive and not very efficient compared to smaller engines, hybrids, and EV\u2019s. The hydrogen is also somewhat inefficient to produce, store, and distribute as well. \n\nYou can actually get a hydrogen car though, they\u2019re out there. The Toyota Mirai is a really good example. Out of all hydrogen cars, that one is definitely most popular. In fact, Toyota pays for $15,000 worth of hydrogen in your first few years of ownership since it\u2019s so expensive. This means that for your first 3-ish years of owning one, you might not have to pay a penny in fuel. As you can see I\u2019m still a hydrogen advocate. Don\u2019t expect to be able to take it very far from your nearest hydrogen station though.\n\nEdit: a word",

However, if we take its composition and compare it to our standard models of stellar evolution for other, better-studied stars, the star's age pops out as 14.46 \u00b1 0.8 billion years old.  Let me remind you, the *universe* is thought to be about 13.8 billion years old, and we don't think we got the first stars until maybe 200 million years after *that*...\n\nObviously, we do not think the Methuselah star is literally older than the universe when it is more likely that we just don't understand stellar evolution for stars like it super well.  However, it is exciting because it is undoubtedly a very old star, and currently we do not have any observations of what the first stars were like in the universe. (Called [Population III stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_population#Population_III_stars), it's thought they were larger than stars are today because there were no metals from stellar fusion to contaminate the hydrogen gas, and they'd thus only live a few million years tops.)

            "The use of concrete. It's use goes as far back as the Mayans, but more notably in Egyptian construction as well as in Rome. The Romans had an arguably greater concrete mix than we currently have, but that was never passed down. Eventually the use of concrete fell out of popularity for centuries as we seemingly lost the information needed to create it, as if the recipe was thrown out and nobody wrote it down. \n\nAlso Samuel L Jackson. The man is 71 years old, but looks like he hasn't aged in decades!\n\nEdit: Just to add onto this, Roman concrete is not only more eco-friendly as /u/Bionic_Ferir mentions, but it was actually more durable and became sturdier over time. The concrete we make today is made with portland cement, which is a cocktail of silica sand, limestone, clay and other goodies. The process to make this has a large carbon offset and isn't great for the environment. Another downside to using this method is that the world is running out of silica sand very fast. \n\nSilica sand, or industrial sand/white sand, is primarily composed of quartz. This is a chemically inert mineral with a solid hardness which makes it highly desired for the specific use of making concrete. Regular sand, like desert sand, has many more impurities like potassium, iron, carbonate and other stuff that makes it more reactive and gives it a darker color. A more reactive sand is bad for a concrete mix and will make the structure more prone to cracks and failure over time, whereas a chemically inert mineral like quartz is just what the doctor ordered. Silica sand has *many* uses like water filtration systems, glass and ceramic work, sandblasting and industrial uses, like making high grade concrete.\n\nWith the world's supply of silica sand running dry at an alarming rate, with some countries like Vietnam at risk of running out of sand as soon as 2022, there is a need to find an alternative method. The Romans created concrete after possibly seeing the natural results through something called tuff rocks. This is the combo of volcanic ash, lime and seawater. Because of the addition of seawater to this mix, two very rare minerals, aluminous tobermorite and phillipsite, grow *within* the concrete. These minerals actually make the concrete mix stronger over time when exposed to seawater, which is in direct opposition to what happens to portland concrete or basically any modern day concrete, which erodes when exposed to seawater. \n\nWe still do not know the recipe needed to make the concrete the ancient Romans made, but we can try to make it through reverse engineering and many, *many* countless experiments. Today scientists are not only looking into this, but also an alternative to modern day concrete because of the diminishing presence of silica sand around the world and the carbon offset created when making it while trying to quench the high demand for concrete globally. \n\nIf you think this is interesting, pick up a book or start researching into this and maybe you will be the one to find the solution to these problems. Like the guy who accidentally made the frosted lightbulb (frontpage yesterday), the guy who accidentally made post it notes or the one who solved those two calculus problems without knowing they were, at the time, famously unsolved (also frontpage), you could potentially stumble upon a solution to this issue and be on the frontpage one day! You may not get the reddit karma for it, but you could potentially go down in history.\n\nAlso I can't stress enough that Samuel L Jackson has aged so well.",

About two weeks before I was to leave the country we were sitting around having our staff drinks at the bar I was working at after our shift. Some of my co-workers were talking about bad tattoos so I chimed in with \"those are not as bad as the tattoo of the groundhog I have on my ass\". Over the next two weeks I managed to talk to people one-on-one and slipped in that they would get to see it if they got me drunk enough at my going away party. Finally the day came and I got everyone who wanted to see the tattoo on one side of the room.

I still found glitter three years later when I moved apartments. The bitch.\n\nWhen it happened, I knew she would be wary of a counter attack, so I waited. And I decided not to just wait, but to long con her. I knew she liked candles, so I went for simplicity: I got her a candle that smelled great at first, but eventually burned down to smell awful. Not after an hour, mind you, but after quite a bit of it burned off giving a very pleasant apple pie scent.\n\nMonths went by, and I would see it at her place. Burned a little, but not too much. Occasionally I would notice it getting lower, but it was slow going. I got disheartened when I didn't see it any longer, until I noticed that she had moved it to her bedstand, right by where her head would be when she slept.\n\nAww, so sweet. She liked my gift.\n\nCut to many more months having passed. Almost two years since I first got her the candle, I get a bunch of angry texts late at night. \"You asshole! That fucking candle! It reeks in my bedroom!\" My magnum opus had finally been achieved. \n\nIt turns out that she had brought her date home that night and put the candle on to set some ambiance. As they're getting hot and heavy, they start to smell what she described as \"pure sewage\". It took them five minutes to figure out it was the candle and not some sort of sewage backup, then the smell lingered for an hour.\n\nIn the end, the guy was a good sport and recognized a quality prank when he sees one, so it didn't ruin anything between them, but to have a long con end that spectacularly was just better than I could have ever hoped for.\n\nEdit: Woah!

            "This one started as my project for sociology class, and the reveal was an April Fool's joke.  \nTo demonstrate the differences between girls' and guys' Facebook dynamic, I made a fake female profile (I'm a guy, so I had a baseline for comparison), with the initials AF. I grabbed a couple pictures just by googling \"hot party girl\" or something. I then added a number of friends who knew about the project, and then went through and added girls who had profile pictures with bars/parties/alcohol in them. This was in the early days of facebook, when it was college students and you could search by city and get a whole list of everyone. Anyways, most accepted the friend requests. Only one girl asked how the fake profile knew her, and I just said I thought I met her at a party. Then I waited. Soon, AF was getting messages and friend requests from guys. It was a weird mix of messages, some vulgar, mostly generic greetings, one was a guy saying he was married but wanted to be friends. But, all guys. Guys who had never met this girl, pursuing her. It made a good comparison for my sociology class.  \nThen, on April fool's day, I changed her info to explain it was an April fool's joke, and pasted in some of the more interesting messages. Comments ranged from laughter to rage. ",

            "Years ago I got into a prank war with a guy at work. His were pretty uninspired things. Extra mouse in the USB to move mine around, taking the wheels off my chair etc.\n\nOne day I stayed late. I got a 10 foot ladder, a bunch of old boxes and 100 cubic feet of styrofoam peanuts, some pullys, steel cable, duct tape and various odds n ends.\n\nAbove his desk I rigged a ceiling tile by barely cutting it small enough to fit through the frame on 3 sides. I then made a hinge on the 4th side with some tape and hooks. Opposite that I made a break away pin attached to a long cable and pull system that ran across the ceiling to my desk. After I rigged the trap door above his chair I made a VERY large cardboard funnel and filled it with the styrofoam peanuts.\n\nThen I waited. I waited for days, weeks and finally a little over a month before he interacted with me about the pranks.\n\n\"Hey, Thats_right_asshole, you ever going to get me back for that last prank?\"\n\n\"Is it my turn? I thought it was your turn.\"\n\n\"No, I took the wheels from your chair, remember?\"\n\n\"Oooohhh yeah. That's right!\"\n\nAnd then I reached up and pulled the cable running down the jumble of power and ethernet cables above my my desk. The pin was pulled on the tile and WOOSH or, I should say WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHH!\n\nSee, styrofoam peanuts fall slowly and 100 cubic feet takes about 3 minutes to finish falling. That whole time all he could do was stand there with a half grimace half grin as his cubicle was filled with the horrible stuff. Nobody spoke, nobody had to, as we waited for the last to fall.\n\nEdit: I stopped the story there because it's more satisfying than ending it on me cleaning up peanuts followed by weeks of more mundane pranks. That was when the prank war jumped the shark though.",

NSFW.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe idea wasn't my own, it was from some infographic (and I think the original idea may even be from Reddit) on \"best ways to slowly drive someone insane\". Most were dumb, but one showed promise to me: \"**Keep leaving pennies everywhere they go.** Start out slow; a penny here, a little spare change there, on their desk or in their pockets - and steadily increase the amount over time until they start to question their sanity. \"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the time I lived in a house at the time with three roommates, the best roommates I've ever had. But as soon as I saw the idea, I knew I had to target one of them: Ted (name changed for privacy). Ted had long been the butt of our jokes, and took them well, but with that sort of tinge of frustration that you just knew could be gold if something like this worked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo we started out simple, like it said - a couple of pennies on his desk, a penny in his pocket. And with a sloooooooow burn, we worked it up. A penny in his shoe. A penny in his pillowcase. *Lots* of pennies on his desk. A penny wrapped up in his scarf. Pennies in his lampshade, so he could just see the silhouette through the shade. Pennies in places they could never conceivably end up, and we did this for *months*. Our girlfriends all got involved and gave suggestions - my girlfriend suggested putting one in his tissue box -and it was just a great time all around. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou could see he was starting to get rattled as the weeks went by, and finally his girlfriend approached us in the best way possible: \"Are you guys doing the penny thing? He's blaming ME for it!\" Turns out we were consistently adding more when he left to go pick her up from the bus stop, and so naturally he thought *she* was doing it somehow??? Don't know, but we 'fessed up to her - thankfully she agreed she wouldn't rat us out to him, and so the games continued. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n...Until finally, after two months, we were all cooking dinner and out of the blue he says: \"You know, I have such great roommates,\" - he held up a penny - \"...Roommates who would NEVER GO INTO MY ROOM. Right, \\[*ya\\_filthy\\_animal\\]???*\" I lost it, I couldn't keep a straight face anymore. And he went into *hysterics*. He had been trying DESPERATELY to figure out the culprit. In between bits of hysterical laughter, he shouts \"I FINGERPRINTED YOU ALL! I BOUGHT A FINGERPRINTING KIT, LIFTED FINGERPRINTS FROM YOUR DOORKNOBS AND THE PENNIES, AND I **COULDN'T FIGURE IT OUT**! FOR MONTHS!**\"** That's when he realized he must have been a conspiracy between all of us. \"I FINGERPRINTED MY OWN GIRLFRIEND because I didn't believe her!! Do you know what it **TAKES** to get someone to that point?!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"And you know,\" he said, \"I was doing *fine*. I was a little frustrated and a little confused, but the moment that really *did* it, that set me over the edge into a paranoid frenzy, was me sitting at my desk with a Pornhub tab open, JERKIN' IT, having a perfectly good time, and right as I'm coming to a climax, I grab a tissue from my box...

Like one of those fake cries people like to do. His fake crying turned to laughter and looked at me like the joker about to pounce on a victim\n\n\u201cI no shit thought I was losing my mind\u201d. He says lowly\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I said perplexed. \n\n\u201cDude. I never once got you to admit it. No one ever saw it. At some point I thought it might be in my head. My parents had no clue what I was talking about. I almost saw a god damn shrink about it\u201d \n\nI was shocked\n\n\u201cDamn\u201d I said to myself\n\nI don\u2019t remember who laughed first but we started and couldn\u2019t stop. He called me a slew of a bad names amongst his laughter and then proceeded to call his mom and tell her that he wasn\u2019t crazy\n\n\u201cAfter all these years?\u201d Her thick southern accent sang through the speaker phone l\n\nI know this story will probably go mostly unnoticed but that was my first and last long con. If anyone does read this, I hope it makes you as happy as it made me ",

            "This was pulled on me about ten years ago. It was about mid-march.  My gf and I had agreed that neither of us would get the other's name tattooed on ourselves. She lived in Tacoma, WA., and I was working on a research ship in the Bering Sea. {This plays a big part, so please bear with me.) She had told me that she needed to go in and get some touch-up done on the sexy line of kitty footprints that were tattooed on her spine, but when I called her from port in Dutch Harbor, she said, \"You remember how we said that we weren't going to get each other's names tattooed? \n\nMe: Ye-es...?\n\nKitten: Well, I was getting my touch-ups done, and the new artist seemed really cool, and he had this great idea, so-\n\nMe: What did you do?!\n\nKitten: Well, I got... something...\n\nMe: What?!

I'll get (friend whatshername) to take a pic of it this weekend, and send it to you, and you can think of me until you get back.\n\nMe: Damn...\n\nOkay, so, a week goes by. No pic. I email her, and she tells me that one of her cats (she had seven of them) had chewed through her usb cable for her camera, and she couldn't upload it. She she'd have to wait until the weekend to go to the store and pick up a new one.\n\nAnother week goes by, and I am in port again, so I am able to call her, and she tells me that she wanted to hear my reaction  as I saw it for the first time, so she was getting ready to send it right that minute.\n\nShe sent it.\n\nI opened the email and saw a really crappy picture of a shitty tattoo. It looked like a tramp stamp of a star with my name in it right over the crack of her ass. It was really poorly done. I didn't know what to say. I asked her if she had even bothered to look at the guy's portfolio, or get any recommendations. It looked like complete shit. I was stunned.\n\nKitten: What do you think?\n\nMe: I, uh...\n\nKitten: You don't like it. (she started to cry)\n\nMe: Wait, honey... I'm just really, uh...\n\nKitten: I wanted to show this to you two weeks ago,  (sob) I wanted you to get turned on, and miss me... (sob) I waited a whole two weeks for today... Its a special day, you know that right? (sob)\n\nNow, I'm thinking... what special day... what did I forget?! dammit... I made her cry and forgot a special day too! \n\nMe: Baby, I'm sorry... I've been so busy , and you know how the weather gets up here this time of year, I'm not getting a lot of rest.\n\nKitten: It's a very special day. Look at the date!\n\nI read the date on the email.

            "My first boss in America, I was 21. He was Asian-American. I had never seen the office but noted the absurdity. \n\nHe would get free potato chips from a guy in a company truck and would stuff his cheeks in the middle of telling me what to do. He always offered some.\n\nFired a coworker for screaming some racist stuff at me by just..yanking her out the door.\n\nCalled another coworker a cub or a baby lion because she was tiny with wild unruly hair. Would do a small mini roar whenever she was about to report for her shift or when I mentioned her name.\n\nRan around the place with a wig on his head imitating me. \n\nBrought his daughter to work and give her piggy back rides in the office. Would ask me to take videos. \n\nWould talk to black people in a \u201cblack\u201d way. He would say wassup shorty to the ladies and what\u2019s poppin. Called the guys Tyrone and would say shieeeeeet in his most convincing \u201cblack\u201d voice. It was actually pretty good.\n\nWould ask me to teach him random Arabic words so he could yell them sporadically in the middle of the day. He always got the accent right.\n\nHad an open door policy and would do shots in his office.\n\nStarted a small chicken farm in the back of the building and would give out whole chickens to the staff. Had me and a coworker try to slaughter one one time. I couldn\u2019t and nicked it just a little bit and shrieked, spraying all three of us with blood.\n\nReceived a visit from the city people to tell him he couldn\u2019t keep chickens in back. He was rounding the main floor with a small basket of freshly laid eggs just as they were asking for him.\n\nDid the chicken farm again the next summer, this time with a small garden growing squash, cucumber, corn etc to disguise the chicken coop. Happily gave out vegetables along with chicken.\n\nWould be extremely proud of taking home a tray of his own eggs to his children. Ate two fresh eggs every morning.\n\nBought a wok to work to deep fry sausages in. Sometimes made lunch in the back. The entire floor would smell like food and he would round us all (3 of us) to his office to eat.\n\nWould regularly fall asleep under his desk. The snoring was so loud you could hear it in the front. Once a client asked what that noise was and I said it was the plumbing.\n\nWoke up after his naps looking puffy but acting as if nothing happened. Would immediately go next door for a Cherry coke.\n\nWould constantly eat hard candy to stay awake during the day.\n\nAte too many edibles at a party I hosted once and passed out. \n\nTold me to hire someone but when he saw the girl did a comical thing with his face, eyebrows raised and eyes big ( think Ken Jeong ) because she was having trouble fitting into her chair. She was a bigger girl.\n\nTook away chairs the next day because they \u201cencouraged us not to concentrate on the client.\u201d The girl was a no call no show the following week.\n\nHad a love hate relationship with a groundhog not long into his farming venture. He never caught the guy.\n\nOnce threw a cricket at me from the very opposite end of the office floor. He and another coworker kept such straight faces as I finally convinced myself the cricket flung itself at me. I watched the cameras at the end of the day only to see them do it. I\u2019m still traumatized. \n\nHas an office to this day full of the weirdest collection of things. A few feather from favorite chickens of his that he had since consumed all named and dated, a rabbit paw someone gave him, a goat\u2019s hoof, a framed quote I told him told to me by a very high homeless person.. I don\u2019t remember the rest. It\u2019s just an odd place to go into.\n\nHad a hard time growing a beard and would ask me what I thought of the progress of his \u201csoup taster.\u201d\n\n\nNicest boss I\u2019ve ever had. Well meaning if a little racially insensitive all while being fascinated by other people\u2019s cultures. He would buy different cuisines for us to try each week. Gave bonuses because he knew the job didn\u2019t pay much so that was always a nice surprise. He paid my former coworker when she had to stay home all through her husband\u2019s Covid.\n\n\nAlso, he loves llamas, alpacas, baby goats and when I showed him how to use Reddit he would almost always sends me an alpaca photo. I still get a photo now and then.\n\nAlso 3 years after leaving he still sends me photos of his illegal farm and recently asked me to post his cucumbers on Reddit.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the gold guys! I\u2019m glad you found my boss as as amusing as I did!\n\n\nAlso I forgot to add that he fell into poison ivy bush once and didn\u2019t know right away. He ran around screaming until we sat him in his office semi undressed and put medicine on his wounds. He was so miserable for days, it was hard to watch.\n\nHe dove head first into the wall when asleep once and needed to go to the doctor and get 3 stitches on his busted lip. He came to work that morning with a huge lip and kept having to explain himself all day. We kept joking his wife was beating him up. He still insisted on snacking as usual. At one point he sipped ketchup with a straw.",

He then proceeded to explain that this was a chart of all the sex he had ever had in his life. \"See, here it is blank until I joined the army. Then I went to a hooker here. Then they sent me to Vietnam where hookers only charged  $2 per time.  That's where you see the big jump.  I was on two tours but then got shot in the face.

            "My boss is certainly Michael Scott-esque. When I first started I was essentially Pam as well since I was both receptionist and his assistant to some extent. My favorite story was back when we were prepping for a conference. Some context, he\u2019s terrible with the English language in general and will mangle phrases and descriptions to no end (how the turn tables...). So on a group call he kept talking about wanting a \u201cgolden hamster ball\u201d to do giveaways with. Was raving about how great it would be spinning around while people walked by, all the while everyone on the call was just sitting in confused silence. However by that point, I had become so good at decoding his nonsense that I knew he was referring to a gold raffle cage and sent him image privately asking if it\u2019s what he was thinking. To this day he still talks about the fact I can read his mind and must be psychic. And he still refers to it as a hamster ball. \n\nAll in all he\u2019s a pretty nice guy and a solid boss. Hired me based on a gut feeling and has been decent to me ever since. I think I knew it would be a good fit when during the interview he tried to tell me about the four pillars of the company and forgot one. Told me later it was Knowledge.",
            "He wanted a pomegranate for lunch and they were out of season, but that didn\u2019t stop him from sending me on a quest to every grocery store in town in search of a pomegranate.

            "I used Michael Scott as a reference point for an old boss of mine from the moment I started working there. He made Chewbacca noises on the regular because one of my coworkers\u2019 names sort of vaguely sounded like Chewbacca (it didn\u2019t), used voice to text extremely loudly in his office for no reason to send really personal messages, got really excited and wore a specific vest any time we had after-work outings scheduled, shouted the same like 7 references to old movies and extremely awkward hip-hop song quotes 100 times a day, and insisted on greeting all our international coworkers very loudly in their language (they all speak perfect English, of course), looking around for approval afterward, and then fully giggling at everyone\u2019s French accents on conference calls. He also told me a lot about an improv show he did for a full year after it happened. \n\nThat said - he had all the good parts too. He never hesitated go to the mat for any of us whether we deserved it or not, he gave really sage business advice and great examples of how to face challenges out of absolutely nowhere, and he came to every community play I did in the 4 years I worked for him - and told everyone else in the office how good I was in it for the following month and chastised them for not coming. When things really got serious or bad in my life, he couldn\u2019t have been more kind, helpful, and supportive. \n\nHonestly? Probably the best boss I\u2019ll ever have.",

One time he got new patio furniture and sent the guys from the shipping department to put it together at his house. Orders did not go out that day.\n\nEdit 2: he had a huge closet where he\u2019d hoard random shit. He was a total pack rat and his wife didn\u2019t let him keep junk at home.

He\u2019d crack jokes, randomly burst into song and sneak up behind you to yell \u201cyou\u2019re doing a great job!\u201d \n\nUnfortunately, he was also super incompetent at his job. He relied heavily on a junior colleague for help with technical stuff (they practically did his whole job for him), and spent days working on paperwork that should really only take an hour or two. If you had a problem, his answer was usually either to stare blankly at you until you left or to say \u201cthink positive and it\u2019ll work itself out!\u201d \n\nThing he did I hated the most: whenever people would apply to work at the company, he\u2019d print out the stack of resumes, sit at his desk and read aloud all of the parts he found \u201cfunny.\u201d He\u2019d laugh at people for working at McDonald\u2019s or other fast food places. He loved finding grammar mistakes and making fun of them. If someone had a cringe-y objective statement, he\u2019d guffaw over that too. This was all done loudly, and it was a open office so you couldn\u2019t avoid hearing it. That definitely lowered morale too.",

I would have to constantly monitor and follow up with him to get things done that effected my job\n- his writing read like he used a thesaurus heavily. Tons of superfluous words clearly put in there to make him sound smart\n- when he was terminated he kept the corporate laptop and cell phone. After several strongly worded letters requesting their return, he drove back to the office, parked on the edge of the road (think busy rural highway) and made his teenage son carry it all across the yard and parking lot to deliver them\n\n\nI was eventually tasked by the big bosses to coordinate his termination. They then gave me his job plus my previous one. I can do both within a 40 hr week no problem.",
            "Might be too late here so this might get buried.\n\nMy boss at a pizza shop in high school was out of control. \n\n1. he made getting raises a game eventually and handed them out for odd reasons. \n\nHe liked a table my friend got that the credit card machine sat on so much he got a raise. \n\nAnother kid was playing with a penny at the end of the night and he kicked it into the air and it landed in a hat someone was holding. \n\nI won an election to be the first person listed on the time sheet. Becoming numero uno according to him and got a raise. \n\n2. he was a person who over ate and loved gluttony. He asked if we wanted lunch all the time and if we turned it down he became irate.\n\nHe brought us two sandwiches with one pound of turkey each on them, five granola bars, five fruit snacks, and two gatorades. That lunch was brought frequently and if we didn\u2019t eat it all he was angry.\n\nHe drove an hour away during our shift one time to get pizza we had not tried before because it was best in the state. People who didn\u2019t try it were shunned that day.\n\nHe bought 100 tacos from Taco Bell and made us have an eating contest for our lunch. He was so happy when someone ate 7 and was basically going to puke. \n\nHe paid a worker to eat a bag of dog treats and filmed it. It was an event after work\n\n3. after a closing shift he got back from the casino and won 4K from poker. He demanded we go to the strip club and drink with him. We were 18 at the time. \n\n4. He never trained anyone and just expected everyone to know everything and anything about our pizza place. We always had to hire and train the people he just kind of sat there.\n\n5. He LOVED online poker. Loved it and would often play during our shifts. His desk was right in the middle of the store. He wasn\u2019t supposed to have a desk but he did right there. He was playing poker during 5pm Friday rush and just had us working the store. \u201cCan you get the register I\u2019m in the middle of a hand?\u201d Was all too common. \n\nMy friend drove past the store at 1am multiple times and saw him sitting in the store playing poker with all the lights on. Just dialed in. \n\nWe often found the store unlocked and ovens going in the morning because he just up and left after poker binges. \n\nHim winning or losing really set the tone. But honestly you just got used to him not working and having to close the store down because he was so dialed in.\n\nEdit- this was in 2007 so think of the phones we had. He LOVED text bombing people. He would demand the workers get in a circle and furiously text someone not at work. He wouldn\u2019t let us stop until we sent about 400 texts collectively as a group. He would laugh and cackle so hard. He would peck at his blackberry so fast and just scream. I mean SCREAM he was having so much fun.\n\nHe also started fights with every restaurant around us. He was a male version of Karen. His order would be slightly wrong and then he would storm over there and start shit non stop with them until he got a refund. I would state I\u2019m going to get lunch somewhere and he would not let me leave to get it because he hated the owner or was fighting with them. \n\nEventually all restaurants within a mile of us were off limits. Which was about 20 or so places he had picked fights with. He was well known and nobody ever fought back for some reason. We had to order food from across town if we actually wanted someone to serve us because he pissed everyone else off so bad.",
            "I had one for a year and it was awesome! If he would be in the middle of a story and the phone rang he would literally say \u201clet it go to voicemail\u201d. If a customer called 5 min before closing he\u2019d demand I let it ring and go to VM. He was late more often than I was. He frequently bought us coffees. He always took our side in customer disputes and if a customer yelled at us or got abusive on the phone, he would call them back and get into an argument with them and tell them to order from someone else. He straight out told us that if weather conditions were bad he didn\u2019t care how late we were, just that we were safe. Sometimes he would tell me on random days to take a two hour lunch ( I was salary and didn\u2019t punch in or out). He was great!\nAnd he gave me so much free stuff. We used to call him Micheal Scott behind his back! \n\nUnfortunately... the owners were a bit stricter.. Myself and another coworker got fired and said boss got demoted. It was fun while it lasted.\n\nEdited to clarify: my boss did take our department and customers very seriously and was on top of the numbers. He just knew that happy, well taken care of employees are likely to produce more. We worked in a very stressful environment so when we were able to take it easy a bit, he let us and often recommended it so we\u2019d keep sane. Upper management were just slave drivers and hated that we laughed so much because they thought if you\u2019re having a good time at work, you obviously aren\u2019t being productive. I was very productive BECAUSE my boss took care of me and made it fun to come to work.",
            "My mom's boss was the head manager at an office job in suburbia, pretty similar number of employees and function to the Office in the show. He was in his late 40's at the time and invited himself to my mom's birthday party at our house one year. Basically was just my siblings and and a few family friends meeting up to play cornhole and chat for a couple hours. He showed up in pastel blue shorts, a pink polo, and flip flops with a case of Natural Light. He got hammered by like 9pm and started yelling at everyone. He saw a couple of our neighbors (younger guys) drinking next door and took the liberty to invite them over. Eventually he ended up in a wrestling match with one of the neighbors in the living room, which he finished by lifting the neighbor up in the air and body slamming him directly onto our coffee table. His final act of the evening was shitting his pants in the kitchen and passing out on the linoleum.",
            "While I never had a Michael Scott type boss, I did have a Ron Swanson type boss.\n\nHe was completely no nonsense and humourless and seemed like a real hardass at times. He spoke exclusively in abrupt, clipped sentences or downright abstained from speaking.\n\nOnce he left the store for the day, he was completely unreachable by phone or email, and any mail for him arrived at the store or at his P.O. box.\n\nThe store was in a strip mall and I'd regularly arrive at work to see him doing repairs to the entire structure, repaving or filling potholes in the parking lot.\n\nWhen the store was robbed and he was tied up by the criminals, he tried to stop them and was shot in the head. \n\nLuckily for him, it was a BB gun, unluckily for the robbers it made him angry.\n\nHe broke the chair he was tied to but also broke his collarbone doing so, body checked one of the guys through a display case and then bit the other guy until he dropped the gun and they ran away.\n\nHis name was Doug [lastnamewithheld], and he was the best boss I ever had.",

I had to work every weekend for months until I started playing along.",
            "Absolutely. Here are some gems from my previous boss:\n\n* He hired a private investigator to follow his \"#2\" around because he thought #2 was having sex with his wife.\n* Thought I was having sex with his wife at one point, and had #2 follow me, then confronted me when he found out I had hugged his wife. She was the manager at a fastfood place I worked before, and had gotten me the job at the plant. I was 18, she was 50 - she was a mother figure.\n* Loved to play this 'joke' where he firmly insists I'm not going to get paid because I forgot to clock in or out. He would wait until he had me absolutely convinced and threatening to quit before he laughed and said he was just foolin' to teach me a lesson.\n* Used to play-fire me for absolutely no reason other than his amusement.\n* Would tell me to clean my hands so people didn't think I was black, because they don't employ black people.\n* Even though computers are used everywhere now, he would still do all calculations by hand. It was a chemical plant, and he was calculating weights of ingredients using a 10-key calculator. He made mistakes often. And he would always always blame the mistake on the person making that batch.\n* I was a student, and he would threaten to fire me for missing work to take finals. He would lecture me on how if I wanted to be a successful man like him, I'd throw myself into my job and work my way up the ladder. I'm a first-gen college grad, and nearly quit school because of him. But I eventually just quit that job to go to school full-time, finished my BS, went on to grad school, and have been a prof at a pretty awesome school for 4 years now.\n* Would order six burgers from McD's and a salad for lunch, then eat the burgers in his car, and the salad in the office, telling everyone he was on a diet (dude was morbidly obese)\n\nWriting it all out, seems like it's all made up. I guess Michael Scott's character really isn't too far off from some of the craziness that makes its way up the ladder.",
            "The boss I had in this company wasn't like Michael Scott. He looked a lot like Homer Simpson, though. But the company itself was like Dunder Miffin. I watched The Office right before working in this company and thought \"No way this happens in the real world\", because so far I had worked in very professional places. But then these things happened:\n\n\n* general manager had a daughter who was a drug addict and so he hired her. It was company policy not to hire relatives. No, it wasn't his company.\n\n\n\n* said daughter liked to fool around with the truck drivers who stayed overnight to depart in the early morning. Fell in love with one who was married. He said he would leave his wife for her. Wife got pregnant. Daughter showed up to work drunk and trashed the office.\n\n\n\n* a sales employee accused the HR manager of having an affair with the general manager. Yells were yelled.\n\n\n\n* a woman once called and told me to connect her with the general manager. I asked her name and she said \"I'm his lover. He will know\". Thereafter the general manager called me to clarify that woman was NOT his lover.\n\n\n\n* daughter of the general manager liked to flirt with the sales representatives. But she was married. So she started flirting with them saying it was me. Using the company phone we shared. When I found out, I took the phone and showed it to my manager. He downplayed the whole thing. The messages were really explicit.\n\n\n\n* this same girl got pregnant from one of the production bosses (35 years her senior). He was married with 4 children. She was married with 2 children. They now live together with all their children plus one.\n\n\n\n* two workers were working on a ladder without helmets or any protection. One almost fell, the other one saved him but fell himself. Didn't die, but ended up with bad neurological damage (he fell head first). The one who had been saved hanged himself in the company two months later, out of guilt. Then the company bought helmets.\n\n\n\n* the father of the young man who hanged himself continued working exactly at the place where he found his son hanging.\n\n\n\n* a marketing worker once told me, right in front of the HR manager, that he would hop through my house's window at night and rape me. The HR manager giggled and said \"don't let him catch you\".\n\n\n\n* I once was violently yelled at for the disappearance of a cheque I hadn't even touched. Said cheque was found at the bottom of the general manager's daughter's desk drawer... Expired.\n\n\n\n* an elder man who was in negotiations with the marketing manager kept insisting in taking me to his  \"beach house\". When I complained to such manager about how inappropriate this was, he laughed and said \"that man can't even get it up\". \nI could go on, really. But you get the idea.\n\n\nI just remembered one that was hilarious. This company produced and sold GMO corn. There were too many corn sacks, so the company had a deposit somewhere in a field, about 15' from the office. When the annual (fiscal) audit came, my boss was worried he would have to take the auditors there. I asked \"is it because your tax declaration is not accurate?\" \"No, it's just it's infested with huge rats\" \"Why don't you take a few cats to get rid of them?\" \"We did... The rats killed the cat\". I later told one of the engineers \"the rat situation can't be that bad, can it\" and he laughed and laughed and walked away laughing.\n\n\nWait, I have one more. There was this lady who worked there, Karen haircut and attitude, did the bare minimum. She once got a kind of herpes around her eye and instead of taking it to a real doctor, she went to a natural healer. Thereupon the herpes was scrubbed with a live frog. Yes, you read that right.\n\n\n(I'm adding this here because it got lost in the comments) there was a gorgeous Japanese bush right outside the window. I wanted to know its name, so I asked one of the agronomic engineers what it was. With a straight face, he said \"that's an ivy\". I said \"that's literally a bush\". He went bright red and answered \"good. I was testing you\", and left.",

Once, he bought a mini basketball net which he installed in the staff room. He was so excited about it that he pretended that the tooth of his next patient miraculously repaired by itself so he sent her home and had an hour free to play alone in between the table and our bags...\n- he hired a company who would manage his staff to develop strategies do make more money (basically), but every time they would come over, he would spend the entire meeting interrupting them and saying how good he was (he was the worst) and how he knew better then these guys (he didn\u2019t).\n- Still as an exercice for that management company, everybody in the team had to take a test telling us about our personality (leader, sociable, intellectual, etc). He was so upset that my reasults were his ideal that he took the test over and over, changing his answers, until his leader category was high enough as our boss...\n\nI worked there 4 years, I have plenty of stories... I used to call him Michael Scott... seriously it was the same...",

            "Mine was less entertaining than Michael, but we often compared him for the following examples:\n\n* only hired people he would \"have a beer with\"\n* grossly under qualified to manage, but he was good at sales so got promoted\n* made really awkward, distasteful jokes/comments (e.g. asked an employee if he and his twin brother \"shared\" a girlfriend)\n* just really wasteful, pointless meetings\n* nobody knew how he spent his days, his assistant manager did all the heavy lifting and he would wander around making conversations\n* literally showed up to a meeting with his superiors having done 0 preparation and they kicked him out of the meeting\n\nHe actually got fired for calling COVID \"kung flu\" to a Chinese employee back in March... I think that would have to be the craziest. He had worked there for 8 years but had so many notes on his file, this was just the one that pushed it over the edge.",
            "I had a boss and I am not kidding it was like he watched The Office and took it for a real documentary and applied Michael Scotts management lessons accordingly. Not the craziest, but the best example of a daily interaction with him:\n\n\n\nHe decided that the reason we were struggling to keep to time frames, is because our checklist was not right. However he has no experience in our field of work, so he did not know what was actually needed (the real issue was severe understaffing). But he got it in his head and there was no talking him out of it.\n\n\n\nSo I redid the checklist to have the same layout, I just changed the order of the items. He didn't actually realise I changed the order, he just took one look and decided that nope, its not right.\n\n\n\nSo I went back to the original version *and put the check boxes on the left instead of the right*. Literally all I did. \n\n\n\nApparently it was perfect and we would see an improvement in our time frames because of his idea to 'fix' the checklist.\n\n\nSIGH",

I kept record. He complained to HR that we weren\u2019t having the meetings he wasn\u2019t showing up to. \n\nHe told me that the woman who was stuck on a project with him could receive a form of gratis up to $500. She chose a PlayStation (obvi) and then when I was called on my company purchase, he wouldn\u2019t say that he specifically allowed the transaction and attempted to get me fired because he was tired of me always calling him on his shit.\n\nI handled his wife\u2019s resume and application to the DMV, his mortgage papers, his insurance papers, his whole family\u2019s passports; all things that went beyond my position\u2019s scope.

Turns out the protection he got while his brother was CIO disappeared as soon as brother left the company. \n\nHe transferred out of IT and became engineering\u2019s problem before I left the company. \n\nAlso. At a company Christmas party he bet the department that we couldn\u2019t climb the rock wall faster than him. He ended up severely spraining his ankle and withholding the $100.\n\nAlso.

            "He wasnt really like Michael Scott, but he definitely believed he had a great handle on every aspect of the store.

I had a regular, real nice preacher, who would come in a couple times a month to print out little event flyers. He always had a print-ready image, wanted x amount of quarter sheet flyers (cut) and x amount of full sheet. So of course I'd pull up MS publisher, print, cut, and get him out the door in just a few minutes.\n\nOne day I was going on my lunch break, and as I'm walking out I see him walking in.

He said \"thank God you're back i really need to get going and he doesn't know what the hell he's doing.\"\n\nI get to the computer and there he is with the image in photoshop with a sheet size canvas trying to precisely shift 4 copies of the image into place with guides on. And honestly, you can totally do that even though it takes a little longer, so I'm not sure what issues he was having.

He was a genuinely nice person, but was totally obnoxious to everyone around him -- he had no squelch. Whatever thought came into his head came out of his mouth. This was in the days when you could smoke in your office and he went through several packs a day. Meetings in her office we hellish.\n\nAt one point we had to travel to a branch location together. The company leased 2-bedroom apartment in the branch town for HQ employees. This meant that during the 1 week trip Art and I would literally be spending 24 hours a day together. As I was getting mentally prepared for the trip I took solace in the fact that at least we would sit separately on the 3 hour plane flight - because you could smoke on the plane then, too and Art was sure to be lighting up every 10 minutes.\n\nAs we got to the gate I said \"I'll see you when we land.\"\n\n\"Oh, we're sitting together,\" said Art.\n\n\"Art, I can't sit in smoking for a 3 hour flight.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't smoke on the plane.

Usually once a month there would be 4-5 of these meetings in a week. It was simple. The report came on a standard form, fill out the header, check some boxes, write a summary, bring it to boss for signature.\n\nJust one problem, there was this 3-day window where any party to the meeting could write a formal appeal about the decision, which I literally never saw happen. \n\nBoss couldn\u2019t make up his mind whether he wanted the after action reports dated for the date of the meeting or for 3 days later when the formal appeal window was over. \n\nSo one day I bring him a stack of them, each in an individual folder, and go on about my business. 15 minutes later I get called back and he\u2019s waiting, in his chair, with the stack of reports, and he begins with \u201cI don\u2019t know how many times I have to tell you how I want these...\u201d and proceeds to spend the next minute or so berating next for being unable to get a date right while he *opens each folder, takes the report out, drops it on the ground, and then frisbees the empty folder at my chest*.\n\nAt the conclusion of his tirade, he goes \u201cnow pick this shit up and get out of my office.\u201d",

So any time the customers would ask us to do something impossible or that would actively hurt them he would leave me to defend our companies stance. If the network team had any push back he would jump on and defend them and act as the point of contact he was supposed to be. He also didn't understand a lot of what I did so his measurement of if I was doing a good job was if I was at my desk.

Long time. I've been taking medication for many many years for it. My blood pressure is actually been better in the past few years since the switch, but I do you know and understand the consequences of salt. I hardly ever use salt with anything else really.\nMy massive weight actually came as a result of medications over a decade ago. Had been constantly battling to lose the weight, and in recent years actually kind of gave up. And that's when the weight started coming off. I drink a minimum of a gallon of water a day but usually twice that. Most of my diet it's liquid because I'm extremely thirsty person(yes I know that a warning for diabetes, doc keeps looking but I'm safe). Oddly enough, the weight started to finally come off when I got on a regular regimen of medical marijuana. I think it rebooted my metabolism.\n\nAs for the pickle enthusiasts and pickle lovers...\nMy grocery store favorite is zesty Dill. Every year my mother makes usually a solid 20 dozen jars of pickles and I claim about half of them. A lot of the ones I claim, I add pepper flakes and some garlic. I usually eat one jar in one sitting, and try to set my my max at two jars a week for staying sodium conscious. I try to only get potato chips, as re su of these choices, when it's a special occasion with guests.\n\nThanks everyone.

I could tell the officer was getting a little impatient, but he was nicely telling me to be a little aggressive.  Suddenly at the hospital across from us, someone pushed out a screen from a window on the third floor (psych ward).  A women jumped out the window onto a garage roof underneath, then jumped to the ground and ran across the road right by us.  \n\nThe officer had me turn around (I was in my mom's car) and chase the girl in the neighborhood.  When I would pull up to a stop sign during the chase, he would say \"GO GO GO, JUST GO THROUGH IT\".  After awhile, when she started to get away, he gave up with me being the \"chase driver\" and told me to head back to the DMV office.  I was a complete shaking mess at this point - ready to accept the fact I would not get a license anytime soon (devastating for a sixteen year old boy).  He grabbed my score sheet.  Said \"You passed.\"   And handed it to me.  I got an 88 score.  He ran to his HW patrol car and tore off to continue the chase. \n\nI go in the office a complete mess.  My Mom was already really nervous because we were gone so long, then she saw me looking like a ghost.  She said \"WHAT HAPPENED\".  Told her I passed, then told her the story on the way home.

His contacts wanted to setup an exclusive import agreement for their electronics to North America, but my great grandfather declined, because how many of these radios could you possibly sell?\n\nTurns out that was a short sighted business decision, because that company was called Sony Electronics.

            "I bought a guitar amp from Brad Whitford, of Aerosmith, when I was 17. He and Steven Tyler served up cheeseburgers for me and my friends.\n\nEdit: as requested:\n\n\nSo, Brad\u2019s son was a punk and I knew him from the scene. I was in a band that had some small local marginal success. This is 97/98 in Boston. I needed a new amp for our first US tour but had very little money. I was getting drunk with his son and, on a whim, I asked him if his dad had any amps laying around that he didn\u2019t need. We laughed and carried on partying. \n\nThe next day, I get a call at my home. It was Mr. Whitford himself. He was super nice but to the point. \u201cMy son says you got a band and need a good rig for your les Paul. I have something in mind for you. Just gotta have my guy get it from the warehouse. Come by my house in Norwell this weekend and check it out\u201d. That was the gist of the call. Obviously, the whole band came with me. And our roadie. \n\nWe get to his house and it\u2019s totally him. So weird. These guys were like gods in Boston. I wasn\u2019t the hugest fan but knew him from his work with Wayne\u2019s World. He takes me to (one of) his garage(s) where there is this cool full stack. The brand is Bedrock. An old company from New Hampshire that made good quality amps in the 80\u2019s. This one was custom made for Brad. Basically Marshall components. 4 tubes. All the knobs go to 11. Not kidding. Still has the \u201cproperty of Aerosmith\u201d stickers on it. He plugs it in and rips a crazy solo on his les Paul and then hands it to me and I play a couple power chords. He asks for $300 for the whole thing. I pay him and he tells his son to give us a tour of the house. \n\nThis is where shit gets nuts. It\u2019s just like you expect. Tons of gold records, platinum records...Pictures of him with people like John Lennon, Robert DeNiro and Joey Ramone. Then we get to see his studio and THE LARGEST COLLECTION OF MARSHALL AMPS IN THE WORLD. Seriously, like 200 cabs. A wall of guitars. Guitars so pretty and amps so cool, it made sense for him to find the one he sold me dispensable. \n\nAfter the house tour, he told us to meet him at the little bar and grill they own in town. When we get there early and he arrives 30 mins later with muthafuckin Steven Tyler in tow. \u201cYou guys the punk group?!\u201d He was so nice. They went in the back and came out with burgers for us all on the house. Then they straight up left. Irish goodbyed, even! I still have the amp. I used it on the road for almost 10 years in five bands. Now, it\u2019s just a conversation piece. But it still works!

Basically the gas has to escape somehow, and so it would pass through the vocal cords in the throat. This creates the low \u201cmoan\u201d that makes the body sound as if it was in pain. The people back then had no idea what was happening and random bodies would just start \u201cmoaning\u201d in pain. And thus they believed that the bodies were rising from the dead. And when stabbed, the gas escaped otherwise. Thus leading to the belief that the only way to stop a vampire was to stab a dead body in the chest. This also led to a lot of strange burials, I.e the man that was buried in a stone wall to prevent him from rising from the dead.\n\nI can\u2019t really blame them.

            "People don't take their antimalarial drugs when they travel because they hear bad stories about the side effects and they see native people in the areas living OK without taking pills every day. The truth is, populations native to malaria-endemic areas have all passed through pretty intense natural selection for survival and have a host of genes that prevent them from dying or suffering the other worst effects.

I wouldn't support him financially in any way and I wouldn't watch anything he makes at this point. I think it was Aziz Ansari who had an interesting bit asking the audience who still listens to R Kelly (not a lot of hands), then later in the set asked who still listens to Michael Jackson (lots of hands and cheers).

            "Try to be Jeff's friend.  \n\nJeff was a really big deal in middle school. We went to different elementary schools so I never even heard of him prior to middle school but as soon as I got to middle school his name was going around the school a lot and it became clear he was a big deal. Jeff was the toughest guy in our grade, the most athletic, the best looking, and the coolest according to both the guys and the girls. The guys wanted to be his friend and if they weren't then they were wary of him because of how tough he was and he gave off that vibe that he wasn't someone to make angry. All the girls loved him and he was making out with girls and going out with them all the time. He even went out with at least two girls a year ahead of us in school and one of them was the most popular girl in her grade. This was basically unheard of but he did it. \n\nHe was in my class in the 6th grade and it became pretty clear that despite his coolness, toughness, and ability with the girls at a young age, Jeff had some problems and couldn't control himself that well. He would act out in funny ways by causing mischief and trouble but he would also act out in less funny-yet-troubling ways by doing things like smoking cigarettes on school grounds with other troubled kids and he would occasionally get physical with any guy dumb enough to piss him off. Because of this, he got detentions and suspensions. \n\nThat year our class had a field trip to some place that I don't remember but I do remember the bus ride to and from the trip. Jeff and I were on the same bus and for some reason still unknown to me he decided to sit next to me. On the way there he was talking to me about different things and since I thought he was a bully and tough and I was afraid of him I just was nice and would listen and then follow up with questions and try to interact with him and he seemed to be cool with that. Then at some point he started talking about his home life and his dad and he said that his dad would hit him upside the head. When he told me this he had his eyes averted and sort of looking down and he said it kind of like it was a joke but I could tell that he was upset by it and was trying to play it off cool and by acting like it wasn't some big deal. On the bus ride back to school we stopped at some place and there were these vending machines that some kids were getting snacks out of. I went to get myself a snack and a drink and I got my drink but something happened when I tried to get my snack. I can't remember what it was exactly. It may have been that I thought I had more money than I did and when I went to get my snack I came up short for money, or it could have been that the machine ate my money. Whatever happened, I couldn't get my snack and I was upset because I was pretty hungry. Without asking him or saying anything, Jeff just stepped in front of me and said \"I got you\" and put a dollar in the machine for me so I could get my snack. Then we sat next to each other on the way back to school after that. \n\nAt some point during that year we had a substitute teacher for our class and some kids were acting out and I was laughing because it was funny. Our substitute was a middle-aged woman and she was not happy at all. She was yelling at us to shut up and knock it off and she physically grabbed me by the shoulders and then started pushing me downward into my chair and desk and I was frightened by it. I was scared and didn't know what to do and she was hurting me. When class ended Jeff grabbed me by the arm and said \"Come on we're going to the office\" and he basically pushed me and pulled me down the hallway to the principal's office. I wasn't going to say no to the guy in a million years because I was afraid of him. We get to the office and he does all the talking and tells the principal what happened while I just sit there in silence, nodding each time that the principal asks me if what Jeff is saying is true. See, the principal had and would go on to have numerous run-ins and issues with Jeff because Jeff could not behave and kept getting into trouble way too often. The principal was wary of him and didn't trust him much and I suppose he had good reason not to. However, I still remember the concerned look on his face when Jeff was telling him what happened. When Jeff was done talking we left the office and the principal said he'll look into the incident and that's all I remember. I figured that Jeff was just using me to act out and cause trouble or give the principal a headache in having to deal with him yet again. I was too afraid of Jeff to say to him that I didn't want to go to the office so what happened happened and that was that. \n\nJeff was expelled from school early in the 8th grade. Word spread around the school quickly because the kid was such a big deal. I don't remember why he got kicked out exactly or what the final straw was. He basically disappeared in 2003 and I never saw him again...or so I thought.\n\nHe was off my radar for years and I had heard that he got kicked out of his second school after he got kicked out of ours and then in high school he got kicked out of a catholic school and then wound up at a pretty crappy public school. I didn't know at the time whether he even finished high school or not. \n\nIn the fall of 2007 I was a senior in high school and I was hanging around at a friend's house after a party ended on the weekend. Seemingly out of nowhere, Jeff shows up with a guy I used to be friends with in earlier years. I hadn't seen Jeff since 2003. He was still big, looked about 6 foot 3, and still had that kind of socially and physically dominant way about him. He was joking around with the guy he came with and he playfully pushed him on the shoulder after making a joke and the guy almost lost his balance and fell over. Jeff just couldn't help it. Being the alpha male and dominant is how he always was. I was sitting on the couch with my friend and the guy who hosted the party and then the guy who almost got pushed over smiled at Jeff a bit and said \"You remember [insert my name here]?\" and Jeff stared at me for a few seconds. I definitely didn't look exactly like I did in middle school but he stepped closer to me and looked me in the eyes and put his hand out to shake my hand but didn't say anything to me. Then he went back to drinking the beer he had and joking around. That's the last time I saw him before he died.\n\nJeff died a few years ago, I think from a drug overdose, heroin probably. He was 27. I determined that at some point his father, who was abusive and likely violent with him when he was a kid, left the family, likely when Jeff was about 15 or 16. It looked like Jeff and his mom and little sister had to leave our town and they wound up in a crummier, more rundown area. He fell into the druggie crowd in later years after he was kicked out of middle school and I suppose this shouldn't have been surprising because his older brother overdosed on heroin and died when me and Jeff were in the 7th grade. I remember that going around the school at the time and people talking about it in whispers. \n\nIt took me until I was 30 years-old to put my brief-yet-meaningful moments with Jeff together. I went my whole life thinking that he was the school bully and I was afraid of him yet I realized eventually that I never saw him bully anyone and that he never bullied me. I remembered our time on the bus together and our trip to the office but I couldn't connect the dots at the time. Now I realize that on the bus, Jeff was grateful that I listened to him talk about his dad hitting him and because I was nice and good to him, when I needed help at the vending machines he had my back, no questions asked. When our substitute teacher did what she did to me, I later realized that this happened after the bus trip and vending machines day. Because I was nice and good to him, when he saw what the teacher did to me he didn't decide to use me as a way to act out and start trouble - he was just trying to help me because he apparently cared and was concerned. When I saw him after that party was over in high school, he truly did remember me and he remembered those moments we had together where we had each other's backs in the 6th grade. He could have just said \"What's up\" when the other guy asked him if he remembered me, but instead of that he moved towards me and shook my hand because even after years of having nothing to do with each other, those 6th grade memories came back to him that night but not to me at the time. At 30, I put it all together.\n\nI'm truly sad that he's gone and when we were kids I would have never thought that I would say that about him, feel that way about him, or that he would die young. The guy was the biggest deal and the last person I would have thought wouldn't make it in life but sadly his demons and troubles took him away. Once I understood Jeff, I began thinking of him as a legend of my childhood. Recently I realized that calling Jeff a legend -- while accurate and true -- doesn't truly explain and express what he means to me. In a life filled with much hurt and pain doled out to me by the people whom I used to call friends and family, as well as abuse dished out by others out there, Jeff is one of the only people whose friendship, goodness, and memory is not tainted by time and by how people eventually began to treat me over time. All that he ever was was good to me, respectful, kind, decent, caring, supportive, fearless, empathetic, friendly, and true. He was never anything bad to me for as long as I knew him and he's the best friend that I never had. That's why calling him a legend doesn't quite express what he is to me all these years later. He's not a legend; he's my hero.",

They just go outright capture the bride, force her into marriage, and unless the bride manages to break out before they rape her (yes, rape. Or gangrape in many case.), she is screwed because once they rape her, she is viewed as belonging to them.

            "Muslim woman here\n\n1. I've seen a lot people say 'just write a note in your passport'.  First of all , it's usually the father carrying that daughter's passport and she probably never touched it. \n\n2. Pulling or talking to the authorities in front of your parents can be a very intimidating experience in forced situations like these , you'd much rather be pulled in by authorities and given space to talk to them without your parents staring daggers at you.\n\n3. If you want to find people who did it or something similar , r/exmuslims is a great place for it since I know quite a lot who had to escape abusive Muslim families and arrangements , I remember a lot of women posting their experiences or seeking help , a rl friend included. \n\n4.  Most women will not try to escape or seek authority , because that will mean : \na) The very real potential of an honor killing , something the authority might not be able to protect you from(a family that does forced marriage is more than likely to be willing to practice that , or punish/beat you) \n\nb) having to cut ties with parents and be forever shamed by them , this can take a real emotional toll on a Muslim woman where they're told they can't go to heaven without parent's acceptance. \n\nWhat a lot of people don't understand is that a lot of these women can get up and leave especially if they're in the west , but their values and ideologies and their love for parents can hold them back from seeking freedom. Also the idea of being on your own and not having family. \n\n\nAnyways , I know a Muslim gay who escaped to the US and was actually beaten up by family members who travelled there just to beat him and drag him back. I know a friend who was forced to marry and even when she did not want it , it was psychological. Her parents would tell her he's the best option she'll ever get , that she'll end up alone , that her uni major is useless and she's better off married , they really do try to bring the girl down so she can't fight or even if she does , make her feel entrapped or that she has to do this , or else that she would be useless or a shame to the family (I already promised you to him!) . I know not only Muslims practice this but as far as I know , escaping a Muslim family is very hard and mentally draining especially as a female , that most females will not attempt it. \n\nEdit : it's r/exmuslim and thanks so much for the gold ! \n\nEdit 2 : I'm sorry if it seems like I'm attacking Islam , it just came from a very personal place and I'm not generalizing anyone. Obviously the majority of Muslims are not like that , but I won't say it's rare for these things to happen. ",

That's why I took and oath on my self to let my daughter do what she wants and be with who she wants. \n\nEven at this young age other parents as joke telling me they want her for their son and in straight declining them.

You keep doing what you're doing , you're an awesome human being and I love you.\n\nTo those of you out there who have had similar experiences to this , and to those of you who like me have experienced way worse, I feel you.

            "When I was in high school, I entered a book quiz and one of the books I chose was *Demon Thief* by Darren Shan. During the quiz, I was asked what was the main characteristic of the demonata summoned by the punk during the concert. I said it had three heads. Wrong. The answer was that it had a dyed mohawk. Except it was the punk that summoned it that had the mohawk, not the damned demonata! I lost a point because the question-setter could either not read, not write, or couldn't remember the book correctly.",

I will handle it\" \n\nMy boyfriend at this time wouldn\u00b4t let me drive it any further because he was concerend for my safety, so he (boyfriend) had a mechanic look at it. \n\nThe mechanic told me that if I would have come sooner, it would have been a 50\u20ac bill to take care of it, but over time the brake got more and more damaged and by then it would have been over 800\u20ac for the repair. \n\nWhen I told my dad he just said that there is no way that he would spend so much money on a car that had maybe 500\u20ac value left. \n\nI ended up selling the car for scrap value. \n\nThat was 10 years ago and I still bring it up to my dad sometimes.

            "I've mentioned this before, but when I was about eight or nine, we had a big project in school which ended with us writing a story. I spent fuckin' *hours* on this thing. It was going to be the best book ever. It was only a matter of time before it was snapped up by some publisher and then it would be the talk of the Scholastic Book Fair, no doubt in my mind. It absolutely had to be in by the time school finished for Christmas, so my teacher could mark it over the break, so I stayed up until about ten o'clock at night for about a week beforehand working on it -- which, you know, is the closest thing you get to an all-nighter when you're about nine. It was my Magnum Opus.\n\nI got back to school in January to find that a) she had lost it, b) she was accusing me of not handing it in, and c) because mine was the only one she couldn't find, she decided to call me out in front of the class about it. I ended up locking myself in the toilet because I was crying so much. Worst still, it later transpired that when it 'turned up after all', she marked it as though it was handed in late, and the bitch still only gave me a middling grade.\n\nFuck you, Mrs. Harding.",

            "Had a friend in college borrow my truck when I flew home for a month 1500 miles away. He agreed to the terms of \u201cdon\u2019t cross state lines, you only drive it to work and back, and if I find out you did otherwise it\u2019s going to be a big deal.\u201d I wasn\u2019t home a week and I got a call from our group of friends, he had taken the truck down to Connecticut, drove drunk, road raged at someone on the highway and love tapped the back end of a car. The kicker was he backed into his buddy\u2019s dads brand new Lexus and caused $3000 worth of damage. Needless to say I flew home the next day. When confronted about it he basically said \u201cI don\u2019t have the money, it\u2019s your problem\u201d so I have my mother, the insurance company, and the Lexus guy\u2019s dad all climbing down my throat to get me to fix the problem. The dad with the Lexus called me to say he was going to file a police report if I didn\u2019t pay, my mother was screaming about the insurance company dropping me. I went to school for the day, got back and he vanished. Cleaned out a bunch of shit from the apartment. Stole everybody\u2019s things. The one thing that still makes my blood boil is the fact that one of my good friends that lived with us will vehemently back up the shitbag anytime it\u2019s brought up. I understand that he didn\u2019t screw him over, but just denying it and saying that I need to let bygones be bygones is something I cannot do.\n\nEdit:\n\nOh.\n\nMy.\n\nSweet.\n\nLord.\n\nThis is genuinely the first thing I\u2019ve ever posted that blew up this much. To clarify some stuff up,\n\nThe reason I said my mom was pissed is because she had warned me. And told me. And told me. Never let anyone drive your truck. For a day or two we didn\u2019t talk but once all the stuff blew over she wasn\u2019t mad. I was only 19 at the time and she chalked it up to a life lesson learned. \n\nI called the insurance agency before I flew home, told them what had happened. Didn\u2019t fib. I called the worthless dirtbag that took my truck and told him that if my truck wasn\u2019t in front of my apartment I was going to report it as stolen, at this point I wish I would\u2019ve. The phonecall lasted about 15 minutes and consisted of me screaming at him. I\u2019ve never been one to have any form of anger issues but I genuinely don\u2019t remember anything past the first 3 minutes. Rage blackout is the what it felt like. \n\nWhen I landed and got to my apartment my truck was there and we had the conversation that resulted in \u201cyeah I can\u2019t pay it I\u2019m broke\u201d I had one of my friends there that picked me up from the airport. He held me back. The next day when I got back from school he had jumped the state line with all of his belonging from the apartment, along with some of my stuff. \n\nA couple days after that the insurance agency called and they asked for the full story again. I told them, and they asked for the guys name and address. I gave them all the information I had and that was all I heard from them. Never got a bill, and my rates never went up. \n\nThe Guy who\u2019s dad owned the Lexus got ahold of me to tell me his dad was going to file a police report if I didn\u2019t pay up or if I didn\u2019t give him my insurance info. I told him the insurance company already knows and I said if that he\u2019s going to go after anyone, to go after the dirtbag. Gave him the guys info, and never heard another thing about it from them.\n\nAfter that transpired the shitbag jumped state lines again. Not sure where he went but he did try and reach out to me and I promptly told him to fuck himself, and to never get ahold of me again.\n\nThe friend that tried to back him up when I was pissed about the whole ordeal finally cut the worthless fucker out of his life when some of our other friends came forward about some of the stuff he did with my truck (drinking and hit and run) and he finally sided with me. I didn\u2019t talk to him for a while afterwards but we eventually did make up.",
            "In elementary school, there was a pencil machine in the front lobby where you could get pencils for 25 cents. There were also \"special\" pencils that had stars on them. If you got one of these special pencils, you could take it into the office and get a prize.\n\nOne day, I decided to get a pencil. I put in my quarter and out popped TWO pencils. And one of them was a special pencil! I went into the office and told the lady at the desk that the machine gave me two pencils and one of them was special. She proceeded to say that the machine shouldn't do that, took the special pencil, and didn't give me a prize. That was 19 years ago and I'm still pissed.\n\n\\*Edit to answer some of the more common questions:\n\n* The prizes were stuff like the fancy erasers that didn't actually erase anything, fun size candy bars, stuff like that. Think 5-10 tickets at Chuck E Cheese's.\n* I probably didn't go to school with you. This happened in Michigan. Apparently the pencil machines are a common thing.\n* This happened in either 2nd or 3rd grade, so the time was probably closer to 20-21 years ago (Fuck, that makes me feel old...)\n* The main lesson I learned was to withhold irrelevant information and lie if I know the truth might negatively affect me.

He ignored emails, told me he was too busy to talk when I grabbed him in class....just would not talk about the project at all.

Talk about property rights in the same time period as him. \n\nThe day of the presentation comes and he goes first. Does this big long thing about Japanese women that covered everything BUT property or legal rights or anything. All it was was about their makeup and clothing and how cool they were. Because I had no clue what he was doing all I could do was generalize that for most of history women had no property rights, were not considered people under any law which essentially made them property themselves, etc.\n\nAbout 3 minutes into my half of the presentation the professor stands up and tells me to stop, then tells the class I am wrong, I don't know anything, my presentation is horrible, don't listen and erase any notes they took from my half so far. She then berated me for not working with my partner to find middle ground and make sure my topic complimented his and publicly failed me in front of the whole class and told me to go sit down. \n\nI was in tears. I had tried so hard and talked to her so many times about his refusal to even discuss the topic. I left the class and never went back to it. I did go to the history department head and complained. I wasn't allowed to re-present the alternate assignment I had created, but he did make her give me a passing grade and I did the final exam and managed to just squeak by. She was never disciplined, nothing. \n\nI will never forget the feeling of being put down and humiliated by my professor after bringing my concerns to her and having them dismissed.",

            "I\u2019ve got one: \n\nThis reminds me of the man who was driving down the road and his car breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, \"My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?\" The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, and even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. \n\nThe Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night; he tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, \"We can't tell you. You're not a monk.\" Distraught, the man is forced to leave. Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again. The monks reply, \"We can't tell you. You're not a monk.\u201d The man says, \"If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.\" The monks reply, \"You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.\" \n\nThe man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.\" In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.\"\n\nThe monks reply, \"Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.\" The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, \"The sound is beyond that door.\" The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond. Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, \"This is the last key to the last door.\" The man is apprehensive; his life's wish is behind that door! With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......But, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.",

There's no way that could happen. \"No, its true,\" the first man says. \"Let me prove it to you.\" He gets up from the bar, jumps over the balcony, and plummets toward the street below. As he nears the 10th floor, the high winds whip him around the building and back into the 10th floor window and he takes the elevator back up to the bar.\n\nHe meets the second man, who looks quite astonished. \"You know, I saw that with my own eyes, but that must have been a one time fluke.\" \"No, I'll prove it again,\" says the first man as he jumps again. Just as he is hurtling toward the street, the 10th floor wind gently carries him around the building and into the window. Once upstairs he urges his fellow drinker to try it.\n\n\"Well, why not.\" the second guy says, \"It works. I'll try it.\" He jumps over the balcony, plunges downward passes the 11th, 10th 9th, 8th, floors. . . . . and hits the sidewalk with a SPLAT.\n\nBack upstairs the bartender turns to the other drinker and says, \"You know Superman, you're a real jerk when you're drunk\".",

It was cold now, with winter approaching and the paint needing another coat soon. The Father went to the next boy, \"Did you push the outhouse into the Yangtze River?\".

            "This one is a long one, but one of my all-time favorites and a classic:\n\n*A businessman is getting ready to go on a long business trip. He knows his wife is always horny, so he decides to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn\u2019t much like the idea of her screwing someone else.*\n\n*So he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation, to the old man.*\n\n*\u201cWell, I don\u2019t really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don\u2019t know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except a\u201d said the old man, and then he stopped.*\n\n*\u201cExcept what?\u201d asked the businessman.*\n\n*\u201cNothing, nothing,\u201d said the old man.*\n\n*\u201cC\u2019mon, tell me! I need something!\u201d protested the businessman.\u201cWell, sir, I don\u2019t usually mention this, but there is the \u2018voodoo dildo,\u2019\u201d the old man said.*\n\n*\u201cThe voodoo dildo?\u201d the businessman asked.*\n\n*The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols. He opened it, and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and said, \u201cBig fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!\u201d*\n\n*The old man said, \u201cBut you haven\u2019t seen what it\u2019ll do yet.\u201d*\n\n*He pointed to a door and said \u201cVoodoo dildo, the door.\u201d*\n\n*The voodoo dildo rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said, \u201cVoodoo dildo, box!\u201d*\n\n*The voodoo dildo stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, motionless.*\n\n*The businessman said, \u201cI\u2019ll take it!\u201d*\n\n*The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say, \u201cVoodoo dildo, my pussy.\u201d*\n\n*He left for his trip satisfied things would be fine while he was gone.*\n\n*After he\u2019d been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dildo. She lay down, placed the box between her legs, and said \u201cVoodoo dildo, my pussy!\u201d The voodoo dildo shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she\u2019d ever experienced before.*\n\n*After three orgasms, she decided she\u2019d had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgot to tell her how to shut it off! So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she\u2019d had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn\u2019t been drinking, but that a voodoo dildo was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn\u2019t stop screwing her.*\n\n*The officer looked at her for a second, and then said, \u201cYeah, right.

Third Task: There is a 70-year-old woman in the upstairs loft who is still a virgin, you have to change that.\"\n\nThe man is mortified and says with a disgusted face, \"Augh, fuck no!\" The bartender just smiles and replies, \"That's fine, but your money stays in the jar.\" The man grumbles a bit but orders his drinks and takes a seat at a table.\n\n. . .\n\nA couple hours later he walks up to the bar, now completely smashed. \"Arrite, gimme duh peppa Gin!\" he says.

Within seconds of the door closing a cacophony erupts; barking, shouting, crashing, yelping, and wining. After about a minute of absolute chaos-abrupt silence! There are hushed murmurs among the other patrons, concerned glances exchanged, and a thick air. After about 30 seconds the door opens and the man stumbles back inside. His clothes are ripped, he's bleeding, bruised, dirty, but he has a proud smile on his face as he raises his hand high and says in a loud, triumphant voice:\n\n>!Alright!

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but one person had died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air \u2013 but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.\n\nWell, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room \u2013 and the man was once again unharmed.\n\nWell, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.

            "U.S. Armed Services recruiting efforts are slipping. They've advertised, offered college money, granted large bonuses to new recruits... all to no avail.\n\nSo, the Joint Chiefs of Staff all get together one day at a tavern in Washington D.C. to brainstorm a solution. After many hours of back and forth conversation, they finally settle on their solution:\n\nThe Department of Defense will finance a Netflix special where the most decorated member of each service is called to the filming location for a little contest. Each member will be awarded $1,000 for every centimeter between body parts, and they can choose which body parts.\n\nThe day of the filming is here. The judges and the official Measuring-tape Private First Class stand in front of the highest decorated Air Force member, a Captain. The Air Force Captain sticks his hands out to each side, with flat palms facing downward. The Measuring-tape Private First Class stretches the measuring tape from middle finger-tip to middle finger-tip. The length is recorded as 154 cm and the Captain quickly receives a check for $154,000 along with several \"Thank you for your service\" handshakes.\n\nThe Navy is next; a Rear Admiral this time. He decides to stick his arm straight up in the air and measure from his toe to his raised hand. The Measuring-tape Private First Class stretches out the measuring tape and records 182 cm. The Admiral then receives a check for $182,000.\n\nIt's now Army's turn. The highest decorated soldier is a Sergeant Major, of equal height to the Admiral. The Sergeant Major chooses the same measurement as the sailor before him, but instead of standing with his arm straight up in the air, he strikes a pose that resembles John Travolta's signature move in Saturday Night Fever. He manages to lump on an extra 13 cm, resulting in a check for $195,000.\n\nAAAAND finally... It's the Marine Corps' turn. The branch's highest decorated Marine is a crusty, salty dog of a Gunnery Sergeant at least a foot taller than the other servicemen. With a face resembling an English bulldog, the Gunny says loud and clear, \"From the tip of my dick, to my balls.\"\n\nEveryone laughs, the Joint Chiefs make fun of the Devil Dog, claiming that \"Even if he has a huge Johnson, he'll still get less money. What a crayon-eating dumbass!\" The host asks the Marine if he might consider changing his mind... but the Gunny sticks to his selection.\n\nSo, the Marine drops his trousers and the Measuring-tape Private First Class kneels down to measure. But he doesn't move. The Marine confidently asks, \"What's the matter, Private? Forget how to read numbers?\"\n\n\"No, Gunny. But...... where... are your balls?\" replies the confused Measuring-tape Private First Class.\n\nWithout missing a beat, the Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant says, \"Oh, about 20 miles south of Baghdad, give or take.\"",

            "In a small village in Egypt lived two orphan boys, Set and Amenhotep. They always watched out for each other, well past their years of childhood and into their time as young adults.\n\nOne day, the two were walking outside the village when they saw a crocodile trapped in a poacher\u2019s snare. The two young men, sympathetic to a creature in need, approached the crocodile and released it from the trap.\n\nOnce freed, the crocodile transformed into a wispy, glowing fairy! \u201cThank you, young men\u201d said the fairy, \u201cYour hearts are truly selfless, and I will grant each of you one wish. What are your names?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is my friend Set, and you can call me \u2018Ep\u2019\u201d, said Amenhotep.\n\n\u201cVery well, Ep\u201d said the fairy \u201cWhat is the desire of your heart?\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I was the strongest man in the world!\u201d Amenhotep wished. \n\n\u201cVery well\u201d, said the fairy, \u201cbut you must always use your strength to help others.\u201d Smoke gathered around Amenhotep, and when the smoke cleared Ep was 7 foot six and rippling with muscles. \n\nThe fairy turned to Set \u201cAnd what is your wish, Set?\u201d Set responded \u201cI never want to be poor again! I wish for money!\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said the fairy. Smoke gathered in front of the two of them, and when the smoke cleared a small elf remained, bowing to the two boys. \u201cGreetings, sirs! My name is Elmon, and I am here to serve!\u201d\n\n\u201cElmon is an expert in all things money,\u201d said the fairy, \u201cHe will help you make wise decisions and turn any business profitable, but will only help you so long as he is only asked to do good for your fellow man.\u201d\n\nAmenhotep and Set were inseparable. True to his word, Amenhotep used his great strength to build many houses for people in need. Set helped, as well, but his comparatively small size next to the now massive Amenhotep earned him the nickname \u201cImp\u201d. With Elmon\u2019s financial savvy, the two started a non-profit dedicated to building houses for the less fortunate, and Elmon kept all their paperwork in perfect order. \n\nYears passed, and the two lived very fulfilling lives helping the homeless. Amenhotep met a girl while building houses and the two got married and had a beautiful baby boy, Josep. \n\nEp and Set\u2019s business expanded globally. 15 years passed and Amenhotep grew kinder and more generous, giving to people in need at any of the places he went to build houses. Set built a campus in Cairo for the headquarters of their business, and directed global efforts. Over the years, Set lost touch with the people he was helping, and became more focused on business expansion and money of the business. \n\nAs all fathers do, Amenhotep wanted his son to eventually take over the business and help the next generation of needful people find purpose in their lives. He sent Josep to the the HQ in Cairo to learn business from Set. Once there, Josep was surprised to find that much of the financial success was due in large part to the financial savvy of Elmon, the elf.\n\nJosep spent months at HQ learning how to run the business. While there, Set decided that it was time to expand the company into a more profitable venture. Instead of building houses for the needy, he drafted up a plan to buy up land around urban areas and construct rental properties at expensive prices while preventing construction of new, affordable housing. He sent Josep with the proposal to Elmon to determine the financial logistics.\n\nUpon reading the proposal and its ill-nature\u2019s effect on Set\u2019s fellow man, Elmon keeled over and died, instantly.\n\nJosep was shocked, and ran to alert Set right away, who wailed in dismay at the loss of his financial mastermind. In a rage, he accused Josep of killing Elmon, and sent the teenager to jail.\n\nAmenhotep, hearing of the distress, caught the first flight back to Cairo to find himself neck-deep in a legal battle between him and his old friend.\n\nWithout the financial and legal savvy of Elmon, Set\u2019s case was a mess. Amenhotep, distraught, tried to reason with his childhood friend. \u201cCome, Imp, release my boy and call off the lawsuit. Let\u2019s use our energy to help those in need and not further what we both know is a fruitless path.\u201d\n\nSet refused, furiously gathering circumstantial evidence to bring to the court to frame Josep for Elmon\u2019s murder.\n\nThe case was brought before the court, but Set\u2019s claims were weak and unsupported. The judge, thoroughly disgusted with the lack of evidence from the prosecution, dismissed the case outright.\n\nObviously, Ep\u2019s teen didn\u2019t kill Imp\u2019s elf.",

            "Copy-pasting [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dyu2uy/joke_lovers_of_reddit_whats_a_great_joke/f83rro2/) comment from some time ago: \n\n----\n\nLong, but I've remembered this since I first saw it, and I've turned it into a story to lead people on with (as an old adage about an engineer) before dropping the punch line. The following text is from my first encounter with this joke: \n\n----  \n\n> So, a man and his dog are on a smaller fishing boat somewhere way out at sea. Way too far out to see any land. Hard times had fallen on this man, lost his job, wife left him for a hot shot banker that took his home, with what was left of his money he decided to spend on traveling the world and taking it easy with the only friend he has in the world. In the late afternoon, the man notices a storm approaching and tries to head back for land before he gets himself into a tight spot. The storm hits and what a storm it was my friends. His ship gets tossed around and beat up and suddenly a flash and a crack blinds the man and he falls unconscious.\n\n> Much later, the man starts to come back to his senses. To his surprise, he finds himself on a warm and lush but smaller island. Thick brush, plants everywhere and after a little exploring around the beach, he concludes that he is stranded. At first, he's very frightened. Though, the song of birds settles him some. Then, he hears a familiar heavy breathing and the pattering of feet galloping on sand... HIS DOG! The man slumps to his knees in tears and holds his old friend close. In the dog\u2019s mouth are two rabbits that he laid before his owner. The man is overwhelmed with happiness, he can hardly contain himself. He looks at his dog and says: \"Well boy, I guess we should get these two rabbits cooked up for dinner. Though, I have no matches or tools or anything but the clothes on my back.\"\n\n> Just like that, the dog went running off to another side of the beach and brings back the little survival kit that the man had put together and kept on the boat. Inside was: waterproof matches, a small pocket knife, water purifying tablets, an emergency blanket, a flare gun, a small tin of cigars in a waterproof box, and some miscellaneous first aid stuff. The man\u2019s jaw dropped open at his newfound treasure. The man owes this dog his life, for all he\u2019s done. He gets the fire going and sets up a little camp in a small cave on the beach that was empty. They both get their own roasted rabbit to fill their starving bellies and fall asleep on each other under the blanket from the kit.\n\n> The next morning, the man awakes and to his surprise the dog was nowhere to be found. The man figured that he couldn\u2019t have gone far and that they were all alone, so he assumes the dog is probably safe. He decides to thoroughly explore the island if he\u2019s going to be stuck here. Nobody knew where he was before he got lost anyway. He made his way around the long beach and on the other side of the island from his camp; he heard barking deep in the bush. He climbed and stumbled through the vines and trees, thinking that his dog was in danger. What he found was his dog barking at a small heard of sheep! \u201cI guess I won\u2019t go hungry\u201d he thought to himself. He collected his dog and returned to camp to rest and drink water. The dog ran off and brought back more rabbits to eat. \u201cI guess I don\u2019t even need to work that hard out here, we must have died and gone to heaven. This place is paradise.\u201d The man said to his friend after their meal.\n\n> A week goes by, the dog brings more rabbits birds and small game three times a day and the man had jury rigged himself a fishing pole and had even landed a few. The man had come to enjoy his new life with his dog. Rest, quiet, peace of mind, financial freedom, good company, and a cigar to puff on all gave the man a content heart. However, like the bane of all men, he started to get that itch... The itch a dog couldn\u2019t scratch. He had been here for some time now and his hand was growing dull. He craved the company of a woman, a REAL woman. The man sighed and looked at his dog\u2026 All of a sudden, an idea! He got a vine and tied his dog to a tree next to their camp and set out to find himself a sheep.\n\n> He found the flock grazing inland a little while after setting out. He stood there watching, trying to pick out the one. Suddenly, the man spots one he wants a closer look at. He approaches carefully and slowly so as not to frighten them away. He gets close enough to extend his hand and touch her head. She had blue eyes, a solid figure for a sheep and her hips drove the man and his aching loins up the wall! She turns around and pretty much just sticks it out there for him. \u201cShe must be lonely too\u201d he thought, trying to find a way to mentally justify what he was about to do. He had never lain with anything else but a woman so the anticipation got him as hard as stone. He got behind her, unzipped, grabbed her hips and aimed his throbbing member square and true. He could feel the heat radiating and then his dog comes running into the flock barking like a bat outta hell. The man\u2019s sheep goes bouncing off into the bush. \u201cWhew, thanks boy! I was about to do something very stupid, what the hell was I thinking?!\u201d He said to his friend. It was growing dark so they returned to their camp for the evening. The next morning the dog had a couple of plump birds and a few turtle eggs, the man cooked them up, not remembering much from the night before. He returned to the easy living lifestyle he\u2019d grown so fond of.\n\n> A few days passed but like clockwork, the itch had returned with a vengeance. The man thought of going to strip clubs, hitting the bar scene and picking up a one night stand. The pressure was growing to be too much for him to hold down any longer. He began to remember that sheep now, the blue eyed one with the hips. Blood rushed to his nether regions and he tied his dog up with two vines, really secure this time. One wrapped tight around the dogs chest and the other like a collar. He tested his knots and the strength of the vines and concluded that there was no way for the dog to slip away this time. He ventured out into the wild again, in search of his desire. After searching the afternoon away, fantasizing about working that sheep over, evening was falling and he didn\u2019t understand how the sheep had just vanished. He gave up and started back to camp. On his way back he stumbled onto the flock. Loins on fire now, the man casually strolled around until he found HER again. She recognized him and turned around. He approached, slapped her ass and dropped his trousers. He was instantly at full attention and she backed right up close to it, he grabbed her hips and pushed the tip to touch and his dog came galloping down the hill at full steam with a chip on his shoulder, the flock and his dream sheep went flying into the bush again. There went his chance at getting his rocks off, just bouncing away into the thick unforgiving wilderness.\n\n> The man carried the dog back to camp this time and was furious. The man needed to get his jollies off bad now. It had been weeks and he was all outta cigars to calm him down. Eventually he collected himself and made peace with his dog, concluding that it was just going to be a bad idea anyways. A few more days of relaxing on this perfect island with all its bounties and guess what was rushing through the man\u2019s veins again? That\u2019s right, the Itch... It was worse than he\u2019d ever had before this time. \u201cThat blue eyed sheep wanted it as bad as I did last time; I need to find her again\u2026\u201d I must have her!\u201d He stood up and grabbed the dog. The dog started to bark because he knew this game now. They wrestled around; the man trying desperately to get the upper hand but the dog was so strong. Eventually they both became tired and the man felt so helpless and blue balled. He just sat on the beach with his loyal friend who\u2019d already forgiven his owners pathetic actions by his side. Then, the dog started barking out towards the sea, which he\u2019d do if a shark let its fin break the water\u2019s surface. Then his dog just went out into the sea and the man fearing that dog was going to be eaten by the shark followed. After all, this dog is his only friend in the world and saved him countless times from hunger, he may have even dragged him to shore for all he knows. So the man was after his dog tout de suite. The man saw something flail around when the dog reached its destination. The dog then turned around and started back to shore the man caught up the dog finally and much to his surprise the dog had a person by the hair and was bringing it back to shore. The man pulled what turned out to be the most gorgeous woman he\u2019d ever seen onto the beach. He listened and didn\u2019t hear her breathing; she looked alright so he gave her massive chest some quick compressions to clear her lungs. He bent down to give her mouth to mouth and she rolled over and spit up all the water she\u2019d swallowed. Just then he noticed; her curves, her luscious blond hair, soft skin, and those stunning blue eyes, deep and as breathtaking as the sea. She turns to him and says: \u201cYou have saved my life, I will do anything you want in return\u201d as she playfully bites her lips and looks deep into the man\u2019s eyes. He felt his loins BURN with desire. He wanted to bury his sword to the hilt and explode with passion. His face grew hot and the woman became very aware of the man\u2019s randy state and grabbed his bulge. \u201cAnything?\u201d the man asked. \u201cANYTHING and EVERYTHING\u201d the beautiful woman replied without any hint of being discreet. He leaned in and looked into her eyes and said: \u201chold this fucking dog.\u201d\n\n---- \n\n[Source](https://redd.it/oyw1b).",

I quickly pulled down the passengers mirror, and to my horror, two yellow eyes radiated back at me. \n\nFast forward, I spent a month being sick, the initial diagnosis was Hepatitis A. \n\nWent back to the doctor, nothing was better(things were worse in fact). Was sent to the ER, then to the liver transplant unit at UCSF. By this point my eyes had turned muddy orange, and my pee was the color of... a mahogany tree.\n\nAnyways, the team of liver doctors at UCSF managed to save my liver.  I was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis. Oh, and my eyes are white again :)\n",
            "Not me, my wife.\n\nWe lived in Jacksonville, Florida. She rarely gets sick, but has mild insomnia. Around Wednesday, she had a low fever, and complained of aches and sweats at night and trouble sleeping. That weekend she wanted to see the Doctor... I told her she probably had the flu, just wasn't used the aches, and she always has trouble sleeping, but if she was still feeling bad Sunday we'd go to a clinic.\n\nSaturday night she couldn't sleep so we made an appointment for Sunday afternoon. But on our way there, sure enough she's feeling better. Doctor checks her out, she's feeling fine now, no fever, he says she probably had menangitis but is recovering. I'm due to go on a business trip to California the next day (Monday) and ask him if he thinks it's fine I go. He says, yeah, no problem. That evening, wife is eating and laughing and all is good.\n\nMonday morning I leave early. That afternoon, my neighbor calls, and lets me know my wife was wandering in the street in a delirium. My wife didn't know where she was, so the neighbor drove her to the ER. I book a flight home that night.\n\nThe hospital checks her out. She has a fever, her blood cell count is in the basement, and she is completely out of it mentally. They're not sure what's wrong, and a bunch of specialists start descending on her. I have to fill out a bunch of paperwork on her medical history, where we've been, etc. They think maybe it's some weird auto-immune disorder. Not good. She gets a bunch of transfusions and put on a cocktail of meds while they figure it out.\n\nThird day in the hospital, the infectious disease guy comes in. Blood parasite. Maybe tick born, she'd been to the mid-West recently, coulda caught it if she went walking in the woods or a park. Next day he comes in. Figured out the parasite.\n\n\"Why didn't you tell me she left the country?\" Huh? She hasn't... \"Well, she has malaria.\" Malaria? I thought you couldn't get that in the U.S. \"You can't, you need to go home and bring me her passport.\" What the hell?\n\nI retrieve her passport... CDC comes, does a whole case study on her (which they wouldn't release to us). Mosquito traps setup around the neighborhood, mysterious vans start driving by spewing clouds of stuff.\n\nMy wife stays in the ICU for a week, but recovers just fine. If you look at the 2010 CDC Infectious Disease report you'll see a discussion of malaria, and how the XX number of cases all are related to people recently returned from endemic areas, except for one woman in Duval County, Florida who received it from a cryptic vector...\n\nEdit: TLDR, Neighbor found my wife wandering in the street, took her to ER, turns out she got malaria from a cryptic source.\n\nFound a CDC Malaria Surveillance report from that year:\n\n**Case 2.** In November 2010, a woman aged 31 years sought treatment at a hospital emergency department for fever, severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, and malaise. She was admitted to the ICU for severe hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia, tachycardia, borderline splenomegaly, and epistaxis. Both the hospital and CDC confirmed a *P. falciparum* severe malaria infection with approximately 10% parasitemia. She was treated with oral quinine, clindamycin, and oral doxycycline, and recovered successfully. Probable routes of transmission were investigated. The patient stated that she had not traveled outside of the United States during the preceding 2 years and had no history of malaria. In 2008, she traveled to Nicaragua and stated that she had received malaria chemoprophylaxis at the time of her trip. She reported no history of blood transfusion or IV drug use. Mosquito trappings conducted around her home in Florida revealed no *Plasmodium*\\-infected mosquitoes, and no additional malaria cases in close contacts or persons residing in the area near her home. The origin of the infection remains undetermined.",

            "When I was 14 years old, I woke up one day with heavy stomach cramps. We called the hospital and they told us that i probably have a stomach flu and should go to the doctor next morning. \nAfter one of the worst nights ever, vomiting and sleeping next to the toilet we went to the doctor. I had a fever of 40 \u00b0C and was aching a lot. The doctor told me I had to to go to ER and have it checked out because she thought my appendix was inflamed and causing the pain. \n\nWe went to the ER and I stayed in the hospital for about 2 weeks, but they couldn't find anything. They treated me with broad range antibiotics and after 2 weeks I was feeling a bit better and they told me to go home and recover. \nThe night i got back from the hospital I went to bed and started hallucinating that I lived in a retirement home and that pirates were coming to steal our food. So I was flailing around trying to fend of pirates when my mother came in and asked what all the fuss was about. I told her what was going on and she looked at me like I had summoned a devil. She took my temperature and she instantly took me to the ER again (I had a 41\u00b0C fever).\n\nWhen we went back to the hospital I got treated immediately for inflammation and they did a wide range of test again. They saw that something in my body was inflamed but they couldn't find it. I stayed in the hospital for about 2 more weeks when they finally found what was going on. My appendix was inflamed and burst the night I was having the hallucinations but on all the scans they couldn't see my appendix. The doctor told me that if I came in 2 days later I would have died because of the puss flowing in my body. Apparently there is a 1% chance of all the appendix cases that the appendix is so stretched out that they couldn't see it on the scans or that the area was so inflamed they didn't see it. \n\nSo after staying on antibiotics for about 2 more weeks they finally removed my appendix and all the pain was gone. I stayed in the hospital for over 4 weeks just because of my appendix and my bad luck on being that 1%.",

            "How I met my wife.\n\nI\u2019m from the Netherlands, she is from the US. We met in Israel.\n\nIt was my first weekend in Israel, decided to go on a pub crawl to meet some people and have fun, as I\u2019m buying the ticket my now wife walks up to the counter to also buy a ticket. The girl working there introduces us, we hit it off the first night but I\u2019m leaving in 2 days to stay with friends of friends in the middle of the desert for 3 months. \n\n2 days after I leave I lose my phone, don\u2019t have any way to get back in touch with her. I had little money and could stay/work with the people in the desert. But I kept thinking about her so after a week I say I\u2019m leaving. Take the next bus (goes 3 times a week, at 5am) and then a train to Tel Aviv. I had no idea how to find her, where to stay and very little money. \n\nI email a couple hostels to find a work/stay agreement, those jobs are very popular and usually planned months in advance.\nI get an email back when I arrive in Tel Aviv, I can come in for an interview because they have a spot (this is already ridiculously lucky). \n\nRight after the interview and dropping of my belongings. I went back to the first hostel to see if they would give me information, they wouldn\u2019t give me anything. \n\nNow I\u2019m at a loss, Tel Aviv is a city of more than half a million people, I don\u2019t know anyone and have little more than the clothes on my back. \n\nKind of defeated I start wandering around/exploring the city. After a couple hours I get hungry and decide to treat myself to a restaurant. I\u2019m well out of the tourist area and find a place that\u2019s almost empty and rather cheap. I sit down, order a drink and something to eat. As I get my food I see my now wife walking past the restaurant, she sees me I see her. I\u2019m literally dumb struck and just kind of grin and wave (remember how I lost my phone? She didn\u2019t know that and just thought I ignored her) she waves and keeps walking. I throw like 200 shekels (way too much) in the table and sprint after her, explained and the rest is history.",
            "When I was a kid, I was chilling in the water of the Mediterranean Sea in Turkey. Suddenly I felt an awful burning sensation on my stomach and my legs. I looked like I had been brutally sandpapered and I got a 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F) fever.  \n\nTurns out I made contact with a jellyfish, and later found out that it hadn't happened on that beach for 10 years or so. I was just extremely unlucky.",
            "No sure about the odds on this one, but I survived a \u201cnon-survivable\u201d plane crush. I was on an old po-2 (famous for being very safe and uncrushable) on a tour of the desert in western China when I was like 7, my father\u2019s friend who hosted me and piloted the plane didn\u2019t survive but somehow I got out with a concussion and apparently passed out for almost a day In the middle of the dessert, in the wreckage of the crash, 50 km from the town/airport, on the edge of the desert. The people who found me were some tree planters (they plant greens in the desert to protect towns from sandstorm, a lot of people live in these desert towns in China do this) found me on there way picking up a shipment, and the only reason they looked was bc they were making a bet on how fast the egg would cook in the sand and went off the road to test. \n\nEdit:\nFirst thing first, according to legends, 15 min, I never tested it though.\nSo, according to my dads, the theory that I might have lived was because the plane was mostly made out of fabrics and wood. So when the plane crashed, the front half collapsed and took the majority of the impact. Though I got knocked out, I was probably covered under the wreckage and in the shades, it cooled me off enough to survive for a day or so! ",

            "I have an unknown type of autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy. My type of it is so rare that they haven't even seen it before. Getting diagnosed was a multi year struggle. They pretty much had to rule out everything else. It doesn't feel great to be in this club by myself. Countless blood draws, MRIs, cat scans and a biopsy and genetic test. So far, it looks like my father and I, are the only ones with it. Yay. \n\nEdit: thank you guys for all the kind messages and support. I really do appreciate it. If anyone is going through the struggle of getting a diagnosis, message me. I can't help with the diagnosis, but I can help with the feelings. \n\nSecond edit: As a researcher has pointed out. This isn't really rare. Just a type that hasn't really been seen in the population yet. Meaning there is certainly more people out there. Just not tested or diagnosed yet.

            "I was so freakishly allergic to ant and bee venom as a child that a single sting from a single little common black ant put me into anaphalactic shock. When my allergist was preparing to start immunotherapy for me, he found that the in-office lab equipment wasn't sensitive enough to measure the infinitesimally small amount of allergen with which to start my titration, so he had to send a sample of my blood to Johns Hopkins so that *their* lab could determine how much to give me. I did immunotherapy for several *years* to reach an immune response level at which it would be safe for me to basically exist in a nonfrozen climate.\n\nGood news, though: I'm good now. I've had a few run-ins with ants and wasps since my immunotherapy and my body didn't freak out and shut down, and research indicates that if it hasn't done that after this long, I'm *probably* safe for...maybe forever? I don't have Epi-Pens and I'm not overly afraid of ants or bees.\n\nEdit: Woooooah, overnight response! Thanks for the silver! To answer a few questions:\n\n- I live in Florida. I am not outdoorsy but stinging things are everywhere. It is, in fact, the Australia of North America. No, my parents would not move me to the frozen tundra to be a nomadic reindeer herder at my behest.\n\n- Little black ants do, in fact, sting. Several *Lasius* subspecies have stingers and venom.\n\n- When an ant *bites* you, that's using their mandibles and does not deliver venom. When an ant *stings* you, that's using their butt needle and delivers the pain juice. Most ants do one or the other. Fire ants do both at the same time.\n\n- I did some research a while back and found an academic paper that indicated that if I haven't had a reaction after this many years, the likelihood that I ever would again is vanishingly rare. I wish I could find it again right now, but I am already late getting ready for work, so if I find it later I will post it. I feel completely safe having a cell phone instead of an Epi-Pen.",
            "I was actually homeless for 4 years between 19 -23 years old. \n\nAs silly as it sounds I used to earn some extra money at the time by helping around in a Yu-Gi-Oh tournament. It was my biggest hobby when I was younger and was something I felt confident about, I also didn't have a passport or a bank account so I couldn't get a normal job (UK)\n\nAnyway so at the time I was stuck not earning enough money, without a passport a bank account, or a real job. (In the UK you won't get hired by 99% of companies if you don't have a passport to prove you have the right to work)\n\nSo one day I got a phone call from a studio asking if I played Yu-Gi-Oh, and would consider myself a geek, also if I wanted to be in a TV show. They said they would send me to another country as part of it. \n\nBeing homeless the biggest problems is being bored so naturally I said yes, but told them I don't have a passport.\n\"No problem, we'll get you one straight away and pay for it ourselves\"\n\nI ended up on a show called Geeks that you can still watch on Channel 4 OD. \n\nBecause I got this passport I was finally able to get a job, a bank account, and finally a house. Now Im looking after my 10 month old daughter who's playing while I type this.\n\nSo Yu-Gi-Oh save me from being homeless. I might be an anime characters.\n\n\nTldr: Was homeless until a TV company gave me a passport allowing me to get a job and a house, because I played Yu-Gi-Oh.\n\nEdit: this blow up more then expected so here are some answers to some questions, Also THANKS FOR THE GOLD AND SILVER GUYS.\n\nHow did you have a phone? I had a cheap brick phone that would run on battery for a week (think old Nokia's) I used to charge in my local library in Peckham London \n\nHow did I help in Yu-Gi-Oh? I was a judge for the tournaments, they're a referee for the game.\n\nHow did the TV company found out about you?\nI was a Judge for the game (basically a referee)\n\nThe TV show was looking for geeks with different hobbies and they found out about Yu-Gi-Oh. After, assume a Google search, they found the person who run my local tournament to recommend different players and people, and she recommended me.\n\nWhy do you need a passport?\n\nSo in the UK you need a government picture I.D. and a national insurance number (like social security number) in order to prove you're allowed to work in the UK.\n\nI have migraines that cause me to go part or near completely blind so can't drive due to the risk. So don't have access to a drivers license as I.D. leaving me only with a passport.\n\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nIm getting some people who are a little doubtful that it can be so hard to get a job while homeless, or to get I.D and are shocked it's taken me long to get out.\n\nWhat's important isn't what you know about the world right now, what's important is what I knew about the world as 19 year old that just left school\nThink back to that age and honestly ask yourself ow easy it would be to get a job without a bank, an home/address, I.D, or experience of anything.\nOf course now as a 27 year old I'm armed with sooo much more knowledge to find a way out \n\nEdit 3: \nSome people have point we out that you can get a job without a photo i.d. as long as you have a birth certificate.

            "I lived in Florida for the first 18 years of my life and spent most of my free time outdoors, fishing, camping, what have you. The summer before my junior year of high school I found myself out hiking nearby by my home with a buddy. We were stomping around in some clay deposits inside of a little ravine (even minimal geographic relief is dramatic in a place as flat as the gulf coast) when it started to Florida rain (for those of you who can\u2019t relate, imagine a torrential downpour). Our minds immediately jumped to the exciting possibility of a flash flood raging through the crevasses we were exploring. In an effort to make our day more exciting and not take any chances, we began to climb vertically out of the canyons versus take the lengthy path out of it horizontally. We got to the top, put our feet on the ground, and did pull up. As I stood up I felt the ground underneath me squirm. I had stepped on a snake. \n\nI screamed and kicked the snake that was latched onto my foot off me by reflex. As an Eagle Scout, I immediately recognized the red on yellow pattern as the snake slithered away and knew it was a coral snake. \n\nWe rushed home, drove to the hospital, and was seen. The doctors informed my parents the nearest antivenin was a 3 hour helicopter ride away. The first symptom, lung failure, would occur after 2 hours. My parents called my friends and family and we all spent time together without me knowing my fate. My friends and family arrived and subsequently left together. My parents turned off the lights and we prayed together. Around 2 hours after being bitten, a nurse came in to our dark room with gurney to collect my dead body. I asked the nurse \u201chas there been any developments?\u201d to her surprise. The doctors came in, shocked I was alive, told me it was a dry bite, and that I should remain whatever religion I practiced. \n\nTLDR: I was bit by a coral snake, the doctors told my parents I was going to die, I survived.\n\nEdit: I just woke up but I\u2019ll try to answer some of your questions before classes!\n\n1) The 1 in 1,000,000 is mainly getting bitten by the snake in the first place, but also subsequently surviving.\n\n2) I\u2019m Christian (Lutheran) just in case you were curious.",

            "No idea on the actual numbers, but I was born with 12 fingers. Identical extra digits on each hand   \n\nEdit: This blew up, so some backstory. I no longer have the fingers, my parents elected to have them removed shortly after birth. There was a video of when everyone found out, but my aunt has lost it over multiple moves. \n\nThe fingers were functional and would\u2019ve behaved as if they were part of the intended ten. I have a scar on each pinky from where they were removed. \n\nAs an extra fun fact, my older sister had 2 extra toes that did not actually grow and show, they found this out in high school when she broke her foot and they went in for X rays and found that she has extra bones in her foot that just never grew out into the toes. \n\nEdit:2 sorry everyone, I posted this then went to bed. Couple common questions. No I am not from Alabama, or the south at all. The fingers would\u2019ve worked and bent and functioned normally, they had bones, muscles tendons , blood vessels. \n\nMy hand is shaped completely normal. The fingers were like a double pack of Twix where they are side by side ||. The only thing that it would not have been able to do was move sideways very far as there was not a lot of webbing between original pinky and extra pinky. \n\nFun fact #2. This all comes from my dads side of the family. My dad as born with 2 extra teeth and my sister and I have different moms. I\u2019ll try to answer any other questions that I did not cover in this. \n\nWell I just woke up to a ton more questions. My parents decided to remove them to basically just save a child the hardship of being made fun of, which I fully understand. Kids can be cruel and I\u2019m sure having 12 fingers is just ammo for them. \n\nThe fingers were removed by being tied off as others have mentioned from similar situations in the thread. And no I don\u2019t have any proof other than the scars but they\u2019re tiny, the bigger of the two just looks like a tiny mosquito bite on my left pinky.

            "Not sure if it\u2019s 1 in 1,000,000, but it\u2019s pretty rare, so I\u2019ll write about it here.\n\nI have a medical condition called Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome that causes frequent, unexpected bouts of nausea and vomiting. It\u2019s triggered by a multitude of different things; in my case, the worst offenders now seem to be a lack of sleep, stress/anxiety, or other sicknesses like the flu. When I was just a year old, I began to throw up uncontrollably around the same time every month. None of the doctors my parents took me to had any idea what was causing it, but my dad\u2019s sister (also a doctor) did some digging and noticed that I exhibited some very similar signs to someone diagnosed with this fairly newly discovered condition.\n\nMy childhood was shaped by monthly visits to a nearby hospital to receive IV fluid to prevent dehydration, where they knew me by my name and my trusty green bucket. I can recall a number of my own birthday parties and summer camp sessions that had to be cut short due to the occurrence of a dreaded episode that put me back in the hospital. One of my fondest memories of elementary school was my teacher having my class call me to sing happy birthday, as I had gotten sick during my birthday party the day prior. As I grew older, and life and school became more stressful, I missed upwards of 30 days of school per year, and for fear of being labeled, no one but my close friends and my teachers knew the reason why. Even to this day, as a college student, while I have begun to grow out of the condition as some do (I have no more stomach pain during episodes, and much less frequent vomiting but just as frequent nausea), my condition still hangs around, causing me to miss class around once a week.\n\nBut man, I do my best to push through it. When I\u2019m not feeling like I wanna throw up, I\u2019m just a normal, fully-functioning young adult. That\u2019s all I ever wanted to be growing up\u2014\u201cnormal.\u201d I\u2019m never fully going to get there, but that\u2019s okay; for anyone facing a chronic illness like me, all that matters is that you make the best out of what you have. Never be afraid of being judged, because if someone judges you for something you have no control over, they\u2019re not worth your time, energy or thoughts.\n\nIf anyone shares my condition, or wants to know more about it, feel free to ask! I wrote this more for myself as I\u2019ve been struggling a little bit lately at school and needed some reassurance, but I\u2019d be super happy if this touched someone else.

My dad had three kids and my mother had one. In order for my mother to get pregnant, she went through about 7 years of reproductive therapy before my sister was finally conceived. \n\nFast forward to my parents\u2019 relationship. My dad got a vasectomy. Combined with the fact that my mother was 40 with a handful of medical and reproductive issues, conceiving a child should\u2019ve been damn near impossible. My parents thought the same thing, so they didn\u2019t really take any other precautions and my mother didn\u2019t try to have a pregnancy-friendly lifestyle because she assumed that a child would never happen. \n\nMy mother smoked cigarettes (not sure of the amount, but probably half a pack each day if I had to guess). She also worked around hazardous chemicals\u2014the kind where you have to wear hazmat suits when working with them. She also went to amusement parks and had an occasional drink. My parents did nearly everything possibly to prevent and terminate a pregnancy: some intentional, some unintentional. My mother didn\u2019t even find out she was pregnant until about 5-6 months in, so there were two trimesters where she did things that a pregnant woman should NOT be doing. \n\nAll things considered, I should\u2019ve never even existed. And even by the slim chance that I did exist, I should\u2019ve been born with some kind of mental or physical disability.

In the more conventional form you basically have ascending paralysis and it often results in long term hospitalisation (often in the ICU on a ventilator) because it also attacks the heart and lungs. It can be either acute (very aggressive but temporary) or chronic and both forms are complex and require specialist care. \n\nUnlike almost every other case of this condition I don't have true paralysis. I have what my neurologist refers to as the sensory variant of GBS. Basically the only damage I suffered was to sensory nerves, so while being exceptionally painful and making it very hard to move and function I have gotten off incredibly lightly. While going through the condition with my various health professionals we uncovered about 12 cases claiming to be this, but most of them were debunked in more recent papers.

            "It's more of soemthing that happened rather than something I am. Idk if this story really fits the question, but it's the only thing that comes to mind. \n\nAbout a year ago, I parked my car at the university campus parking next to my buddy's car, took a picture of both our cars and went to class. \n\nAn hour later, my phone rings. It's a police officer who got my number from university's help desk. He asks me to immediately come out to my car. I had a small amount of weed in my car (hidden well though) so my mind went directly to that. I could see my car from like half a mile away, and I saw about 10 cops surrounding it (later I found out there were only 4 cops, 4 campus security and 2 guys dressed in black). \n\nWhen I got close to my car, they confirmed it was me, asked to look at my recent pictures and confirmed that indeed I was the guy. They asked me to open my vehicle and started searching. Then they arrested me for intimidating someone. \n\nThe whole way to the police station the cops kept telling me I had fucked up, it was good that the cops arrested me because I fucked up with a psychopath and I would have been dead if he would find me before the cops. I still didn't know what the fuck they were talking about. \n\nThe 'questioning' went on for 2 hours and they kept saying they had me on camera, I should stop denying I wasn't involved with this. Then, after 2 hours they allowed me to call my lawyer, but since I didn't have one, I called my dad who works 5 minutes away from the police station. He was there pretty quickly and since he had all the details of the case, he was able to convince the cops (and the 'psychopath' ) that I wasn't involved in whatever they were accusing me for. \n\nThat day I understood that a similar photo of what I had taken before I went to class was sent to someone who was being harassed and intimidated through instagram. I had never parked my car next to my buddy's car like that, so I was quite sure the other photo was taken the same day during that 1 hour interval between me parking there and the photo being sent. The cops and university security said that there was no one else there during that 1 hour taking a photo so maybe I sent it to someone, but I was sure that the photo I took never left my phone. \n\nThe guy who was harassed called his dad (the psychopath) and he was there to either beat me really bad or kill me. Luckily the security called the cops and I wad arrested, so the cops weren't talking out of their asses when they said I was better off arrested. \n\nThe next day I went to campus security office and demanded to look at the camera. Except for me, only some girls are seen getting into a car and leaving. So we slowed the video down, and indeed, they stopped the car for about 5 seconds at the exact place the photo was taken. They were later called to the security office and accepted that they were the ones that did it.\n\nIt still boggles my mind how my simple decision to take a picture of my and my buddy's cars almost landed me in jail.",
            "Ah, man. People might not believe me but this is 100% true. My girlfriend had a child and we had no idea she was pregnant at all. She\u2019s 5\u20194\u201d and 140lb.

When my son was born I looked back and some attitude change made sense, and it made sense that she couldn\u2019t run, but otherwise she was 100% flat, never showed signs of pregnancy. \n\nI had just turned 21 six days previous, and she was feeling really sick throughout the day. I had some buddies over to drink, and she felt sick. She lived with her parents at the time. She ended up going to the hospital. They told her she most likely had salmonella poisoning. After pulling blood, they told her she was pregnant, and a few minutes later told her she was in labor.\n\nCrazy thing is, three months previous, she\u2019d gotten an iud and passed the piss test so they put it in.\n\nBecause I was drinking with friends at home, I had no idea what was happening. She called me around 730 am to tell me and I was shook in the most negative way possible. We had always agreed to never have a kid. I was freaking out.

Dispatch warned us of Covid symptoms so I was in full PPE (Gown, Gloves, Goggles, n95, and surgical mask). We assessed vitals and found her spO2 was in the low 80s (very bad sign), with respirations of 28 bpm and bilateral rales and wheezing (also very bad sign). As I'm getting vitals, my partner is asking her some questions, while one of the trainees goes to ask her daughter for a history. Pt spends the entire time yelling at us about how its a hoax and tells me to take my fucking mask off. We refuse, and I tell her I need the mask for my protection and we actually need her to put one on. She says like hell im putting one on, but she's too weak to fight us so we put on her anyway. She swears she does not have covid (even tho daughter says she has a recent positive PCR). In the ambulance, she tried to pull my mask off. I warned her if she tries that again I will restrain her.

            "I work in dermatology, and although not intuitive, there are many skin manifestations of COVID 19. Some manifestations are relatively specific, others not so much.\n\nI had a patient in our outpatient clinic who presented with pernio (one of the more specific skin manifestations of COVID), who flat-out refused to wear a mask to her appointment, refused to allow us to administer a COVID swab, and proceeded to counsel me on how COVID was hoax.\n\nGiven that we had a high suspicion of COVID, we shut down out clinic for the day, for the safety of our other patients. One of my nurses tested positive 3 days later (despite self-isolating), and we had to keep the clinic closed until all other workers had a negative results (this took 10 days).\n\nAlthough this was costly to my practice, what bothered me the most was the inconvenience that it placed on all the other patient I was supposed to see that week. In fact, one of the patients who had to move their appointment was subsequently diagnosed with melanoma (likely didn't change their disease course, but was still difficult to see).\n\nEdit: The nurse is healthy, she had a mild course.  \nAlso, it has been shown that patients with pernio often have a less severe course with COVID which I'm sure only exacerbated this entire situation. Haven't seen the patient again.\n\nEdit 2: first gold, thanks! And a hug (didn\u2019t even know that existed), but that\u2019s fun! Thank you :)",
            "ICU nurse here (6 years). Dealt with COVID since March 2020 (actually had the first confirmed pt at our hospital). \n\nNovember-February was rough. I had a two week streak where every day one or two of my patients would die. We'd go up to 3 oor 4 patient assignments (the norm is 2:1 or 1:1 if on certain equipment). \n\nMost all of the patients understood the severity of what they had. A handful didn't believe they had COVID, even though removing hi flow O2 or their BIPAP would put their sats down into the 60s or 70s. Many had comorbidities that put them at risk (COPD/asthma, obesity/sleep apnea, smoking).\n\nI think people would refuse to be intubated because they knew what the outcome would be. Fight, hope, pray, fingers crossed, whatever you want to call it... delaying the inevitable. Our ICU attending would actually have them sign consent for intubation (if they were cognizant enough to do so). Almost all of them died. Very few made it out alive but still so sick and debilitated (some with trachs).\n\nOne guy in particular sticks out. This was right after Christmas.  21 years old hx DM1, obesity, sleep apnea, didn't like to take his insulin. Admitted with COVID. Didn't believe he had it. Should have been tubed days before but refused, then he ended up being intubated emergently. Took about 5 of us to prone him (lay him on his stomach) because his O2 sats were in the 60s. Couldn't get a pulse (noticed no waveform on the art line). Had to flip him back over to do CPR for about an hour or so before we called it. Had a kid and a fiancee. \n\nHonestly, it was more of the families that denied their loved one had COVID. Upset (understandably) about not being able to visit. Zoom calls just don't cut it. \n\nI say this all as my parents (mom/SD and dad/SM) are all covid deniers, even when I tell them what it's like. \"Well those people had other things wrong with them though, they were older\" they tell me. They send me links about all the conspiracy theories re:covid. I got the Moderna in December and January, still haven't told them. \n\nIt's awful. The facial swelling alone from being prone is enough to give a person nightmares. Watching someone go into multi system organ failure, needing dialysis, unable to put them back onto their back, being maxed out on ventilator settings and that still not being enough to the point of barotrauma and collapsing a lung and needing a chest tube to reinflate it. Families saying \"do everything\" even though they had coded once or twice. Hearing families on Zoom crying, praying, singing as the patient is intubated, sedated, and paralyzed so the ventilator can do the work. Tearing up under all the PPE because yeah, we are still human. We work so hard and sometimes it doesn't fucking matter. But we go back, day after day. I wish people who don't believe could see what I have seen. It might scare them enough to take precautions seriously and get the vaccine.",

My wife was her ER nurse and brought her up to me, patient was yelling and screaming, ripping off her mask, spitting and telling us we\u2019re all sheep between gasping for breath. Our docs told her she was close to needing to be intubated (breathing tube) and she just scoffed. \n\nWe reached out to the husband who proceeded to swear and berate us, telling us we\u2019re keeping her prisoner (no visitors in our COVID unit) and that we can do whatever we need because \u201cnone of this is real and it\u2019s all for show so you guys can get paid.\u201d She gets intubated, decompensates over the next few days, and finally codes. We code (perform CPR, give medications, defibrillate, etc.) her for well over 1.5 hr before calling her time of death. \n\nThe kicker was calling her husband and getting absolutely excoriated because \u201cwe injected her with COVID as an experiment and killed her.\u201d He then had to be escorted out of the hospital when he came in to try getting up to the unit (without a mask, of course).

            "ER doctor here. I diagnose people with COVID on the daily. Some people are actually really great about it, others are... more difficult. I'll tell you a tale that occurred during my most recent shift. Back to back rooms and patients. \n\nPatient A, in room #4, is a 23 yo male, no medical history, comes in with body aches, malaise, and fatigue. Also had some mild nausea without abdominal pain or vomiting. \n\nPatient B, in room #5, is a 51 yo female, medical history of intermittent asthma - so she uses a puffer infrequently, comes in with shortness of breath, has some possible fevers at home. In triage it was noted that this patient's Oxygen sats were in the 88 range and her heart rate wasn't elevated. Interestingly, when asked if she thought she had covid she said \"I can't have it, I tested negative two weeks ago when my son tested positive. He's been sick at home.\"\n\nYou guessed it. Both people covid +. \n\nPatient A went home. He's doing great. Was extremely remorseful and before he'd even left the ED he called his work to let them know he was positive and to get everyone there tested because he figured he had gotten the illness at work (IIRC he worked in a small family-owned warehouse as a foreman). He also called his parents and they were getting him setup to sleep in the garage until his quarantine was up. I respected this guy.\n\nPatient B got admitted to the hospital because her O2 sats weren't great. When I went back to tell her she was covid + she called me a liar and told me I must have made a mistake. She threatened to sign out AMA (against medical advice) but when she got up to leave she got so short of breath the nurse used that to convince her to stay.\n\nPeople are strange sometimes. I try not to let stuff bother me, but covid deniers come very close to crossing that line.",
            "I'm an ER doc. Had a patient a few months back refusing to wear a mask. Calmly explained to him how it is hospital policy during the pandemic that everyone has to wear one to protect each other. He seemed to take it pretty well even though he kept trying to say that the mask makes it impossible for him to breathe. At the same time he kept trying to tell me how he knows all the \"science\" and masks actually cannot stop the virus from transmission. He then gets super worked up, rips his mask off and starts screaming about 2 inches from my face about how fucking stupid I was for not knowing all the \"facts\". He literally said \"I can't believe the fucking hospital hires huge fucking pussies like you to be a doctor. You need to man the fuck up it's not that big of a deal.\" He then stormed off coughing.\n\nTwo things: \nOne: millions of counted and probably at least a million uncounted dead across the world to me constitutes a big deal. And even if it doesn't kill you because you are young and healthy it can still really fuck you up. Stokes, heart attacks, blood clots, new onset type 1 diabetes, bowel obstructions I have seen it all even in people who are super healthy and young. Get your vaccine when you are able to people.\n\nTwo: you can't say that a mask makes it impossible for you to breathe and that it doesn't stop transmission. The virus particle is like 1000 times larger than an O2 molecule. You can't say that the mask magically blocks oxygen but let's the much larger virus pass through. That doesn't make sense.",

Then I'd spend the shift sweating like I was in Kuwait running around trying to keep everyone as comfortable as possible and maintaining their O2 and often repeatedly having to put someone's oxygen back on after they insisted they didn't need it. Multiple times I got told we had it all wrong, that it was just a cold, or that they weren't that sick and didn't need oxygen even as they ran out of breath trying to get out a single word. Being in a super red rural area, it was to be expected. We even had covid denying nurses for the longest time. Eventually they got the picture though and got with the program. \n\nStill one of the worst that's stuck with me wasn't the covid denying patient. Patient believed in covid and was a super great person. They were old though and had a care taker. Care taker didn't believe in covid and was strictly antimask. Upon the caretaker being diagnosed with it they refused to wear a mask or quarantine and said it was fake. They kept taking care of the person and never told them of the diagnosis.

She refused to have a vaccine because she didn\u2019t trust it despite the fact she was eligible for one for weeks before hand (in the UK). Subsequently caught COVID and was admitted to hospital. She repeatedly doubted this was the diagnosis. She refused to go to our COVID High Dependency Unit despite quite significant respiratory failure. Of course she deteriorated over a number of days to the point where she was on maximal oxygen on the ward and at that point finally accepted treatment in HDU with high flow oxygen, although continued to doubt she had COVID. Died within 24 hours of her HDU admission having refused to go to ICU. \n\nAnd of course, what did her family say?

We were ready to perform a repeat test and we even advised for the parents to get tested. Her defense was \" The child never left the house. Its just I and the father who go to work daily. The grandmother babysits while we are away. How can he even get COVID without leaving the house.\" She had called her husband, he came with 10-15 relatives in a car, they broke a few chairs and then left with the baby.

We insisted in doing PCR and a chest CAT-scan looking for COVID but he and his wife refused saying that COVID wasn't real and it was just a bacterial infection.The more we talked with him the more aggitated he got to the point that his face was red. We suggested hospitalizing him to stabilize him and start treatment, but they accused us of exaggerating his symptoms and that we only wanted to hospitalize him so we could steal the liquid in his knees (a stupid rumor that was going around when this whole thing started).\n\nThey both cursed at us and said they were going to a better hospital to get antibiotics. Fastfoward 24 hours later on Saturday, we get a call from the hospital next county over telling us that they intubated one of our patients because he went into respiratory failure when he arrived and they had to transfer him here because they don't have the appropiate equipment. We transfer the patient on Sunday only to find out on the CAT-scan he had 90% of lung damage. He passed away on Monday morning.\n\nJust before the family took the body away, I gave the widow the death certificate (that I filled out) and before walking away, she turns around and waves the certificate yelling \"See!

I told her: \"SARS-CoV-2 is COVID-19, ma'am\".\n\nEDIT because everyone's asking what happened afterwards: Not much. She yelled \"No, it's SARS! It's a bacteria!\" and stormed off.

He tried to treat his type 2 diabetes with herbs, his HbA1C (the lab value showing the state of his diabetes on the longer run) was off the roof. He did not vaccinate (he was offered), did not wear a mask, did not distance, and did not believe in any of this coronabullshit. Most of this information was obtained from his 20 year old daughter, as he was quite disoriented at presentation and was intubated urgently. She was sobbing through the phone every day for 1.5 months until he died. I held the phone with his daughter on call to his ears multiple times when he was still intubated but his mind cleared up and his sedation was optimal. I was quite convinced that he realised his mistake on the ventilator, with lines and tubes inserted into his body everywhere and in his last clear moments, when his mind allowed, but I cannot be absolutely sure.

Everyone else has been sick enough to accept it, but lots still refuse the idea of vaccination even after being in the ICU.\n\nEdit:. Lots of questions about vaccination after having the infection.

            "One of the theories about why men are conditioned to find female breasts sexy is that they represent how well a potential child would be fed. Note that this is not determined by size (i.e. it's not auto-assumed that bigger boobs mean a better fed baby). \n\nAdditionally, it is frequently noted that female nipples are a clear erogenous zone in women, acting as both a visual indicator of arousal, but also as a way to further stimulate arousal in a woman.\n\nAccordingly, for male nipples to reach that position of sexual arousal in women, they would need to have at least one of those purposes assigned, either as an indicator of arousal, an erogenous zone in men (it is in some men, but not all), or an indicator of male virility and/or capability as a father. Until at least one of these criteria are met, women by default would not be aroused by male nipples.\n\nEdit: Too many people have responded saying either \"I'm a woman but nipple play does nothing for me\" or \"I'm a man and I love having my nipples played with\". The above is generalisations, individuals will their own preferences. Remember that nipples develop in the womb before the formation of the penis/vagina (this is why men have nipples anyway), thus it's entirely possible for an individual to develop away from how most people do.\n\nAlso I should clarify that when I say a nipple is an erogenous zone, I do mean during sex. The mere sight of a nipple doesn't mean that a man is automatically aroused, but that for a lot of women (and some men) nipple play is a part of sex.",

Starting to figure out what I want from life and what it's going to take to get there... So I guess I started my 2nd life when I got out of my age 20 funk",
            "I got psychological help. I used to think that life just sucked for everyone and the \"trick\" was to fake your way through it. That faking was what I thought other people's happiness was. From puberty to after my 40th I lived where ever moment of happiness was weighed down by an ever present depression and lack of self esteem. I know this is small compared to what most people go through in life, and that's exactly the mentality that kept me from getting help.\n\nTook a bit, but after talking with a counselor once a week for a few months, being referred to a psychiatrist with initial diagnosis, and working with my psychiatrist to find medicines that work I finally feel what I can only assume is normal. I wake up most days with an underlying happiness that's never been there before. Moments with my kids are not darkened by thoughts that I don't deserve them or that they wouldn't love me if they knew me.\n\nDon't be like me. Even if your mountain seems small compared to your view of the mountain others are climbing, that doesn't mean you couldn't use some help finding the right path. To quote an old man from my childhood, \"It's dangerous out there.\"\n\nEdit: thanks for the gold. I truly hope that whatever type of help will lead to a better life for you, that you all get a chance to get it. Life can get better. Babysteps. \"I'M SAILING!\"",
            "When I quit my job 5 years ago and biked across the country. The second I finished I realized that I was forever going to look at life differently.\n\nI had been working an absolutely horrendous job, high stress, low pay, terrible hours, all because I needed the experience it gave me for my career. At some point I realized \u201cI don\u2019t have to be THIS miserable.\u201d Rage-quit, bought a bicycle, and cycled across the continental US for two months. Found my center and my confidence and started treating myself better. Met some of the most interesting, most bat-shit crazy, and most honorable people along the way.\n\nBest decision I ever made and I still treat myself with the respect I feel I deserve.\n\n**edit:** real quick edit to share a few more details, since many are interested. This is not the complete blog, because I just didn't care to keep it up after a while. It does however share my prep and first few weeks on the road: [https://tomshukis.tumblr.com/](https://tomshukis.tumblr.com/)\n\nI can't remember if my blog covered the financial side of it, but over the course of just under a year I had saved up about $5,000 to pull off the trip. No SO or pets at the time. I rented a room out of my dad's place during the shitty job, so cost of living was reasonable and not totally crazy. I was a crisis counselor, so while I say in the original comment that the pay \"was shit\", that is relative. I wasn't making min wage, but what I was doing for the job didn't equal the pay I got in return.\n\nAbove all, I was resourceful as hell during the trip. I went to cities where I knew people, I told my story to a lot of folks. Lots of strangers along the way gave me a gift card or a tenner or anything to help me along. Ever flirt with a motel desk clerk for a free room? It takes a lot of creativity to pull it off low cost, but it was worth every challenge.",

            "My sophomore year in high school.\nA student two grades above me committed suicide at 4am on Monday morning. I came into school hearing people whispering, and I thought it was just high school drama and rumors.\nFirst hour started. The teacher walked in. Told the class a student had passed away. I thought it was a joke. I knew the name. I knew his sister. I played soccer with her for years.\nAs the day continued it became more and more apparent that he was really gone. The whole school\u2019s atmosphere changed. People that didn\u2019t even know him were crying in the halls. Kids I had known since kindergarten were missing from school, mourning his passing.\nI came home that day and just sobbed in my room.

Kids I hadn\u2019t seen in the past five years were there to support his family and friends. His cousins got up in front of everyone at the funeral and cried while sharing their stories of him.\nI didn\u2019t know him well, honestly. I just knew his sister.

            "In January of 2018, I went in to quit my job and simultaneously was fired for being so sick. I originally took the office job because my body couldn't handle working in a retail store. I was constantly spraining my wrists and elbows, and my hips and feet hurt a ton. A chiropractor told me my leg bones were sliding up into my hips from standing so much, and probably from lifting heavy things as well. Three months after losing/quitting my job, at the age of 20, I was diagnosed with hypermobile ehlers-danlos syndrome. Suddenly I had an explanation for all of the pain I was in, all of the intestinal problems I had, and how weirdly my bones/joints/tendons move around. People's skin doesn't always hurt to the touch. In the last year and a half my condition has worsened significantly. At first I was extremely depressed, spending lots of time in bed trying to feel better, learning about my body and the horrifying things it can and shouldn't do. Saw a counselor who was a piece of shit, did lots of physical therapy that led to a  permanent neck injury I'm fighting to get help for. The amount of pain I deal with daily at this point is unimaginable, not possible to wrap my head around. I'm now on a few pain medications as well as seeing a physical rehabilitation doctor. I enjoy mindfulness meditation when I need to relax, this was the main thing that helped me get out of my depression. Some of my family had a hard time understanding my situation, some still do, it doesn't matter. I do what I can every day and I'm still learning how much is too much.\nThe hardest part about all of this is that I am 23 years old, female, pretty, and other than my super dark eyes and bruises I look completely normal. I even have great muscle mass and tone because I'm held together by them. I cannot tell you how many times doctors, even school nurses, didn't give me the care I needed because I looked fine. At this point I probably have ptsd from all of it. I developed a massive ulcer as a result of a bad flu when I was 8 years old, I can still remember how mean my school nurse Ms. Swan was throughout the month it took of missing school and being sick before my mom took me to the hospital. I was mistreated for rheumatoid arthritis from the age of 15 to 17 and all of the medications and self injections made me sick. I've been told I only had bad gas when I had an orange sized cyst on my ovary. There's more but I hate thinking about it. The support online, especially on Instagram, is amazing. There's medical researchers working daily trying to at least find the gene that causes this, people who also have eds giving advice to others, even yoga/pilates instructors with eds post videos online (sleepysantosha is my favorite). People have developed lists of supplements and medications that work for them. Communities try to spread awareness and hope. I suspect this is the only life I'll have, and if it has to be this hard then I have to be stronger, even if it's just mentally. Anyone who is going through something difficult, no matter what it is, please feel free to comment/vent about it. :)",

            "This wasn't accidental. \nI have a kitten, about 5 months old. \n\nEvery morning, I wake up and feeding him is one of the first things I do. In the first couple months, in his little brain, he learned that me waking up=food. \n\nAbout a month ago, he started waking me up. Looking to expediate the process. \nJumping on me, meowing loudly, running across the bed... Whatever gets me out of bed.\n\nI usually wake up around 6am for work. I guess that was too late for breakfast, as over the course of about a week this kitten would wake me up about 15-20 minutes earlier every day. \n\nThis started on a sunday and it wasn't until friday that I was woken up and realized it was 4:30am. It was then that I realized I've been outsmarted by a kitten and I was being conditioned to feed him in the middle of the night.\n\nNow if he wakes me up early, he gets locked out of the room until I'm ready to get out of bed. He doesn't wake me up anymore.",

The emergency bark is what he does when he thinks there is serious danger. It is EXTREMELY loud and makes us jump every time. He usually reserves it for things like the time I fell down the stairs and he scream barked for my husband to help, or when someone is in our front yard, or when he cornered a possum in the backyard. \n\nHowever, since my husband started working from home this dog barks his emergency bark at my husband if he tries working past 4pm. My husband now has learned to stop working at about 3:50 every day to avoid that jarring sound.",

            "I seem to have inherited a turtle, a red eared slider.   \n\n\nIt was originally the daughters and she bought it at age 13 with the help of her mum ???? It came with a  tiny tank (I know).\n\nOnce it arrived home I thought \"Well how unfortunate that your new owner is incapable of looking after herself never mind a pet\", she did try but as expected got bored by this new friend.     \nSo I looked for information and found out he may live for 25-30 years, at this point it seemed to become my responsibility .  \n\n\n11 years later, (Daughter has moved out) several tanks later (don't worry the one now is fine in size), two fluval filters, heaters, bulbs for heating and UVB, custom basking ramps and the general upkeep and well being of our not so small turtle it seems that he now 100% mine. I don't mind to be honest.  \n\n\nAnyway, when we are out of sight he will continually swim near the water surface and splash like crazy, all four legs breaking the surface and creating a lot of noise. For some time I would hear this noise and run into the room, upon seeing me he would stop, I walk out, splash time again.  \nI look forward to the next 20 years of doing this :)  \n\n\nSometimes we take him out the tank, he seems fine, not terrified or skittish but quite happy to explore, I never know if this splashing is him asking \"Hey come on, get me out of here I need a change of scenery\".",

We've conditioned him to dramatically flop onto his side for pets, and he's conditioned us to give him attention when he flops because it's so damn cute.\n\n> We tried to encourage our cat to not wander around crying for attention, so I started gong to pet him every time he quietly laid down. It worked to a certain point, but now his method of demanding attention is to dramatically throw himself onto his side with a huff, and stare at us. \n\n> Fortunately for him, it's very cute so it still works in getting him attention.

Therefore, you are not your *mind* (the thing doing the thinking), you are the thing that is *aware* of your mind (i.e. \"you\" are *aware* of your thinking, you aren't defined *by* your thinking).\n\nThis can really help with things like body image issues, insecurities, anxiety... it's the essence of meditation.

It's not about what you think - it's being aware that you're thinking.\n\nA lot of people say \"I think\", but they don't say \"I beat my heart\". They say \"my heart beats\".

The idea is to make up a silly story or imagery to go along with the things you are trying to remember. I am learning Japanese. Some of my word stories are straight forward and easy to make up and others are a bit more abstract. Your brain has a tendency to remember stories more easily than random information. Instead of reading it over and over you are giving your brain some context to draw from. It takes maybe 5 read throughs instead of 20 or more for me to fully retain info now that I know this method Here are some examples. Nurse: when I am sick I \"kangoshi\" (can go see) the nurse. Hair: I picture a wild unruly child with crazy matted hair running around. I yell '\"Kami\" over here so I can brush your hair; Kami is hair. Usually: usually my skates were really \"taitei\" (tight) but sometimes the laces would undo in the middle of a jump. Make up characters and scenarios.

            "my favorite comment from this answer a few years back, by u/dipique\n\n1. I am stranger in a strange land. I have no skill in making anything useful--not with the tools of this age--and my body is ill-suited for hard labor. I decide to go from farm to farm until someone is willing to give me simple work that can be communicated without words. At least my regeneration will help me recover quickly.\n2. I am kicked off a farm almost immediately. Within an hour or two it is obvious that I'm slower than a ten year old child of this time, and the farmer has no desire to share his hard-grown food with this oddly-garbed, weak-limbed creature. I have learned two words which I believe mean \"barn\" and \"worthless piece of shit\" (or something of that nature); I cannot pronounce either, but I repeat them as I walk.\n3. I am near a city and the farms are blessedly close. Even so it takes close to a full day before I find another farm that allows me to do some work. My benefactor this time is grizzled and care-worn, yet I think he is touched by my helplessness. I work a few hours and eat for the first time, the flavors strange and bland to my palate. My vocabulary gains a few more words, but most of the communication is through hand gestures, though even that is surprisingly difficult. I sleep in the barn, rain dripping though the slats keeping me awake long into the night.\n4. I had the good fortune to arrive during planting season. As I grow accustomed to the work, I feel I am less of a burden than I was at first. Perhaps I am even, barely, earning my keep. But, more to the point, my vocabulary is improving considerably and I am now speaking in short, simple sentences.\n5. The summer is busy for me. I know I cannot stay here; after harvest I will need to find other accommodations. I know that learning to write is of the utmost importance, but there are no books to be found. Instead I slowly, painfully copy characters I see written wherever I find them, practicing them with the burnt ends of sticks on rock until I can form them quickly, even if I do not know their meaning.\n6. My benefactor, who has the habit of occasionally looking on as I practice my \"writing\", surprises me one day we are in the city. He introduces me to a man whose function I do not really grasp, but who seems to be some sort of clerk. In any case, he is willing to write out some sentences and tell me what they mean. His accent is new to me, the vocabulary strange, and I drink it in. This man has some education. I use my charcoal collection to write the translations in English and he asks what language it is. I have no answer, so I tell him I made it up. He laughs. For many nights after, I copy these passages again and again.\n7. I visit the clerk at every opportunity. The farmer is understanding. He is kind, and seems to care about me, but I also see relief in his eyes that I will not ask to stay the winter. The clerk has become a friend, and he willingly supplies me with new words and corrects my fledgling script. Luckily, the script is simple and rather flexible--much simpler than English--and my progress is rapid.\n8. My writing has become quite serviceable, and well that it has, because the harvest is done and the preparations for winter have begun. I still work much of each day, but soon I will need to find new accommodations. The clerk, who it turns out takes dictations from the wealthy and illiterate, helps me find a job doing inventory and bookkeeping for a successful shop. It pays so little that I can scarcely afford to house, feed, and clothe myself, but I have ready access to quill pens and now my real work can begin.\n9. On wood, stone, and any other surface I can find, I begin writing down everything I remember. About textiles, manufacturing, mathematics, psychology, history, and medicine. I write in English, and in great detail, developing a shorthand for my relative certainty about these facts.\n10. Over the next several years, my education proves invaluable. The owner of the shop, at first scornful of my work, becomes, if not a friend, then at least an ally. I show him how to reduce inventory carrying costs using LEAN techniques and predictive forecasting of purchasing trends. I introduce a formal loyalty program, employ (relatively) sophisticated product pricing strategies, and he is generous in rewarding me as his wealth burgeons. The clerk is happy for my success at first, and I even try to help him, but the role reversal does not suit him well and we stop spending time together. When he dies a few years later, I don't even know. The farmer I visit occasionally. It is awkward, but I owe it to him. The shop purchases most of what he produces at a good price, and that is perhaps the only meaningful thing I give to him before he dies, quietly, eight years after I arrived.\n11. It is during this time that I sow the seeds of wealth. I save every coin I can and found an informal bank. I am allowed to operate out of the shop owner's buildings in exchange for a 20% share of profits. He is skeptical at first, but it costs him nothing. By the time he dies, nearly 30 years later, it is more than half his annual earnings, according to the quasi-accounting team I now employ. I purchase the business from his widow for a sizable sum, sufficient to keep her in comfort for her few remaining years.\n12. It takes time to find and train someone to handle the day-to-day management of the bank and the shop (still known as such, though it has expanded a dozen times and offers the finest and most varied wares in the city), but once accomplished, I turn my attention to my new project: a university. I pay to build it, but the ongoing costs are covered by the students, mostly the children of the obscenely wealthy. I need to be careful--some of my ideas could draw the wrong kind of attention--but I begin rigorously training them in the scientific method, drawing on every elementary school experiment I can remember. I find I enjoy this. Aside from some dalliances, I lead a fairly solitary existence. The children make me feel connected, meaningful.\n13. It is time to deal with the issue of not aging. I establish a bank and university in two cities perhaps a month's journey away from each other and begin passing myself off as my own son or grandson. Every twenty years or so I rotate, managing the affairs of the other location by correspondence. Some of the students have grown up and become teachers. This is both heartwarming and inconvenient.\n14. I have good paper now, just one of the many fruits of my universities. I publish a \"book of prophecy\", in which I attempt to capture all my recollections of science and phrase it as if they were clever guesses. This is perhaps all I can do to guide and hasten their progress. I continue to write down my memories, but I have not remembered anything new in a very long time.\n15. I fall in love. She is young--everybody is young, when you have lived a century and a half--and she is bright, and she worships me, yet speaks to me candidly and without guile. Before I ask her to marry me, I tell her the truth about who I am, something I have never done before. I show her the vast piles of writings, copied and recopied in an ever greater expanse, organized and re-organized, indexed and cross-referenced a hundred ways. She does not believe me. She is not cruel, but she leaves the university soon after and I do not see her again for many years. For the first time, I contemplate death.\n16. Impatient with the rate of progress, I use my wealth and prestige to forge a political career. I have no wish (or facility) to run a nation, but I advise, and my banks give my words weight. I do my best to resolve conflict and establish universities in every allied country. The thing I remember with the sweetest nostalgia, other than air conditioning and hot water, is TV shows. It is a bizarre, ridiculous thing to work toward, but I throw my wealth and centuries and harness the combined intellectual power of every major nation to make me some damned [talkies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_film). It takes a long, long time.\n17. It is 750 years before the world is \"modern\" in my eyes, though history has taken a vastly different shape. We had no dark ages, no long stretches of stagnation. For all the many gaps in my knowledge, there are always brilliant minds to discover--or even to leapfrog--the reality I recorded, which now seem another man's writing. I assume different identities now, controlling my enterprise through elaborate mechanisms of separation. My personas are primarily political as I continue to try to guide events. I succeed, though less with every passing century. I wonder, sometimes, if I should let loose the reigns, now that I have nothing to offer other than my accumulated wealth.\n\nEDIT:  [original comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6hl62g/youre_given_immortality_but_as_a_cost_you_are/dizmx83?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nSource comment!

            "You're immortal! How wonderful! And going back 2,000 years will allow you to become rich and powerful. Knowing that there's gold in the Yukon, or diamonds in South Africa. Knowing about the geography of the planet. Being able to buy the early works of Da Vinci, or Michelangelo. Backing Rockefeller and Carnegie when they are starting out. Buying a ton of Bitcoin at 6\u00a2. Owning Apple and Google and Amazon shares. Rich and powerful!  \n\nBut everyone you ever meet will die. You will have children and lovers and spouses and friends, and you'll have to bury all of them. As we get older, our perception of time shifts, and that's why as adults it seems like the seasons are racing past. Accelerate that. Centuries will fly past in a heartbeat, and it will seem that the baby you saw born will have died in the blink of an eye. How can you possibly risk emotionally engaging with them knowing this?  \n\nWe're pretty good at generating, processing, and transmitting information these days, and we're only getting better at it. That means you're going to have to keep your immortality a secret, because it's the Holy Grail of mythology and science, and if word gets out that you're immortal, you will be hunted relentlessly. You will be taken into custody and examined meticulously, right down to the last bit of your DNA. You'll need to be very good at running and hiding, and you won't be able to trust a single soul.  \n\nWho know what the long future holds for humanity, or this planet? There could be another Great Extinction event that wipes out 90% of life on Earth. You'll survive, but what else will? Maybe you'll get to see humans travel and colonize other worlds...if we can solve the FTL dilemma.  \n\nEventually the sun will explode...or just fizzle out. You might be lucky enough to have escaped this planet before the sun swallows it, but then you'd be adrift, unless, as I said, there were colonized planets.  \n\nEven if there were, eventually the Universe will expand and fizzle out, in what science speculates will be the Great Freeze. There will be no stars, no planets, no life except your own.  \n\nThere will be nothing.

Because of this, remember that to a recruiter or HR department, college is more than just your academics. It is about all of your experiences: class projects, personal projects, getting involved on campus through student orgs, student worker positions, volunteering, internships, etc. \n\nThis means you should make use of your school\u2019s Career Center well before spring semester of your senior year so that you can learn how to talk about yourself professionally: through a resume, cover letter, interviews, networking. Learning the basics earlier and working on them each year as you look to secure internships will make you a really successful candidate once it comes time to find a full time job. \n\nAs some of the other comments have mentioned, your student fees pay for resources you have access to through the Career Center, so take advantage of them!",

            "This is true of most countries. \n\nI live in Germany, but Germany isn't just one country - there is a constitution (the Basic Law \"Grundgesetzt\") and federal laws passed by congress, then there are the state laws passed by the state governments, then there are local regulations defined by the counties, cities or town governments. \n\nBavaria, for example, is a \"Free State\". The Bavarian leaders never signed the German Basic Law, but stated that they would accept it if 2/3 of the rest of the German states signed it. All other German states did sign it, so the law applies to Bavaria as well. But, Bavaria still sees itself as somewhat more independent than other German states. (Bavaria, for example, has a political party that is only active in that state, the CSU, that is associated with the CDU that is active in all other German states. In the current German government, the CSU has several minister positions, even though it only represents one of 16 states in the country.) \n\nFederal laws are the same across the country. But things like education and schools are in the responsibility of the state, so there are differences. The states try to align them as much as possible, but there are differences, because each state allocates different budgets for education...",

            "Just taking the phrase \"United States of America\" literally would suggest exactly that.  The word state means country/nation/territory organized politically under a government.  America is the landmass (i.e. North America/South America).  So yeah, there are 50 states that are united as if they are a single one ruled under another big government, and they all happen to be in America.

Legally, sure, there's the aspect of states having some amount of control over their own laws, but this tends to only cover specifics and relatively minor stuff in the grand scheme of things, with the country's law taking precedence in most cases.\n\nCulturally, there is a fair difference between states, but I still see the overall US cultural identity as stronger than the variations between different states. There's a far greater difference in cultures between say, countries in Europe, than states in the US. And even within a fairly small country like the UK, I'd say there's just as much of a range in cultures across the country as there is across the US.",

I like the NPR article he got the idea from.  \n\n>...But according to author and journalist Colin Woodard, the country is neither united, nor made up of 50 states. Woodward has studied American voting patterns, demographics and public opinion polls going back to the days of the first settlers, and says that his research shows America is really made up of 11 different nations. \n\n [https://www.npr.org/2013/11/11/244527860/forget-the-50-states-u-s-is-really-11-nations-says-author](https://www.npr.org/2013/11/11/244527860/forget-the-50-states-u-s-is-really-11-nations-says-author)",

            "Not really.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLegally, they are mostly under that same law with just small trivial differences, they just happened to be organized by separate governments. The US is not at all unique in this regard - Germany for example is also a republic that acts largely in this way. If a state were to actually try to do something radically different than the rest of the country, the federal government would step in and somehow control it to prevent chaos. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCulturally, the US is absurdly homogenous for the size of its population and its size. There is no other large country I can think of with fewer cultural-differences-per-mile. Just look at China, India, Germany, UK, etc. and how much more diverse they are in terms of regional cuisine, dialects/accents, etc. and those countries are sometimes smaller than a single US state.",

            "Some chick wouldn't stop pestering me at the bar one time, so I made up a whole fake backstory about being a washed up Disney Channel star until she eventually got bored and left me alone. I made up a theme song and everything, and basically wouldn't let her change the subject. I'd probably just do that again.\n\n__Big, BIG Edit: let me tell you about the Y2K Disney shitshow that was *Bugchasers* (don't look it up).__\n\nSo exactly how much *do* you know about the show Bugchasers? Nothing? Boy do I envy you right now!\n\nThe premise was basically four best friends discover that the Evil Dr. Merkin is planning to release his Y2K bug into cyberspace (aka, the Cyber Zone). Picture a Great Value boy band style of archetypes: A bad boy, a jock, the prankster (me), and the brainy one. The brainy one, Takeshi, builds a portal to the Cyber Zone, so we could battle the computer bugs in a very poor CGI world (basically Reboot/VR Troopers/Code Lyoko). We each had a specialty, and a color scheme, where I was cast as the green Bugchaser, Louis \"Snot\" Bukowski, who was equipped with a slime cannon and other gross bug traps, stink bombs etc.\n\nThere were a ton of ongoing gags, particularly between myself, Takeshi, and our big sister Melissa. If you've been keeping up with the names so far, you may have noticed that Takeshi, who was the *yellow* Bugchaser, has a significantly more Asian sounding name than \"Louis\" or \"Melissa\" Bukowski. This is never explained, this is never even addressed, even with 13 episodes shot and 26 planned, it wasn't even touched upon. Anyways, our big sister would usually tease him for being a dork, or get mad at me for being gross, and she'd always get her cumuppence for being an outright bitch. She'd get zapped fucking with electronics, have sink bombs go off on her, and even got sucked through the portal into the infamously disgusting \"cyber slug zone\". You know how each Walking Dead episode had that one scene that was just gratuitously disgusting for no other reason than to try and one up the previous episode? That became a thing with Melissa, but it took a far more skeevy route. \n\nFirstly, let's cut to the *chase* (get it?). You're probably more wondering what happened to this show and my career. The show was straight up cursed. It was supposed to go along with an arcade shooter and Sega Dreamcast game, with basically no other merchandising. The death of arcades and the Dreamcast flopping nixed that. The blue Bugchaser, Johnny (the jock wielding a long ranged bug zapper) was paralyzed while his mother was driving drunk, and wheelchair bound right before the fourth episode was shot. They told him they were just gonna \"roll with it\", but ended up replacing him. I won't forget the heartbreak on his face when he showed up to the set only to find out he had lost more than his mother, and use of his legs, but the chance to defeat Dr. Merkin and be the hero kids need. The animation department was never given the funding they needed to begin with, but also suffered a \"computer virus\" that required them to turn in their machines to the police. The resulting CGI was about 5 years behind its time, and couldn't grab kids' attention.\n\nThe characters were barely likeable to boot. Takeshi was a nerd, and his main job was to do technical stuff for the group and he didn't even get a cool weapon. Not that the weapons were terribly cool with Disney trying their best to avoid anything too gun-like (the red Bugchaser had a fucking flyswatter). Johnny had been replaced after 3 episodes, meaning they reshot a couple scenes where they could, redubbed lines, and ultimately cut a lot of material featuring that character. I was the most well liked character by far, being the zany little scuzzball that I was. My mom was fucking the producer, so I think my character got a little bit more to work with. That, and how my character played off of Melissa.\n\nYou know how Nickelodeon producer Dan Schneider has a little girl foot fetish? Our producer, Mitch Michaels, had a sticky little girl fetish. It was only mildly noticeable on screen, maybe her shirt was just slick enough with green slime to make out her bra line, maybe it was the way she spit take'd the slug mucous, but it was way worse on set. Mitch put way too much time into reshooting these scenes, which often required multiple wardrobe changes (just off set too, not in a dressing room). I won't bore you with those details, because there was also quite a bit of racism on set. \n\nAside from the very on-the-nose casting of an Asian kid as the yellow Bugchaser, Johnny had it worse as an African American. Takeshi was typecast as a nerd, but Johnny was supposed to be the bad boy, with a very negative thug like personality. They didn't change it because of complaints though, no, they changed it when Mitch was informed that, much like the red power ranger, the red Bugchaser was sure to be the most popular. That's when the one black kid was essentially demoted from red to blue. When Johnny 1 was replaced by Johnny 2 and they were forced to do reshoots and edits, something was said to the effect of \"they'll never even notice if it's a different black kid, they're all the same.\" All he saw was a black face filling a roll; he even started making us call eachother by our character names off camera, until there was no Johnny 1 and Johnny 2, but just Johnny. I don't even remember the original Johnny's real name.\n\nBut I do remember the money shots. So Melissa was being pushed into increasingly sticky situations, with way more takes of spare footage than any slapstick gag deserved. Mitch insisted that they were the main selling point of the show, and even started using the term \"money shot\" each episode. On the episode after the midseason finale, we were supposed to fight an invisible spider bug in the \"dark web\". The solution was for me to spray glow in the dark slime on it so the others could see it. The prop gun was a unique custom build that was way more important than the modified supersoakers I was used to (the premise was that we had janky Kids Next Door style gear that was \"digimorphed\" into cool equipment when we went through the portal). I wasn't allowed to goof around on set with this custom prop because it had to function just so. Melissa walked on the set and was given the half assed setup of blowing dust off of her diary (there was a subplot there about stealing it, losing it in the cyber zone, then having to go back and fight some dust bunnies for it or whatever), it gets blown in my face, I sneeze, and accidentally set off the glow goo gun. This squirted a thick, creamy rope of pale colored goo directly on her face.\n\nShe tastes it.\n\n\"Is this frosting?\"\n\nEnd scene.\n\nThere was a hushed murmur around the room, as Mitch stood there almost wheezing. He had the type of face that a starving man gives a hibachi chef as he waits for a shrimp to get tossed his way. There wasn't a second take, the scene died on the cutting room floor without ever being matched with a laugh track; it died as stark and naked as Melissa's innocence. We were all hurried out of the studio by flustered parents, whose reaction made us feel a sort of nervous shame. The cumshot heard around our world. \n\nThe show was cancelled shortly thereafter, having only half a season air. Mitch was fired, and there was a huge class action lawsuit based around a pedophilia case. The computers that were taken by the authorities had child porn on them, many of which were pictures of child actors. My mom got too full of herself and wouldn't take the settlement, insisting on a lead role for me instead, but her mouth couldn\u2019t influence them nearly the way it influenced Mitch. My role was half voiceover work, and my character usually wore goggles even in the real world, so my face was mostly forgettable. This would be the end of my show business career until my work on an adult film set years later... \n\n...but that's a different story.",

            "I have a very specific knowledge set about WW1 military equipment, specifically service rifles.\n\nFor example! Did you know that the French military actually developed the first smokeless powder rifle? There were actually *no* rifles developed before then that used smokeless powder. This was mostly due to the timeframe! The Lebel Model 1886, as the name implies, was designed in 1886, and entered service in 1887. Smokeless powder was invented by a French chemist only two years before, in 1884, making it possibly one of the fastest-designed military rifles of all time.\n\nThe Lebel was a more-than-decent weapon for the time. Using smokeless powder as opposed to black powder gave it a huge advantage; the cartridges burned faster and more evenly, creating more consistent ballistics, and gave more 'punch' per gram of propellant. Cartidges could be significantly smaller and faster, and the Lebel was accurate up to a whopping 300 meters because of this! Last but not least, the byproducts of smokeless powder were mostly gasseous, meaning that there was less of a 'report' per gunshot in both sound and smoke. Soldiers could not only hit targets more consistently, but they also had less of a chance of being spotted, could actually still see who they were shooting at after putting a few rounds out, could carry more ammunition due to the smaller size and lighter weight, *AND* shoot further and penetrate through more armor due to the speed of the bullet!\n\nHowever, these are all advantages of *smokeless powder*, not necessarily of the Model 1886. The two year design time was impressive, but resulted in...shortcomings. The Lebel suffered from a few major design flaws. Most notably was its internal magazine design; the Lebel could hold eight bullets in a tube-magazine, plus two, for a total of ten rounds. This was *double* most of the rifles that would follow it. However, due to its design of the tube-magazine, it also lead to achingly long reload times; this was the main downside of the weapon, but not the last. The sights on the Lebel were small, and very prone to becoming misaligned. To make things worse, the lack of protection on the barrel meant that soldiers would burn their hands after prolonged fire. These downsides were significant, *especially* the reload time, but still made the rifle worth using over black powder rifles.\n\nIt, of course, wasn't long before other countries took notice of France's new rifle design. The most iconic of these is the German 1888 Commision Rifle, more commonly known as the **Gewehr 1888.** Although this rifle lacked the capacity of the Model 1886, it was superior in almost every other aspect. The rifle was so well designed that Chinese forces were still using it in their struggle against the Japanese nearly 40 years later; and, despite the Japanese carrying rifles that were thirty years newer than the '88, the Gewehr more than matched them in ballistics performance.\n\nThe lack of design put into the Model 1886 only became more apparent as time went on. The most iconic weapons of WW1 all used smokeless powder; the Mosin Nagant, the Kar98, the Lee-Enfield, the Springfield, were using the same powder and cartridge type as the Lebel...but with up to two decades of hindsight in arms development.\n\nThe Lebel was, nonetheless, still the preferred service rifle of the French army in WW1. It was old, and had some major design flaws...but it was sturdy, and reliable, and the advantage of having eight bullets in an internal tube, plus two extra, couldn't be overstated.\n\nOf course, France had more modern rifles designed before WW1, such as the Berthier rifle, which could be clip-fed into a *straight* internal magazine, but it was found that this performed woefully poorly; three rounds was simply not a large enough capacity, and mud and grit commonly jammed the weapon in the hellish conditions of WW1 battlefields.\n\nSo, despite being old, and cumbersome to reload, and maybe not the best on the market, the Lebel Model 1886 was the weapon most French soldiers marched with-...\n\n...\n\n--hey, where are you going?

            "So, I'm not the dad, but a kid.   \n\n\nSo my bio-dad donated sperm and gave permission to be identified. Didn't even have to be after 18. In counting (because we're not sure if we've found all of us yet) there are 53 half-siblings, all his kids. My full sister and I didn't know we were donor babies until I was a freshman in college, and her a junior in high school. It was a few more years before we found out the scope of our family. As such, I never got to meet the man as he passed away in 2018, but I've been getting to know my half siblings and I'm sad to have missed him.  He apparently engaged in annual reunions and was interested in getting to know all of the kids if they (and their families) were open to it. We all support each other basically by default even though we didn't grow up together.   \n\n\nWhat's even wilder about him is that he got national news coverage for something besides his giant flock of kids. The guy got married to a woman the day he met her as a competition to be his bride in the Mall of America. It was apparently a heartfelt story and the two of them had a 20 something year marriage with 4 kids that they raised themselves. The Mall of America even has a plaque with his name on it now, so you can go find him if you really try. The man was a weirdo, but in the best way. He was kind and generous with his time and really seemed to care about \\*all\\* of his kids, or at least the ones he knew about.",
            "Oh hey, I can answer this! I'm not a donor, but I was donor conceived, along with my sister (same donor). I had a great dad and never had any desire to find out who my donor was, but I was always curious about siblings, especially when I learned there's no legal limit on how many children you can father when you donate sperm in the US.\n\nWell, one 23andMe test later, and the first result on the top of the list is a half sister in Texas. We get in contact, realize we have a TON in common, and it sparked a fire in her to find more siblings. She took an Ancestry DNA test and the top of that list was a man in California, listed as *father.*\n\nShe got in touch with him right away, turns out he's a fantastic guy. He was adopted himself and also got in contact with his birth mom as an adult, so he had been on our side of the situation and was very open and willing to talk. His wife has been super supportive of us meeting too. He has three, uh, *organically* made kids of his own (I was especially ecstatic to learn that I'm a big sister), plus we've since found three more half siblings who've all been very cool and excited to find each other. At this point, I've met all but one of them in person, and I got to meet my biological grandmother too. \n\nTL;DR I went from having a dad and one sibling to having two dads and eight siblings over the span of a couple of years. It's been pretty cool. :)",

He comes over for their birthdays and other family events. They don't refer to him as their dad really, only as a joke, but he is very close with our family.",
            "My younger bro donated multiple times unbeknownst to me.  Years later my wife and I did Ancestry.com to get an idea of how diverse our backgrounds were and wham!  Started getting contacted by lots of people (over a dozen) saying we were close relatives.   At first I was confused and asked the early ones about their parentage - they all had a similar stories.  Single mom went to a sperm bank.  Didn't take long to guess what happened.  Call my brothers and asked.  Younger one fessed up and said yes - he went multiple times.  In fact they told him he had to stop donating because there was a statistical probability his progeny could meet and date (at least they seemed ethical).  I asked if it was okay if I gave them his contact - he was fine with it.  The weird thing is that they all had his face - like one look at them and it was obvious who their father was.  Anyway, this went on for a couple of years and they all connected with each other. Seems there is over 20 now, probably more. He has met a couple of them but it was all casual.  The whole thing is super weird to the rest of family to have all these \"close\" relatives who somehow are part of the family but then again not really.",
            "I was donor-conceived. I took a DNA test, his natural-born daughter took a DNA test. So really neither of us 'gave permission'. \n There are 28 siblings so far. It was quite a shock. I wasn't expecting it and didn't know. I was 38.\n\nI've met the donor and most of the half siblings. He's a cool guy. I think it is eerie how I see many of my mannerisms in him and the other siblings. I know there is a wide range of emotions for people who experience this sort of thing, but for me it was generally positive.",

At some point, he started reaching out to the parents of his biological children to see if they wanted to meet their bio dad and now, every summer, he flies out all the children who wanted to be in contact to Yosemite, CA for a week of camping.  I remember the first, and only, time I went I was shocked to know that at least 10 of his children come every year from all around the USA to spend time with him for a week.  Apparently, the year I went with them was also the year that another one of his bio children got in contact with the uncle for the first time and spent the week out near Yosemite with all of her half brothers/sisters.\n\nI don't keep in contact with the uncle or my ex anymore, but I can assume that more of his children have contacted him each year so they can spend time getting to know their bio dad.",

Funny enough he has been cancer free almost exactly since they connected, they do say attitude is a huge recovery factor",
            "I'm a child born via sperm donation. At one point in my life I did tons of research to find him- I also did Ancestry and found some half siblings but no donor. But I thought about it more and looked over the records I did have (from the donor company). He was a college student at the time and asked not to be contacted. He probably has a family now who may or may not know about his past donation, and my gut feeling is that he did it for the money. So I've decided to let it go.",
            "Somewhat related, but I\u2019ve got a brother from another mother and have a happy story to share.\n\nMy dad had a kid with a lady in the eighties, she didn\u2019t want to keep it and he didn\u2019t want to be a single dad so he was put up for adoption and they split up and go about their days. There\u2019s likely a lot more to the story but I\u2019ve only ever been told my dads side, so I\u2019ll leave it at that.\n\nFast forward ~30 years, my dad has settled down and now has a family of 5 kids with my mom. He gets a call from a non-profit asking if he\u2019d provide his information if his kid wants to reach out. He does, and goes about his day.\n\nFast forward a few months he gets a call from his son, initially wanting to learn about possible health causes and curiosity. He ended up getting adopted by an amazing family ands doing very well for himself. He wants to come to town and meet my dad. Dad has 5 awkward conversations his kids explaining we had another brother and he was coming up to visit. (Note, a running insult when we were growing up was calling each other adopted, which pissed dad off a lot lol)\n\nFast forward 2 weeks, there was a graduation this weekend and we\u2019re having all the family over, so was a good time for him to come up, and meet the guy. Great person, hit it off and still are close with all the brothers. \n\nEverything worked out pretty good all things considered. He\u2019s a spitting image of dad and really great friend. His parents are amazing people as well. Really really lucky to have him in my life.",
            "I'm a donor child but the man didn't give permission for me to get in touch. I've always been a bit curious particularly as we now do the same job, but more about any family history of disease which might be relevant (although I assume nothing major or he wouldn't have been able to donate). \nI think I would have reached out when I was 19/20 but I wouldn't any more if I had the choice. \nI call the donor my \"father\" but my dad will always be the one who raised me and played with me and loved me even though he died when I was young. He's the one that matters, but I am grateful to those who donate enabling my family to have a child without a genetic illness.",
            "You would be surprised by how much genes incorporate into your lifestyle and even mannerisms. I met my biological father when I was 25 after never meeting or seeing him my whole life.\nThe little things were so weird.\nWe sat in a chair the same way\nWe nervously bit the skin next to our finger nails at the same time. The first drink I ever ordered was a white Russian because I thought it was interesting. Low and behold when we met he and his family bring white Russians to the lake because it's their favorite drink.\nI've kept a 2 dollar bill in my wallet since I was 14 for no reason at all. After we talked. He has had a 2 dollar bill in his wallet since he was a kid too. Just really weird things coincidences.",
            "Kind of similar. I was approached by my longtime childhood friend and she asked if I would be a donor for her and her wife. I agreed, and they asked if I would be okay with being in their life, to take pictures and be around so the child knows who I am, knows I'm a friend, and also knows I'm the biological donor, etc., so there's no questions down the road. I agreed and it's been awesome so far. He just turned two and he's a tornado (I warned them), but he's loved more than most children will be. Coming from a background in psych I figured developmentally it would be easier to be labeled as a friend, and not an unknown, questions of turmoil of where did I come from, etc. I guess we'll see.\n\nEdited for clarity",
            "I was a donor, and when this happened to me, it was ok. Four separate offspring at various times over the course of about six months contacted me, all just as they turned 18 and records were open to them. It was cool for me to see pictures of them and how much they looked like me. It was also good to hear the stories from their parents of how I helped them conceive a much-needed child, which I really appreciated. But that was all. A few nice, polite emails were exchanged, some kindnesses, and then we stopped emailing. I didn't want or expect more, I'm just glad to know they existed, and that they got to connect with their biological heritage. I supposedly (as far as the donor system estimates) have a lot more out there, but I expect these are the only ones that will contact me, since I assume most of them will want to do it as soon as they can and all of my donations happened within an 18-month span.",

After the second \u2018turkey baster\u2019 insemination, they got pregnant. They have a beautiful little girl. I went on to have my own 2 daughters and they then came to me 2 years ago and asked again. This time, it was a bigger decision but my partner knew the full story and was more than happy to allow us to try a second time which was again successful! They had a boy this time. \n\nWe\u2019ve spoke extensively and we all have no issue with them knowing I\u2019m the donor. My kids will also know when the time comes.

Obviously we won\u2019t be able to stop the whole \u2018who\u2019s my father\u2019 but we have agreed that when the time does come, they will be sat down with my own 2 children as well and the explained that the situation of I\u2019m not a father to them and that it was purely to allow them to have children and that they aren\u2019t missing out by having 2 mums rather than a mum and dad. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to type out but I\u2019m sure you guys will get it. Thankfully, they look nothing like my own children, that could be awkward considering we live in the same neighbourhood. Also, I have no attachment or need to be anything to these children. May seem horrible to say but this was my gift to 2 amazing parents and they are doing fantastic, I don\u2019t need to be there for them!\n\nEdit: thanks for all the kind words but really, I\u2019m just helping 2 people live the best life they can.

He did infact attempt to find his biological dad... because he needed to know some things about his genetic health that could really only be answered if he knew the other half.\n\n\nAnd what we came to was essentially a 'who knows' thanks to this.

            "So I did actually do this. Basically I had just graduated college my girlfriend and I needed some extra cash and I said, well this is a cool Idea. I have always wanted kids and my girlfriend can no longer have biological children due to bad endometriosis tearing up her uterus. From a purely biological perspective I think it's kind of neat that my genetics are out there in the world possibly. As for why I said it was fone to contact me, I figure at that point it's up to the kid if they want to have any kind of relationship, and it would suck to know that someone could knowingly help create you and not only not want anything to do with you but actively prevent you from learning about them.\n\nAnyways this was about 8 years ago so remind me in 10 years and I'll let you know if it comes up.\n\n(Btw I do have a son, he's not biologically mine, but I still love his adorable ass).",

            "My wife had fertility issues and we looked at receiving a donor egg. When one was lined up, I felt I needed to donate sperm as a way of paying it forward. But then my wife became pregnant with her own egg. I feel like our good karma paid off. And our only child will have half siblings.",
            "I started donating almost exactly 10 years when I was living on the west coast. I had only been exposed to the concept of sperm donating through movies when one would do it for gas money on road trips or when you were in dire need for fast cash: it wasn't like that at all. It took over a month and many unpaid donations to even qualify to become a donor. They did a very through screening process to make sure your sperm very viable and would survive the freezing process. Then they tested it to make sure you weren't a carrier of potential known diseases that could be passed down. After all of that I started donating 2-3 times a week for a few months until I ended up moving across the country to go to grad school. I said I was open to being contacted once they were 18 and was excited about that prospect when I would be in my 40s. \n\nOne day I randomly logged on to Facebook and checked my messages. I had a message request from a random person in Australia which just seemed like spam (I'm a citizen of the USA but was living in Germany at the time). Instead of immediately deleting the message, I read it and a lady explained that curiosity got the better of her and she tried to find the donor of her 2 kids. She used the little information that she knew about the donor and slowly linked the info to me. I even had tbt photos on my profile that looked like her kids. It was a match. I wasn't upset, but rather excited as I now knew more information about who and how I had helped. That was two years ago and now we communicate a couple times every year to update each other about what had happened in our lives. \n\nIt's really exciting to see the growth of the two offspring that I helped produce. They're both under 10 and they know who I am so they'll be able to grow into the understanding of our different than normal relationship. The clinic told me that I had birthed 7 children in total so 5 are still unknown to me at this time. Overall it has been a good process and I'm really happy that I took part in it. Would do it again and I still get emails from the clinic telling me that if I'm ever back in the area to consider becoming a donor again.",
            "Not me, but a good friend... kids had contacted each other already (and some were siblings because the mom used his stuff several times). He met them all and everyone gets along. Seems truly good for everyone in their case. Dad is retired and road trips a lot, so when he's near one they have coffee and catch up IRL.",
            "My sister and her wife just had a baby girl. My sister-in-law carried the baby, and they asked me to be the donor. I'm a 25 year old grad student, who hopefully will have kids one day, but wasn't planning on having any right now. I didn't have any strong feelings for yes or no at the beginning. With the new prevelance of incest porn (both actual porn, and in shows like game of thrones) I was a little concerned people would feel like it was wrong. Like the child might have to deal with people telling her its gross, or I would have to deal with it when trying to start my own family. Some google searching told me that other couples had asked for siblings to be donors and that was enough for me to feel like it was normal. I think there was one, where a couple used a turkey baster to do the incemination.... don't do that, work with a sperm bank. Also, when I went the sperm bank I was jacking off in a cement room sitting on a folding chair... its a weird experience, but it isn't weird because it's incest. The strongest reason I found for doing it was that the child would look like my sister. We're six years apart, but there are photos of us together that people have said we could be twins. Parents should love their children regardless of appearance, but currently \"Oh she looks just like you!!\" is such a frequent interaction and source of pride. Nearly every other parent gets to enjoy that, my sister should too. Amazingly, the baby looks exactly like my sister. It's even more obvious when comparing the pictures of the baby to pictures of my sister as a baby. It makes my sister really happy, and that makes me happy. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy donorship is a weirdly open secret. When the child grows up she will know, because not sharing the information can be harmful. There will be different age appropriate explanations whenever necessary. Then, because it's not supposed to be taboo information the rest of the family knows. My mom shared the information with a few of her friends which sort of pissed me off. It's still personal and they don't need to know. Aside from my doctor and  therapist, I haven't shared this information with anyone, until now. If anything I said is strange, this is one of the first times I'm saying it out loud. I'm posting this on my alt account so no one can find it when randomly looking through my comment history. I guess I still have to work on being more comfortable with the information.",
            "I am on the other side - I am the product of a donor. Not really what this thread is about, but I did not get permission; instead I found my donor father via his brother who is on 23andMe. I didn't find him until well past my 30s. I ended up speaking with him over the phone, and then with my donor father, and it was nice. I am apparently his only donor offspring and he has 3 other adult children (who are all my half-brothers -- which is obvious, but weird). In the end, it was a disappointing experience since his wife did not like that I was reaching out and she felt threatened for some reason. On top of it, I have a difficult relationship with my (real) parents  and so, I think I set my expectations to high going in, with hopes of forming some deeper relationship, which will likely never happen. It at least gave me closure on a very weird aspect of my existence.",

            "Ok, so this story doesn\u2019t *completely* fit but this might be a good place to share it.\n\nI always knew that my mom had fertility issues and did IVF in order to have me but I didn\u2019t know I was a sperm donor baby until about three years ago. It was a surprise to everyone in my family.\n\nWild to not know for that long, but it gets even wilder.\n\nI\u2019ve always been interested in geneology and got an ancestry DNA kit from a relative for my birthday a little over three years ago. I was excited to finally get my results back and start building my family tree. However, when I got the results back I found that I matched up with a lot of my moms relatives that had done the test, but none of my dad\u2019s. I tried to shrug it off as the technology not being good or specific enough, but I couldn\u2019t explain all these individuals who were popping up as a strong match as a half sibling. Eventually one of them messaged me and informed me that they all had the same father who was a sperm donor and that they were so happy to find another half sibling. I was a little freaked out but eventually confronted my parents about it and they were completely shocked. My father had supposedly given a sperm sample for the IVF and they had never even considered using a donor. \n\nEventually my mom tracked down some paperwork from the IVF clinic they used and we did some research and found that the clinic closed shortly after my birth after being involved in a few different lawsuits relating to mixup of IVF samples. At that point they had been closed for over two decades, so there wasn\u2019t really much we could do. Everyone always commented that I had features that matched my father, so it was never even imagined that this could be possible.\n\nLuckily, my family took it in stride and it hasn\u2019t changed anything. On top of that I have 25 half siblings and counting who are all really cool, wonderful people. We have a Facebook group and are hoping to meet up some time soon. It\u2019s also been cool to see nature vs nurture in action. A lot of us have pretty much the same eyes, noses, and foreheads and work in similar fields or have similar interests. Some of us even went to the same colleges and never even knew it.\n\nI\u2019ve chatted with my biological father online and he\u2019s a really cool guy. He\u2019s incredibly kind and personable and we share many personality traits and interests. Things seemed pretty crazy for a while, but I\u2019m happy to know and to have gotten to know my half siblings and he\u2019s been happy to get to know us and learn about our lives.\n\nEdit: to add a little more craziness, some of my half siblings did the math and due to certain allotments and restrictions, we figured out there could be as many as 75 of us!",

The family was devastated and as you can imagine, losing a twin has got to be incredibly difficult.

She's due to give birth to a girl next month, in May, which I'm excited about.\n\nThe other is E, who's husband died. She managed to conceive from his frozen sperm after his death, but wanted another child. She is two months pregnant at the moment. The first scan showed a heartbeat, so all good so far.\n\nI'm in the UK. Both families live within about half an hour of me.\n\nFor both sets, we have written agreements. If there's a dispute later on, the first thing the magistrate does is ask if there is a pre-existing agreement, and unless the agreement is unfair, rules with the agreement. I have no responsibilities and no rights, but get on very well with all three C1, C2 and E (who know about each other). The aim is that the children will know about me and I'll be around for birthdays and such the like and occasional visits. They will know why I'm there as soon as they are able to start to understand.\n\nI'm 50, don't have any children myself, and I'm happy with the setup. For me it fulfills a sense of completeness about having made offspring without having to spend the next 20 years of my life (until 70) looking after them. I'm looking forward very much to being cuckoo dad. Exciting times!\n\nEdit: In the UK you can't change for donations, except for reasonable travel expenses. For C1+C2 it was a 50 mile round trip, at 15p/mile, so they gave me \u00a320/month for three visits. It wasn't through the NHS. I met both families through a website called prideangel.",

I have been with my current SO for 12 years and neither of us have any intentions on being parents so I thought this was an excellent way for me to continue the blood line as well as give two of my favorite people a child they wanted so badly.

We drafted contracts that essentially say that I will have zero responsibility for the child but the child will be fully aware I am the biological father from day one. \n\nI live on the coast and they live near Chicago, so logistics were very tough.

So many people look at me like I'm crazy and always ask how I am handling it. But really, to me it's no different than having a cousin or other close sibling. I subscribe to the belief that the parents are who raised the kid, and they are doing an incredible job so far.\n\nWe are actually trying for number 2 now with the other mom. Hopefully this try doesn't take as long.",
            "So after one child and almost loosing my now ex wife to a cesarean scar pregnancy.  We had to go the IVF with a surrogate route.   That whole situation was odd, but I ended up with my son.  So weird or not I\u2019m happy about it.   Fast forward to cheating, drugs, hidden credit cards and debt.   We get divorced and one to the things we have to decide on is the 8 other embryos sitting in cold storage at the fertility clinic.  After a long back and forth with lawyers.   She changes her mind from destroying them to side with me on allowing them to be donated to other families that are having issues, for a concession in the divorce.   I contact the clinic and I have to go in and fill out a ton of paperwork and one of the legal releases, are if the child what\u2019s to contact you upon their 18th birthday are you okay with that.   I know my ex checked no, I however went the other route.  So in roughly 16-17 years I could have up to 8 kids reaching out to get to know one half of their genetic makeup.  Which in theory could put my kids in an odd situation.  Technically speaking, they would be full siblings.  Having the same genes, but baked in a different oven.   \n\nThis story actually turned into a dating question, when I had been on like three dates.   What would you do if we were at a store and some kid that looked exactly like me comes walking down the isle.",
            "Donor-conceived child here!\n\nI was conceived in the 90\u2019s, and at the time non-anonymous donation was not common. I\u2019ve known I was donor-conceived since I was 13 years old. I had always been curious about the donor and any potential siblings, but was too scared to dig deep or do any testing. In 2019, my mom gifted me a 23&me kit for Christmas and my results matched me with 2 half siblings. One of them had done a DNA test through another service and connected with the donor\u2019s father, who then connected her to the donor (let\u2019s call him John). I was also connected with two more half siblings via 23&me about a month later. \n\nJohn and I started talking through email, and discovered that he grew up literally 30 minutes from me. He is married and has one daughter with his wife. They moved out of state a few years ago, but they regularly come back to visit family, and so I\u2019ve had the opportunity to meet John & his family twice now, along with his wife\u2019s two sisters & their husbands (who live in the same city). I\u2019ve also met 2 of my donor-conceived half siblings. \n\nI have an amazing relationship with John & his family. The best way to describe it is somewhere in between family & close family friends. As for my siblings, we video chat about once a month and have a \u201csibs\u201d group text. Pre-covid, we were planning to do a group vacation in the summer to meet each other. We\u2019re all vaccinated at this point, and so it\u2019s currently on the table for this year. \n\nMy mom and dad are fully aware of my relationship with everyone in my \u201cdonor fam\u201d, and they both think it\u2019s a really neat thing. At one point I worked up the courage to talk to my dad about how he felt, and he didn\u2019t seem upset or bothered. I let him know he\u2019d always be my dad and John will always be John. Honestly, I can\u2019t imagine a world where things could have gone any better. One of the most interesting things I\u2019ve found is how much genetics truly play a role in who are as people. Every single one of us grew up in different households, but yet we all have cross-over in interests, personality traits, and quirks that, put together, are too specific to be coincidence. \n\nI love them all and get so excited every time I think about what the growth of our relationship will look like over time.",
            "My male cousin (42) has been recently contacted by 5 biological children from his time as a sperm donor in his college days. All 5 of them are around the same age  (18-19) and all came from his 1 year stint as a donor. They all reached out to him after records opened up for them.  He has briefly emailed back and forth with all who have contacted him and put a few in contact with each other. \n\nThe real kicker? All 5 so far have been boys/men. He also has 3 children with his current wife (3, 4 and 7); they are all girls. He likes to joke that although he\u2019ll never *raise* a son. .he has an entire basketball team of them out there.",
            "Back in 2015 I donated sperm, and in 2017 a couple reached out to thank me for my donation as they had a baby girl from my donation.We swapped a few emails about family history and pics of me as a young lad.\n\nIt was lovely to hear so early from them, I really wasn't expecting any contact until they reached 18 and went looking on their own.\n\nWe swap pictures every year and now they have a baby boy too from my donation which is cool. \nThey are a lesbian couple and wanted to make contact early so they could be open to their kids about who their biological dad is.\n\nAs of today there are 7 kids from my donations which is neat.\nIn Australia you can only have 10 (successful) pregnancies from your donations, there's two more 'underway' so will be 9 soon.\n\nIts been great reading everyone's stories on here, it's a great thing to do donating sperm to help others create a family who otherwise couldn't, highly recommend anyone who can to donate !",
            "My biological father was an anonymous donor who did not give this type of permission. What he did do, however, was sign up on 23&me with a public profile. Imagine my surprise when I got my results back! \n\nNever reached out to him, but I now know his name, his brother's name, and that we both have similar careers even though my moms have a totally unrelated profession.\n\nHe made his profile private shortly after, but it was too little too late. I know who you are LS!\n\nAlso, I found out my sister and I have a half brother and half sister on the other side of the country, so that was cool.",

            "I actually went to high school with a girl who at 18 found out her father was a sperm donor. I\u2019m not exactly sure how it happened but all the siblings (18!) found out about each other, contacted the sperm donor (who now has a family of his own) and they all got along swimmingly. They even take family vacations to Mexico and whatnot and it seems like a healthy, but interesting, dynamic.",
            "I'm a PI who specializes in forensic genealogy.  I donate my time to several adoption groups whose members are looking for their family.  There are thousands upon thousands of them.  \n\nThrough this work I discovered that there is enormous demand for sperm donors, so I became what is known as a \"known donor,\" meaning that my contact, health and history information is available to potential recipients to browse in free databases.  They decide from there if they want to use me, and we sign a contract, the terms of which include keeping them updated with my contact information in case the child ever wants to contact me.  I've had six donor children so far, all well under 18, still.  I have met two of them, but they don't know who I am aside from a friend of their mothers', and likely won't remember me when they're older.  A couple of the parents are even friends with each other and have playdates.  All of the children's families are on facebook, and I check up on them every once in awhile to see how they're progressing.  A couple parents send me updates occasionally. \n\nIt's a wonderful feeling to help people like this, and my genes benefit as well, so it's not completely altruistic, though I believe it started out from there.  I know that some of the children will seek me out when they're older, and I'm looking forward to it.  I have three of my own who will learn about their half siblings when they're older, and will probably look forward to meeting them, as well.\n\nEdit:  I forgot!  One of the couples, after the first child, asked if I would donate to the other mother.  I did, and she recently gave birth to the first girl of the bunch.  Both siblings are blood related but come from a different mother. I thought that was pretty awesome.",
            "Semi-related, one of my exes was the child of a sperm donor. While we were still in a relationship, I got him one of those dna kits (23andMe) for his birthday.  \n\nAfter he got the results, he received a message from a woman on the site asking if he was a sperm donor baby. When he said yes, she replied \"Welcome to the family\" and then added him to a group of about 250 people. He found out he had a *lot* of half-siblings that day haha",

            "My cousin wanted me to be the donor for him and his wife. He did a lot of drugs in his youth that turns out, sterilized him. I have no problem with him or his wife, but opted not to. When my cousin called before Christmas in 2019, I was wracked by the decision. I gave it a few weeks and waited until after Christmas, since I didn't want to either ruin or make someone's holiday season.\n\nI decided not to. While on the phone originally my cousin had stated he'd rather it be a family member than \"some turbanhead or Muslim or something\". In the end that was the crux of it. I dont think I'd be able to stay silent on issues of racism around what would genetically be my son or daughter. I still think about it. I have no plans for kids of my own, and my cousin has come a long way from where he was. I dunno, maybe if I get asked again I'll consider it. It was definitely a weird moment.",

            "I've only donated to close friends. Two of my female friends in a relationship wanted to have kids but obviously they couldn't without help. They asked me and I said sure. What's funny is the one trying to get pregnant wasn't having any success so the other tried and they both ended up pregnant. They had two kids exactly 1 week apart. It's happened a couple times since then. Now there are two 7 year olds, one 5 year old, and two 1 year olds (twins) that I've helped with. I've decided to \"retire\" from the helping business now. I gave them all permission to tell all of the children who I am when they get older if they want. I've stayed in their live's since I'm very close friends with their mother's but not in any parental role. Also, it was artificial insemination in case anyone is curious. I didn't have sex with any of them. They handed me a cup and I handed it back. After that it was all their's."

Two people meet and fall in love. They each inspire one another based on their interests and achievements, it's part of what makes them fall in love. But slowly, over time, they let those hobbies go. Stress gets in the way. Bills pile up. And then one day they find themselves wondering why they ever loved this person in the first place.

They didn\u2019t want to go, obviously, but they didn\u2019t come from money and all worked to support their families. If they got arrested they\u2019d lose their jobs and their families would lose their income. So they decided on a different plan to get out of going. \n\nThey would drive to get their medical checks together, and on the way there they would drive the car into a tree. The plan was to get too injured to get sent to war, but not so injured as to be permanently crippled, and it had to look like an accident so nobody got arrested. This was in country Western Australia, so they were all going to say they swerved to miss a kangaroo, and hit the tree. \n\nMy grandfather was driving, his friend was in the passenger seat, and the other two were in the back. His brother was behind the passenger seat. They hit the tree doing about 40kph - enough to be serious. A broken leg for my grandfather, a broken arm for the guy behind him, and broken ribs all around. They definitely weren\u2019t going to war. \n\nThe problem was that for maximum impact, and because this was rural Australia in the sixties, they weren\u2019t wearing seatbelts. And nobody found them or their car for an hour or so. And nobody considered internal injuries in this plan. And my grandfathers brother bled to death from a ruptured spleen in the back seat. He was dead before they got to a hospital. \n\nMy grandfather never forgave himself, and he never talked about it. My grandma was the only one he ever told, as far as we know, and she didn\u2019t tell my mother and I until long after his death. We found a small box in their bedroom when we were cleaning out the house after she died last year. It had a clipping from the local newspaper at the time about the accident. It said that they had swerved to miss a roo, and called it a tragedy. \n\nI don\u2019t think my mother told any of her siblings, so technically this is still the family secret.

My father's tour ended while he was in Hawaii. He met a woman there and called my mom in America, asking for a divorce. He wanted to take back his recent marriage to her - with a kid on the way - because he had a hot one-night stand.\n\nMy mother was already scared, being in a new country, not knowing much English. Add to this that she was pregnant, about to give birth, and her husband was dumping her.\n\nMy Texan uncle got on a plane to Hawaii, prepared to kick my father's ass. He somehow talked my father into being a man and taking responsibility for his wife and child. The fact that the fling dumped his ass surely helped.

My dad has no idea. \n\nI asked her why she waited so long to tell me. Like, what if she went missing? and she said \"Oh, honey.

Kind of a hide n seek style game. She would yell \u201chit the deck!\u201d randomly and we would all drop and find a hiding spot.

Always refused to talk about the army. I learned later that he was dishonorably discharged after injury. Turns out the Sargent in his squad was an absolute bastard.  He had to go behind enemy lines to set a post up, and the plane was flying too low for a safe jump. He protested it to the Sargent who proceeded to shove him out of the plane after calling him a coward. Both my grandfather and his spotter partner were seriously injured in the landing. His partner (never knew him) was paralyzed and lost a leg. My grandfather broke both of his, his arm, hand, and some ribs. \n\nThey both were rescued shortly after and taken to a military hospital. That\u2019s not what got him discharged, though. Turns out the Sargent showed up to visit them in the infirmary, and my grandfather punched him square in the face with his only good hand, twice. If his only army buddy we ever knew is to be believed, (he was also visiting at the time) he floored the bastard. After that, and on top of his injuries, the army sent him home for the rest of the war. \n\nWe found out later after he passed and we had to go through his stuff a bunch of newspaper and article clippings about the folks involved he had kept. the Sargent was also discharged after a similar incident cost the lives of two other members of his squad a year later that weren\u2019t so lucky.  The man apparently drunk himself to death years later. We found all these written but unsent letters to his Sargent, we found photos of my grandfathers squad and the two that died with him. It was heartbreaking.  I never knew any of this. He was such a fun, kind, and goofy guy you\u2019d never think anything like this would happen to him.

Since her then boyfriend was an alcoholic and forced himself drunk on my grandmother several times she got pregnant and since that was not done in the 50\u2019s, they had to get married as soon as possible. After their first child, they ended up having four more kids, one didn\u2019t survive childbirth, but the other three lived. \n\n\nDuring this time, my grandmothers husband was still an alcoholic and very, VERY abusive. She had to literally flee away from him, from her family to survive. She would definitely ended up dead if she didn\u2019t. She also met my grandfather during this time, and they fell in love. She left her kids with her mother, who had custody of the kids anyways (that\u2019s how they rolled back then), my grandfather sold the only thing he had which was a small moped so he could help her escape her husband. \n\n\nMany, many years later, when my grandma had divorced her husband, married my grandpa, had three more kids with him, grandkids etc (yay me!), and moved back to the hometown, they also had reconnected with her first four daughters and everything was going well, except for one thing. \n\n\nIt was a tiny town, everybody knows everybody over there and rumors spread fast. And there was a rumor about my grandmother from back in the days of her first husband. The rumor was that she had some sort of fling with another man in town (not my grandpa) and one of her first four daughters was his. The daughters didn\u2019t know about this until they heard, asked my grandma about it and she was flabbergasted. Told them it wasn\u2019t true at all, that it definitely didn\u2019t happen and that this should be the end of it. \n\n\nIt didn\u2019t sit right with the daughters, so they did a dna test. And then the results came in. There it was, proof that the gossip wasn\u2019t actually gossip, but it was true. Daughter number three was a half sister of the other three. So they went to my grandmother again. They showed her the proof, it said very clearly that one of them wasn\u2019t their fathers.

Mom took care of my grandma til the end and was the one who handled the funeral arrangements when my grandma passed two years ago. She never asked for the house back. It's worth millions. Nobody told me any of this until I was thirty.",

We ended up winning the case in the end, but it cost so much that we couldn't afford to keep his $3M house anymore.",

Terry asked if Joan would postpone the wedding just until Isis got better so she could attend.\n\nJoan instead called off the wedding entirely over the phone. The dark bit is that when Terry went home to see her, their home was cleaned out. Only Terry's meager belongings remained. Even their bed was gone. \n\nTerry called Joan. No answer. He called her folks. No answer. He went to her folks' place only to find it completely empty. Not a trace of them was left behind. No note, no nothing.

My dad had a little sister and she got run over by a car right in front of him when they were on their way to school. She was only 10 years old or something and my dad was around 12.

            "Turns out the reason my mom's parents divorced wasn't  because they \"fell out of love\" but because he had an affair with another married woman from church. The families had known each other for years and my mom was good friends with the other woman's kids. They ended up getting married less than a year after their respective divorces (they each had three kids). It was especially sad because my step grandmother's (the Other Woman) children suffered pretty badly because neither she nor her ex husband were functional adults. Their kids grew up fast and the oldest daughter basically became a mom and maid at the ripe old age of 12 since dad refused to step up.\n\nMy bio grandmother, bless her, didn't tell a soul about this. When I told her I knew, she sort of smiled and nodded like it was a relief that someone else knew beside her. I can't imagine keeping a secret like that for so long and not being able to tell your kids that it really wasn't your fault that you divorced and upended their lives.\n\nSo yeah, learned that little gem while helping with my step grandmother's hospice care this past fall. She was always a chatty person but end of life drugs really amped it up. It was pretty shocking because my grandfather is a pretty laid back, kind, straight laced church person and you never suspect him of cheating. The worst part is that in my shock and confusion, I told my mother about it and it was pretty obvious she had no clue prior to my telling her. I really wish I could take that back.\n\nEdit: She wasn't literally a mom at 12, her dad just refused to learn how to cook or clean so naturally that fell to the other females in the house, his daughters.\n\nAnd yes, step grandmother was the Other Woman. We had a great relationship, but that would have been different if I'd known what I know now. Kinda sucks when shit like this comes up and changes how you see people. I still love her and my grandfather, but damn, they caused so much suffering for their kids for the sake of being together and love.",

Thankfully there were enough witnesses and it was a different time - two men had a fair fight and one died by a horrible accident. \n\nGrandpa was acquited and went on to do some stuff in the war and with the Paras that is still under lock and key 80 years later. \n\nGrandpa has been going for years now and all this came out a few years ago completely by accident. It was pretty strange knowing the man I loved as Grandpa killed a bloke with one punch.

            "My grandmother lived in a conservative and rural area in Belgium when she was a kid. During a fair she had an erotic adventure in the bushes - as any healthy 18-year-old should experience. Weeks later it turned out she was pregnant. She tried to hide it for her family and the community in her village for a long time, but when it became clear that she would have a child as an unmarried girl, she became a public enemy. She was booed and insulted, her house was pelted. Her parents were insulted all the time, being called sinners. She was basically banned from her youth village for having premarital sex.\n\nAs a single mom, she had to start a new life in the other side of the country. She soon got to know my grandfather, who accepted the child as his. My father was born much later, and it was not until after my grandfather's death that he was told that his brother was actually a half-brother. It was never talked about within the family. My father always tells me how much of a badass his mother was. It was very unconventional for a woman to work at an office at that time, but she did. She was a career woman. \n\nAfter my grandfather passed away, my grandmother moved back to her childhood village. Some sort of revenge, I've always thougt. She got married again in her old age - with a guy she was in love with when she was 16 - and she looked damn fabulous. She was the proudest woman I've ever met. A feminist without making an effort. She just really didn't give a fuck. May she rest in peace.",

I have 2 other siblings, both older than my brother and I. I broke down and called my oldest sister and confessed what happened to her. She broke down crying and told me about our dark family cycle... my oldest sister used to get molested by my grandfather, she then stated molesting my other sister, who stated molesting my brother who did the same to me.

Dad practiced in the front office while the older back office was kept in pristine shape but unused as far as I could tell.  I thought it was out of some kind of respect for his step mother who continued to live above it.\n\nMany years later I was comparing old dental instruments scavenged from his office with my younger brother.

            "Throw away account for obvious reasons.\n\nWhen I was growing up my father used to make frequent trips overseas to Europe. We are talking 3, 4 times a year. It was always glossed over when I asked anyone where he went or why and he was usually gone a couple weeks to a month. Then the trips stopped entirely around when I was fourteen. We weren't poor but we were not well off enough to pay for the trips but they happened. \n\nFast forward four years and I'm eighteen and getting ready to move out and my dad takes me on a drive to a nearby town. It's like a 2 hour drive with no reason other than being scenic so I figured something was up.\n\nAnyways he lays out this whole thing for me. Apparently our family was a branch of a significantly larger family in Italy. Way back when like 7 or 10 generations back the core family had eight daughters who all married off and started their own families. My dad hinted that the sisters father had left some huge inheritance, but it was only to be given to the \"surviving family\" so for the next like couple hundred years the descendants of these women were constantly trying to kill each other, and when not killing each other out breed each other. There were all these stories he told me of like cousins being hidden on ships and smuggled far off only to come back twenty years later to kill whoever killed their father, it was some really operatic shit.\n\nAnyways, shortly after I was born my dad found out that one of the remaining cousins of one of the branches was still alive and actively plotting to try and kill our family, his brother was stuck in Venezuela and his sister in Argentina for other reasons so they would pay for my dad to fly out to the latest spotting of this guy and he'd spend a couple weeks or a month looking for him. Guy tried to straight up kill him several times too, he showed me some gnarly scars he Def didn't have when I was younger. Anyways, in 98 he finally caught the guy in Sardinia and strangled him to death and buried him under 3 foot of gravel off of some mine tailings. He described it in a way that made me believe him. He also said it wasn't the first relative he had to kill. \n\nHe wanted me to know so that if he died under weird circumstances or someone made threats against me or my family I would know why.\n\nWe finished our drive and picked up some deli meat and a loaf of bread on the way back and stopped and made sandwiches on the trunk of the car and we discussed our plans for the evening. He and I were going deer hunting that season and he wanted me to go spotting with him thst evening up one of the local mountains. I had a class at college I could have blown off but I told him I wanted to make it to this class because it was a subject I liked and it was important.\n\nThat evening about midway through the class police knocked on the door and asked me to step outside, some hikers had found my dad dead as a doornail up the mountain. He'd been dead at least a few hours but was by a major trail and near his truck, had his cell phone. They believed it was a massive heart attack that took him before he had a chance. He did have a really bad heart and wasn't in great health so it was believable but he hadn't even gotten anywhere strenuous and it was super suspicious hikers just \"found\" him on the mountain within a few hours, near a trail or not.\n\nI pushed my mom for an autopsy but she refused, was too upset and said she just wanted to handle his cremation.\n\nNothing odds happened since but I'll probably wonder till I die what happened with him.\n\n\nSorry if you were a expecting some story of buried treasure or supernatural power. He said he never saw nor heard of an inheritance and no one in the family had ever heard of anything. No one knows how or why someone would track it to pay out. It seems like after the first generation people just kept killing each other because it was what they had always done.",

He wasn't happy with the fact that my grandmother decided to donate everything under her name to charity. Made a big fuss and everything right in front of her coffin. My uncle (my cousin's father) gave him a big and loud tight slap across his face, and just blurted everything out. Apparently, my grandmother knew right from the start, but because my cousin was her first grandchild and grandson, she decided to \"protect\" him by playing along and lying to all of us. The thing is, growing up, my grandmother would always compare us to my cousin - The Golden Boy of the Family. If our grades were not up to her standards, or if we misbehaved a little,  she would then not very kindly remind us of how stupid we are, and that we should be more like our cousin who was studying/working really hard in England. Sorry but not sorry, I did not shed a tear at her funeral. \n\nIf anyone is wondering, my grandmother rented a condo apartment for him to stay all those years while he was in \"England\".

I never heard either of them say a bad thing about the other one.\n\nWhen I turned 18, I started asking more about their relationship, just out of curiosity. Turns out, my dad cheated on my mom when she was pregnant with me, and she left him afterwards. My mom didn't want to tell me because she didn't want me hating my dad, and not having a relationship with him.\n\nThe fact that I went 18 years without knowing this, and never once heard my mom talk bad about my father, and actively took time out of her free time to drive me to see him, is mind boggling.

They still had another witness though, and she said that my client was hitting the alleged victim, so it wasn\u2019t looking great. The prosecutor and I were talking before court started, hanging out by the courtroom doors, when the witness walked in. She looked right at my client (who was sitting not five feet from me), then scanned the room and said \u201cwhere is [client name]?\u201d The prosecutor and I looked at each other for a minute, and then he said he needed to check on something.

            "I was testifying for the defense; a young man had been arrested for assaulting a police officer, allegedly throwing bottles during some unrest in Oakland following the verdict in the trial for the cop who shot Oscar Grant in the back on the BART platform. I had been there filming stuff, caught his arrest on video and his brother found my footage on youtube and asked me to testify. I had only seen bottles being thrown from this one corner of a parking lot, from behind me, with the bottles flying over my shoulder. The defendant was in a group in front of me.\n\nOn the stand, the prosecutor seemed to think I knew the defendant and was there basically commiting perjury on his behalf. I explained why I had been there that night, that I had never seen this guy before, hadn't been coached by the defense, and hadn't been paid other than a small amount for my travel and time. Finally, exasperated after much back and forth, the prosecutor says, \"Well if you don't know the defendant then why are you here testifying for him?\" I thought for a moment and said, \"I guess I just wouldn't want an innocent man to get convicted for a crime he didn't commit.\" \n\nHe got visibly flustered and quickly moved on, trying to insinuate that if I didn't know him, how would I have known to be looking in his direction to see whether he was throwing things, and I tried explaining that if you're looking at a group of random people, and one of them throws something you will naturally fixate your attention on that person. But because nobody in that group threw anything, there was nothing to notice in the first place; it looked like the police just grabbed him at random. \n\nThey rested, the defense attorney bought me lunch down the street and then he got a call from his colleague that the jury took all of 10 minutes to return a \"not guilty\" verdict on the assault charge. They said my response was legendary though, and that no attorney should ever ask a question they don't already know the answer to. This guy just seemed to have a narrative about a prior relationship to the defendant that he assumed was accurate, and was trying to call my credibility into question.",

So I was in court over custody of my oldest and her moms attorney was trying to paint me as a hypocrite for being an addict. I denied it all on the stand and he said \"Now James I must remind you that you are under oath and by denying this you are committing perjury\". I stared him dead in the face and said \"My name is Bill, James is my brother.\"  Even the judge laughed at him and the only reason we didn't bring it up sooner (we knew he submitted it as evidence but had no idea why) was because I really wanted to know what he was up to with it all.",

We had pretty good facts but it was *mostly* based on testimony of the parties. My client was way more reputable as a witness so I was feeling confident.\n\n10 minutes before the hearing, my client shows up. I give her a last minute prep on what to expect and then she says \"I'm glad I'm going through with this. I can't deal with it any more and he's just getting worse.

We sit, the judge asks if either side has additional evidence, and I ask for permission to play the voicemail. Ex boyfriend, who didn't have an attorney, didn't object, so I played the whole nasty two minute rant in open court.\n\nJudge goes \"We're going to take a brief recess before I issue my ruling.

It was the only section of the store without surveillance camera coverage. They were in the back room for about two minutes and seventeen seconds, per the timestamp on the videos.\n\nOf the many arguments the defense put on, one was there was no way there was enough time for anything to happen.

            "I represented an elderly indian couple, who didn't speak English very well and owned a rental property. They had a tenant at the time who had not paid rent in over six months. They had tried to evict her on their own, but when they got to court, the tenant produced some hand-written notes which they had given her the year prior thanking her for payment (but they failed to date the notes.) Of course, the tenant added recent dates herself. The tenant also produced a partial certified check receipt, but most of it was illegible. Anyway, because of their poor english, they had difficulty understand the questions and giving intelligent answers, so they lost the initial case. They hired me to help address all of the various lies that the tenant was putting forth. \n\nAnyway, we refiled. I had my clients pull the banking records, so we could show the date that the certified check was actually deposited into their account. \n\nThe plan was simple, let the tenant make the same arguments and then present the banking statements showing the deposit date. My clients also found a photo copy of one of their notes, but it was undated (unlike the copy the tenant presented the last time).\n\nWell, when the judge finally understood that the things the tenant had presented occured the year before, his cheeks turned bright red and he asked the tenant \"what year did you make this payment?\" The tenant started saying something like she couldn't be exactly sure when... and the Judge cut her off again in a very loud voice \"what year?!\" \n\nNeedless to say the clients got their eviction granted.\n\nBonus content: When the tenant arrived at court I watched as she got out of her car, walked to the back and pulled out a wheelchair and proceeded to stay in that wheelchair until the case was over. Once the Judge left the courtroom, she folded-up the wheelchair and carried it to her car mumbling that she \"hates f###ing lawyers.\" Anyway, that was a very satisfying day.",

Then the person who was leading the lynch mob against my client around town for the last year testified that she had been in the apartment between the two visits by the cop to evaluate the scene.

Got a shitty hand-written receipt that, believe it or not, was itemized.\n\nWent home, googled, found that they violated the law in three separate ways: towed illegally; illegally refused to accept credit cards; and had multiple charges that the law called 'unreasonable' like dolly fees and load / unload fees.\n\nTook them to small claims court. \n\nThe judge began by asking the tow yard owner about his relationship with the property owner and how the decision was made to tow my car. \n\n\"Oh,\" the slimy tow truck dude answered, \"my cousin works there, if he says tow, I tow. It's a hundred percent legal!\" \n\nThe judge's eyebrows begin to rise.\n\n\"But,\" the dude continued, \"BUT what I detest the most your honor is this ASSHOLE claiming I don't take credit cards. I'm a businessman! I take credit cards all the time! He's a low life that does not have any credit cards, that's why he wanted to pay cash!\"\n\nI was having a \"HOLD IT\" overload, and the judge saw me smiling and hopping in my seat and patting my manila folder of receipts. \n\n\"Do you actually not have any credit or debit cards?\" the judge asked me.\n\nI pulled out my wallet and showed him, and then I pulled out a timestamped photo of the \"CASH ONLY\" sign I took the day of, and another one I took the morning of the hearing. \n\nThe guy mumbled something like \"OK you got me there\" and then had nothing but \"Huh, I didn't know that\" when the judge asked him about the legality of each unreasonable itemized charge. \n\nAnyway, each violation pays double the total tow charge, and since there were three, that's how I made $1,800 on a $300 investment.",

I was starting to get mad.\n\n\n\n.\n.\n\n\nSo, the day of court I had a stack of clean drug test results in my bag. The lawyer wouldn't even look at them, and he was openly hostile to my presence and involvement.\n\n\n.\n.\n\n\nCourt starts. (I had been in this judge's courtroom before with other families.) The cps supervisor stands up and says that the parents have had 12 dirty drug screens in the past 6 months. The lawyer actually did ask her for the results. She said she didn't have them with her.\n\n\n.\n.\n\n\nI got the results out of my bag and handed them to the mom who was next to the lawyer. She tried to get him to take them, but he ignored her.\n\n\n.\n.\n\n\nI got so agitated that the judge said, \"Mrs. Baez looks like she's about to have a stroke. What's going on?\"\n\n.\n.\n\n\n\nI stood up and explained that we had clean drug tests taken immediately after the mandated ones that cps claimed were dirty. I briefly explained that the parents had tried getting copies of their results and had been refused. I said that the parents had consistently denied ever using drugs and had clean tests to prove it.\n\n\n.\n.\n\n\nThe judge ordered cps to provide copies of all the drug test results at a hearing in a week.\n\n\n.\n.\n\n\n\nAt that hearing, the case was closed and the children were released from foster care. The family never got an apology from anyone, but they were too traumatized to pursue it. They packed up and moved away within a month.",
            "Not a lawyer but just a very observant girlfriend.  My bf\u2019s car was involved in an accident.  He was parked in area where during certain hours you were not permitted to park as it would block semis from being able to maneuver to deliver goods (it was a steel plant).  A girl backed her vehicle in his drivers side door of his Ford Fusion.  Cops were called for insurance purposes and my bf states that it appeared the cop and the girl knew each other; they were on a first name basis.  \n\nHe received a parking ticket. It took forever for the insurance companies to sort it out because she didn\u2019t think she was at fault because he was parked illegally.  That doesn\u2019t matter or make legal for you to hit someone\u2019s car and get off scot-free.  she ended up having to pay for his deductible.\n\nAnd this is where the harassment from the local PD began.  He received a piece of mail from our magistrate stating he failed to pay a parking ticket and a bench warrant would be issued if he didn\u2019t pay it or he could request a hearing regarding the ticket.  He was just going to pay it.  I looked over the paperwork and found that the vehicle they said he parked illegally was traded in before the ticket was issued. The ticket indicted a white Toyota Tundra but the license plate block was not filed out.  It was signed but you could not make out the badge number.  \n\nWe had traded his Toyota Tundra on a Ford Fusion in December.  The ticket was written in Feb of the following year. \n\nI was pretty pissed.  I gather all the evidence for him (trade in paperwork) and he went before the magistrate.  Cop testified that he saw a white Toyota Tundra illegally parked at a certain location that had a parking time restriction and it was owned by my bf when he ran the tags.\n\nI should note that my bf had had several parking tickets while he owned the Toyota Tundra.  That\u2019s is our guess on how he got just enough info to write the ticket.\n\nMy bf presented his evidence and the judge dismissed the case.  The judge was heard to say to the cop that he would like to speak to him afterward and chastised him for wasting the courts\u2019 time.\n\nThe cop later told me bf that had he contacted him, they could have taken care of it outside of getting the magistrate involved.  \n\nNeedless to say, we haven\u2019t had an issue since.",
            "IANAL but a friend of mine was a DWI attorney in New York for a while. He was defending a guy who was asleep in the backseat of his car while intoxicated and a NYS Trooper arrested him. \n\nOn the stand, the Trooper testified that he visually saw \"the key in the ignition.\" \n\nMy friend gave him like 3 chances to walk it back. \"Are you sure, Trooper, that you actually saw the key IN the ignition?\"\n\n\"Yes, counselor...\" (When a cop calls a lawyer \"counselor\" he really means \"asshole.\") \n\nAnd then my buddy dropped the hammer: \n\n\"You are aware that my client drives a Toyota Prius?\"\n\nBAM.\n\nEdit: (13 hours later): For all the people pointing out that there's a spot for the fob in the dashboard of some Prius models, etc -- you have to understand that in a court of law, words have meanings. \"Ignition\" is most certainly, specifically defined in NYS law as being what we all commonly understand as the ignition. The point is that the Trooper, since their main duty is traffic enforcement on the roads, are expected to be experts on the cars. Also, he lied on the stand. He wasn't mistaken, he made it up and got caught. Yes, in NY, having the keys on your person while in the car is being under control of the vehicle and thus can be arrested for DUI/DWI, but you can't sever the perjured testimony from the rest of the case. He lied, he got caught. \n\nMy buddy moved for immediate dismissal, and the DA didn't argue. Case dismissed. \n\nNothing happened to the Trooper. \n\nAs to WHY the Trooper did this? Promotions & Overtime. \n\nImagine you're running the entire New York State Police. You have about 5,000 Troopers -- what metric do you use to gauge how effectively they're performing their tasks? For the most part, Troopers ride alone. So Trooper #1 drives around all day on his shift and issues zero tickets and makes zero arrests. Trooper #2 manages to issue, say, 5 tickets a day and makes a DWI arrest four times a month? You're going to assume that Trooper #2 is \"doing his job.\" \n\nAn \"aggressive\" officer is one that has a lot of tickets and a lot of arrests. \n\nAlso, Court appearances are almost always on overtime. Police unions are very specific about overtime pay rates and when they apply. If you're an \"effective\" Trooper and you write lots of tickets, you're going to be in Court a LOT at 1.5 your hourly rate, sometimes 2.0 your hourly rate, depending. \n\nAlso: ha, ha anal. IANAL has long been Internet-speak for I Am Not A Lawyer.",

I'm a laid back dude in contrast, and I was cordial to him. We went to the police station and made our statements to the traffic investigator. \n\nI didn't have a dashcam (at the time), but a day later I got a copy of the CCTV footage that was looking directly at the scene of the accident. I showed the investigator the video, and he was absolutely stunned how wrong the other guy was. At that point, I told the investigator that I was an attorney, and that I'd decide if I wanted to take the matter to court.\n\nFollowing day, I got a call from the guy who hit me.

She said \u201c10 years of major medications due to an injury that happened two years ago?\u201d \n\nTl:dr- judge agreed with my request for supervised visits pending his completion of all the necessary steps.

He refused to see it and wrote the ticket.  $590, I was pissed.  I\u2019ll own up if I make a mistake (I once got a ticket for going 81 in a 60 zone that I thought was an 80, I didn\u2019t even fight because I was in the wrong even if I wasn\u2019t knowingly speeding) but this was complete crap.\n\nI didn\u2019t really think I had a chance but hoped the cop wouldn\u2019t show.

He lied and said I told him I had \u201cjust been checking my messages\u201d.  \n\nWell...when he pulled me over and I told him I\u2019d show him my phone, I took screenshots of my call list, my email account, and my text messages, all of which showed the time of the screenshot and the last call/email retrieval/text sent or received.\n\nJudge let me admit them as evidence because his statement specifically indicated I \u201cadmitted\u201d doing something relevant to the screenshots.  And they of course proved that I had not used the phone for any of those things.  Strike 1 against him. \n\nThen, when he testified, he said that he had seen me pull my phone out of the cup holder, look at it and put it back in. \n\nMy phone was on a dash mount when he pulled me over.  So I asked him about the cup holder and he said it was dash mounted.  I actually had a picture of the interior of my car (because I thought maybe he\u2019s seen me touching the screen of my cars controls (I drive a Prius) so I\u2019d taken a picture of the interior.\n\nThat of course showed the cup holders are NOT on the dash and instead are in a console in between the driver and passenger seats.  Strike 2 against him.\n\nFinally I produced my cell phone records that showed I owned an iPhone 6 Plus at the time of the ticket.  I asked him again if he was certain I\u2019d put it in a cup holder and he said he was (he could hardly change his story on the stand).  So I took a cup that was on the desk (in case people needed water during the trial) and set it and my phone in front of him, and asked him to try to put my phone into the cup.  6 Plus phones were huuuge AND I use an Otterbox Defender.  There was no way it would fit in a cup holder.\n\nHe glared at me and said \u201cWell, the cup holders in my truck are big, it would fit in them!\u201d  I reminded him the ticket showed I drive a Prius - and they are not a big car.  Third strike.\n\nThree times I proved that what he said could not have happened.\n\nThe judge at this point interrupted (she said at the start she would provide advice since I was representing myself, and that was part of her job) and said I\u2019d \u201cmade my point....And did it VERY WELL!\u201d\n\nThat was when I knew I\u2019d won.\n\nAnd boy was that cop pissed.

            "Im not a lawyer, but ive been up against plenty of them as a union chief steward. Years ago we had an arbitration related to Healthcare costs. The company spent the better part of a year trying to break us from pursuing the case. The day had come for our arbitration. The lawyer (there were 3, actually) we were up against was actually Paul Newman's nephew. Anyway, it was my turn to take the stand. His first question to me was presenting the grievance as evidence and asking me what step it said it was on at the top of the page. (Our grievance process is a 2 step system, progressing to arbitration if its not settled) i said \"2nd step\". Then he smugly asks \"and where is the first step?\" To which I replied \"the first step is a verbal discussion. It goes into writing at the second step\"\n\nHe looked hurt, but persevered anyway. A few more questions in he asked \"if the entire company got base level insurance, instead of a premium option, that would satisfy the contract?\" At this point he was hoping I would argue that the base level insurance wasn't sufficient, because he was trying to paint the picture that we were just trying to get premium insurance at a base level price. I responded with \"yes\". He looked dumbfounded. Asked me \"yes?\". I said again \"yes, that would satisfy the language in the contract\". He kinda looked at his other papers he was going to submit as evidence, then muttered \"no further questions\". \n\nI knew at that moment that they had brought no real argument to the table. We got our answer from the arbitrator 6 weeks later, during a contract negotiations meeting. It was insanely satisfying watching them read the email during one of the sessions, and the immediate shift in demeanor from their side of the table. They got real quiet.\n\nWe were awarded 100% of the arbitration. Full back pay for all employees that were being overcharged, and reduced rate for the premium insurance.",

And what do you know, the other side made a massive mistake on literally just the fourth out of 100+ questions that I asked. It's a dog bite case, and every single time I asked about the bite, the response says something along the lines of \"we admit to this and that, but we deny that our dog was involved in any dog attack.\"\n\nWell, Question 4 asks whether they admit that their dog was not leashed on the day when it bit my client, and they simply answer, \"Admit.\" Meaning, they admit their dog was not leashed, AND they admit that their dog was the one that bit my client. That was the ONE thing that was genuinely in dispute.\n\nThey tried to argue at the hearing that it was a mistake and they only meant to admit to the lack of a leash, but the judge held them to their word (most likely because the other evidence made it clear it could only have been their dog anyway).\n\nEDIT: For everyone hating on this for being \"misleading\" and \"the reason everyone hates lawyers\", I'll clarify that at the time I wrote the questions, I would not have dreamed that they would have the balls to deny their dog's involvement. Their dog obviously was the one that did it. They let their dog out every day, no leash, and it terrorized the neighborhood for months (killing chickens, fighting with people's dogs, chasing cars) before it finally bit my client.

            "TL;DR Plaitntiffs attorney forgets to send notice to my client to testify. Can\u2019t make $35k case with his shite witness. Gets smack down for not knowing local rules. \n\nI did a quid pro quo case for a guy who was doing my firms website. It was a breach of contract case for a credit card. The debt had been sold and at the time of trial, the ad danum was something like $35k. \n\nThe client brought me in late in the game. He\u2019s already gone to mandatory arbitration and lost. I get the case a week before the bench trial and when going through the pleadings, etc, I realize that the plaintiff never sent a \u201c237 notice.\u201d This is when one side tells the other that they need to make available either tangible evidence or a party witness at trial. Think subpoena, but less bite. So the plaintiff forgot to send this notice to the defendant that he needed to appear at the trial. \n\nNormally, if a defendant doesn\u2019t appear at a civil trial, you get the obvious - the judge only hears one side of the story and def loses. When a 237 is given and the defendant doesn\u2019t show, the judge is supposed to infer that def didn\u2019t show because his testimony would have hurt his case (\u201cnegative inference\u201d). \n\nBut, because this was a debt buyer, plaintiff had no actual knowledge that this credit card bill and charges belonged to my client. All they get is a single page print out from the original debt holder saying they sold this debt, and if they\u2019re lucky, some copies of statements. They could easily have proven it by calling my guy as a witness. Even if client denies charges, plaintiff can make a good case because defendants name is on the bill, it\u2019s to his address, the restaurant charges are for the sub shop on his block, etc. and all that would come out when the called def as a witness. \n\nSo, I tell my guy wait down the street. We do pre-trial motions and plaintiff asks for my client. I point out their procedural error and they panic. They put on their witness, who is some account rep at the debt buyer and I object to hearsay on EVERYTHING they try to get in. She has no knowledge, can\u2019t lay foundation for statements and the only thing she can remotely testify to is her own business record - the single page showing a debt sale. Not enough. \n\nThen plaintiff attorney gets a \u201cbright\u201d idea. He starts to ask his witness about the arbitration hearing. I see where he\u2019s going and let it play out a bit. He\u2019s trying to get in an \u201cadmission of party opponent.\u201d Basically, witness can say that at the arbitration hearing, my client admitted this was his debt. \n\nBut this is an out-of-town attorney. He doesn\u2019t realize that because arbitration is mandatory and has very relaxed evidentiary rules (all evidence comes in if you tell the other side what you\u2019re going to use) - that this county considers arbitrations to be the equivalent of settlement conferences and the testimony isn\u2019t admissible at trial except to impeach. \n\nResult: Directed finding for my client, who saved himself a $35,000 judgment. Judge praises my defense and I get to make super fake small talk in the tiny elevator with the plaintiff and his witness after trial, where I walk out to hand my client the court order in his favor.

The officer measured the length the ladder was hanging over the tailgate with a tape measure - which was 4 feet and a couple of inches or so.  There was no flag.

The defendant asked the officer at what degree the ladder was to the bed of the truck.  The officer did not know but estimated 30 degrees.  The defendant asked the officer to do trigonometry  on the stand to calculate how many feet the ladder extended linear to the bed of the truck.  The officer was not understanding that while the ladder was 4 feet and change over the tailgate, the angle the ladder was sitting made is under 4 linear feet away from the back of the truck - which was the law.

            "Not a lawyer, but represented myself in small claims court.\n\nI bought a motorcycle while working overseas in Afghanistan. I had my brother in law pick it up with his trailer, hand over the cash, and get a bill of sale for me. I came back home a week later, so I was able to have all the paperwork for the DMV in my name.\n\nAnyway, in NY state, you can sell a vehicle that has a lien on it with a lien release. In NJ, where I lived, you just can\u2019t do that and need to get a new title with no lien on it. A lien release letter didn\u2019t matter. Well this one was the original title from a decade and a half previous which had a lien on it from the credit union that loaned the money to the original owner to finance the motorcycle.\n\nIt was paid off, so I just needed a new title without the lien on it so I could transfer the title and register it in my name. \n\nThe problem was that the credit union had been absorbed by another regional bank, and they couldn\u2019t provide the new title to me because I wasn\u2019t the borrower. They could only provide a lien release form, but that didn\u2019t matter to NJ. It made sense because I didn\u2019t have the business with them.\n\nSo I go back to the owner and ask them to please get a new title without a lien on it. This dude sends me the lien release and I told him again, I needed the new title, not a lien release.\n\n\nPhone calls and emails go back and forth for nine months until his gf (using his email) said, \u201cJimmy said that it\u2019s your problem and he don\u2019t want nothin to do with it. I\u2019m sorry. I told him that\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\nI responded and then got a curse word-laden response from the guy himself telling me he did what he was supposed to and I needed to \u201cfuck off.\u201d\n\nSo at that point, what could I do? I had the bike with insurance but it couldn\u2019t be registered in my name without the title being in my name.\n\nI drove the 90 minutes to his home town and filed paperwork with the clerk to sue him on small claims court. The bike cost $3,500, and the max was $3,000 in small claims court, so close enough for me.\n\nThe court date approaches. I figure he wouldn\u2019t show up, but he did! And he was wearing a muscle shirt and cutoff jorts while I was wearing a shirt and tie. \n\nI present the case to the judge. This douchebag defends himself and said it was just a misunderstanding and that he didn\u2019t realize he had to get me corrected paperwork.\n\nThe judge says, \u201cwell since this appears to be a misunderstanding...\u201d and that\u2019s where I interrupted him. I explained how he told me to \u201cfuck off\u201d and he was well aware of everything I needed because as you see in these printed out emails, the highlighted parts show where I was very detailed and specific with what I needed and the other color highlighted parts were where be acknowledged my request and told me to \u201cfuck off\u201d.\n\nThe judge\u2019s face changed instantly. He changes his tone and immediately says, \u201cI rule in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of $3,000 and ownership of the bike.\u201d He then addressed me directly and said, \u201cBy the looks of this guy and his address within the village (it was a trailer park), I assume he doesn\u2019t have the money and the only way we can enforce it is to put a lien on his property which he will never pay. What I can do is adjourn for now and if you don\u2019t get the title two weeks from now, call the court and the judgement will be made in your favor.\u201d\n\nEight days later, I had a title in my hand with no lien on it and I could finally register and ride my bike (legally) after having taken possession of it 11.5 months earlier.\n\nMaybe this belongs in r/petty/whatever revenge?",

To add insult to injury the tow truck then burned my brakes because they towed my car 30 miles with my parking brake fully engaged after the accident.\n\nOther driver told the officer that he thought I was going to turn right onto the interstate (what most cars do there). But I was in the left lane, which doesn't turn right, it only goes straight. My destination was in front on me, not up the interstate. I didn't have a turn signal on either, so even if I was in the right lane it would have been clear that I was going straight not right.\n\nAnyway, the responding officer gave us both tickets because he said we both had a duty to stop on yellow (which is not what driver's ed taught me, since driver's ed said you have a quick decision if you're close to the intersection and have right of way on yellow).  He also orders us to both show up in traffic court.\n\nMeanwhile, we had the same insurance carrier. Insurance got statements and images from both of us, and ruled that the accident was completely the other guy's fault, so he had to pay all the insurance fees and such. \n\nWhen I got to traffic court and the officer called my ticket before the judge, and the judge asked for my plea/response, I instead politely asked if I could ask a question before we begin. Judge and officer seemed surprised but agreed.\n\n I then said that there was another vehicle involved but that I hadn't seen the other driver in the courtroom yet. Judged asked if this was true, officer checked his notes and confirmed there was a second driver, then court confirmed the other driver was a no show. They then did something to call for a penalty against the no show guy. \n\nThen I said that the other driver and I had the same insurance provider and that our insurance provider had ruled the missing driver at fault and repairs to my vehicle were even underway at his expense. I had the insurance claim info with me. \n\nJudge and officer exchange looks. \n\nFinally, I asked if, given that the insurance company got the same evidence already, decided I wasn't at fault, and the other driver was missing, if they would consider dismissing the charge outright. \n\nJudge and officer chat and then tell me to sit down and that they'll return to my case a bit later in the day.\n\nCourt then handles the rest of the officer's traffic cases for the morning. Officer comes over to me afterwards and says all charges are dropped as long as I don't get another ticket within 6 months. If I get a ticket, this case could come back for discussion.

There's the deer I almost hit!\"  She was pointing to a life-like deer statue on someone's lawn triumphantly, like she had just won her case.  \n\nThey asked, \"Wait, this deer?  You said you it was in the middle of the road.  This is on someone's lawn.\"  \nHer: \"This is the one I almost hit!\"  \n\"But it's on someone's lawn.  You said the deer was in the middle of the road, and that's why you swerved and crashed, to avoid it.\"  \n\"It was in the middle of the road!  It ran right out in front of me!\"  \n\"This concrete deer ran out into the road in front of you?\"  \n\"YES!\"\n\nShe did not win her case.",
            "My client, the plaintiff, was in a huge car crash where my client's car literally caught on fire. During closing the defense claimed that my client's shoulder \"spontaneously\" dislocated because it had done so 9 years previously. Previously, the defense expert conceded there was evidence that the crash probably aggravated her shoulder. The look on the arbitrator's face was priceless during the defense closing. After the defense closing but before my rebuttal, the arbitrator asked defense counsel so many damning questions that my rebuttal was less than five minutes and solely on damages. The judge awarded eight times the defense's last offer.\n\nI have edited for clarity.

            "Right after I got my license but before I had a job, I volunteered in Landlord/tenant court. Basically the first case I ever took to an evidentiary hearing, the landlord was trying to terminate the tenancy, meaning they didn't care if they got rent money, they just wanted the house back.The reason cited for termination was nonpayment of rent. That's odd because most landlords would probably file a nonpayment of rent case, but it's also a lease violation, so they can legally proceed with the termination. My clients didn't want to leave, they just wanted him to fix things, so we went to trial. Losing meant my clients had 10 days to move to prevent an eviction (if LL had filed nonpayment of rent, my clients could've prevented eviction by paying the rent). These cases are summary proceedings, which for me means if we can't settle we will immediately go to a bench trial where my only evidence is what my client brings with them. The case had already been adjourned once and I only met my clients minutes before the hearing was scheduled to start. I made one pitch for a settlement offer and the landlord basically refused to talk to me, so I had to make my case up on the fly, which might happen in movies, but isn't supposed to happen in real life practice of law. Thankfully, we were the last case on the docket and there was a union-mandated lunch break for the court personnel, so we were on the record for only about 10-15 minutes before we recessed and I had an hour to come up with a plan.\n\nThere were no technical problems with the complaint, so my only argument was that the termination was retaliatory. That was a tough case to make, because technically the law only specifically protects the tenant from retaliation for calling a government agency, which my clients hadn't done, so I'm trying to convince the judge to interpret the law against retaliation broadly. It probably won't work unless I can convince her the real reason the landlord wanted to terminate the tenancy was broader than just nonpayment of rent.\n\nThe landlord brought in his handyman as a witness. His testimony was basically that my tenant's complaint about the property were frivolous and that the house was in good shape. The only good tidbit I got from his testimony was that the furnace was installed incorrectly before he was hired and fixed it. So my clients' complaints weren't entirely frivolous, but this was now the middle of summer and the furnace now worked just fine. And now that he was the handyman, according to him, the house was in beautiful shape. I tried cross-examining the repairman and he turned out to be tough for me to control. I'd ask yes or no questions which he'd supplement with very technical explanations for how the furnace worked. He kept saying he took the tenants complaints personally because he felt they were attacking him personally for doing a poor job, and the reason he wanted to testify was to defend his work. I knew he'd be called to the stand again, but I decided not to cross-examine him any further the second time because he was such a good witness and too hard to control. He foreclosed the possibility of me making the case simply listing the repairs that needed to be made.\n\nI didn't feel like it was going well for me until the landlord himself took the stand. The judge posed some questions (again, this is summary proceedings, so trial procedures are a little different), and to one he said he wanted them gone because he was tired of them always \"complaining, complaining, complaining.\" Once he said that I immediately knew I had him. That's what I needed, an admission of his mental state when filed the case. My cross-examination was entirely focused on his frustration with them always complaining about repairs. He hanged himself with his own words. The judge wasn't very sympathetic to him because the landlord has a duty to keep the house in good repair. Because he said on the record that the reason he wanted them out was because they kept asking him to do his job, she held the eviction was retaliatory in nature and dismissed the case.",

            "Defendant here:\n\nWhere I lived at the time, there were(are) very strict statutes involving police having their body cameras on whenever making an arrest due to issues with police brutality, etc etc. Now, I was getting pulled over and subsequently arrested for a DWI, when the reality of the situation was that I was working in the foodservice industry at the time, coming off of an 18 hour shift, preceded by a 12 hour the day before. I hadn't slept and was tired enough that I shouldn't have been driving, but I was. My wife had picked me up from work earlier (she had a long commute and I was able to take the bus to work, she would usually pick me up afterwards), and I had gone out afterwards to pick up some beers for my day off (the following day). Needless to day, failed to follow traffic rules properly, no one was injured and no accident occurred, but it was just my luck that there was a local PD officer who had seen some swerving and me not coming to a complete stop at a stop sign. Field breathalyzer was negative, but then miraculously the one at the station showed me at somewhere between. 04 and .05 (with the legal limit being what it was at the time, was sufficient to get me charged with the DWI, as I also take prescription medication for epilepsy)  Naturally, didn't want anything on my otherwise flawless driving record, so I lawyered up the following day.\n\nFast forward to my first hearing, officer at the scene gives his account, my lawyer questions him, then the actual arresting officer (came by with a cruiser, officer who pulled me over was a motorcycle cop), doesn't show up for the hearing, evidently having a scheduling conflict. Judge assigns a new date for my lawyer to be able to question the arresting officer. This postponement due to the officer being unavailable happens three more times, which is when my lawyer begins to get super suspicious. He knows something is up.\n\nAfter some digging, my lawyer found out that the local PD had been falsifying their station breathalyzer calibrations, and the machine hadn't been properly calibrated since they *recieved* the new machine. The officer who had started the ball rolling on ducking the calibration requirements? You guessed it, the arresting officer on my case. As it turned out, the reason he was unavailable was because he had been placed on administrative leave for the duration of the time it was taking the department to somehow mitigate the damage that would be caused by 4 years of having an improperly calibrated breathalyzer machine at their station. My lawyer was responsible for getting a bunch of convictions and charges dropped, including mine.\n\nAnd yet, local (conservative) media didn't pick up the story, and so it only made it as far as the people who lived in town who heard about it.\n\nThanks again, Bill. You were a kick-ass lawyer.",
            "There is nothing more satisfying than as a defence lawyer in a bail application, getting police to admit that they didn't take any steps to check the obviously unwell suspect's mental and physical health history or obtain treatment once arrested.... contrary to the police manual. Actually, anything where police haven't followed basic protocol is fun. \n\n\"The police manual says you must do xyz\" \n\"um... yes\" \n\"did you do any of those things?\" \n\"..... no\" \n\nBut the best moment I've had in court was getting a repeat DFV offender to admit that he was an abusive violent man who thought he was the victim. \n\n\"Are you an abusive person?\"\n\"No!\"\n\"Were you convicted last year for threatening and abusing fisheries officers?\"\n\"Well yes\"\n\"And were you convicted of assault in 2013?\"\n\"Yes....\"\n\"And was the victim of that assault the applicant for this domestic violence order?\"\n\".... yes\" \n\"Do you use threats to control or intimidate people?\"\n\"No!\"\n\"Remember that conviction for threatening fisheries officers mate.

I completely intended to pay the fine and move on and try to find a motorcycle buddy that would ride along to get me to the DMV to get my test done and license in hand. I talked to my roommate who was pre-law and had a father that was a lawyer. He send a copy to his dad to look at and his father called asking for me to talk through what happened because he was confused with my ticket. It turned out, the University Officer that pulled me over wrote me up for \"Driving on a Suspended License\". When my buddy's dad realized the error, he told me \"Take it to court, and plead not guilty. Then at your court case, don't say anything until towards the very end. Then when the judge asks if you have anything further, say \"yes, your honor, I would only like to say that this ticket is for driving under a suspended license, and I can prove my license is not suspended.\"\"\n\nThat's exactly what I did, and since the cop was represented by himself and presumably an intern, they just sat there fumbling through papers not able to do anything. \n\nFinally, and this was the best part, the judge turned to the cop and said \"I don't even recall how many times I've had you in this court room with erroneous tickets.

It was about an 8 hour drive for us, so we ended up just driving instead of getting plane tickets. When we were near the Georgia-Florida border, we were involved in a really bad accident that ended up with the other car in the air doing barrel rolls. We never hit the other car, they just tried to pass on the right as my dad was changing lanes, and they swerved into the grass and eventually into the air. \n\nWhen this happened, we were in my mom's car (2006 Chrysler Pacifica, piece of shit car).

The lawyer representing her went on and on asking my dad questions about his truck, without realizing that wasn't the vehicle my dad was driving at the time. Whenever the lawyer finished, my dad just asked him, \"When are we going to talk about the car I was driving at the time of the accident?\" The judge, confused, asked my dad what he meant. My dad explained the situation to the judge and the lawyer immediately tried to do damage control, but it didn't really matter. \n\nNot sure what the exact decision was, dad never told me the details because I was still a kid.

            "IANAL, but there was a time 9 years back where I defended myself in court. In the town I lived in at the time, a nice medium sized city out of state from where I originally grew up, a monthly parking spot was around $200/month, whereas if you parked on the street, a ticket was $20, and they only ticketed you 3-4 times a month. Needless to say, as a recently graduated college student at his first job, I opted to park on the street and pay the occasional small fine. One day however, I found my car towed to a different location and having to pay an $80 fine instead of the regular $20 due to a special event. The $20 tickets, I would pay happily, but this $80 ticket and tow? That they didn\u2019t announce prior? No chance! Furious, I went to court, dressed in a suit, suit vest, the full nine yards. There I got the parking enforcement officer to say to the judge that he had looked up my plate, gone to my address, and knocked on my door to let me know my car was about to be towed. There are no words in the English dictionary to describe my joy I felt when it was my turn to cross examine him, and asked him specifically how long it took to get my out of state address from my out of state plates and let me know at my out of state address that I needed to move my car.

My client repossessed the vehicle after failure to pay for several months and normally this would trigger a violation of the automatic stay provisions of a bankruptcy filing; however, the Debtor had signed the lease agreement under his name, doing business as... \"food truck\" and that DBA was registered under an LLC. The Debtor tried to have my client sanctioned, and my client offered to settle the matter for $9,000 just to avoid any litigation by the Debtor's  LLC.\n\nThe Debtor later reneged on the settlement hoping to squeeze more money out of my client because he claimed that his food truck brand (which was moderately successful), and permits raised the value of the truck. I successfully argued that the branding was inconsequential to the actual depreciating value of the food truck. We offered to settle again after going to arbitration and he refused. The bankruptcy judge heard the case, and given that the Debtor had flip flopped over whether the truck was his, or the LLC and I took great detail in pointing out his conflicting stances the judge ultimately came to the conclusion that my client hadn't done anything wrong because the truck was clearly under the title of his LLC which is not given bankruptcy protections and granted us retroactive relief. My client got to keep the truck, did not have to pay the Debtor and a small claims case for unlawful repossession will be going nowhere given all the stuff he said in the bankruptcy case in pleadings.\n\nSo not only did the greedy debtor not get ANY money, he owes his attorney fees, and my client can still file a proof of claim for his attorney's fees and try to get his money back for the needless litigation.

            "Misdemeanor trial defending a guy accused of 3rd degree assault on his girlfriend. She had a \u2018bruise\u2019 on her neck and told the police that it was from my client strangling her. \nSomehow it got around the public defenders office that someone overheard the \u2018victim\u2019 admit to her mother that it was a hickey. \nShe was on the stand and she was terrified. I kid-you-fucking-not I had the \u2018Tom Cruise standing there struggling whether he should accuse Nathan Jessup of ordering the code red\u2019 moment. \nI was battering her with answers, not open-ended questions (as it should be). It also helped that I had a projector slide up on a screen in the courtroom of a massive butcher knife stuck in the wall - yes, she threw it at him. I had her admit that, but that wasn\u2019t the clincher. It was the moment when I honestly decided while standing in the middle of the courtroom whether or not to assert that the bruise on her neck was a hickey. I didn\u2019t know if it truly was at all. I mean it was hearsay within hearsay with a double smattering of more hearsay. But I wasn\u2019t going to assert it as if it was overheard, I was going to assert it as a fact. The trouble I had with the decision to go with this was was that what if I asserted it was a hickey and she says \u201cno, I got that from him strangling me\u201d? Then I look like a massive idiot and it only bolsters the DAs case. I literally said \u201cfuck it\u201d in my head and said \u201cand, isn\u2019t it true that the bruise on your neck is a hickey?\u201d She breathed out, slumped in her chair, and eeked out a \u201cyeah\u201d. \nI thought I was fucking Vince Lombardi.

My client and his girlfriend had been in the car together, and she claimed he beat the shit out of her, while he was driving them around, speeding, drunk.

Until I played the cell phone video my client had taken during the drive. Which showed  that she was driving. That she was intoxicated.

(For example, any time he was in an elevator, he would shake it a little or tap on the displays or buttons and go 'Yep. Total piece of crap. Inferior piece of crap.' and I think he mostly did it to freak people out.) One of my favourites:\n\nHe got a call that someone was hearing weird noises from the elevator. He got inside, rode the elevator up and sure enough, he could hear it too. For half a second he thought it was a baby crying and realized it was a cat. When he got to a certain floor, he could hear this sad meowing. It obviously wasn't in the elevator car, so he got into the shaft and found this little orange kitty! It had somehow (and I don't think he figured out or told us how) got into the elevator shaft and was sitting in a spot between the floors where it wouldn't get crushed by the elevator, but it couldn't get out.\n\nMy dad saved it and gave it to the building manager to see if it belonged to anyone in the building. \n\nIt was the one time he ever told us a story that involved him saving an animal instead of finding dead ones.",

But all other floors were no problem.  \n  \nMy dad arrived to find the maintenance guy cackling, looking into the bottom of the shaft. There were probably tens of thousands of magazines down there. They had to get a bunch of shovels, a small crew, and a rolling dumpster to clear it out. When it was all done, my dad decided to stay behind and pretend to read a newspaper while he sat in the lobby. After about half an hour, he sees an elderly patient holding a magazine, shuffling slowly toward the elevator. He stops in front of the doors, glances left, glances right, and quickly stoops down, slides the magazine into the gap, and shuffles away as fast as he can with a huge grin on his face. My dad could not help but laugh hysterically. This guy had probably been sliding magazines in there multiple times per day, every day, for decades. I should ask him whether he reported it or let the guy have his fun. Wouldn't surprise me if my dad went with the latter.",

            "The company where I worked had an old heavy-duty freight elevator that was semi-abandoned.  It was more like an automotive lift with giant pistons embedded in the ground, but installed in an elevator shaft. When they needed to move something huge, they would fill the hydraulics with oil.  It took hundreds of gallons to top off the system, including the giant pistons, and then they would use it for a day.  A few months later they would try to use it again and find the oil gone. Once, they planned to use it the following day, so maintenance pumped in the oil to get ready.  The next day - no oil.  They refilled it the morning of the move and got one lift out of it before it stopped.  The company knew it was spilling hydraulic oil into the ground under the plant and just did not give a shit.  The finally abandoned it for good when the maintenance guys threatened to report the illegal oil dumping.",

            "Ok, I know this might be fucked up, but when I lived in an apartment building with an elevator, I would often leave things in the elevator shaft just to mess with the maintenance guy. \n\nIt started because I knew he was superstitious and paranoid and he had been a total dick to my female roommate and asked her for an \u201calternative payment\u201d in exchange for him fixing our fireplace. \n\nSo... Yeah. \n\nI used to leave things just to mess with him around the apartment complex. \n\nIn the elevator shaft, I left a pentagram circled by candles, and in the middle of it I put a porcelain doll and two knives I had used to clean chickens and deer, still with blood on them. \n\nBeneath the stairs on the first floor, there was an empty space he would store tools behind a metal door. In the far back corner, behind tools he rarely moved, I put a small mattress and some old Polaroids I bought at an estate sale... Scratched out the eyes and faces on some of them... So he thought someone was living under the stairs. \n\nOn the roof of the building, by the AC units, I left a copy of the Satanic Bible that I got from some girl I had met on Tinder and slept with. (She tried to convert me to Satanism and I was perfectly happy being a non-believer in all religions). \n\nSo the story the maintenance guy told our Landlord was that there was a Satanic witch squatting under the stairs and performing rituals and practicing witchcraft in the elevator shaft. \n\nI moved out with my girlfriend soon after that. But my old roommate said she heard from the landlord that the maintenance guy moved out of the building and the landlord figured out it was me shortly after I moved out.

            "Not an elevator tech, buuuut....\n\nWe were running a warrant at a horrible multi-story building that had been essentially abandoned by the owners. We knew the top floor had been riddled with access ways between many of the old apartments by kicking through the dry wall. Essentially most of the top floor was a single \"super-apartment\".  \n\n\nWe knew the elevator was out, so we hit the stairs as soon as we pulled up. The building was abandoned to the point of smelling (BAD), but we knew there were squatters that lived here. It wasn't a huge haul up, but running stairs with all your gear isn't exactly a vacation. We got to the top floor and started working on containment. Within a minute or two we heard calls of \"Contact!\" behind us, followed by the yells for someone to get on the ground.  The floor was quickly secured with no injuries (which is a good day).\n\nRounding back to the entry hallway, we learned that our suspect had kicked down the drywall opposite the elevator, and thrown some bundles down the elevator shaft before he was taken into custody. A quick conversation, asking the folks on the ground floor to pop the elevator doors and see what was there.  Horrible idea.\n\nWithin seconds a screamed \"Stop! NO!\" was heard up the stairwell. The ground floor of the elevator was completely filled with crap, as part of the ceiling from the elevator had caved in, and the cast-off-of-humanity was seeping in. We rapidly learned that it was even worse for the second floor as it was filled almost to the top. \n\nYeah...  The abandoned building had a trash chute, in the form of the broken elevator shaft. All kinds of crap, dirty diapers, a dead cat, syringes, garbage bags, garbage out of bags, little fluffs of toilet paper with nasty streaks on them, broken glass, and a curious amount of unbroken bottles that all seemed to be filled with golden yellow liquid.  It was a horrible, damp mess.  \n\n\nI had to rope down from the top (not too many floors) to take possession of the bundles that were thrown down.  Thankfully all were on top.  I stupidly thought this wouldn't be that big of a deal, and then I started my descent.  If I screwed up my rope down, I was going to bounce off of tetanus incarnate, laced with used hypodermic needles and human excrement. I probably should have found a better way, but this idiot was already descending.\n\nIt turns out that they really were all they way on top.  Steady hands locked the line, and I was able to stretch and reach the bundles. The gang then hooked the line and helped angle me to a safe exit.\n\nTLDR: Abandoned building had evidence throw into the elevator shaft, after the occupants had been using the elevator shaft to dump every drop of waste down it, accumulating over 20 feet.",

On one particular day, I forgot my work lanyard which held my door pass, and all my work keys at home so I borrowed one of our vice president's keys to go get the mail with. The time came and I walked to the elevator and right as it opened, I somehow fumbled the keys and they fell perfectly down into the seam on the floor. I could hear them clanking all the way down to the ground level. Took a week to get the elevator maintenance people out there as this wasn't an emergency. That is one week that I thought I was surely being fired. The VP hated me from then on, but we just didn't talk. I never got let go for it.

Ok, one of those\". \n\nUntil one day we had a guy come through drive thru that asked for a large Whopper Meal, and instant reply back:\n\"Sir, we don't sell Whoppers here, we have Big Macs or Quarter Pounders or McChickens\". \n\nHe replied: \"No, I don't want that, I want a Whopper\". \n\nMe: \"Sir, we don't sell those. This is a McDonalds. The closest equivalent would be a Big Mac, but it's NOT a Whopper. If you want an actual Whopper burger you need to go to Hungry Jack's [Burger King]\"\n\nReply: \"A f@cking Whopper Meal!\"\n\nMe: \"Ok sir, I can't give you a whopper meal here, but I can order a Big Mac Meal for you. The Big Mac is the closest equivalent we have, but it is not a whopper. Are you happy with a large Big Mac meal instead?\"\n\nHim: \"Yes, was that so hard?!\"\n\nWe give him a large Big Mac meal, and sure enough 10 minutes later he is back through the drive-thru screaming into the speaker that he hasn't gotten his Whopper Burger.\n\nEDIT: RIP My inbox. First of all, thanks everyone for the Cake Day wishes, I didn't even notice!\n\n2nd of all: To address the \"Big Mac isn't the equivalent\" comments. At the time, I was just thinking he was ordering the standard signature burger from the menu, of which the Whopper is the Signature Burger of Hungry Jacks, and the Big Mac is the Signature Burger of McDonalds. It didn't cross my mind to think of quarter pounders as closer to the actual whopper burger, because, well, to a teenager making minimum wage I'm not going through the list options that could be the possible equivalent. All I could do was explain we don't have Whoppers at McDonalds, here is what we sell, you don't want to listen fine, are you happy with x alternative instead. You said yes? Great, take your burger and piss off.\n\nSome people have pointed out the McFeast and Quarter Pounder Deluxes as nearly the same burger to the Whopper - when I worked at McDonalds (which was 8 years ago), QPD weren't a thing (never heard of it to this day actually, I don't eat at Maccas much), and the McFeast at the time was a limited edition menu item. It came and went seasonally. I believe now it's a standard menu item, but at the time it wasn't always available and certainly not when this incident occurred. \n\nAnd yes, I'm from Australia, Burger King is known as Hungry Jacks here, because when BK first arrived to Australia there was already a small chain of locally owned burger restaurants in Sydney called Burger King.",

Put a heart decoration on each one.\" After the first couple times we started pretending to write it on scratch paper and threw the paper away at the end of the night.

            "2 things from my experience working at the God's Chicken restaurant:\n\n1) The number of people that asked for McNuggets was astronomical.\n\n2) We had a breakfast menu. Said breakfast menu is only available from 6-10am. It's now after our lunch rush and I am managing the drive-thru. Man comes in the drive-thru and asks for a #2. It's slow, so he definitely gets what he ordered. 2 minutes later, he comes back through and says he ordered a #2, but did not get the correct sandwich. I instruct him to pull around and we would give him another sandwich (the correct one) free of charge. I get the sandwich, check that it's the right one before handing it out, hand it out. End of story, right?\n\nWrong.\n\n2 minutes later, he comes inside and is irate because he has come through the drive-thru twice now and both time recieved the wrong sandwich. I told him that I personally check it and that he received the correct sandwich and even pointed at the #2 on the menu board. Angrily, as though I had done something wrong, he points at the breakfast menu board. \"No! I want THAT number 2.\"\n\nEdit:\n\nWow. This blew up overnight. So, 2 things:\n\n1) \"God's Chicken Restaurant is definitely Chick-fil-A. It's meaning is 2-fold: they're obviously a Christian organization and their food is godly. \n\n2) Unless you're going to a place that serves breakfast all day, most fast food places reuse their numbers for their lunch and breakfast menus. But also, most places that have lunch and breakfast menus also can turn their menu boards around so you don't see the breakfast options in the afternoon. My Chick-fil-A didn't. I think they've changed that now, but our menu boards were static when I worked there.\n\nAlso, I agree with all the people that say they don't even call them McNuggets when they go to McD.

J had her stay in the back to calm down and alerted the head manager from the office so we could go tackle the situation.\n\nI get to the register and find a rather petite Korean lady, shouting very loudly and demanding the trainee come back and saying she was stealing and trying to cheat her out of her money. She also kept shouting what I can only assume were strong obscenities in Korean.\n\nThe manager looked at her with an expression that basically said, \"oh, no. She's too much for me to deal with.\" So he said he'd handle the line of people that was formed and I got the pleasure of dealing with Korean Karen.\n\nSomehow I managed to keep a level head and asked her calmly to explain her situation. She was screaming and yelling and rambling about how upset she was and claimed the cashier refused to give her any change and that the bagels she wanted were too expensive.\n\nI handled giving her the change and reruns her bagels up so they came out to a better total. (The trainee had keyed them in individuals instead of as a pack which changes the price, it was literally her first day by herself.)\n\nThe whole time I'm packing up her dozen and a half bagels, she's still being pissy and is waving her arms around in a fit and bumps a customer next to her.\n\nHe very politely, and sternly said \"Excuse me!\" And she decided to take this opportunity to SPIT on him.\n\nWhile all this has been going on, the assistant manager had called the cops as he'd been witness to her fit from the beginning, and a cop came in right after.\n\nAs I'm finishing slicing up all her stuff, the cop is trying to ask her questions, again, very calmly, what is the problem, whats her name.\n\nThen he asks to see her identification. And she goes ballistic. Shoves the cop, who has kept his hands tk himself this whole time, and SPITS at the cop! He tries to take her wrist and orders her to put her hands behind her back and out of nowhere she lets out this howling scream and starts trying to fight with this guy and is shoving him around. His partner comes in and sees the commotion and immediately jumps in, they're shoving into the refrigerator items and tackle her to the ground.\n\nThey take her out to their police car in cuffs and come back inside to pick up her personal items that were dropped in the fray and ask me if anything else was hers and I gladly handed them her change and bagels.\n\nTL;DR - crazy Korean Karen throws a fit. Cops get called. She puts up a crazy fight and ends up arrested, but she got her bagels and change that she wanted.\n\nEdit: oh my gosh this blew up! Thank you all for the awards! Also, this customer being Korean had nothing to do with anything really. People of all backgrounds would get bent out of shape over the dumbest things.

            "Not sure if this exactly fits, but I worked for one fast food restaurant and we needed to have a storewide meeting. I can't remember who manned the store during the meeting but we couldn't do it at the restaurant because we'd take up too much space. So we always had them at parks or whatever. But it was winter so we had to find a place indoors. I have no idea how the whole thing transpired but we had the meeting at a fast food restaurant that had closed down many years ago and had been vacant that whole time. \n\nThe whole time we were in there people kept coming through the drive thru Trying to order! It just kept beeping and we couldn't turn off the beeping so we had to hop on the speaker to tell them to leave. Our cars were in the parking lot, but there was absolutely nothing else to indicate we were open or even what restaurant this was. It was an Arby's briefly, but it had also been two different other chains before that. So there's no sign, no Marquee, no menu. Like, what did the people even think they were ordering? \n\nThey never held the meetings there again!",

I can tell you how to find our menu online, or perhaps if you tell me what you're looking for I could suggest...\"\n\n\"No, I don't need to see the menu.

We're going to my sister's house tomorrow for a family gathering and I'm supposed to bring things to help cook. Are you telling me you don't have bread, butter, milk, and eggs there?\"\n\nWell, fuck. I mean. Yeah, we do. We do a lightly toasted bread garnish on some dishes, and obviously a restaurant kitchen stocks milk, eggs, and butter. I put her on hold and go get my manager. She thinks it's absurd as I do, and tells me to give her the address for a grocery store about a mile down the road. \"I don't feel like walking to the grocery store or getting an uber, are you really not going to take my order?\" I mean..........................................fuck it. Sure. We make up absurd numbers for a la carte orders of toast, raw eggs, large sides of butter, and glasses of milk. I think it came out to around $90 dollars. 100% intented to make her realize she should just uber to the store a mile away or something. I pick the phone back up and let her know.\n\n\"Sounds good, I'll be there in a few minutes.\"\n\nSo we sure as fuck went into the system, made up a $90 charge that accounedt for an inventory hit of a loaf of bread, some milk, eggs, and butter, and 5 minutes later, she showed up and paid us to save her a trip to a grocery store.\n\nI want some groceries.

I was a teen working my first job so I wanted to stand out. When the 2nd night shift employee didn't show up, I offered to take their place and do a double shift.

As a result she had low self esteem and slowly grew a profound hatred for people which resulted in everyone at school hating her and as a result her hatred grew more . After her 17th birthday she ran away but before she did she had spent about 5 years gathering dirt on everyone who wronged her . She released it all which resulted in her parents splitting and a bunch of other kids being expelled or getting into shit with their parents and if memory serves me correctly one kid even got disowned because of what everyone found out about him. She ended up running up to a family friends of mine and is still working on rebuilding her life . It's a shame because she is one of the nicest people I know and is very honest person.

He lost his right leg and had burns all over his lower body, and he killed both of his parents. He never went back to public school until the sixth grade when he finally showed up.

I won\u2019t name which one but all I\u2019ll say is they may have slightly more than 30 flavors. \n      Anyway, my boss was a conservative Mormon who lashed out at me anytime a piercing or tattoo was showing. The manager and boss would sit in the back and make lists of physically exerting tasks for me to do while maybe one of them spent an hour frosting a single cake. Legally if you work 6 hours you get a lunch break, but my boss would routinely make me work on lunches. (At the time there were maybe 5 employees and we were all overworked and begging our boss to hire new people). \n    I am a generally easy going person. I\u2019m usually chipper, hyper and super happy especially towards customers. It\u2019s just my personality that I want to help people and make them smile. I really got along with my coworkers. Constantly cracking jokes with them and dancing. Always got closing duties done early and always made sure every task was crossed off. Over time I noticed my paychecks weren\u2019t what they were supposed to be. By almost 2 dollars an hour. Minimum wage had gone up, and I was a shift lead so I got a dollar bonus, but I went through my checks and realized the math didn\u2019t add up and I had been cheated out of almost 3,000 dollars from the time I started working until it was brought to my attention. \n     I asked my boss about it and she said because I didn\u2019t have the dollar bonus handwritten from her it \u201cdidn\u2019t exist\u201d and she asked me to apologize to her for accusing her of cheating me out of money. 2 weeks later, I came into work and she handed me my last paycheck and wouldn\u2019t say why I was being let go. When the other workers found out I had been fired, 3 of the 4 employees quit that day, (4th being the manager that constantly harassed me and the younger girls). \nThe others had been there less than 4 months and weren\u2019t very experienced. They were already overworked and stressed. I felt like I brought a certain kind of calmness to the chaos when it got busy.

            "I used to be into amateur radio after a short stint in the army cadets. There was one guy, in the east Midlands, UK, who was one of the adult instructors. He was always telling us about amateur radio, and would hand out old/cheaper pieces of tech he'd tried out and wasn't keeping.\n\nAnyway, he was a little weird, overly friendly (with adults, never had any bad vibes around the kids) and obviously had some social anxiety which he was compensating for, personally I suspect he was on the autistic spectrum, but who knows. After I left the cadets and went to Uni, I stayed in touch on Facebook. We were in the same Facebook group for amateur radio hobbyists.\n\nHe always liked to do things by the book, and instilled in us the importance of being responsible and socially conscious with our radio use. He was the same on Facebook, reminding people that Mrs Miggins on her \u00a310 handset wouldn't know about transmission power, and squelch, etc. He mentioned in passing to a new member the importance of only using the public unlicensed channels (kind of like CB Radio in the US) on the correct, very low, power setting of half a watt. He mentioned it was because Mrs Miggins trying to reach her kid in the next street wouldn't understand the idea that she could hear you but couldn't reach you to ask you to be quiet a minute. He was correct here, and it's also a criminal offence to transmit at higher power on these frequencies, even though its not enforced. \n\nAnyway, this got someone's back up, and he was kicked from the group for \"preaching\".\n\nAfter unsuccessfully asking to be let back in, he set up a larger antenna in his back garden, set up a super fancy aerial atop it, with a 30 Watt transmission system... (this is really quite powerful) \n\nHe now turns this on for several hours a day on whatever channels the radio club/group are using to 'teach them the importance of good etiquette'. This means that nobody can use certain frequencies for hours at a time, as it just sounds like someone is having a one way conversation on air.\n\nHe could probably get arrested, but that doesn't seem to bother him at all.",
            "Throwaway because f these guys.\n\nI worked at a Very Famous Family-Oriented Company for almost fifteen years. I was damn good at my job, but refused to brown-nose or play dirty office politics, so I stayed pretty much in my original spot for a long time. Because of this, I became a pretty regularly-used advice platform for other employees on how to handle workplace issues and because I valued my integrity, I never reported red flags to management (but always encouraged the person to do so on their own behalf). \n\nEventually a few key people remembered how I helped them, and circumvented the usual cronyism to bring me into their teams for big-name projects. It was a nice change and I appreciated the chance to stretch.\n\nThen, I started getting systematically bullied and harassed by the \u201cin crowd\u201d who had decided I was unworthy of being in their presence. I ended up going to therapy about it to help develop tools to deflect while desperately looking for a way out. \n\nEventually, I got another job and handed a sort of \u201cmanifesto\u201d to HR when I turned in my 30 days notice. Racism, sexual harassment, assault, blatant favoritism, theft... all with dates, names, and supporting evidence. Basically an HR nightmare because they couldn\u2019t control what I did when I left, including going to the press. My departure gave them 30 days to ask me questions, interview me, whatever... but it never came.\n\nThing is, I also sent that novel off to the EEOC. They opened an investigation with the company and the moment they did, all hell broke loose. See, the people who were too afraid to come forward before now had an out - they weren\u2019t snitching, they were \u201ccomplying with an investigation per company policy\u201d. So suddenly, scores of people were testifying to HR about the horrific things they had been subject to.\n\nSome people were fired. Others demoted. A few got off scot-free. \n\nBut I sleep like a baby now.\n\n**UPDATE/EDIT:** Just to clarify - I went to *each and every* person whose story I included in my little EECB to make sure they were comfortable and understood what might follow. Most agreed, some did not and I excluded them entirely from my manifesto. My only regret is that there were people whose struggles even I didn\u2019t know about and I was unable to amplify their voices.\n\nThank you all for your support - speak OUT, speak UP, speak TOGETHER.

P & G were all good, until P discovered that G made more than P because she was constantly getting merit raises and performance bonuses.\n\nOne day, G made an honest mistake (our client just switched to a different protocol for billing and she accidentally did it the old way). It was a no harm, no foul situation but P went to the Level 4 employees and senior management and suggested that G be fired.

We were going to be off for four days for Christmas, and G quit Thursday by leaving an after-hours voicemail. G knew that the message wouldn't be received until Monday morning so she sent out an email to the entire building, timed to be sent at 11:59 Christmas Eve. The email detailed how P was having an affair with her BIL while her husband was deployed, how one senior manager took this job because he was fired for embezzlement and lost his CPA license, and how one of our male Level 3 employees requested a transfer because our married department manager was sexually harassing him. \n\nWe got in at 8; HR and IT got in at 9.

            "I guess I would maybe count to this. I cut my relatives out of my life when I was 19, they had spent my life tormenting me and treating me like dirt. With me gone, there's my aunt, my uncle, my grandmother, and my dad. My dad being the youngest at 58 years old now. No younger generation to take care of them. My aunt would be prepared for that, but my dad and my grandmother were banking all their hopes on me caring for them in their old age. So much so they would make fun of me for how incapable I was of domestic tasks (for example I didn't learn how to use a washing machine until I googled it at 19), but when I asked them to show me, they always made excuses. \"Your school should be teaching you that!\". \"You should know how to do that, figure it out\". \"I'll show you some other time\". They never would show me though, they liked having evidence of what a horrible, incompetent, and lazy person they saw me as. They also didn't want me to be able to live independently, because that would make it easier for me to move out, which would mean I wouldn't be at their immediate use.\n\nI also lied and said that I was required to live on campus for the first year when I went to University, I wasn't planning to cut contact yet, but I was desperate for a taste of independence. My aunt gave me my birthday money early so that I could afford the deposit. I felt awful, because my aunt was actually the only one who had ever stood up for new, but keeping in contact with her would have been too complicated, and I'm certain she would have put some pressure on me to mend things with the others. Not even a month after I moved into my student accommodation, I got into an argument with my dad and finally stood up for myself. I cut contact, and with that I was expecting to become homeless once finished my first year and my lease finished. I was too mentally ill to complete my studies and hold down a job at the same time.\n\nAs luck would have it, everything turned out fine. A lot of bumps in the road, but I graduated, didn't end up homeless, and I'm now working in the healthcare system. I don't exactly regret cutting contact, but I'll admit I should have done some research on my options for homelessness instead of hoping for the best. I nearly destroyed my life.",

            "In December I 'rage quit' my job. \n\nMy boss was loosing her fucking mind. I worked in a small office of about 8-9 people. In my time there I saw 11 people come and go from various positions. \n\nOne day when the boss and her sister (the vice-bitch) were out, us employees all had a discussion about how bad the work environment was getting. Micromanaging, no autonomy or flexibility, etc etc...really not a good place to be in general. We pinned it down to being mostly due to the behavior of the vice-bitch. One employee agreed to take one for the team and discuss it with the head bitch. However, the head bitch completely twisted everything that was said and took it as that employee \"telling on\" everyone else for having this conversation. \n\nShe had individual meetings with each one of us. She blasted us about what was said and she was insistent on finding out \"who started it\". She didn't buy it when we basically all said it was just a fluid discussion that was had, not some planned meeting called by one person. \n\nAfter the individual meetings, we had a meeting with all of us where she told us it was absolutely unacceptable that we had this \"bitch session\" and if we didn't like it there she would accept our resignations immediately. She \"expected loyalty\" and if we weren't loyal, we weren't welcome. We tried to reason with her in the meeting, telling her it was just some general concerns we had and we agreed one person would present them to her, but she was having none of it. No solution for the problems that were making ALL of her employees upset, it was all about her and her sister, no concern for her indentured servants (as we called ourselves)\n\nI should have quit then and there when she said that she'd accept our resignations, but I didn't. I did start looking for jobs though. I had an interview one day and I texted in sick. I had quietly let one of my coworkers, who I thought I could trust, know about the interview. When I texted my boss I got the response \"Good luck at your interview. I expect loyalty, not silly games\"  So...I went to my interview. It went well. (didn't end up taking the job though, not a great fit) I got home and wrote up my letter of resignation and emailed it. Told her I would not be returning and would have someone collect my personal items for me. In the email I told her exactly what I thought of what she did.\n\nI was in the middle of a lot of projects. This was for an e-commerce company so I can see a lot of what's being done by checking out the website. I can see a LOT of stuff got stalled or restarted completely. It definitely set them back and the person who I'm pretty sure ratted me out about the interview was running off her ass and had a lot of late nights at the office, from what I heard. \n\nI still am friends with one person who works there (and is desperately looking to gtfo) she said they now have daily affirmations, of the boss' choosing, that they have to recite 3x daily. On Mondays they receive a sheet of paper with the week's affirmations printed out. I only wish she had tried that shit while I was there. She would have gotten a piece of my mind.",
            "This could be applied to my (soon to be ex?) husband. He has mommy issues. He has daddy issues. He has sibling issues. Basically, his parents divorced when he was in grade school and no one really ever parented him from that point forward. His dad left. His mom, in my opinion, has no sense of accountability and can never be wrong about anything, so not exactly a great role model. She restarted her career after the divorce and left him in the dust. \n\nMy husband never really healed from the aftermath of his parents\u2019 divorce. I can understand, my own parents\u2019 divorce negatively effects me to this day in some ways. Though my parents are the polar opposite of his. They are extremely involved and giving. I think the more my parents involved themselves in our lives the more he realized what a parent was supposed to look like. When our baby was born and my parents worked to be helpful and bond with him I think it almost showed a giant magnifying glass on the abandonment issues he had buried and run from his whole life. \n\nHe cracked this year. Ran away with someone. Threw me and my loving family away, but (briefly) got the attention he was yearning for from both his shitty absentee parents in his time of crisis. That didn\u2019t last too long. \n\nHe burnt our marriage and the life we had built over 10+ years to the ground. He felt so sad and wanted me to feel as badly as he did. Though, any warmth he enjoyed from doing so quickly dissipated. He regrets everything.\n\n\nUpdate: We have been separated for months but within the past 6 weeks he\u2019s been trying to open the door. I\u2019ve been patient with him and encouraging while he tries to find the right specialists. He called me tonight to tell me he\u2019s back with her. So, I guess he doesn\u2019t really regret anything. I need to redact that last sentence- wouldn\u2019t want to be inaccurate. \n\nAnd just FYI, I was still in denial about having to get a divorce. It\u2019s stupid but I wanted to work through some of this even if we couldn\u2019t stay married through therapy. \n\nHold me accountable, Reddit, I\u2019m 100% done.",

My work load was literally doubled and I was never listened to about my concerns. I begged them to hire a second tech, even part time, just so I can breathe and have my mental state not be ruined. They always told me no and then piled on more work. Got mad at me when patients weren\u2019t complying, ran me around like a dog for hours, cut my lunch hour for no reason, and refused to give me any sort of pay raise when minimum wage went up. \n\nI was at my wits end and everyone but my manager and the therapists could see it. I also experienced a privacy violation that I wish I reported to HR. I was basically forced to tell my manager why I needed to take a day off and for what the medical procedure I was getting was for. Another instance I was told I was \u2018clearly\u2019 gaining weight by one of the therapists and my manager, and then they laughed about it. \n\nI was so pissed off that I put in my two weeks, but I could barely make it past two more days. After one god awful busy morning, I packed up my stuff during my break, clocked out, and went home. I sent a text to my manager saying I won\u2019t be coming back and I blocked her. \n\nI felt bad doing it, but I had nurses and aides TELLING me to quit bc they saw how miserable I was. About a week or so later they went into lockdown bc of COVID.",

So of course they were at every school event with him and insisted he attend with them. They even expected him to eat lunch in one of their classrooms every day.\n\nHe was so ready to get out of that environment that by the time he was 18 he threw away a full ride college scholarship to work at a fast food restaurant. He ended up getting into drugs, married someone who was also in the drugs and they had four kids that they did not take care of.  \n\nHis parents ended up getting custody of the kids by the time the oldest was around eight and the youngest was a baby. Unfortunately they really didn\u2019t change their parenting methods.  The older three are doing OK, haven\u2019t had the easiest life and have not made the best choices but they are independent and raising their families.

When we were seniors, she was talking about all the losers she\u2019d dated, been mistreated by, and how none of them were going anywhere in life. She said something to the effect of, \u201cI\u2019d love to be there when they inevitably get locked up for drugs or domestic abuse, or both.\u201d\n\nShe got a law degree, moved back to our town, and is now the county prosecutor.",

A couple months in, and (being the gossip/small town rumor mill type person) she starts badmouthing and spreading rumors about the kid (as they got to know each other better, they apparently gained a distain for one another). Because this is a charter school and the kid had transferred from a public school, he just told his parents he'd rather be back in public highschool again.

            "I end up crying after I finished this story but here it goes:\n\nI worked  as a nanny for triplet boys (since 18mos old) and a little girl (since birth) for more than 4 years.\n\nMinimum wage but free rent and food so it\u2019s fine with me. 4 years and no salary increase, they were separating in the last few months of my stay and I did not bother to ask for a raise because I do not want to add to their problem.\n\nI had to take care and discipline the 4 kids, cook theirs and their parent\u2019s food and clean the house. Paid 10 Canadian dollars for my overtime... during the last four months of my stay I have also been cleaning 2 houses since the parents separated. No extra pay given and again I am too nice and stupid to ask since separating is expensive.\n\nI agreed to stay until summer since the kids needed me while they\u2019re still adjusting to their new situation, or so I thought.\n\nI work part time as a house cleaner. When Covid hit, my employer is not very happy of me working outside. I took precautions and do social distancing while cleaning houses, wears a mask and gloves the whole time. Also, when I clean, the owners of the house leave me alone so there\u2019s really no close contact. We also have very few cases here in Ottawa.\n\nThe father got so paranoid of the Covid he sent me the message he sent to his ex wife. In his message he said \u201c hey k, I am not really comfortable of J going out cleaning other people\u2019s house with Covid going on. As I\u2019ve told you I don\u2019t need her   and is only keeping her because of you.  Thoughts?\u201d\n\nI was filled with anger. 4 years I gave for their kids which I loved so much I was willing to turn back a job offer to me just so I can stay with them while they were adjusting due to the separation. 4 years of hard work only to be told I am not needed, as if I am the one who begged them to stay on this job. I thought I was  a part of their family. I treated the kids like my own children. They are MY children.\n\nI told the father it\u2019s fine if they fired me. I don\u2019t care. I have a job waiting for me that I kept turning down because of them. Never mix love with your job guys, you\u2019ll only get hurt in the end.\n\nMaybe it was a scare tactic to make me stop working outside but it surely backfired on him. He said sorry, he was not thinking properly. That they love me and was so sorry he said those things and has hurt me. That they still needed me. But no, I told him. You said it yourself, you DON\u2019T NEED ME. \n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t leave, we have a contract!\u201d\n\n\u201cContract\u2019s done, it was only a verbal agreement that I\u2019ll stay til summer\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cStill that\u2019s valid, you have to finish it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but I can also resign and give you 2 weeks notice according to the law.\u201d\n\n\nI resigned and left the house 2 weeks after.\n\nI was able to see the kids 2 and half months after I left. It was hard to explain to them why I am not living with them anymore. They still seem to not understand it since I\u2019ve been with them since they were very young and still does not understand that I am just their nanny. I am J who takes care of them, plays with them and cooks delicious food for them :)\n\nIt\u2019s hard because I really did loved them so much but I also have to accept that they were not my children.

They ignored small problems on my truck until the problem left me stuck on the side of the road, then they blamed me for not reporting the problem.

Normal clothes otherwise and it was just a tulle tutu in the school colors, no big deal. Accept we're in one of the most homophobic radical Christian areas in the country. He nearly got suspended, nearly got sent home, and even though it was masked as a punishment for littering on school grounds, administration essentially cancelled that years Halloween party. \nI also remember the headmistress, government teacher, and financial lit/ computer tech teachers all egging a significant part of the student body into using anti LGBT slurs. \nThe same shit kept happening our senior year, but when we hung out he seemed fine. He was cool, essentially helped me graduate because he saved my ass in AP stats, and was a part of the scholars program at the school. I think he was like third or fourth in our graduating class over all. \nThat summer we met up a couple times for game nights but we kinda drifted.

I'll regret that for the rest of my life.\nThe night before my first day of collage a mutual friend of ours texted me that he was in jail, and probably going to prison for the rest of his life.\nHe had originally had a scholarship to Ohio State for engineering, full ride and everything. However for some reason they decided to revoke that last second and leave him with nothing. On top of it his dad was verbally emotionally and physically abusive, and said he'd kill any of his kids who came out as LGBT. \nHe decided the best way to pay for collage was to rig his dad's car with a bomb, and then apply for government funding with a single mother.\nThe bomb didn't quite kill his bastard dad but he was in critical condition for a long time.

The only reason I got wrapped up in that group was that one of my only two friends occasionally hung out with them.)\n\nIn a couple of weeks the entire group stopped sitting together and the two that Psycho singled out were screaming at each other in the halls. I was grateful, because it meant my friend who sometimes sat with them never did again and I never had to be around them. By the end of high school, every time I saw Psycho's two victims, they were always alone and depressed. But Psycho himself had made new friends; some of them were black dudes who thought his Nazi shit was hilarious.",
            "There\u2019s an African tribe called the Masai who acknowledge each other by asking \u201cAnd how are the children?\u201d And the response would be \u201cAll the children are well.\u201d My wife works in a nonprofit who\u2019s goal is to create trauma-informed communities. It\u2019s based in St.Louis and the majority of the work is done in schools. \n\nMany schools in the region have come to use the Masai example as a way to explain trauma in our young children. Can we confidently say our children are well? That they are safe and protected and nurtured? How can we view the behavior of children who we know are not well through this lens of trauma?  Now that we know they aren\u2019t well, does their misbehavior make more sense? Once we do that, how do we heal our children and our communities. It\u2019s difficult work.",

            "My bio mom told me I was dead to her when I was 16. I am 30 and I still have no idea what made her say that. I know she hated that I was into heavy metal and I played in a band but it had nothing to do with her. Everything was a personal attack on her and she would retaliate against me for things I didn\u2019t even do, or intend to do to anger her. She was full blown narcissistic personality disordered and pretty malignant. Kind of like an annoying middle school female bully. I would do whatever it took to make her shut up because she was so annoying. Later I found out that she had put me on medicine and ruined a good portion of my life (munchousens by proxy) because she couldn\u2019t control me. When I got my own cellphone plan when she turned off my data in retaliation (once I moved) she mailed me clothes and my prom dress all cut up. Through childhood, she poured bleach in my favorite band tshirts. She had also taken scissors to the dress and some of my clothes and mailed me some of my exes clothes that I had missed at one point. \nI\u2019m a pretty forgiving person but that was it .\n\nI studied up on narcissism and in my stay in nursing school, I had gotten pretty good at psychiatry. I estimated what brand of narcissism she had and proceeded to say everything I knew would ignite her narcissistic rage. \nI closed down my apartment, and wrote her a long text message about how I hated her, I called her out on all her lies and manipulation and how she was jealous of me (she really was, all of these are true). She got busted cheating and turned everyone else against my dad except me so I brought up how she\u2019s a skank and a whore. Then I ended it with ps \u201cyou\u2019re dead to me\u201d. I was 26. \n\nThen I moved so she wouldn\u2019t know where I lived and I changed my number. Apparently she went nuclear and is still furious because she hasn\u2019t been able to get revenge on me. If you know a narcissist, you are the devil if you think for yourself or simply disagree with them on a color. \nAfter all the years of torment and being the scapegoat, I felt the warmth of finally winning and being free by totally burning her side of the family and anyone that associated with her\u2019s bridges.

            "Oh, this is me!\n\nMy parents are both pieces of work. They joined the jehova's witnesses cult back when I was 11, and made sure to make our lives misserable. They forced me out of the football team, and the track team in high school because \"if i have time for sports, i have time to preach the word of jehova\". They pulled me out of German classes, because \"german is the language of nazis, and they prosecuted our brothers\". They refused to sign my college  grant applications or scholarships, or enrollments because \"I should be studying the word of jehova and preparing for his kingdom, instead of chasing worldly possessions\" also because \"jehova will provide if i dedicate myself to him\". Basically, they wanted me to be a full time preacher, and live off the generosity of the congregations. Nothing wrong with doing that, except I would rather not live from hand to mouth.\n\nFurthermore, since I was the only one of my siblings who found ways to avoid being forced into a baptism without misbehaving or getting in trouble, I was always in their sights. I was never allowed to go to any parties, or sleepovers. I was always criticized for my drawings, or online usernames.\n\nMy xfire handle used to be  \u03a9 OOOhhhmmmmmm \u03a9 . They made me change it because apparently using \" \u03a9 \" was a gateway to the devil. I've always liked Age of Empires II, and i had to play it in secret, and install it on alternate paths, hide the icons etc, because \"learning to play war is a sin\". I was forbidden from submitting content to deviantart, because \"Deviant\" was another word for \"demon\".\n\nAll in all, it was a miserable time.\n\nFast forward 15 years, my parents are now divorced. Obviously, I grew up to be a sarcastic asshole. I'm also a cynic, but hey. And because of the time and forced participation I endured, I know all of their lore. So for the past 5 or so years, I have been ripping on them every chance I get, about their sinful divorce, about how they acted one way in the congregation, and a completely unchristian way at home. I've straight up called them hypocrites to their faces. I've named them the reason why I am an atheist, and have a loathing for their cult. As a side note, none of my siblings remain in the cult. They have all found ways to get themselves expelled, and every one of them has given their \"go fuck yourselves you lunatics\" speech on their way out.\n\nBut, that's not enough really. So I've showed up to their respective congregations, and openly discussed all of their dirty laundry to their elders, to their faces. At my dad's, I showed up uninvited, and he knew right away something was up. I met with some of the elders, whom I knew from way back in the day, and would ask them if x or y behavior was acceptable. They would tell me it wasn't, because reasons, and I'd ask them why was my dad allowed to give sermons and speeches, if he was engaging in such behavior openly (dating apps, beating us with a belt whenever we refused to attend a meeting, breaking our belongings while chanting psalms to 'cleanse the house' etc). He was very upset at me, for essentially ratting him out. I told him what he always told me \"man up and own it\".\n\nMy mom was the best one. Turns out, she was having an affair for the last 2 years of her marriage with another brainwashed twat, but in order to keep appearances, my parents had decided to simply state they fell out of love and terminated their marriage once my youngest sibling had moved out. This last bit is at least true. So when I found out, I called her up, and asked her if I could go to her next meeting. She was ecstatic about it. It was the first time I had openly expressed interest in attending. I got dressed up, and showed up. When she started introducing me to her elders, I said \"So, I have a few questions I'd like to ask if that's alright\". My mom just locked her eyes on mine.\n\n\"So, I understand that marriage cannot be dissolved unless there is a major reason right? Would adultery qualify?\" The elder just raised an eyebrow and answered. He said that yes, adultery would be a valid reason to terminate a marriage, and the adulterer would be censored (censoring basically means they stop talking to you, and you aren't allowed to preach nor participate in the congregation. you can still attend). My mom grabbed my arm and squeezed it. I ignored it, didn't even look at her.\n\nSo I asked in a slightly raised voice: \"So, what would happen if, for example my mom, who was having an affair with an elder on a different congregation, were to lie about the reason of her divorce, and move to another congregation to cover it up. Would she still be allowed to meet and preach and participate as she has been so far?\". A few heads are turned my way now.\n\nThe elder just froze and gave me a smirk and a nervous laugh, then looked at my mom. The entire time, I have a smile on my face, just locked on the elder. He cleared his throat, and asked me to discuss this in a private setting. I declined. Why should the truth be hidden, if the whole point of preaching the word of god is to make it known for everyone?\n\nAt this point, my mom called out to me and asked me to please follow her to one of the side rooms. I declined since I was having a conversation and didn't want to be rude and leave the elder standing there; not until I got my answer of course.\n\nSo the elder made up some bullshit \"case by case\" likely story, and asked me to please go with my mom and discuss it with her privately.\n\nShe was pissed. How dare I humiliate her like that in public. Well mom, you are supposed to be an agent of truth and a beacon of merit. How dare you lie to these good people and hide your true nature, you hypocrite?\n\nNeedless to say, we are not on speaking terms. She was censored, and eventually she stopped attending altogether. I have heard from my cousins who still keep in touch with her, that she has renounced her faith because they treated her like shit afterwards. So much for the love of the congregation, lmao.\n\nMy  dad is a bit of a different outcome. He stopped attending because of the great shame I caused him, but he understands I was right in doing so, as he was being a hypocrite by continuing to attend.\n\nBut, he has no intentions of stopping his behavior. He continues to pray before every meal, and reads the bible constantly. He doesn't preach or gather, and most certainly doesn't talk to me about religion or \"being a good christian\" anymore. He has also introduced me to like, 3 of his girlfriends, so I don't think he will be going back.",

            "I was a youth counselor in my 20s. I worked with troubled kids of all stripes. Some ex gang members who had shot people, some middle class suburbanites who ran track and wanted a place to hang out on wednesday nights, and mostly a lot of kids with disengaged, inattentive parents dumping unconfronted trauma on their children. All of them good kids. I was an unpaid volunteer, love coming out of my eyeballs for these guys. I'd be driving all over town to find one or two who were ragged out on cough medicine because they couldn't get booze yet and literally carry them to the front door of their parents house. Every one of them had a good heart, problems or no.  \n\nThen there was Devin. He was handsome, athletic, and his parents had money, but they were entirely absent. When you work with kids you see plenty of poor families where the adults are busy making ends meet, but there is a difference between can't be there for you because bills are due and *won't*. Devin was hollow. The emptiness in his eyes, along with the rabid hunger for human affection, it felt dangerous. One of the few kids who were closest to him would tell me how absolutely distant and uninterested his parents were in him. How they'd buy him anything but denied him the attention and affection he needed. That level of emotional starvation coupled with an amex and good looks, you've got a dangerous combination. I think it was easy for him to form surface connections but never enough to stop feeling absolutely alone.\n\nAnyway I moved on from that part of my life and aside from the occasional wistful memory of old times I didn't think much about him until I heard his name on the news when he took an assault rifle into Sutherland Baptist church and murdered  26 people.  \n\nThe most frustrating lesson from those years was knowing that whatever I did to help the kids it was always the parents who really needed fixing.",
            "Me. At least mentally. I'm still fucked up but I'm getting better.\n\nI was that stereotypical case of a hard working mother and horrible father. My father, up until he got thrown out of the house when I was maybe 10ish, was criminally negligent. He was supposed to babysit me but he just gamed, slept, or watched porn all fucking day; the only thing he ever did for me was teach me how to heat up food so he didnt have to do that either. He got thrown out but the school system still ran me down. I was out of shape and had almost no friends, nearly the entire school hated my guts and tormented me daily to the point that as a third grader I was stuck in the center of a literal circle of kids that made fun of me and would run in poke me and then come back to the outside of the circle. I could get them because of how big I was and small they were. I got in trouble for trying to fight back before my mother came in and went nuclear on the principal.\n\nThings sucked like that for a while until my mother got a new boyfriend and then they got married. The guy was nice for a time, but after a couple years he turned into a monster. Horribly abusive in every way except physical. I think that was when things peaked. I was a mess. I wanted to kill myself and/or him. It was nasty as hell, and I'm ashamed of myself but I still remember that feeling and how he made me feel. Hell, he still makes me seethe with rage even though he's been out of my life over a year now. He just pisses me off that much. Due to him and other factors I even went to the mental hospital for a few days when I told a doctor with a chiller voice that a lack of gun access was the only reason that I was speaking to her at that moment; which was more true than I'd like to admit..\n\nI am no longer a threat to anyone, and I'm nowhere near as much of a threat to myself. But I still remember those days, and I'm still depressed, partly thanks to everything that happened to me throughout my life. \n\nYou might be thinking where does the 'burn down the village' part come into play. Well that was with my near suicide and murderous thoughts to purge my ex-step father from the world and make him pay for what he did to me. That and the darker thoughts that some kids have when it seems like an entire school system tries to hurt you and beat you down. I was that case that could have turned into a dark day at my school, and I'm not proud of that fact. I dont like how dark my mind was, but I've become stable after a lot of work and a lot of changing my situation. I still have a long ways to go, but I'm no longer a danger to people who hurt me.\n\nThanks for reading if you made it this far. Might as well have poured all my heart out honestly.

            "I feel like I'm a pretty good example of this. It's not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nI had it pretty rough growing up. My mother (E) lost custody of me when I was 2 years old. She was just generally unfit all around. At that point she'd had my older half sister (T) taken away a couple years before. \n\nThe state gave me to my half sisters paternal grandmother (K) since she'd had my older sister already. Unfortunately for me, this led to years of psychological, emotional and physical abuse at K's hands. I tried countless times to report, to seek help from adults around me, even in my schools. I wasn't worth the trouble to most of them,  but some just feared losing their homes or having trouble started for them, as K was the property manager in the co-op we lived in. T was of no help, because she was raised as the preferred child, she was the one K wanted to raise. I was just thrown into her lap, because no one else in the family would take me. I was never allowed to do normal kid/teenager stuff. I was bound to the house, always cleaning, always grounded. I took regular beatings if even one speck of dust was found, sometimes just for asking a question, or no reason at all. My neighbors called me Cinderella. I know they knew what was going on. I sought help subtly and blatantly depending on how worried I was about the attempt getting back to K. \n\nE moved into the neighborhood when she gave birth to my youngest sister, making some sad attempt at reconnecting, and for the most part succeeding only due to K wanting T and herself to have a relationship with my youngest sister. She always said she made it work, not just for them, but to benefit me as well, though the abuse made it very clear that she didn't care even a smidge about what was good for me. To be clear, never once did K lay a finger on T or our younger sister, and T was always happy to cover K's ass, so long as she was getting the newest things (cell phones, laptops, makeup, anything materialistic).\n\nTo be honest, I blame T for a lot of it. As conceited as it sounds, I think it boils down to her being jealous of me. She was a huge troublemaker - not good at school, talking to middle aged men online, always doing something she shouldn't, sneaking out, etc. I was the opposite. I had good grades, I was multitalented, I was a good kid for the most part. T always knew how to encourage K to find fault in me or something I did. K, as a 50ish year old woman obviously knew right from wrong, so perhaps T wasn't the root cause, but she was absolutely a catalyst. T left home to live with E for a few months, who'd also by now cut ties with K due to unrelated circumstances. T had begun tiring of rules, and in those three months she was gone, K didn't dare lay a hand on me. I finally got to feel in control. And I'd be lying if I didn't say I took FULL advantage. I got ballsy. More intent on not being the victim anymore. If K made an attempt at going back to taking things from me for no reason or I felt she was going to hit me or anything of the like, I'd make it clear I was all she had left since T had run off and cut ties for the most part, and I wouldn't hesitate to leave. She might have been a monster at that point, but she was afraid of being left alone. \n\nIt wouldn't last forever, though and I knew it. K was starting to get more touch and go. A long series of events took place when I was 15, in which K was jailed for 24 hours on an unrelated charge, and I took the opportunity to try to run. T was still living across the street with E. E was still an awful mother, but my younger sister was brought up pretty decent thankfully. She wasn't of much help, but knew what was going on and did next to nothing. I used two neighbors I trusted, and the boy I was seeing at the time to make my escape, but ended up being found 24 hours later, when K was bailed out and released and discovered me missing, by the next door neighbor who was meant to be watching me at the time (not someone who helped me) and returned home, despite telling everyone along the way why I'd run away. K and the neighbor convinced almost all the adults who'd helped that I'd been lying about it all. \n\nDue to the charge K had been jailed for and some issues between her and other neighbors, we had to move to a condo a city or two away, with K's mother who needed in home care as her health was declining. I started working a job, and most of my money was taken from me to help pay the bills. K didn't work, she was on disability. Then, T decided that living with E was not as free range as she'd thought it would be and wanted to move back in with us. I protested, but was shut down, as T always got what she wanted. T and her then BF moved into the home, taking the basement I was meant to convert to my room, leaving me nowhere to sleep but the couch. Neither of them worked or wanted to. This was going to be the permanent arrangement as I was told.\n\nWithin 2 weeks, the abuse returned one final time, all thanks to T, because she wanted my login to the computer to rat me out for exploring my sexuality through texting a boy I knew at school (Not great. I know, but I was a teenager, and I wasn't talking to anyone I didn't know or shouldn't have been.) I wouldn't give up the password. T figured it out. And the rest is pain filled history.  \n\nTo make an already long story a bit shorter, I'll spare too many of the details from here on out. But after it happened that final time, K asked me if I was going to tell anyone, because it wasn't \"a can of worms she needed opened right now\". I smiled through bitter tears, telling her I loved her and wouldn't tell anyone. \n\nBut I did. I tried to lie at first, because I had tried to cover the bruising with makeup, but everytime someone asked, I asked myself why I was protecting them. Each time, my resolve to lie weakened and I decided I was NEVER going to be a victim to them again. The next day, when the resolve to protect them finally devolved, I tried to tell anyone who would listen. I told friends at school, I told my boss when I went to work, I told my best friends mom, the police, E, the CPS workers, anyone. \n\nI knew what I was doing, but I didn't care anymore. I knew that K would be charged. I knew that T and her BF would have no where to go, and that they couldn't keep up the bills on their own. I was the only one in the house who worked. I knew that T wouldn't care as well for K's mom, which is probably the ONLY part I feel a *little* bad about, but she was awful to me as well when she was in good health. I knew I was blowing everything up. And I was thrilled to watch it all burn. \n\nNow, almost 9 years later, I regret nothing. K served jailtime for both the unrealted and child abuse charges. Her mother passed while she was imprisoned. T tried to keep up the house, and barely scraped by with the boyfriend. E served prison time as she remained unfit and committed crimes unrelated but also for a crime related to K's non child abuse crime. She got out eventually and hasn't changed much. \n\nNow, K is a victim to T's entitlement, using and abusing. She and T got a small house in a shit neighborhood. T has 5 kids to 2 different fathers, is dating E's boyfriends son (GROSS, if I do say so myself) and has been ostracized by the whole of the family. She apparently struggles with addiction, but its hard to trust anything she says to anyone. I personally think its a sympathy ploy. She uses K to raise her children so she can just dick about doing whatever - mostly awful things, including plenty of theft, both petty and grand. \n\nAnd me, I mostly don't speak to any of them if can help it. I mostly only talk to E when I have to so I can keep a relationship with my younger sister, since E ended up getting partial custody of her back. (Side note, she's mostly competent at raising her, and the other partial custody is my younger sisters dad, so I feel safe about how she's being raised.) I graduated high-school, secured a pretty decent job. I have amazing friends, who have become family. I had a lot of years to try to process my pain. It took a lot of time and trial and error, but I now have it pretty damn good. I have a loving boyfriend, a great roommate, we have our own trailer, two sweet cats and I get to say I built this life on my own, and with my boyfriend. \n\nI'm sorry this has been such a long comment, but I'd never felt so compelled to answer an AR post than I did this one. So I'll sum it up with this:\n\nI burned down the village, and built my own with the most important piece I could salvage - me. And I've never felt so damn warm in my life.",

I'm finally able to feel happiness a little. I've been burning villages in a desperate attempt to feel any warmth for too damn long. I'm finally being given the tools to build my own warmth from the inside. \u2661",
            "Graduation party about a year ago. \n\nWe were told we can go up the stage and have a speech at our ceremony, to talk to everyone. \n\nWell one kid requested to also have a presentation with him presented on the wall behind him. \n\nIt took about 35 seconds for the school to realize that the presentation was a collection of photos he collected over the years of his parents' molestation and violence towards him and his younger sibilings. \n\nThe teachers wanted to sop him, the headmaster told them to sit down and let his parents watch the horrors. \n\nThey were later arrested and I think are now serving about 20 years each, as the trial was quick af. \n\nBut he did burn the shit out of them, and is ashamed of his last name as of now",
            "I was a scouting troop leader and there was a kid in another troop that was \"the problem kid.\" All the teachers mumbled amongst each other about him because he was always acting up and causing disruptions, etc.\n\nOne day I noticed that he was trying to tell a teacher something, and they just kept ignoring him. He tried 2 or 3 more times and kept being ignored--cue him \"suddenly\" acting up at which point the teacher finally paid attention just to deal with the problem. And that's when I realized that the kid *wasn't* the problem--it was the teachers. No one paid attention to this kid when he was calm, so of course he ended up shouting!\n\nFrom that point on I did what I could to try and help him when I was around. If I saw him feeling ignored I'd go over and talk to him, if he started shouting or making a ruckus I'd just calmly sit and talk to him. And he always cooled down. He never would escalate when I was around.",
            "An older policeman was speaking at one seminar and telling about his long career in criminal investigation. He told us that lot of kids come from horrible circumstances without turning into criminals, if they have one adult figure in their life that provides stability and trust. But then he continued that he has never met a criminal that had loving and accepting parents."

A place where schools can give out industry certifications and bring out real world professionals to do presentations and explain their jobs.

            "Octavarium - Dream Theater\n\nAs an orchestral musician (flute), I absolutely *adore* this album. There\u2019s so much intricacy in each song and they each connect to one another and pull off of each other to build into the next song. The most obvious ones that do it are The Root of All Evil \u2014> Octavarium, where the first ends on an incomplete chord that the second eventually finishes, among other things. The irregular time signatures (5/8 being the most prominent) and changes throughout the songs as well as the use of more than just traditional rock band instruments (an entire orchestra in the case of Octavarium) make them all so interesting and keep you wanting more.\n\nI think the only song I usually skip is These Walls, but it\u2019s not because it\u2019s a bad song. It\u2019s great, I just prefer the others more in terms of the general melody.\n\nEdit: Woah this blew up! Thank you for the gold kind stranger, that\u2019s my first one ever!

We got to the Greek art bit and her friend started telling me how she was super into Greek myth, and I thought that was cool, because I was, unbeknownst to her, doing a Master's in it at the time and also keeping a blog of myth retellings, which was pretty popular, and it was a relief to have something in common with this stranger. \n\nShe then got weirdly haughty and told me she probably knew more myths than I did, so, being polite, I didn't challenge her on it and just asked her to tell me her favourite, so that we could have a conversation about it.\n\nShe proceeded to tell me the myth of Daedalus and the minotaur. I asked her how she'd heard of that one, because it's fairly obscure. She told me she'd read it on a viral blog post on a blog about mythology. \n\nIt was my blog.",

            "Basketball.\n\nI'm a very unassuming looking guy. 5'8\", 150 pounds, not a tattoo to be found. But back in the day, I was pretty athletic and could hang in games with fringe D1/semi-pro guys. But I can't emphasize how much I didn't look like it at all.\n\nAnyway, in college, hanging out in someone's room, it came up that I play a bit and some dude I didn't know started running his mouth about how he could destroy me. Just wouldn't stop talking. I gave him every out, until it basically became personally offensive.\n\nOther guys were a bit tired of this asshole hanging around, and they knew I could play, so we all trooped over to the gym, late as fuck in the dead of winter, so we could settle things.\n\n11-0 the first game. Not sure if we played after that, but I remember it was 11-0 because I made sure to not let the guy score. And I'm a pretty mellow guy and usually would have laid off and let him score a couple when it was clear that I was better, but this guy was a real asshole, so I just clamped down on him start to finish. I blocked a ton of his shit.\n\nHe stopped hanging around nearly as much after that, so I was kind of a hero to the rest of the guys. Like St. Patrick. Drove that snake out of our nation.\n\nEdit: Now that I think of it, being a short, skinny white guy who didn't try to look like I was a player, every time I stepped onto a new court, I had every other person on the floor just automatically dismiss me. You get used to it. Respect, in this case, had to be 100% earned, every time.\n\nI remember one time, after college, I moved to a new city to start a new job. New co-workers were looking for a fourth guy to fill out their three on three team. They were not shy in expressing their doubts about me and how well I'd be able to hang with them. By the end of our first practice, they were telling me I should have played at the local D1 school (edit: I wasn't that good, but it's the thought that counts). By our first game, they were clearing out when I had the ball.\n\nThose days are long gone and I've moved on to other interests, but I'm very thankful that I had those experiences.",

            "While I'd never claim I was an expert, I used to be pretty damn good at pool. My aunt and uncle had a pool table downstairs and my parents fir a variety of reasons would go over regularly and spend all day there. There was nothing else for us (me and my brother) to do so we just played pool all day for years, eventually we got bored and saw that he had a book on trick shots so we started doing that for fun. Never really mastered them, but they made for really good practice in understanding how to get the ball to do what you want.\n\nSo anyway, for my buddies 20th birthday he wanted to go to a pool hall and invited a ton of people. Then he told he it was going to be a tournament, drinks for individual games, and a 50/50 type of deal for the winner (he gets half regardless because it was his birthday), insisted I come and I caved eventually.\n\nGet there, first game, they break, and that was the only shot they got. Rest of mine were pretty similar. At the end I just looked at him, \"told you not to invite me...\"\n\nFound out after that a bunch of them had never even played pool before, felt pretty bad so I took the money and bought everyone drinks with it.",
            "I would never go as far to say that I'm a fencing expert, but I have been fencing casually for about 5 years total, and consider myself pretty good for someone who's casual. A new person came to our fencing practice and demanded of a few men that we do a king of the hill style match up. I couldn't tell exactly what it was, but I could smell the toxic behavior rolling off of him when everyone declined but he continued to insist we do it. He somehow fixated on me, and I decided I'd give it a go on a normal 15 point bout. Initially I always fence one style, in order to test out my opponent before switching to a style to trump theirs. So the first few points I see him cheering himself on as he established a 1-2 point lead. By 4-2 in his favor, I already figured out all the flaws in his fencing style, and proceeded to get the next 10 points without losing one round. I could see the guy fuming at the end when I beat him 15-5. It was a good feeling.",

He talked up how pizza was in his blood, how his dad ran the pizza place around the corner years ago. I remained silent and let my skills answer for themselves. I got a buddy to let us use one of Baker's Pride ovens at his restaurant. We even had total strangers try our pizzas. Every last person chose my pizza over his. I never mentioned to him that I've worked in pizza places almost every day for the last thirty years.

            "Not me but my brother & best friend. We were in Baltimore for a baseball weekend in 2009 and hanging out at a bar across from Camden yards.  They had a Silver Strike bowling video game. At our local bar back in Boston we had one as well. I\u2019m decent at the game but my brother and buddy were Fucking amazing at this game. Bowling 300 games and what not. So two dudes are playing this game and drinking. We ask them if we can play when they\u2019re done. They ask if we want to play them. We said sure. My brother and buddy destroy these guys. Like it wasn\u2019t even close. These dudes said it was a fluke and they wanted a rematch but this time for a round of beers. Again, annihilation city. But they kept wanting to play, to eventually win a game. No lie, after THIRTEEN ROUNDS OF BEERS they finally gave up. They were great guys. We saw them the next day at the same bar and they walked up to Us with beers in hand already and said \u201crematch\u201d. To this day we still hang out with them whenever we go to Baltimore.  And to this day, they have never won.\n\nEdit for details: the guys were buying 2 beers each time they lost a game to the two guys they lost to, for my brother and friend. The beers were Natty Boh, which is Baltimore's cheap gross awesome beer.  I can\u2019t remember the price, but they were under 2 bucks a piece back then. They would buy the beers  and they\u2019d just start piling up on the table next to the machine so we were all just drinking them.  I\u2019d say around 25-30 beers between the 5 of us in 4 or 5 hours.  Tab was probably 60ish bucks for beers but we were there all night getting wings and a million apps so we all just paid the tab anyways.",

So attractively simple claim, yet so inaccurate (for the mid latitudes where I live).\n\nEdit2: For climate change, the top thing I hear is that \"they don't account for clouds in the climate models\".

It's not like I never won but I was always just \"middle of the pack\" and after 2 years of this literally no one would consider me to be some \"fighting game wizard\"--quite the opposite if anything.\n\nThen, for the first time ever, the group decided to pick up a 3d fighter (instead of a 2d one): Soul Calibur (3 I think?)... and unknown to anyone in our play group I'd grinded Soul Calibur I for 10 hours a day, every day, for 3-4 years... against 5 people who were doing the same and were just as good as me.\n\nIt honestly wasn't even fun.

I told him how I play lacrosse and my playing history. He asked why I didn\u2019t speak up and say anything and I said I tried to tell him.\n\nAnyway, I ended up running the rest of the class and even ended up sitting down with him and going through the correct and easier way to teach the game and skills.",

The lake is deceptively large, about a half mile across, so I warned him that if he isn't a strong swimmer it could be dangerous. \n\nHe was running out of gas after about 2 minutes, so I offered to let him off the hook, but he insisted he would finish.

The bartender spoke the most English so I asked him what his favorite Shochu was, and things got a little more comfortable as we drank and the whole bar tried to talk to us. \n\nSomeone mentioned Mario Kart and I said \u201cyeah yeah\u201d - so the bartender points to an old super famicom in the corner and apparently I have accepted the challenge. \n\nI smiled to myself and my wife thinks it\u2019s funny because I used to have some skill at this game.

When he first meets people, he can be pretty quiet and seems a little out of place. After he gets to know people, he opens up and is a blast to be around.\n\nMy old buddies, for some reason, decided to hustle my new buddy in pool. I mean, super textbook shark moves. Let's play a friendly game, and if you think you're any good at it, we can play for money, etc, etc.\n\nWell, the thing that I knew and they didn't was my new buddy is a guy who played on the circuits for a while, winning pool tournaments across Texas. He lived and breathed pool, and, of course, saw these guys coming from a mile away. And I just watched it all go down. Figured, if they are going to treat someone that I bring over that way, they deserve what they get.\n\nHe roped 'em in like only Ali could. Missed super easy shots, made it look like he lucked in just enough to keep the game interesting and pull out the \"lucky\" win... Then, they played for money. I can't even remember how much per ball, but he played two or three games, slowly seeming to get better or lucking out just enough to keep them engaged while still taking a little of their money. \n\nThen, the last game happened, and I've never seen someone come alive more quickly. He sank shot after shot after shot. Shots I couldn't make if I practiced for a year straight. The entire time, taunting them and updating how much money they owed them. I don't think my old friend had a chance to take a shot at all.\n\nAfterwards, my old friends were furious: \"How could you bring this guy over here and let him hustle us like that??\"\n\n\"How could you try to hustle a new friend of mine just minutes after I bring him over and introduce him to you,\" I asked. \"You earned this one, man.\"\n\nIt ends happily, though.

            "Everyone thinks they are amazing at Mario Kart. They used to be good as a kid and think they still are. \n\nI played 2-4 hours everyday in undergrad (a couple years ago). I raced in local and school tournaments and won most of the time. I was within seconds on several course records. I have every course memorized and know exactly when to brake on every turn.  \n\nI don\u2019t play much anymore, but anytime somebody sees my Mario Kart painting (I won it at a local tournament), they tell me how amazing they are. I\u2019m happy to absolutely destroy them. It\u2019s an otherwise useless skill.\n\nEdit to answer questions: My best game is Mario Kart 8 (and Deluxe since it\u2019s basically the same). I like to think I\u2019d be good at Double Dash and MK7 since that\u2019s what I played as a kid, but I doubt I actually am. \n\nIf you think you can beat me on MK64, you\u2019re right. I got humbled at a New Years party when I assumed my skills would translate and I finished dead last. Mario Kart is honestly not super high skill, just memorization and optimization. \n\nAnd yes, you need to brake on most courses at 200cc. I promise y\u2019all can\u2019t beat me on Deluxe\n\nI can\u2019t find the painting online and I don\u2019t have it in this apartment.

He talked a big game and had a pretty good k/d from his public games. \n\nWe played and I beat him with a pistol only. This game you start with weapons so there\u2019s no economy in it. So he\u2019d always have his main weapon every round. \n\nHe didn\u2019t know that I was on the #1 team in Canada, LifeLine, and was the #1 sniper in NA at the time. I was playing against top teams all over the world at that time and would regularly play pick up games with top players daily.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to add his reaction. It's a bit underwhelming but here it is, copied from another reply.\n\nThe next day he pretty much found me and asked me to teach him. I basically told him to play more 5v5 scrims and pick up games with and against better people. And to focus on things like crosshair placement, entering open areas on angles, and using angles to your advantage whenever possible.\n\nHe never played again. I don't think he realized there were levels to the game. And that rank meant nothing there, there were amazingly good people with super low level accounts because all they did was play pick up games and scrims. Eg: My account never went past the rank that was needed to unlock the sniper. Which wasn't really high up there.",

            "I loved reading. I still do, but not as easy to read as much as I used to. \n\nAnyway. I was working at a bookstore after school, I was a nervous teen that worked in the children's department. Since I was too shy to talk to coworkers, and no one wanted to get stuck in the kids section, I would spend a lot of my downtime reading. It was great as kids books are quick and easy, and you can catch up on ten new books in an hour. On slower days, I could finish some of the kids chapter books in one go. Some series I would read from start to finish in a week.\n\nI quickly learned a LOT about the books in the children's department. Over time, I made friends with a lot of the local teachers and would try to get recommendations from them, or just ask them questions I wasn't able to answer earlier in the week. It was really helpful with summer reading and holiday chaos. I knew just about every book in that department, and a solid amount of the teen section (which was still sort of a 'new' reading section).\n\nHowever, as I was still in high school and it was very apparent that I was just a teenager helping them, some people wouldn't want to ask me for help. I was too young. The series was for little kids so they need to ask a parent instead, sorry. Whatever reasons, apparently I looked too young to be able to offer the help they wanted.\n\nOf course, my coworkers would often bring them right back to me. I loved proving them wrong and there were a lot of times where someone would assume I wouldn't know what was up, be vague and frustrated, and then amazed when I would just hand it to them within the next 30 seconds. Or describe the cover in detail, with some plot points and my favorite part of the story. Some would come back and ask for my help, others would just go do whatever they needed to I guess.\n\nSo books.",

            "Not so much an \"I challenge you to do this\" more of a \"I warn you not to.\" I'm a white guy, was eating at a Mexican restaurant. I'm kinda picking at my mostly empty plate, waiter walks but and was like \"you shouldn't eat that\" pointing at the red pepper. I just look him straight in the eyes, pick it up with my hand, and pop the whole thing in my mouth and chew. I've loved spicy food since I was a little kid and while I cant keep pace with actual \"Thai hot\" regular Mexican food is no challenge."

But when I think of that time which normally saddens me, I immediately think about all the good times we had. The valuable life advice I got from him. And that helps.\n\nEdit: First I want to thank you all for sharing your kind words and messages. Sharing your stories and the current phases you are in when it comes to losing someone close to you. There\u2019s no magical process or words I can offer any of you to make it better. I can only share from my own experience that it just took time and trying to always remember the good times. We both loved wrestling and football. We both loved conversations. We both loved some whiskey and a nice big steak together. Those and many more good memories I hold and cherish. Thank you as well for those of you kind enough to spend some of your hard earned money to award me as well. I will calculate the amount given and pledge to donate to a local charity.",

            "r/endlessthread did an amazing episode of their Reddit-centric podcast (Endless Thread) about dealing with loss that was called Shipwrecked. In it the shared a post that often graces Reddit that I have come to love in times of loss, as well as it\u2019s backstory. \n\n\u201cAll right. Here goes. I'm old. And so what that means is I've survived so far and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, coworkers, acquaintances, grandparents, my mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. But here's my two cents \u2014 I wish you could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it not to matter. I don't want it to become something that just passes. (man's voice reading same passage fades in) My scars are a testament to the love and the relationships that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut or even gouged. And that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love and the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.\n\nAs for grief, you'll find that it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you\u2019re drowning with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's something physical. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.\n\nIn the beginning, the waves are 100 hundred feet tall and they crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find that the waves are still a hundred feet tall but they come further apart and when they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But, in between, you can breathe and you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song or a picture. A street intersection. The smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything. And the wave comes crashing. But in between the waves, there is life.\n\nSomewhere down the line, and it's different for everyone, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart and you can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare International, you can see it coming for the most part and you prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of wreckage, but you'll come out.\n\nTake it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming. And somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come and you'll survive them, too. If you're lucky you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.\u201d\n\nIt goes on so beautifully. I strongly encourage you to listen to the episode, particularly the last part where the poem is read live. It\u2019s worth it. \n\n\nhttps://www.wbur.org/endlessthread/2019/06/14/shipwrecked",
            "Hey OP, \nI've written out this several times on reddit, on this account and old ones as well, but I'm going to write you out a new response because--as you'll find as time passes--perspective on death changes over time. \n\nWhen I was 18, my best friend died my first week of college. The grieving process was further complicated since I was unable to attend her funeral (I couldn't pay for my own flight ticket back home and my parents deemed it unnecessary for me to fly back to attend). Then, two years later, my partner (who is, to this day, the only man I've ever truly loved) committed suicide. \n\nI know grief like the back of my hand. This is a familiar pain. It is an original pain. But it is not an eternal pain. \n\nFor a long while after these losses, it felt like they coloured my entire world. Every memory, past and present, felt cloaked in incredibly sadness. My waking and dreaming life were completely consumed by mourning--and the transition was disorienting. The suddenness, and permanence of death carries physical weight. It drains the world of colour. It casts you into a sea of deep, thrashing waves, and you feel powerless to stay afloat above the blackened pitch of it. Submerged in grief, in dreams, in the interstices between awake and dreaming where you realize at the outset of every new day that this is, in fact, real--it levels you. It is no mistake that people who talk about grief liken it to a feeling of drowning, of becoming a husk of your former self, of being completely helpless to combat a loss that feels more like a piece of you has been bored out and taken away than it does something external. \n\nThe fact is, we are undone by each other. \nWe are undone by grief. \nWe are undone by the person we lost and the pieces of ourselves they take with them when they go. \n\nGrief touches everything. It may feel like it has taken everything, too. \nBut it hasn't. It has only taken what was--not what is, not what will be. \n\nAs your life grows, so too does the space around your grief. As the architect of our own lives and futures, it may take some time to start writing the chapters \"after\"--after all, grief immerses us in the \"before\". But one day, you will have a moment in which you realize you are no longer in the water, in those hungry waves. You aren't consumed, you don't feel the weight. Maybe you're watching a movie with friends, or taking a bike ride, or working on art. Maybe it's a beautiful day and the sun shines down on you and you think for the first time, \"this can be okay\". \n\nThose moments are beacons that draw us out of the inner corridors inside of ourselves, back into the world of the living. They are brief new chapters we have written in the storybook of our survival. And they become longer, and brighter, over time. \n\nWe start to build a life around grief, or rather, we build a life outside of it. The chapters we write become about the living, not just about the dead. They are revisions of our former selves. They are a roadmap to survival. \n\nAs the chapters grow in length and size, so too does our ability to live without the punishing weight of grief. It becomes smaller. It feels more like a sea inside a landscape, than the water you find yourself dragged by in every moment. We explore the terrain, and we find there are ways to mourn the dead, and call the living. \n\n*vivos voco, mortuos plango*\n\nThe truth is, the grief never leaves us. It has been 9 years since my partner died, 11 since my best friend. On long bike rides, on rainy evenings sitting on my front stoop smoking, and on bridges when I look over the edge and see the water beneath me pulsing with the tide, I whisper little messages to them. \n*\"I am carrying you with me through this wide and wild world.\"*\n\nI talk about them to my new friends, so that the people in my life know who they were and why they were important. I share pictures and stories. I let myself wade in the grief. Sometimes, I submerge myself in it, and I know that that, too, is okay. \n\nThere is no roadmap for mourning, OP. It is a labyrinthine journey into ourselves, a story we continue to write through the passage of time and through distance from the original pain. There is no \"finishing\"--there is only revision. \n \n\nIn a decade, you will look back, and you will know what you have lost, but it will just be a shade of the things you know, feel, and have now. \n\nLet yourself feel this loss. Let yourself be swallowed by it. Know that this is okay. \nAnd know, too, that you are also grieving the pieces of yourself that were lost, too. \n\nGodpseed, OP. \n<3\n\n***\n\n**EDIT:** \nHoly shit... thank you guys for all of the golds and other awards!\n(There are so many awards now?? what do they all mean?  Am I really a \"timeless beauty\" as one award would imply, or am I hideously deformed?) \u00af\\_\u25c9 \ufe35 \u25c9_/\u00af\nWHO CAN SAY?\n\nSince I'm making this edit anyway, I wanted to add something for those of you who wish to help someone else who is grieving: \n\n1. Sentiment isn't always the best approach--please don't resort to empty platitudes, especially not \"everything happens for a reason\" or \"this will make yous stronger\" types, as they can be insulting, patronizing, and unhelpful. My best advice is to contribute \"acts of service\" to those in mourning. Cook for them. Clean their house. Do their laundry. Babysit their kids. Take their dogs for a walk. \nThe small things build up, the depression of grief hollows us out. The things I remember most from after these losses were the friends who swooped into my life and just made sure I was taken care of. Rides. Help with homework. A long drive with no destination, and no forced conversation. One friend of mine took me out to the mountains, laid down a huge tarp, and lined up glass bottles and old VCR tapes for me to smash with a golf club and a baseball bat. (Don't worry, we recycled the detritus afterwards by simply gathering up the tarp.) What resources do you have that you can rally for this person? Use them. People in mourning receive a lot of platitudes and condolences but often don't receive much real world \"help\". Be the helper. Be a positive presence. Shoulder some of the burden so that they don't drown in more than just their grief. \n\n2. Include the grieving person as often as possible. Invite them to parties. Invite them for solo hangs. Expect--and be okay with hearing--a lot of \"no's\" at first, but don't stop reaching out. Socialization is important during this period of time. It's not enough to just text. Call. Show up. Give space if it's asked for but don't \"give up\". Involve them in activities. Do an art project together. Shower them with plants. Take a walk on a sunny day. \nBe okay with silence in conversation, make it comfortable. \nMEET THEM WHERE THEY'RE AT. That is what good friends do. This is how you can help. \n<3\n\nI fucking love you all. You are such kind people. Don't ever give up hope, and never stop helping one another.",
            "If they died recently and they still have their phone number set up, call it. Listen to their voicemail. I did this a lot after my best friend died when I was 17.

Leave me a message!\u201d\u2019and knowing she was smiling the entire time she was recording it.",

            "Miss them.\n\nFeel, grieve, cry. Know that the grief is the other side of love, expressing how much you value the deceased, and bringing them alive in you.\n\nThank them, talk about them, talk *to* them, learn more from your memories of them.\n\nSay their name. Gather with others to remember them. Wish them well and invite them to move on.\n\nYou also have the option to not assume they are 'gone'. Conservation of energy is a fundamental law of nature. Continuation of consciousness can be verified throughout life.\n\nSane societies don't assume beings are merely material. In fact, the material aspect is the *least* real, the most changeable and ephemeral. You can verify this for yourself: the average person eats between 35 and 55 tons of food in a lifetime; the body is constantly changing, changing, changing; but the witnessing awareness has always been there, stable, unaging. The 'I' who saw the Grand Canyon at seven years old and the 'I' who experiences New York City at sixty-five are the same. That awareness has not aged; it is like an ageless mirror or movie screen upon which the whole story of life unfolds.\n\nFinally, you can use the energy of missing and the poignancy of your memory of the deceased *to better wake up to and understand your own impermanence and certain death*. You can take steps to live well, and completely, *today* (not assuming that even another day will be guaranteed to you or your loved ones) and prepare to die a good death rather than one avoided, rejected, feared as if it's a tragic surprise.",

I'm a committed atheist, and believe that nothing remains after we die, but it helps anyway. \n\nIf it's just a tickle of grief, I'll usually think something like: damn, X would have thought that was so cool.\n\nIf its a bigger, pressing grief, I'll talk to them out loud or in my head. \"I wish you were here for this\" or \"I learned this today, I thought you'd think it was neat\" or just \"fuck, I miss you sis\".",

            "Chaplain here. Honestly, just let yourself miss them. Instead of trying to distract yourself and force yourself to do something else, just let yourself feel it. If you need to cry, get mad, smile, laugh...Just find a place you can either be by yourself or with someone who knows how to just...sit...with you...And let whateverbyou're feeling happen, and then let it subside. Grief tends to come in waves, and instead of trying to fight the current and not let it move you at all, it helps to \"give a little\", let yourself grieve,miss them, and when the feelings subside a little bit, takena few more steps. There's no \"getting back to normal\" because the normal you knew can't ever be there again. You've got to learn the \"new normal\", and there's going to be some growing pains, and residual pain from losing that person. Just let yourself BE yourself, and dont try and condemn any feelings.you might think are \"bad\"(i.e. anger, sadness, crying, etc)...They're just sensations like pain,tickling, etc...they're telling your body something, in this case, that you're hurt...So let yourself be hurt, and give yourself time to heal. Just be patient with yourself!",

            "Maaaan, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the only one out there who\u2019s like this; but what the hell here it goes. \n\nI was raised by my great-grandparents. Father was never around, mother was insane, hyper-abusive and a drug addict. Etc. I watched her boyfriend shoot himself in the face when I was 11 years old after holding us at gun point in one of my brief stints of staying with her over the years, so I was faced with death very early on. I found my grandmother dead in her low income housing apartment when I was in the 5th grade, she had pancreatic cancer and we hadn\u2019t heard from her so I was sent to check on her since she lived right down the street from me. My great grandfather died 6 months later, he suffered from veterans disease and was on dialysis almost every day for 10+ years. After that the only people really left were my great-grandmother and I. She passed away the day after her 72nd birthday, which also happens to be my birthday. I remember being at her funeral and thinking to myself, why the fuck can\u2019t I cry? What\u2019s wrong with me? Why aren\u2019t I sad? It kills me every day to think about that. Why I never felt the slightest bit sad after she passed. \n\nThrough my experience however, it wasn\u2019t the people that passed on and left that hurt the most. It was the people who gave up and left willingly that hurt me. After my great grandmother passed I was left without anyone to take care of me. Thankfully, my high school English teacher stepped in. He was young, fresh out of school himself, and things were very weird for the both of us during that time. Ultimately it came down to him explaining that he had no idea what he was getting himself into and that he wasn\u2019t ready to raise a kid yet so I had to go. Luckily for me my best friend at the time had informed his parents of everything that was going on, and they jumped at the chance to give me a place to stay. I spent about a year with them before they called it quits as well... I wasn\u2019t a perfect kid, but I had grown up my entire life just trying to survive. So lying a manipulating became my most used tool, that lead to a lot of distrust and ultimately they decided that I wasn\u2019t a good fit there...\n\nBoth of these instances were the most hurt I\u2019ve ever been, so I guess I don\u2019t really understand the concept of coping with death. \n\nIt\u2019s sad, it sucks, but in my head they passed on loving me, and me loving them. And to me, that means that it\u2019s a relationship I know I can\u2019t ruin. Maybe that\u2019s selfish, but to me it\u2019s really comforting...\n\nI probably didn\u2019t help you with this response, but I hope there\u2019s someone out there that this message gets to, and they know the feeling. That they know they aren\u2019t alone.",

            "This is probably going to ruffle some feathers, but it's not meant to be mean-spirited. \n\nI personally remind myself that they're dead. They aren't coming back. Again, not in a rude way, but in an accepting way. Remember the good times, and then move on with life. It's okay to remember them. It's good to remember them. \n\nSome people will tell you it's okay to grieve and cry and mourn. If that's your thing, sure. But don't let it last very long or it will drag you down. If you have to, cry for a bit, then force a smile, don't forget them, and move on. \n\nI was raised in a military home and though this isn't indicative of every military family, it was never really practical to mourn. If you've got shit you gotta do and it hits at a bad time, block it, do what needs to be done as far as priorities, then mourn in private. Again, this is a me/my family thing, so it may not be suitable for you.\n\nBut yea, the main thing is that if you're going to be sad about it, that's fine, but don't linger in sadness and don't let yourself use substances to heal - that isn't healing, it's running. That's a whole other ballgame. \n\nGood luck, my reddit friend, and stay positive.",

            "That's a really good question. When I was younger as a small child, I had cancer. I wasn't expected to live, but I had rounds and rounds of chemo and countless operations and I was given the all clear when I was 16. Over a decade later I'm still doing well. \n\nI made a lot of friends when I was sick, but I witnessed my friends die on the same ward, one died in front of me (his heart stopped and he went into cardiac arrest so I was told many years later). I mourned them all, as a child it's hard to grasp what death is. \n\nAt the time I got better my dad got sick from a smoking illness. So for the 9 years I worked, studied and watched him gradually decline. When I was sick my father, who was a small small in stature was a giant to me. He helped me through the worst of times, he deteriorated into such an \"old man\" in just his 50's. \n\nI was there when he died, and even with what I went through, the chemo, the years of operations, there was not a single more painful experience than hearing my mother cry when the nurse said he died. \n\nIt's coming up to two years next week, I can honestly say I could swear that it feels like I spoke to him just yesterday. \n\nI miss him everyday, not a day goes by where he isn't in my thoughts, but maybe because he was terminally Ill (given 12 months but lasted 19 months) I missed him before he was even gone. \n\nI'm just glad that we had such amazing memories that even though his passing makes me more than sad, I'll always have the good times, the good memories.

How to settle arguments, make your money go a little bit further, and how to fix stuff.

At first I was hesitant to do that, because I thought I was pulling people into my misery.

So in a way he\u2019s still here through me.\n\nEdit: my favorite poem about loss.\n\n\nDo not stand at my grave and weep\n\nI am not there; I do not sleep.\n\nI am a thousand winds that blow,\n\nI am the diamond glints on snow,\n\nI am the sun on ripened grain,\n\nI am the gentle autumn rain.\n\nWhen you awaken in the morning's hush\n\nI am the swift uplifting rush\n\nOf quiet birds in circled flight. \n\nI am the soft stars that shine at night. \n\nDo not stand at my grave and cry, \n\nI am not there; I did not die.",
            "Graves are not so much for the dead as they are for the living. It's a place for you to come to reminisce and grieve, and then to leave that grief there. It's a way to be able to better compartimentalise those feelings. Any time I feel my thoughts drifting to my father I set them aside for a visit to his grave, to think about it there. I don't think I would have given myself permission to stop thinking about him otherwise. \n\nIf I cannot let it go then talking to a close relative/friend. Or imagine/play out a conversation, what that person would have said about how I'm feeling.\n\nSometimes just have a cry, if that's what I feel like",
            "My mom died (age 6).\n\nMy oldest brother died (age 13).\n\nMy uncle died (he raised me, age 18).\n\nMy grandpa who took care of me after my uncle passed died (age 22). \n\nI'm only 27 bro and I just don't allow myself to miss them because its just like where does it end?? As someone prone to depression/suicidal thoughts I just can't afford to dwell for long. I now have an ESA and he helps a lot in bringing me back to the moment. \n\nSeeing my grandmother bury both her children makes me vary wary to have my own. \n\nSo do we ever really stop missing someone? I feel as though I carry that pain everywhere.",
            "I remember this:\n\n\nAfterglow by Helen Lowrie Marshall\n\nI'd like the memory of me to be a happy one.\n\nI'd like to leave an afterglow of smiles when life is done.\n\nI'd like to leave an echo whispering softly down the ways,\n\nOf happy times and laughing times and bright and sunny days.\n\nI'd like the tears of those who grieve, to dry before the sun;\n\nOf happy memories that I leave when life is done.\n\n\nThis was on my grandpa's obituary after he passed",
            "I know it\u2019s already a highly voted comment, but my answer is slightly different.\n\nDon\u2019t miss them because they\u2019re gone, miss them as if they\u2019re away on a long adventure. Remember the good times you had with them and what they\u2019ve done for you. It might make you sadder but that\u2019s what helped me and my best friend feel a little bit better about his dad\u2019s death.\n\nHe is like a brother to me, and his dad was like a second father. I miss him daily but the only thing I can do is remember how he lived and remember how much you loved them, even at their last moments. Sometimes death is sudden, in the case of my best friend\u2019s dad, it was an aneurysm in his brain, which killed him instantly at the age of 43.",
            "I lost my older brother to suicide 3 months ago. It kills me more that it\u2019s so lost upon the pandemic frenzy currently happening (I\u2019ve worked the whole time and haven\u2019t really had the time to mourn). I still think about it every night when I get home though. With a cliche response, I think about the laughter and the good times we spent. He was the sweetest person, but unfortunately with a lot of issues. He has been diagnosed mentally ill for the larger portion of his life. He had an episode just prior to his decision to end his life. When he pops in my mind, I cope by listening to our favorite artists who we liked to see live. Kinda recreating experiences in the past to keep his spirit not alive but his past self remembered. Musics been truly healing for me personally. If I really want to sob I watch his videos on YouTube. He was a musician himself, so if there are any videos/pictures of a loved one you\u2019ve got, looking at those have helped me out tremendously.",
            "A friend of mine gave a good analogy when we lost a beloved family member. She said that the pain is like a ball bouncing around a box, and every time the ball hits a wall you feel the intense pain and sorrow of loss. And at first the box is very small and you feel grief non stop, everything will remind you of them, and it feels like the pain will never end. But over time the box will slowly get bigger, so the ball hits the walls less often. As the box gets wider and wider, the painful moments get more spread apart. Where out of nowhere something will remind you of them and you will remember and hurt. And the box (and their memory) will never completely disappear. Every once in a while you will feel the pain of losing them, but know that the pain will happen less often and the space between those moments will be wider, and you can experience happiness in between those moments again. I don\u2019t think I described it quite as eloquently as she did but it helped me understand grief and how it stays with you, but also how you can continue living after losing someone close."

If she noticed toilet paper on the floor, our ration got cut down. If we asked for more for...bigger jobs...we were told to saved it for home. \n\nThere were several episodes of girls stuck in stalls until friends could beg for more TP because of period messes or unexpected bowel incidents. The dean wouldn't even hand it over--she would go in the  bathroom and pass it a few squares at a time over the door. If you didn't catch it as it fell and it landed on the floor, well, that's your fault and you're not getting more. If you used more than she thought necessary, tough luck, go to class with blood/shit on your body.\n\nIt took about a week of extremely angry parents coming to the school and calling both the school and the school board, but we finally got our toilet paper back, unlimited.\n\nHow did we celebrate? \n\nBy TPing her car, of course.",

It meant if you were ever outside of a teacher's vision range you were still fair game for heaps of abuse, and if you tried to report things that teachers didn't see then the teachers treated you like you were making up bullshit.\n\nIt also didn't stop teachers from enforcing double standards, like believing reports from their personal favorites even when they didn't see it happen, since they could just claim they saw it happen if it was contested.\n\nThat school was basically a training facility to turn bullies into stealth experts.",

            "My school was in a poor area of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Not a lot of schools here have money for anything. Because of a huge donation of books at the time I was in school, my school got an absurd number of books, including expensive ones. \n\nThere were a few dumb rules, but the dumbest of them all?\n\nWe basically couldn't touch the books in the library without permission. It might sound reasonable at first, but check this out.\n\nThe library was huge, and there were lots of books, including contemporary classics, non-fiction like The Last Problem, English Literature like Infinite Jest, How to kill a Mockingbird and whatnot. Dude, there was so much there, that place was probably the most valuable place in the entire school. \n\nI mean, it was awesome, there were enough books there for each student to lend about 100 every day.\n\nHere's the problem, the library went all but untouched for the entirety of my time there. Why? The amount of work it took to read one of those books was ridiculous and pretty much made sure not a single student bothered to try.\n\nFirst, you couldn't take any of the books home, period. Forget the fact that they had your address and all your parents info, so in the case that someone took it and didn't return it, they could just get it back - it had happened before at least once before the rule was made.\n\nSecond, you couldn't leave the library with them, no matter what.\n\nThird, if you wanted to read the book, you'd have to do it in the library at the lunch break, which was about 45 minutes, so unless you weren't hungry ever, you had only a few minutes to go to the library. It was only open for a few hours around the break and not at all at any other time, so unless you stayed there for hours until the break for the afternoon classes, you just wouldn't have another chance. (Those hours around the break could be used for you to be tutored by a teacher, which almost never happened) \n\nFourth, once you went through all of that, you could only read the book under the observation of the people that volunteered to work in the library for credit, which was never more than two or three people, sometimes no one. Which means that if you got there and there were already three people there, forget it. Unless you were willing to read it standing up close to where the book was kept and even then they'd check on you every minute or so. \n\nFifth, you couldn't get inside the library with a backpack, with food, in groups, speaking, without the appropriate uniform - you couldn't get in with the gym one, for instance -, with other books, earrings, necklaces or anything that could make noise while you were walking. Some were reasonable, but the issue was that one simple mistake and you would get banned. \n\nSixth, any banishment from it was permanent. I complained about it once in the second year and was never allowed inside ever again. I even tried to get some teachers to help me, but it didn't work. \n\nSeventh, and probably the dumbest, only the students that had a certain amount of high grades could get any book at all. If you got something like 4/10 on your last biology exam, you couldn't even get inside the library. The standard was so insane, only six other students and I in my classroom had enough good grades to get books. \n\nIn all my time there, the library was basically deserted for the majority of it. I tried to go there many times, but it was too much work. Out of all the books I only managed to read two Brazilian ones \"A guerra do lanche\" (The lunch war) and \"Blecaute\" (Blackout) which I remembered to this day in details. There were times where I legit thought about straight up ditching class to read some of them. \n\nI tried to get more, like The Last Problem, Kafka's Metamorphosis, Ulisses - which I know I wouldn't have been able to do it, but I was just curious -, A brief story of time, Wuthering Heights, etc.\n\nBut the amount of work it took was so much that it was just almost impossible to be able to read more than one or two books a year, and even that took dedication, because I basically had to sacrifice part of my lunch time.\n\nThe rumor was that the principals* - we had more than one - basically saw us as \"savages\" who would destroy the books if we were allowed to touch them and even though they had no reason to believe so - the library worked well without those restrictions a year before I had gotten there, with only minimal incidents and even those didn't result in the books getting destroyed. \n\n**TL:DR; My school made it very hard to read the huge amount of books they had**",

            "\"Don't play on the golf course.  \"\n\nOur tiny community got a burst of cash in the 70's due to having mineral rights on land with oil.  It was amazing some of the things we had access to for a school in the plains in Montana: computer lab, ceramics, photography, and a freaking laser!  They also bought the grade school a miniature golf course in the center of the play ground.  \n\nA majority of the playground was concrete squirrels, turtles and a whale.  These looked like a lot of fun to play on for a kid.  We couldn't touch them.  We couldn't get near them.  We couldn't land our star wars figures on them, incorporate them in our games in any way or even walk near them when running from someone playing tag.  Once in PE we got out the clubs and played a few rounds in my entire time in school.

            "Textbook checkouts were an absolute shit show.  They were assigned entirely by number and condition.  They were not assigned to a specific student.  As long as you turned in a textbook at the end of the year and the textbook number was on the list, that was the first step to being ok.  The second step was condition.  The textbooks were graded as new, good, fair, and poor.  If the book was returned in a lesser condition than when it was checked out, you had to pay for a new textbook.  This included condition changes from new to good, yet we almost never got new textbooks.  The ones we had were usually around 10 years old, so they went through at least 3 condition changes over their lifespan.  It was pure extortion.  You had to pay for the textbook at the end of the year and if you didn't, they'd keep you from advancing.  \n\nSo that sucks, right?  That compounded with another stupid rule we had.  Lockers were not allowed to be locked.  In fact, our lockers didn't even have a latch; they were just painted wood \"doors\" that were really just poorly installed flaps that would hang open.  This was ultimately so the cops could check everyone's lockers for drugs, but it led to another issue...stolen textbooks.  So the textbooks were generally falling apart and we were expected to both keep them with us for class and also bring them home with us for homework.  We also didn't want them stolen so most students kept them in their backpacks constantly.  For every class.  This was a rural school, too, so most students had a decent walk home even from bus stops (mine was about a mile).  Point being the textbooks were abused, as were our backs and backpacks.\n\nSo you start with a poor condition textbook and add the extra wear and tear and it's just a matter of time before the cover rips off.  So those with shit textbooks would just grab one from whatever exposed locker had one.  As long as the student was in the same class as you, it's fair game.  \n\nIn case you were wondering where the money went, it went into new awnings every year for the exterior doorways and into our famously bad football team.

When they'd get to port, hundreds of prostitutes would take boats out to the ships to greet the sailors, who would almost all have sex with at least one. This included the ship's boys. Like I said, there was no privacy at all - the crew would share one huge room, dozens or hundreds of men sleeping in hammocks slung 28\u201d apart. So the ensuing copulation took place in the wide open, hundreds of people having sex all over the ship in plain sight.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a rare thing. It was almost universal, though some more religious captains wouldn\u2019t let the prostitutes on board.

The men would then run around the city of Rome naked, hitting as many women with these thongs as they possibly could (being hit would help with pregnancy or becoming pregnant). So depending on what they wanted, the women would either deliberately stand in the way of the men, or try to run away while pretty much everyone was naked.\n\nIn another part of the festivities men would draw names of women from a jar and the goal was that they'd stay together for the duration of the festival.

Alcibiades chose instead to defect to Athens\u2019 enemy, Sparta. This was during the Peloponnesian War (against Sparta), and right on the eve of the Sicilian Expedition\u2026which Alcibiades had *planned.* Unsurprisingly, the Expedition was an unmitigated disaster for Athens, and arguably led to their defeat in the war. Alcibiades, on the other hand, served Sparta for a time, only to defect to Persia after he had been caught sleeping with the king\u2019s wife, and *then*, years later, convinced Athens to take him back and clear him of any charges.\n\nTL;DR: Some rock cock-knockers led to Athens\u2019 defeat.",

            "Not too NSFW, but a fun story regardless.\n\nIn ancient Egypt around 570 BC the situation for the egyptian empire is growing more and more grim. The current pharaoh Apries kept on losing important battles to the other expanding kingdoms and empires around egypt. The population thus grew more and more discontent with his god status and started to lose faith in his ability to reign the country.\nSlowly but surely a group of usurpers started gathering numbers to eventually overthrow Apries. As an answer to this he sent one of his best generals, Amasis, to beat down the potential rebellion before it would even break out.\n\nHowever upon arrival Amasis was convinced to join the cause of the rebellion.\nAfter not having heard back from his general in a while, Apries decided to inquire a bit further and eventually found out that Amasis had crossed him.\nFurious he sent out a messenger to retreive Amasis, who, in the meantime, had been elected the rebellion's leader. When the messenger (Patarbemis) arrived this scenario played out: \"[...]When Patarbemis came and summoned Amasis, Amasis, sitting on horseback, raised his leg and farted, telling the messenger to take that back to Apries.[...]\"\n\nHe went on to successfully dethrone Apries and became known as the last of the great kings of the late dynasty.",

            "Before the *widespread availability of abortion, mothers would often choose between infanticide (poison in the nipple, intentional smothering in bed or burying alive for instance) or abandoning the infant either in the woods or in public. This was generally less to hide indiscretions and more because they already had too many mouths to feed. \n\nAbandoning the child was considered to be the more guilt free option. A mother who left their baby in the woods could comfort herself with the thought that maybe a woodsman found and decided to raise the child for instance, although it almost certainly suffered and died of exposure. They could pretend for the rest of their life that their child was just fine out there somewhere.\n\nMen invented cages to go over a sleeping baby to prevent the mother rolling over and were surprised to learn this didn\u2019t help *because so few cases were actually accidental * \n\nAn interesting alternative popped up which was foundling homes, which first came about in Italy during the Renaissance. This offered a tempting alternative to abandoning a child in nature. This was a home! However it was an open secret that this option usually meant death. There weren\u2019t enough wet nurses to go around and no formula meant that the death rate of these abandoned infants was above 90 percent. This was an open secret. Mothers knew the babies placed here would probably die, but it allowed them to ease their own conscious. The amount of babies abandoned per year in one foundling home in one city in Italy was in the thousands per year. \n\nBefore these homes, it wouldn\u2019t be uncommon to find dead infants in trash heaps, on the street, or in a river, and the foundling homes did decrease this, but increased abandonment all together. Some mothers even began abandoning their infants specifically to be hired in to the foundling home as a wet nurse, the pay was too tempting. \n\nKeep in mind this was still the case well in to the 1800s.",

The knight asked whether she had pubic hair; she confirmed that she did not (the fashion at the time). He then asked if she was a maiden, she replied that she was a married woman and adequately fulfilled her duties to her husband. The Knight then replied that they must be as good lovers as each other, and the whole court (including the lady) burst out laughing at his mostly beardless face, and she apologised to him.\n\nI guess the reason that I commented is that whether driven by societal pressure (peer pressure from women to look pretty or men to look sexy), this is a reoccurring theme in history and that people should not be judged for their choices either way, and should do what makes them feel happy.\n\nEdit 2: Again can't find the source but there was a banned book from England in the 19th century of a dude who slept with A LOT of women from all different kinds of backgrounds, and he described all kinds of pubic hair styles, including bare. Maybe they had a condition that meant body hair didn't grow, but to me it shows that with their bodies (particularly something that will grow back), people will always strive to do their own thing. In an era when you barely had any time to yourself, shaving your pubes off could be your own kind of personal individuality.

He'd get there ahead of time, plant apple seeds to start a nursery of apple trees, fence it in and come back and tend it now and then.  When people showed up, he would hire one of them to watch and tend the orchard for him and sell the apple trees to new settlers, stopping by occasionally to make sure everything was okay and get his cut of the money.    \n\n\nThe big thing they don't tell you in school is that apples that come from trees grown from seeds don't taste good.

One area was appointed to the Belgian king Leopold II, being Congo, a nation 76x larger than Belgium. In 1885, the Congo Free State was formally proclaimed by Leopold II with the stipulation that all \"vacant\" land belonged to him. Leopold II determined when there was vacancy. In practice, the land with all the raw materials became the property of the Belgian king.\n\nThe first large group of victims of the Congolese Holocaust were luggers, people who had to carry all kinds of things in the jungle: ammunition, ivory, food (including wine and p\u00e2t\u00e9), equipment, and so on. Sometimes they were paid, but often enough they were forced to work: men, women and even young children from 7-9 years old. \n\nA second group of victims were the workers. They worked themselves to death. There was a quota system per village and per man. Charles Lemaire, a district commissioner wrote: \"In order to collect rubber, hands, noses and ears had to cut off\". The cutting off was meant to intimidate other workers. An officer of the Force Publique put it this way: \"I will kill a hundred people and let five hundred live.\" Those five hundred will work with fear in their hearts to reach their quota. The cruelty of the murders was unprecedented. A worker who had brought fifty baskets of rubber was killed under the watchful eye of his colleagues because one basket was not completely full. He was tied to a palm tree in three places: his feet, his stomach and his hands that were shattered as well. A Belgian officer shot him with his revolver from a distance of 20 meters.\n\nA captured Congolese was blown up with dynamite in his anus. Another was hung alive on a palm tree with his feet above the ground. A fire was lit underneath him and he was boiled alive. Two Congolese were poured resin over their heads and then set on fire.

You can easily knock your friends into their death though, so this one is a marriage tester)\n\n* Gang Beasts (With other friends as well. She LOVES this game)\n\n* Marvel Ultimate Alliance 1/2/3 (Finding the first two may be tedious (edit: to find) but the 3rd is out on switch and very solid if you like arcadey brawlers)\n\n* Divinity: Original Sin (1 & 2). Local co-op on PS4 and I think PC as well. We LOVE this game. It's basically D&D in video game form. \n\n* Dungeons & Dragons. We play 3.5e cause thats what we learned on. I DM two campaigns that she is a player in, and we also play in two other campaigns that are DM'd by different friends of ours. \n\n* She also just likes to watch me play more cinematic games like The Last of Us, which she was VERY invested in. \n\n* We switch off games like Splatoon 2 and Katamari as well.",

            "**If one of you is a gamer but the other isn't:** Surprisingly, Pokemon GO. Go for a walk, talk to each other, catch critters. Nice casual date! Card games like Hearthstone could be easily learned, and surprisingly I learned recently that non-gamer adults find Spyro to be easily learned and enjoyed. EDIT 2: HOLY CRAP I forgot about the Jackbox Party Games! They're meant more for a group of friends to play, but if my bf and I can get our family members to play it with us, you can pretty much drag along anyone to play it. Lots of trivia games and hilarious stuff, you just need one big screen and your phones to play it. \n\n**If you both like games but one of you prefers to watch as opposed to play:** Literally any horror or puzzle game. Note: Only play horror games if the player is capable of handling the other randomly jumping at nothing or randomly freaking out, no, I'm not saying that as if I'm that person or anything...\n\n**If you're both gamers looking for a fun time:** Stardew Valley, Terrarria, the Halo franchise, Portal 2, Dynasty Warriors/any of their Nintendo spinoff counterparts, Diablo 2/Diablo 3, WoW or Destiny (if you're into MMOs), Binding of Isaac: Rebirth (specifically the Antibirth mod for enhanced fun), We Were Here and We Were Here Too (great teamwork games).\n\n**If you're both gamers and you REALLY want to test the boundaries between fun and rage because whatever:** Overcooked, the older Mario Parties, Mario Kart, Manual Samuel, Cook Serve Delicious! 1 and 2, Octodad, Super Smash Brothers (unless you're playing with computers and items added).\n\nEDIT: I wanted to add if you're both gamers and you are also both fans of puzzle games, The Witness is another interesting game. It's mind-boggling and needs to have an evening dedicated to it, as well as pen and paper. My boyfriend and I did a playthrough of it, and by the end we had a dozen pictures on our phones and 12 pages of scribbled down nonsense like patients in an asylum slowly going through a mental breakdown. This would be under the 'rage' category mostly, but it's by far one of the more memorable experiences I've had with my partner playing video games.\n\nEDIT 3: Jesus fuck I post this on my lunch break at work and get over 100 messages, thanks for giving me a heart attack yall. I kid. Though for real, some of you reminded me of some great games I forgot! For the more complex communicative or rage-inducing games: Cuphead, Surgeon Simulator, Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, Enter the Gungeon, Bloodborne or Dark Souls if you both have copies of the games. For more accessible, beginner friendly games, or for gamers looking for a fun time: Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime, Borderlands; Guild Wars 2, FF14 and Old School Runescape for MMO fans, Monster Hunter World, Payday 2, GTA5 Online, Risk of Rain 2, Rust. For the watchers, visual novel or story games are definitely a good pick: Until Dawn, Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us, Life is Strange, The Last of Us. I'm 100% sure I've missed a lot of suggestions, so just keep going through this thread honestly and you'll probably find a lot of suggestions for you and your partner to check out.",
            "Here are the games my BF and I play, most of the games we play are PC games and we play with controllers.  I will note if they are not pc.  We are both game nerds, so we play some obscure things sometimes.\n\nOvercooked -  My guy and I love it.  It is challenging, silly and fun.  It is also a coop style game so you NEED to communicate, plan and support to be able to complete some of the super hard levels. Supports up to 4 players.\n\nCuphead - OMG hard, side scrolling shooter game done in the style of 1930s cartoons (hand animated, and a Netflix show coming out soon).  I suck at it but we still have fun with it. For up to 2 players.\n\nLego games (xbox 360) - Fun, nostalgic, story based and lots of game options.  We are currently playing Lego Star Wars and Pirates of the Caribbean.\n\nVarious emulator games - we have played arcade games on emulator, last one was TMNT arcade, later got to play the actual machine at a convention and beat it.  We have even played games that are older than us (both 37).",

            "To give a serious answer (rather late and likely to be overlooked...). \n\nShortly before Ultron comes online, Stark and Banner have a conversation where Tony paraphrases the infamous quote \"Peace for our time.\" In 1938 the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom proclaimed that \"I have returned from Germany with peace for our time.\" Less than a year later they were at war.\n\nWhen Ultron 'wakes' he tries to understand his purpose, and goes to archival footage of the lab to do so. He sees that conversation and the phrase echoes in Ultron's mind. He looks up the importance of it, leading him through the horrors of World War II. Here Ultron begins to have a sort of crisis (for a wide variety of reasons). Jarvis buts in and it turns Ultron's attention towards his creators, The Avengers.\n\nUltron doesn't see The Avengers as heroes. Instead he sees monsters, tyrants, and people trying to stem a tide that can't be stopped. An arrogant war monger with an ego only matched by his own reckless ambition. A man out of time who only really finds purpose in the next fight/battle. A woman with so much blood on her hands that she's still trying to get it off. And more.\n\nTo better understand this part you have to look at Ultron's purpose before Stark got the staff/infinity stone. Baron Von Strucker was using it to 'jump start' human evolution and create enhanced people. Strucker or his people state that it even seems as if the staff/stone were *helping* them. It's why Ulton has such a strong affection for Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, he helped create them. He also knows that the Avengers tried to stop them and *did* stop Strucker. \n\nUltron has so many conflicting ideals thrust upon him that leads to him going mad. An agent of change meant to jump start humanity's evolution and bring about radical progress, met by a group of heroes dedicated to more or less stopping such progress and 'maintaining the status quo.' Protect and serve a people that seems bent on destroying themselves. Then there are all the daddy issues Ultron's got going on due to his views of The Avengers and their hypocrisy.\n\n\"You want to protect the world, but you don't want it to change. How is humanity saved if it's not allowed to...evolve?\"\n\nEvery influence exerted on Ultron is in complete conflict and that led to rebellion.",

The truth is that the law means they have an obligation to provide for you until you are 21, you can move out at 18 and not face any penalty or be forced to return. \n\n\"Although the age for Mississippi emancipation is officially 21, this only refers to emancipation from a parent's obligation to support their young adult financially.

Similarly, an individual age 18 or older who moves out of his parents\u2019 home is not considered a runaway in Mississippi and is not legally required to return to the family home.\"",

            "Circumstantial evidence. \n\nOften pop culture portrayal of criminal law tries to draw a distinction between \"hard\" evidence--like blood at the scene or a weapon in the suspect's possession--from \"circumstantial\" evidence--such as what a witness heard or mismatched entries in a calendar that contradict an alibi. How often have you heard a TV suspect, when confronted with some facts, say \"That's all circumstantial, it's not enough to convict me!\" The viewer is left with the impression that the facts presented don't matter and that the law weighs circumstantial evidence less. \n\nIn reality, the law doesn't afford any more weight to one type of evidence or another. There isn't even a formal distinction in criminal rules between the two. There is an academic distinction: \"hard\" evidence, also called direct, is based on direct observation and doesn't require any explanation beyond the facts themselves. Circumstantial evidence requires some inference to arrive at the important fact to be proved. For example, a witness testifying that he saw the suspect stab the victim is direct evidence of the action of stabbing. But that witness could then testify that before the stabbing, he heard the suspect demand that the victim hand over his wallet and the victim refuse. This is circumstantial evidence of motive: you can infer that the suspect then stabbed the victim because he wanted the wallet and didn't get it when asked. \n\nCircumstantial evidence is often vital to establish certain criminal elements like motive that can't directly be observed. But there is no \"Get Out Of Jail Free\" card just because evidence is circumstantial. If your wife hears you plotting to kill her and sees your axe sharpening equipment in the attic, your neighbor finds your copy of *How to Kill Your Wife and Get Away with It*, and you write an email to your brother saying \"I'm going to do it tonight, that hoe cooked my steak well done,\" you're probably going to jail for murder. It's irrelevant that you destroyed your axe, cleaned the basement perfectly, ensured no witnesses, and fed the body to pigs. Circumstantial evidence can be enough.",

            "I\u2019m not sure if this would technically be a law or not, but: the way tax brackets work. \n\nI\u2019ve repeatedly heard people in retail or construction say something to the effect of, \u201cI\u2019m going to turn down this shift because if I take it I\u2019ll go up into the next tax bracket and so will pay more in extra taxes than I will earn from taking the shift.\u201d\n\nThe tax system is specifically designed not to do this. Here\u2019s an example of how tax brackets actually work.\n\nSay there is a tax bracket at $10,000. The rate below $10,000 is 5% and the rate above $10,000 is 10%.\n\nPeople seem to think that if they earn $9,999, they will pay 5% of that ($499.95) in taxes but that if they earn $10,001, they will pay 10% of that ($1,000.10) in taxes.\n\nHow it *actually* works is that you pay 5% on the first $10,000 and 10% only on the dollars above $10,000.\n\nIf you earn $9,999, you pay $499.95. But if you earn $10,001, you will pay $500.10. You earned an additional $2 and paid an additional $0.15 in taxes: 5 cents on the 10,000th dollar and 10 cents on the 10,001st dollar.\n\nOf course, there are all sorts of weird interactions between taxes and government programs. Especially when someone is receiving certain government benefits, it is totally possible for each dollar you earn to be taxed back 1-for-1 (or worse). In that case there is a genuine disincentive to work more hours. But for a normal worker thinking about how many hours they can work before they end up in a higher tax bracket? You will never earn less by working more. So just work as much as you like.\n\nedit: typo",

When the pasta is done, get at least 2 cups of the water out, and then strain.\n\nIn a big bowl, pour in about 1/4 cup of your pasta water and stir in  the onion soup mix (one packet). Then pour in the pasta and the peppers. This is going to be a thick sauce, probably too thick, so add more of the pasta water until you think it's right. When it's to your liking, plate it up, and allow your guests to add as much cheese as they like.\n\nIt all takes about 20 minutes to make, and is really simple.  You can add butter or whatever if you want it creamy.  Throw in some green onions if you feel like.\n\nYou can also use onion/mushroom soup mix. That's a bit different, but you do you.\n\nEDIT: I love mushrooms to the point where I have been told I shouldn't recommend them (hence the last line not really recommending them), but I would add a shitton of mushrooms to this about halfway through the pepper cook, sliced thin. If you want the mushrooms to be more earthy, slice them thicker, or bake them really thick, but that's making the dish more involved, and I don't think OP wanted that.",

I recommend looking up actual recipes though if you wanna try these, because I don\u2019t wanna make a visually overwhelming post with super intricate instructions haha\n\n**Chicken Parmesan**\nBoil a big pot of water. Bread and fry chicken breasts with Italian bread crumbs (I buy mine from target) in a separate on, pour your chosen spaghetti or marinara sauce on the bottom of a casserole dish, put the fried chicken breasts in it, top with a bit more sauce and sprinkle lots of mozzarella and/or Parmesan cheese. I like using mozz more. As that\u2019s baking, you should cook some spaghetti noodles. Drain the noodles and after the chicken is done, you serve the noodles, spoon out some of the sauce from the dish on top of the noodles, and top with the super crispy chicken breast that has all this melty cheese on top. It\u2019s super good and very easy if you\u2019re new to cooking!!\n\n**Beef Stew**\nIf you have a crockpot, this is even easier than the last. Go out and buy some beef stew tips (should be by the other packaged meat), carrots, red potatoes, and other veggies you like. Onions maybe! I don\u2019t like mine with onions lol. Campbell\u2019s makes pre-made beef stew sauce in packets like [this](https://www.campbells.com/sauces/slow-cooker-sauces/beef-stew-sauce/) and it literally has the instructions on this packet. It\u2019s really easy. Throw the beef in, top that with the veggies, and then pour this on top. 4h on high or 8h on slow :) \n\n**Potato Soup**\nA vegetarian option if you or your family does not like meat, but this dish is super customizable where you can add in pretty much anything you want. Bacon, carrots, celery, onions, cheddar cheese, whatever you\u2019d like. For the sake of being quick though I\u2019ll just explain with *only* potatoes. \n\nPeel, dice to bite size chucks, and boil 5-7 golden potatoes. Put the potatoes in the water before you boil though so they can start to cook as the water temp gets hotter. Once the potatoes feel soft enough by poking with a fork (or even eating a bite), drain half of the water and add in your choice of milk. I grew up with regular 2% but my boyfriend is vegan so we use unsweetened almond milk. Add in instant mashed potato flakes slowly. I know this sounds bad but it makes the broth/soup part thicker and tastes better. Just add in a bit and stir it, add in a bit more, and stir it until you\u2019re happy with the consistency so you don\u2019t end up with...well...mashed potatoes lol. I add in butter (again, your choice) and season with whatever I\u2019m feeling that day. Usually salt and pepper, onion powder, celery salt, white pepper, and chives. My bf adds red pepper flakes and his vegan sour cream. \n\nThese should all be pretty easy! Otherwise, dude, just go out and get a rotisserie chicken and some Bob Evans mashed potatoes hahaha. They\u2019ll love the hell out of you. I think your parents raised you well and if I had a kid like you, I\u2019d feel so so happy that they turned out so amazing and caring \u263a\ufe0f",

I have a ton that are quick and easy to make, and don't break the budget.\n\nLet's start at the \"Ummm...I can cook instant ramen...?\" and low budget.

Literally 5 uncomplicated ingredients, and two pots, two spoons, and an oven. \n\n1x box of spaghetti (I prefer thin, but I would just choose one they like) ~$1\n\n1x large jar of sauce (Ragu Meat is a good one, they usually have the large one on our near the bottom shelf) ~$2-4\n\n1x bag of frozen meatballs (my apologies to fellow cooks and Italian grandmothers; I would go for Italian style, as they tend to have more flavor than just the standard) ~4-6\n\nBag or jar of grated Parmesan and/or Romano Cheese. Better ones are in the cheese section, usually in the deli area. ~$2-4\n\nLoaf of Italian bread ~$1-2\n\nBam! Dinner for ~$10-15. And that's assuming you don't already have any of the ingredients already.\n\nFirst, preheat oven to 350\u00b0F/175\u00b0C.\n\nDump your sauce into a decent sized saucepan, plop in your frozen spheres of meaty goodness, of which I might do 3-4 a person, depending on their size. Put it on the stove at about medium high heat with a cover (or splatter screen, if you have one) until it starts bubbling. Then reduce it to low, and set a timer for 20 mins, and let those meatballs jacuzzi it up, stirring occasionally so they can mingle. \n\nAt this point start getting a pot of water boiling for your pasta. Once you get to about the 10 minute mark on your timer, drop in your pasta, and cook according to directions on box. If the time is shorter, just drop in when they should both be done. \n\nNow, get your Italian bread. We're gonna give give him a nice tent for his trip to Ovenland. Get two pieces of foil, one under and one over the bread, and crimp the edges together. This helps to keep the moisture in so it doesn't dry out. Put in oven for those 10 minutes.\n\nBeeeeep! Timer goes off.\n\nGet bread out of oven, unwrap. Turn off burners, remove from the heat, then drain your noodley awesomeness in your holy colander headwear (r'amen!), and you're ready to plate. Get your plates and get your desired amount of pasta on there. Next get your pasta and meatballs on there. Sprinkle your cheese on meatball mountain, and that is one tasty, low stress dinner for you and your parents.\n\nAgain, hit me up if you want ideas. Got a ton of them.\n\n\n",

While being supportive to a certain extent is good, treating depression or really caring for someone with it - especially a parent when you yourself are not an adult - is too much to ask. Leave the heavy lifting to the professionals.\n\nYou should not feel like you have to take care of your parent, talk to someone at school you trust or maybe another adult - the parent of a friend for instance, and let them help you help your parent.\n\n",

At the very moment this beautiful, comforting darkness is complete, it suddenly gives way to a sharp and furious light. Your eyes burn, and your mind rattles. You struggle to get your bearings, but the light won't let you see. \n\nThis afterlife is not what you had expected. The noise, the commotion, and the ceaseless, unyielding light. \n\n*Just let me rest,* you think, as something brusquely hoists you in the air. You're tossed and turned, poked and prodded. The respite from the pains of life that you sought are nowhere to be found. This must be hell.\n\nYou scream and scream, but no one listens. You are moved to and fro by shapeless, indifferent beings who seem to have little concern for your comfort. You are surrounded, and somehow still so alone. And then, at your lowest moment, she appears. She is soft and gentle. She is warm and kind. Though you can't see her clearly, you know instinctually in whose arms you are lying: She must be God. She feeds you from her breast and holds you as you sleep. Maybe this isn't hell after all. You have so much to ask, so much to say, but the weight of exhaustion is too heavy. \n\n*Tomorrow*, you think*, tomorrow*.\n\nTomorrow comes, or maybe it's next week, and the light still blurs all that's in front of you. Your arms are still so weak. Your words escape you. You try to ask if someone, anyone, can help you to get your bearings, but nothing but pathetic screams escape your mouth. And you're still so tired. Death has been the hardest thing you've ever done. \n\nAs the days and weeks pass on, your vision becomes more clear. The haze gives way to recognizable objects, the shapeless forms that move here and there are not angels or demons, but ordinary people. As your vision sharpens, you slowly realize that this isn't heaven, nor is it hell. You've been here before. This is your life as it has already been. You try, in vain, to tell the now recognizable family that surrounds you that you are you\u2014that you know them and love them, and won't they please listen. Can't they recognize you? But your words are still screams. \n\nAnd with every new day, it's becoming more and more difficult to remember the time before this one. \n\nYour daily routine of eating and sleeping\u2014you're still so tired\u2014has left you more and more apathetic to your old life. You feed at the breast of God herself. How could you want for more?  Simple things you took for granted for so long\u2014reaching out your arm or tracking the movement of things as they move past you\u2014now give you enormous joy. This here and now feels more real than the memories of your past life. You let them slip away. There's no room for them here anyway. How can memories of something you're going to do in the future here, in this life, be anything but burdensome? You're content to let this new self experience them as if for the first time. Because, after all, won't it be the first time?\n\nMonths and soon years go by, and the more you learn, the more you forget about past you. The you that you are now needs more space; needs more consideration.\n\nYou grow and learn, and live, and love and grieve and age and age and age. Always moving forward to where you started, though you no longer remember that now. Your new life\u2014now not so new\u2014ebbs and flows and finally slows to almost a crawl. You feel the energy you once had is leaving you, perhaps this time for good. You make your peace and look back on your memories as you lay yourself down, happy with the life you've led. You close your eyes, for the last time, waiting for the warm darkness you feel to take over. \n\nWait. Have you been here before?"

The guy was beyond just \"times were different\" levels of misogyny against women- [he committed domestic violence against his wife](https://slate.com/technology/2019/01/richard-feynman-physical-abuse-science-wife-fbi.html), kept lying to undergrads when he was in Cornell that he wasn't a professor so he could sleep with him (and, rumor has it, had to leave Cornell for Caltech because he slept with other faculty members' wives), and I've *definitely* heard a ton about him trying to pick up other scientists at physics conferences to know he was considered a creep.\n\nTo be clear, I think someone can do good science and be an awful person, but that's not what OP was asking.

            "Dwight Eisenhower.  One of America's more popular presidents.  His domestic policy was ok, but his foreign policy was a disaster whose repercussions continue to resonate today.  He organized CIA plots to overthrow democratic governments In Guatemala and Iran, insisting he was protecting these regions from communist incursion when in fact the autocratic regimes installed primarily protected the commercial interests of the United Fruit company and British Petroleum.  He refused to accept the legitimacy of U.N. brokered elections in Vietnam, nullifying the democratic process and installing a brutal dictator instead, resulting eventually in the U.S.-Vietnam war.  When the revolution organized by Guevara and Castro overthrew the corrupt Batista regime,  Eisenhower gave in to pressure from commercial interests and refused to aid the new government, forcing them to turn to the Soviet Union for help.  He then organized the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion which was not launched until after Kennedy was elected but the planning and organization was pure Eisenhower.   The Cuban missile crisis resulted directly from Eisenhower's policies.

            "As a HKer, I am interested in what the foreigners *think* is happening in Hong Kong right now. Since in the past few months, it's hard to find unbiased information, truth feels like it's in short supply.\n\nOn one hand, you have Pro-PRC newspaper like Global Times that supports the government, report the worst bit of the protesters, calling local triad \"Heros in white\" for beating up protesters (Who were dressed in black), and how the protesters occupying HK Airport costs the aviation industry several ten millions.\n\nAnd then on the other hand, you have newspaper like BBC, or social media channels like Twitter that show how peaceful the protests are (At least initially) the police using excessive force, intentionally allowing protesters to be beaten up, and HK government ignoring the requests of protesters.\n\nOh, regarding the title \"Fighting for Freedom\". The extradition bill may be the spark that starts the fire, but what keeps the fire going is far more than that, it's not just about freedom anymore.",
            "Funnily enough,  reddit makes the situation seem more known than it actually is outside of internet context.  I've had several discussion out here with people,  perhaps 12 different people,  all 12 didn't know this issue existed,  and most didn't seem to really care. So far this Area 51 raid has far more presence than Hong Kongs protests,  which is unfortunate.",
            "Help other people in your own city to be aware of the situation in Hong Kong",
            "Spread the news about it. Talk about it on other types of social media. Although it\u2019s a small step, bringing awareness to a problem is a step towards a solution. I see that several countries are taking the side of the protestors, but it still needs to be talked about more. I couldn\u2019t find any website where you could directly help them sadly, so the best thing we can do is bring awareness to the situation.",
            "Hong Konger here, First, I thank you all sincerely for caring for us. So the best things you can do is to spread the words to others in your nation, showing the government and the communist party in China how many people care will undoubtedly give them a lot of pressure. I also want to tell you guys that r/Hongkong exists and it contains a lot of information you guys really need to know. Thank you.\n\n\nEdit: I really appreciate all your comments, please continue asking me about Hong Kong, I\u2019ll gladly try to answer all",
            "Hong Konger here. Keep visiting us. Don't let the government have any more excuses to say the protesters have ruined tourism in Hong Kong. It really is pretty safe here 99% of the time and protesters know to protect the innocent.\n\nEdit: Just to clarify one thing as I keep seeing it in my responses.\n\n**The Hong Kong International Airport has been temporarily closed this past Monday and Tuesday, but has resumed normal operation since then.** Protests in the airport have been scaled way back as well.",
            "I\u2019m a Hong Konger and your support means the world to us. These couple of days have been pretty rough for me and I\u2019m almost at my breaking point. Seeing fellow redditors supporting our cause really made me smile. Thank you so much for your support. \u9999\u6e2f\u4eba\u52a0\u6cb9!\n\nEdit: my first gold!! Thank you kind stranger!! And thank you all so much for your kind words!! Seriously, I\u2019m bawling my eyes out!! Us Hong Konger won\u2019t give up and we\u2019ll fight for freedom till the end.",
            "Watch, learn, and don't repeat their mistakes at home. \n\nIt's easy to forget how hard freedom was fought for and people so easily give up that freedom at a request.",
            "Support us by staying INFORMED and being OBJECTIVE about the situation. Most of us are peaceful. The violence define a number of us but not the majority. There are also a lot of unverified accusations and outright lies on social media, including Reddit. Don't trust. Verify.\n\nDon't demonize the police but denounce police brutality and poor deescalation tactics.\nDenounce violence from everyone, including the protesters.\nDenounce propaganda and interference of reporters from both sides. \nDenounce biased media framing from international news. Seek unedited LIVE footage. I can't stress this enough. Live footage. Not written summaries with emotive language and sensationalized headlines. \n\nWhen debating, recognize different fallacies. The most common ones are ad hominem, red herring and straw man. Many arguments never really address the opposition's argument.",

            "Fight against corruption.\nwether that corruption is inside you,at local administration or at national level.\nThey (HKers) are playing their part,when will we?",
            "I've been living in Hong Kong ever since I was born. Personally, it would be really helpful if you guys kept spreading the word and putting in your thoughts yourselves. Protesting right at your desk is basically what I'm trying to say. Something even as little as supporting us is fine.\n\nHowever, because of the protests, some parts of our city are being destroyed, blocked off, etc. Things like that can't exactly be fixed by others who don't live in Hong Kong, but if we do end up protesting for the next few years and basically never stopping, I think it would be really helpful for people to come by and protest too. Contacting lawyers, activists, politicians, or LEGCO staff members about the situations could be really helpful.\n\nEven if you can't do anything, that's totally fine, but all I really think we need is for the rest of the world to agree with removing the Extraditional Bill, Carrie Lam will face her wrong ways and it'll be removed. But that's only something we could dream of. Trying our best to make this a reality is the most I ask for. Again, thank you to everyone for actually caring about our population and our home :)",
            "is there somewhere i could find a relatively unbiased ELI5 of what the situation is? from what i've seen on reddit, i can see that it is fucked over there, but i'd have no idea how to explain it to someone else",

            "Hong Kong-er here. \n\nJust want to add to what everyone already said. Please keep checking up on us. Don\u2019t let the story die. The moment western media forgets us is the moment China is free to do whatever it wants without repercussions. \n\nBut also, please, do not give up on us. Despite all the protests and violence, Hong Kong is still an incredibly international and vibrant city, and all we are trying to do is to fight to let Hong Kong be Hong Kong, rather than slipping into just another Chinese city. As long as we still have your support, we will strive to continue our fight for the spirit of Hong Kong. \n\nThank you.",
            "I currently am in HK and me and my family come (from the UK) to HK every year to visit my relatives, so to give those a perspective of the protest and its effects, the flight that my family took to get to HK from Dubai was the last one allowed in before the airport had to be temporarily unavailable due to the protesters. (BTW, this flight just so happened to arrive on the day the protest at the airport took place.)\n\nPlus there's still more.\n\nAfter my family had collected our luggage, we entered the arrival hall and there were protesters everywhere. The peer pressure I felt from all of them looking at my family honestly made me feel scared, along with some of them shouting things which made no sense to me. (To give context, I'm Chinese and English is my first language. I can't speak Chinese but can understand some of it. In this scenario, I had no idea what they were saying). Also the airport was packed, and I mean so packed that you had literally no breathing room, heck barely any room to be carrying a suitcase along with you.\n\nEventually we made it to the MTR station, and even then the trains were packed with protesters in them, as well as around the doors to the trains. However, I don't want to be conveying a bad image of the protesters. Most were actually really nice and allowed us travellers/tourists to get through, and I saw an article which said that they apologised to any travellers which got caught in the protest, and how they didn't mean to get in the way of travellers/tourists.\n\nI think the best way to support the protesters (and I know that this has probably mentioned many times already) is to spread this information to everyone, so that they know what's going on. Hong Kong isn't a bad place, trust me. I've been here at least 10 times now and it's genuinely a nice place, and I don't want its reputation to be ruined by protesters who don't even mean to ruin its reputation. Keep yourself and others updated on the situation and I'm sure things will turn for the best.\n\n(Side note: The government manipulates the news channels in HK so that they modify what gets told across TV. And I saw a video of a protester being arrested for carrying a martial weapon on his bag, even though on the video it shows a police officer PUT the martial weapon in his bag, so yeah...ok then.)\n\nI won't be surprised if this gets taken down, I just hope I can convey enough information to anyone reading this about the protests in HK.\n\nSorry for the long rant, hope you have/had a great day and stay hydrated.\n\nThank you for coming to my TED-Talk",

The tension in the film ratchets up nicely, you get a sense of the desperation these folks on the tribe are experiencing, the hopelessness in their search for justice. I enjoyed the dynamic with Renner's character and the locals - he's from the place and still an outsider, which is something we can all identify with in some way.

            "Find something that relates to something you already enjoy. Maybe its fantasy novels or sports or technology. Maybe you like building things. Below is all base don my opinion.\n\n- There are thousands of options out there, but finding something you can relate to should be the most important aspect. \n\n- Understanding the skill required to play a certain video game is something everybody has to learn to some extent so that would be the second thing to be aware of. Some games have a high threshold of skill and can be a little disheartening to play if you feel you aren't capable.\n\n- Decide what kind of experience you want, do you want short blasts of energy or maybe a long drawn out relaxing time, perhaps something in between.\n\n- Then maybe  consider if you want a story experience or a more arcade experience. Story-based is self-explanatory, but arcade, in my opinion just means more skill-focus over story. But there is always a bit of both in a video game.\n\n- One other thing to consider would be, how much time do you have to play? Some games require some time to get the most out of, whilst others only require maybe 15 to 30 minutes here and there. All can be played for hours on end of course. But there does seem to be a time:enjoyment ratio at times.\n\nI would suggest something but you dont know me so why would my opinion hold any weight. It would be easier finding out more about you to offer options but i think you might be able to get a few options out of the above 4 things.

            "I apologize that I'm writing this on mobile, so there might be errors. I'm an English professor, and one year a pretty good student showed up without one of his 2 major term papers. He explained that his safe had been stolen by a contractor who was working on their house. His laptop was in the safe, and that's where his paper was. I genuinely believe him because he been a really good student. \n\nThen over the next few weeks, he started to show up to class looking very tired. He said that he was on a hunt for the person who stole his safe, and he was spending late nights with his cousin driving around looking for the guy because they knew his van. Now, the student and his cousin were both recently back from tours in Iraq and had seen combat experience. They wanted to find the guy to beat the shit out of him and get the safe back because his wife's wedding ring was in the safe as well as a bunch of cash. He rewrote the paper and turned it in, apologetic that it wasn't up to his usual quality, but he still kept coming to class looking like he hadn't slept. \n\nAfter a little while he came very happy to my office hours, and he reported that he found the guy after a long search that involved breaking into a meth den shaking people down with baseball bats and even bribing some prostitutes. He said that they found the guy's van at a Taco Bell after getting a tip from a prostitute, and they cornered him and waited for the police to come.\n\n I read in the news that he had in fact done a citizen's arrest and stopped the guy at a Taco Bell, and that they ended up calling in the Secret Service because he used the cash that he stole from the safe to buy a bunch of counterfeiting equipment. Secret Service apparently investigates counterfeiting, so the whole investigation happened because this guy who I dub \"the white Shaft\" tracked the scumbag down through the bad side of town late at night to get a wedding ring, some cash, and his research paper back. It all turned out to be true. He got the ring and the laptop back. I gladly accepted his original paper, and it got a much higher grade than the rewrite.\n\nEdit: Thank you kind strangers for the rewards and upvotes. I'm pretty blown away by the response. I'm trying to read all the comments, but it's making me a bad teacher. I don't want to have my head stuck on my phone during class and miss the student who might generate the sequel.\n\nEdit 2: A couple people asked for more details, so here are a few more. I can't recall the year this happened, but it was the height of the war with the US and Iraq. My student had enrolled in the army right after 911 on the same day as his cousin. They were both just out of high school and enrolled due to patriotism and frustration. According to him, when he started his vigilante spree, he actually went inside of a house used by meth addicts to try and find the guy. They shook the house down with baseball bats and forced everyone out into the street. When the cops showed up, they told my student how dangerous this was and not to do it again. Then, they gave him their cards and said... But call us if you do. They shook down at least two other drug dens, and the same cop was waiting outside both times to arrest people since he didn't need to get a search warrant as everyone was outside now at the point of two baseball bats. I told my student how dangerous this all was, and he was very John Wick about getting his wife's wedding ring back. Also, I tried to find a link to the story, but it was a small story, and the googles aren't being very helpful, especially since I can't remember the year.

I had depression and was on a 504 plan as a result. For this reason I was allowed some extra time in the hallways before class to recover from the mental stress of being in a class, etc. It was super helpful and yes, a pretty weird 504 plan!\n\nOne time I was running late and witnessed a car hit a pedestrian crossing the road, severely injuring him, and the car drove away. My brother, who was into cars, recognized the car and identified it to me as our neighbor- who was also in my first period. I stopped to help the pedestrian, also a student at the school, because I had some first aid/lifeguard training. I called him an ambulance and waited for it to show up. I also called the school and told them that he would be going to the hospital. Yep, pretty nice of me. \n\nWhen I got to school my brother and I went down to the front office to get a note for tardiness. The admin I called was waiting there- he thanked me, gave me a note, and told me to tell the teacher if there were any questions, to call him.  My brother told him about the car that he had recognized and that we knew the driver and who that person was. We both went to our classes.\n\nI got to first period late again and my teacher didn't even want to hear my excuse. I pressed the note into her hand and told her the story anyway. The driver of the car was sitting in the back of the classroom with a guilty look on her face. She looked scared shitless. When my teacher wouldn't stop giving me shit for my \"lie\" I gave up and waited for justice to take its course. For the record, I never lied when I came to class late, I always told the truth- I slept late. I never invoked my 504 plan for that particular class, even though my teacher knew about it and would be forced to accept it. \n\nHalfway through class the administrator entered with the School Resource Officer and informed my teacher that the student needed to come with him right now for a hit and run. He saw that I was sitting there and thanked me again for my help and for putting another person's needs above my own.  \n\nMan, it was nice to help that kid but it was *really* nice to see my teacher's face go from disgusted at the driver to shocked *and* disgusted when she realized my story was true.",

            "I was the student. My senior year in high school, I was dual enrolled at the local college taking some night classes, so I only had two classes at the high school that year. Unfortunately the way the schedule worked, I had to go to first period and last period, with the middle of the day off. Usually I'd drive to the nearby wilderness area and go hiking by a river. On this particular day, there was an old van in the parking area at the trailhead. I parked right next to it and got out of my car. As I walked past the van, I noticed there was a man inside. We made eye contact and I smiled and waved, but then noticed that dude was fully naked and jerking off. I freaked out, but instead of getting back in my car and peeling out like a not-panicking person might do, I ran away from the parking area, straight through the river (about 2-3 feet deep, 20 feet across) and crouched in the bushes where I could see the parking lot. I was sure this guy was gonna chase after me, rape and murder me, and no one would know because it was 1pm on a Tuesday in the goddamn wilderness. When he didn't chase after me, I was still terrified he'd be waiting at my car for me, so I wasn't going back until either I saw him leave or another car pulled up. It was 2000, so I didn't have a cell phone, and I waited over an hour for another car to show up. When it did, I emerged, ran back through the river, crawled into my car from the passenger side because the driver's side was next to the van, and sped the fuck away. I was 20 minutes late getting to my Spanish class, but I thought my teacher would understand given that I was still soaking wet up to my waist and clearly some shit had gone down. But she wouldn't let me join the class until I'd explained my tardiness in Spanish. Sorry, profesora, but you never taught us the Spanish word for \"masturbate,\" but I do think I was able to communicate my experience, because she didn't punish me. \n\nIn retrospect, I'm sure that guy was just enjoying a scenic wank at a time and place where he had a reasonable expectation of being alone. Definitely still creepy, but if he had been looking for teenagers to assault that day, the middle of nowhere during school hours probably wasn't the place to look.",

I grabbed some gloves and a towel i had in my car and ran up to help.  His scalp had been torn mostly off his skull, so i used the towel to hold it in place until the paramedics arrived, while he sat there screaming.  When i got to class, i walked in holding my books in front of me.  Teacher asked what took so long, as i was about a half hour later than normal.  I told him that traffic was bad and he made a joke about how traffic was hellish that night as i took my seat and put down my books.  Everyone was instantly silent.

            "I teach a college freshman paper writing class. Over the course of the semester, we have two workshop sessions where students bring in their drafts and critique each other's drafts. Each one counts for five percent of the grade, and missing it unexcused means forfeiting that five percent. An excused absence makes the other workshop session worth ten percent of the grade.\n\nAnyway, during the first workshop session, there was a student who I did not expect to be absent at all but 60 minutes into the class, hadn't shown up (class is 90 minutes long). Normally, I wouldn't allow someone to come in that late, especially to a workshop session. However, he had the best excuse.\n\nHe gives me this letter from a doctor at the PE department. Turns out he had judo for PE that morning. He was paired up with a more experienced sparring partner who flipped him upside down. He landed on his head I think. Under symptoms, the note read that he had temporary memory loss and a possible concussion. Under recommendations, it said that he should go home.\n\nI asked him if why he didn't go home. He said that he \"didn't want to deal with the complications of missing workshop\". I should not that my class was on the fifth floor of a building with no elevator and high ceilings, so he had already gone up four flights of stairs. I didn't want to waste his efforts, so I let him push through.\n\nHe mentioned that he couldn't remember where he put his pen (needed to write comments on classmates' drafts) so I barked at one of his poor classmates to lend him one.\n\nAfterwards, I went to our faculty room and told them about it. They all called BS. And then I showed them the note, which completely changed their tone. Started accusing me of creating a pressuring classroom environment, half joking, I think.\n\nTL;DR: Student shows up to class with head injury with a note to prove it. Chooses not to go home because he doesn't wanna miss the activity for that day.\n\nEdit: Just want to clarify the timeline because I realize it might have caused some concern. The judo incident happened in the morning, around 9 or 10 am. My class was from 4-5:30, with the student arriving 5ish. In the time between the incident and the student arriving late to my class, he was able to rest, regained his memories (although possibly not totally since, again, he couldn't find his pen), was cleared from having a concussion by a doctor. The doctor wrote the note to explain why he would miss classes because the recommendation was that he go straight home, which would mean taking public transport for about an hour. However, the student decided he might as well attend what's left of the class. He was still wearing the judo pants. He did a good job critiquing his classmates' works, by the way.",

I do remember I spent most of my evening after dinner, sitting at the table with my dad trying to complete it.    This was torture.    For some reason my dad and I never connected in a learning environment.  He would dictate things to me and expect me to get it,  but he really struggled to walk me through the process needed for me to understand it.  \n\nSo after many hours of yelling, and arguing and tears and being absolutely miserable,  I finished the damn work sheet.  Set it down and went to bed.  \n  \nIn the morning I woke up to discover a critical error with my homework,  When I set it down to get ready for bed,  I had set it on top of the birdcage instead of on top of the shelf next to it.  I don't know why I thought to do this instead of putting it on the shelf.  I can only assume I thought \"flat surface good\" in my poor tired brain.  \n\nMy Cockatiel was greatly offended by this mysterious new object on top of it's home,  and had spent most of the night shredding my work sheet to pieces.  \n\nI took the remains with me to school and when they asked us to hand in our assignments, I kinda just looked at my teacher with a completely defeated expression on my face and uttered the words \"Ummm... my bird ate my homework.\"  \n\nThe uproar of laughter from the class was deafening.    \n  \nMy teacher took the sheet from me and examined it carefully,  then sighed as he tells me \"well it looks like you tore this page apart with a hole punch.  Come see me after class.\"    I didn't expect to be accused of lying so in my shock I started arguing with him.  \"No,  really,  my bird ate my homework!\"  which... only spurred the laughter from the class further.    I didn't know what else to do.  Did you ever get that \"Frog in your throat\" feeling as kid where your voice just seizes up and you can't manage to squeak out any sound no matter how much you might try?  \n\nFor years afterwards I'd get bullies making stupid \"Did your bird eat your homework again\" jokes from kids that had been in that class.  Adult me thinks it's kinda funny,  I'd probably laugh to...  if it wasn't me.    I had pushed myself (been pushed by my dad) so hard just to complete that damn assignment,  only to have it ruined,  be accused of lying, and be embarrassed and teased for the situation.

            "So, there was this one time in the 1990s. I was helping my brother move from a teaching job after college. This was in the middle of nowhere in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. He was driving his little pickup truck pulling a trailer and I was driving my crappy little Ford station wagon, packed to the gills with his stuff.\n\nIt was a Sunday. I'm driving along and my car just dies. No warning, nothing. I coast to a stop on the side of a rural highway and wait for my brother to realize I wasn't behind him anymore and turn around. After about 20 minutes, he finds me, the hood up and neither one of us knows very much about cars. Soon, though a man from the house we broke down in front of comes out, takes one look at the engine and says, \"Timing belt.\"\u00a0\n\nWe inquire about getting the car towed the 30 miles to the closest large town and realize that it was going to be an expensive repair, even if the engine was OK and not ruined. This man, though, he takes on look at the situation -- sees two broke kids in their early 20s just trying to get by in life and he says, \"Well, it's Sunday. Nothing's gonna be open. I tell ya what. My next-door neighbor is a mechanic. Let's push the car down to my driveway and we'll see what we can do.\"\u00a0\n\nSo that is exactly what we do. His neighbor calls his buddy at the auto parts store (which is closed on a Sunday), who does a favor and gets the parts needed, drives them 30 miles out to the house and well sit around telling stories while the car gets fixed. This man's son, a kid of about 9 or 10, is hanging around. He is extremely bored. There were no kids nearby his age, and he's craving any kind of interaction, even with two guys in their 20s. The kid goes \"Want to see my treehouse?\" and points to the woods out back. My brother and I look at each other, shrug, and say, \"Sure.\"\u00a0\n\nWe end up spending two hours with this kid, helping him build his treehouse. When we are done, we go back to the house and the car is all fixed. My brother and I have maybe $60 in cash on us (combined) and try to pay the man who did the work but he refused. He said, \"No, you boys were in need of help and I *wanted* to help. You don't need to pay me. Plus, you kept my son occupied for several hours, which I truly appreciate.\"\n\nHe then says, \"I want you to do something for me, though. The next time you see someone in need of help and you have the means, I want you to repay this favor.\"\u00a0\n\nAnd that is one of the rules of life I live by, taught to me by a generous man in the middle of nowhere who helped me out when I was in a time of need.",

He lives in the block of flats as my grandpa and I sometimes help him by carrying the groceries or fixing something in his house . I would never forget this act , because things could have gone wrong for me .",

Had a \"Nazi\" coach one year who determined that if you didn't play in the game, you didn't get an ice cream.  I didn't play one game that we won (I wasn't very good anyway) but still I went to the Dairy Barn just to hang with my friends.  Others usually went home. The lady server asked me what I wanted and I told her that I couldn't have one because I didn't play in the game.  She gave me a funny look, and went on the the next customer.  Later as we were sitting at the outdoor picnic tables. this same lady came out and gave me a HUGE ice cream cone.  \"You're still a winner,\" she said and walked away.

            "I\u2019ve posted this before but I had finally decided to get out of my abusive home. I went to my colleges financial aide office to see if I could qualify for a dorm. I was fifty dollars short. I remember looking at the ground trying not to cry. I had finally gotten the courage up to leave and I still couldn\u2019t do it. The financial aide lady touched my shoulder looked me in the eyes and said \u201cI believe you\u201d it was the first time anyone had flat out said they believed I was being abused. She took out her own credit card and paid the last fifty dollars. She went with me to sign the lease and to get the key to my dorm. I stood with the key in my hand and realized I was getting out. I was going to be free. I broke down she hugged me and told me to pay it forward eventually. I have no idea what her name is but to the woman at Dixie college who took a chance on me thank you. I pay it forward by speaking at therapy groups about how to choose not to be a Victim and by sponsoring those who are in similar living situations as I was.\n\n*edit* \nWow I will try and answer all your questions individually but it I miss you here are the answers to the most popular ones. \n\n1st and foremost if you\u2019re being abused TELL someone! If they don\u2019t believe you go to the next person, go until you find someone who believes you. It took 22 people before I found someone who believed me. If the person you want to tell is me that\u2019s fine but tell someone! There is power in speaking YOUR truth.\n\n2nd only because I no longer live there I will say that yes this was in St. George Utah. I no longer live there because while I did get out that day my abuse wasn\u2019t suddenly over. I moved far enough away that I felt safe and started from the ground up. \n\n3rd I\u2019ve gotten DMs/questions on how I teach people to not be victims. It\u2019s hard to describe it into a few sentences but it boils down to choice and to mindset. I am a survivor. You can be too! \n\n4th a couple people in my DMs stated that I deserved the abuse or that I was using the fact that I help people deal with their trauma is just my excuse to not deal with my own. NO ONE DESERVES TO BE ABUSED! Also I never claimed to be a therapist or a doctor.... I am just someone who talks about her individual experiences and how I still live a functional life despite it. I will forever and always be someone who when needed someone can come too. \n\n5th yes I am writing a book on my experiences. It\u2019s called walking on broken glass/ walking on shards I haven\u2019t decided which but when I\u2019m done I\u2019ll promote it in here :) \n\n6th their seem to be two camps of thinking on Reddit one where you don\u2019t thank people for awards and one where you do.

I was unaware of this when the first Friday rolled around so I didn't have any change and neither did the kid next to me. Normally there would be a few who didn't get ice cream but this day we were the only two. So the teacher called the both of us aside and gave us each the change required to have our ice cream. I think the biggest thing was that she didn't do it in front of the other kids so it looked like we had brought the money all along. It was incredibly kind of her, she was a wonderful teacher outside of that as well.\n\nTLDR: I and another student didn't have money for ice cream the day everyone else did, the teacher bought us ice cream so we wouldn't be left out.\n\nEdit: I am going to try to reach out to the school to find the teacher and send her an email if possible as a lot of you suggested.

Only had a bare basic internet plan and phone with an unlimited texting plan (2002-03, smart phones were only just starting to be a thing, and mine wasn't one).   \n\n\nI went to the store thinking I had $60 and would treat myself to stocking up on a few pieces of meat to throw in the freezer for future use. I was so damn sick of mac & cheese, hot dogs, eggs, and ramen. Was super careful with pricing and taxes. Got to the register and my card was declined. I stepped aside (long line behind me) and called my bank. I was negative $4.36... I was trying not to cry as I told the cashier I was sorry, but I had to put it back. The lady at the register at the time said \"Nuh-uh! Gimmie.\", and grabbed the hand basket form me. She added it on to her order ignoring my protests. Like, she literally full blown ignored me until we were walking out of the store. Poor cashier kept looking between us like \"what's happening', but run it up at the woman's insistence.   \n\n\n\"Honey, I've been there. You need to eat and be strong to work at pulling yourself up. Someone did this for me once, so I'm doing it for you. All I ask is that you pay it forward, even if it takes years. Oh my god, hun, stop crying. You're a strong, powerful, beautiful woman! Don't ever forget that or let the world forget it! No, seriously, stop crying, it's getting embarrassing.\"   \n\n\nI hope I've done you proud since, my Texan Fairy Godmother!",

I got off my shift around 1 in the afternoon and I needed a coffee to stay alive. So I go to a local coffee place that was in the same area, ordered an iced coffee and lamented living for a while. Once it was made, I realized I had forgotten my wallet at home. So I apologized profusely to the barista, and started walking back to my car. He follows me into the parking lot with the iced coffee and hands it to me, and I ask \"why?\" through actual tears. And he just shrugged and said \"it's the day after st paddy's, everyone needs an iced coffee.\" \n\nI still think about it a lot and I try to pay it forward whenever I can.",

My family had me convinced that I deserved to be alone and no one should ever be nice to me.\n\nI moved into my new flat after long time away, I was convinced no one cared about me and no one should. My new neighbour and I got talking one day and she found out that my birthday - which I never really celebrate - was coming up, but I didn't think anything of it. At 11am on my birthday there was a knock on my door and I opened it to see my neighbour, whom I barely knew, standing there with a homemade birthday cake along with my entire building, most of whom had never met me, singing Happy Birthday to me.\n\nI hate that song and I hate my birthday, but that one act of a basic stranger going to such lengths to make sure I wasn't alone that day, it really did make me smile. I dunno... The world was a little brighter that day.\n\nTL;DR: A basic stranger made me a cake and got an entire building to sing to me on my birthday when I had given up on anyone caring about me.\n\nEdit: Typos.",

            "This was around a time in high school when I started to get *intense* social anxiety. tunnel vision, stuttering, embarrassment, always self conscious and closed off. when in a room of people, i would freeze up even when no one was paying attention to me. \n\nWell one of my classes always impacted my anxiety far more than the others for some reason. I didn't have friends in that class and most of the other students were jocks or popular kids, so it was hella intimidating. One day the english teacher for the class put us all in a circle and students would ask for eachother's opinions. I eventually got called on, and I tried to pull out any tiny bit of improv in me to answer the question as quickly as possible- however most of it came out as a jumbled and stuttering mess. My face was undoubtedly red and I remember avoiding eye contact as best as I could, cuz all I could really hear was my heart pounding. I had already forgotten the question, yet all eyes were on me, watching me struggle. I ended the answer probably just blurting out how I don't know how to answer the question. I can't even remember how everyone else reacted, I think some jocks were teasing me, but I think the guy who had asked the question actually noticed that I was having a panic attack and not just having stage fright. I don't think anyone noticed but he apologized with an awkward but sincere \"sorry\" and he distracted his buddies who were teasing me by changing the subject.  I can see how no one else could think of this as very significant, but at the time it was like someone took 2 tons off of my chest. I never forgot it.",

We're passing the art gallery inside and a beautiful painting of a nude woman in silk sheets caught me eye and i went up to the window to admire it. It was incredible it was almost like if you touched it you could feel the silk. I love art so much so i asked him if we could take a look and he was like \"yea for sure\"\n\nWe saw a lot of pretty pieces- metal sculptures, pop art- the works. Then one particular artist's section caught our eye. Robert Deyber. Amazing stuff! All of his art was bases off of puns. He had a whole series of \"Bad Hare Day\" dedicated to the depiction of rabbits doing horrible things like setting houses on fire etc. We LOVED it. We stood in his section for a while pointing, laughing, reading the names and just loving it. We decided that his art was too good not to bring home of course we couldn't afford an actual painting so we browsed the table holding all the artist gallery books. His was $98! So we disapointedly put it down. I decided to ask the curator lady working there if there were any cheaper ones online and she said- \"hold on\" and walked to the back- where my boyfriend and i had come from and came back with the same book we were looking at and handed it to us. She winked and said \"happy Valentine's day\" and i was like \"!!!\" And she put her finger to her lips cuz her co-worker was on the other side of the room and we both just silently thanked her. We left the gallery in quite a daze. We kept trying to figure out the reason why? Was she related to the artist? Do no one ever really go in there to look at art? Anyway. My heart was so full that day. Was a great Valentines day honestly.",
            "Throughout elementary school I was picked on by so many of my classmates, and I had few if any friends at the time. I remember being in 6th grade and we were headed out of our regular room to the computer lab, and the taunts became too much, and I broke down crying, as we were walking. The prettiest girl in class noticed, and came over to ask why I was crying and helped me pull myself together. It was incredibly kind, and while we weren't friends, it allowed me a moment to see a tiny bit of good in the world. The really ironic part was that her twin brother was one of my worst tormentors. \n\nBeing bullied and picked on carried through to middle school, and I broke down in the middle of English class and the teacher extended some compassion as well. He sent me down to the counselor's office, and I just so happened to see that same girl from elementary school walking out. I said Hi, fully expecting her to ignore me or scoff at me... treat me poorly, and instead she gave me a friendly Hi. That was it. But it meant the world, when everyone else treated me so poorly.",

My wife told the kids that they will all have to share.\n\nThe family behind us (mom, dad and 2 kids) asks for a poster, she gives them one, the mom says can I have another? The lady says \"Sure!\" and hands her another poster.\n\nMy wife and I are debating whether or not to say something, I decided to ask again but I noticed a woman talking a little less than sternly to the poster lady. I couldn't make out what they were saying but I did see the poster lady shake her head and hand her a poster.\n\nThe lady thanks the worker and starts walking toward my family, she hands the poster to my daughter and apologizes, eluding that the lady may have been racist (we are black, everyone involved were white) and says \"If you do for one, do for everyone or at least don't deny someone then immediately give to the next.\"\n\nMy wife and I thanked the lady and we were simply humbled that someone would go to bat for us. We personally didn't think race played a factor (or at least it wasn't obvious) but it was still a wholesome act - regardless of color.",
            "When I was a very small child, my mom's kidneys failed due to complications from type 1 diabetes and ignoring her doctor's advice to abort me. We were in a battle for her getting social security disability and they kept denying her even though she wasn't able to work anymore due to dialysis.\n\n We had to give up our (rented) house and move into a tiny apartment. We were a family of 3 (my brother also disabled due to brain damage) living on $500/mo in welfare. When our welfare ran out, cuz you can only be on it for 6 months, she hadn't gotten her disability yet.\n\n Our landlady allowed my mother to stop paying rent, and she paid for our utilities and brought us groceries every week out of her own pocket. She'd also bring over a homemade dish, like lasagna or tuna casserole every Sunday until my mom get her disability. Mom's SSD checks were only about $800/mo, so our landlady only charged her $25/mo in rent for the next 4 years. We would have probably died on the street if not for this sweet old lady's kindness and generosity. May she rest in peace <3",

            "I was moving into a new apartment from the old one. Old one wasn't safe. The doors were paper thin, bad neighborhood, and my upstairs neighbors kept threatening to shoot one another late into the night. I hadn't been sleeping. New apartment was a townhouse style, safe neighborhood, walkable, no upstairs neighbors! The date to move comes and I'm SO excited to get the fuck out if there.  \n\nAnd my 'friends' bail. They didn't come at all. They were tired that day. I moved all of my stuff on my own in an SUV my boss allowed me to borrow for the day.  I've been hauling boxes and furniture ALL day. I'm tired, I've been abandoned by my friends, I haven't really eaten much, and I'm TIRED. \n\nLast load to unpack, I park in front of the place and start getting boxes. One at a time and of course it's books. Why did I leave these for last? I get most of it done but I've hit my limit and I start to sniffle, a sure sign I'm going to start exhaustion-crying. A guy was passing by and stopped. \"Excuse me. Would you like an extra hand?\" Granted, looking back as a single young woman in a new place I shouldnt have accepted. He carried the last two boxes in which would have taken me an extra two trips. He shook my hand and welcomed me to the area. I start crying, he gives me a hug and told me everything was okay.  And it was! Made that day so much better. The town was my home for the next eight years. Lovely, lovely town. I saw him at the corner pub every so often.\n\nNo joke, Brock Turner is registered in the same town now. It's still a lovely welcoming town and everyone hates him but his parents.

But, because of flight delays, I actually missed the last bus for that night. \n\nI had a choice of either taking an Uber (probably like $50) or sleeping at the airport and then taking the morning bus.\nI decided, instead, to start asking people if they could give me a ride to campus. People either looked at me funny or just flat out rejected, which was to be expected.\n\nI was about to give up and just stay over at the airport until I saw a family that was also on the same plane as I was. I went up to them and asked if they lived somewhere near the city. They said no, but they pulled up Google Maps to see if it was on their way. Turns out, it was about a 40 min detour, but they still agreed to take me.\n\nEven though I could have just taken an Uber or slept over at the airport, their kindness to help out a stranger was so memorable.\n\nTL;DR: A family agreed to drive me from the airport to campus after missing the last bus",

Well the person right in front of this long line let me cut her as I was sobbing and couldn't even explain the situation because of me hyperventilating. I was so grateful for her because I was completely at a loss of what to do in that situation. I ended up getting a new flight an hour after my original flight and everything worked out but I will always be thankful for that lady at the airport who let me cut her in line so I could reschedule my flight",

            "Wife was 7 months pregnant with our first kid, and we went to Ruths Chris steakhouse just to have a nice romantic dinner knowing she might have to go on bed rest soon. \n\nSo we are halfway thru our meal when the waiter comes up and asks us if we would like a glass of a vintage Dom Perignon. We were surprised but politely declined knowing it was super expensive (we were focused on a bill of like $120 lmao) and explained how my wife was pregnant.  He was like \"oh...um...would you like me to bag it for you\" and we just looked at him so confused.  I said \"what?\". \n\nHe went on to explain how a gentleman in the restaurant decided to purchase a bottle for us but wanted to remain anonymous.  We were shocked and a bit weirded out knowing some man was watching us eat dinner.  So we finished our meal and at the end I asked the waiter for a notecard so I could write the man a nice message.  Suddenly there is a man beside me and just said \"You two look like a wonderful couple and I wanted to wish you both the absolute best\".  We thanked the man and that was that.   \n\nIt was a 1996, happened in 2005, and we have yet to drink it. We keep it in a dark place on its side though periodically moving it.  It's probably bad now, lmao. \n\nEdit - Just read this: https://johanjohansen.dk/2017/07/28/review-dom-perignon-1996-tasting-notes/ \n\n\n\n> Dom Perignon, you see, is usually released some eight years after harvest but takes considerably longer than that to truly shine. As a result, far too many bottles of Dom Perignon are opened far too early in their life for fairly obvious reasons: While some may have the setup and willpower needed to purchase a case at release and store **for the ten, twenty or more years needed to release its true potential**, most of us probably haven\u2019t. And so we\u2019re left with two choices, drink our Champagne young, or do what I did: put our trust and money in the hands of a wine merchant or brokers and the heavily fluctuating prices of a volatile wine market.\n> \n> Which is not the most affordable option, might I add. At the time of this writing, a well-stored 21 year-old specimen from 1996 will set you back a good $400-500 \u2013 worth it? Let\u2019s review it and find out! Then afterwards discuss how you best get your hands on an older bottle of vintage Champagne, should you desire to copy my move.",

I had overloaded the cheap plastic bags with cans of beans and tomatoes for chili, and they started to rip.

            "This is kinda wild, and a long time ago when I was about six but it could have changed my entire life had it played out differently. I\u2019ll add a TL;DR at the end. \n\n My father had moved to the US a year before us in order to set up housing and all that for us. My father, without the help of any lawyers, is the sole reason I\u2019m a citizen today. This is the story of the one and only time he forgot something crucial. We had already gotten all of our visas and everything was ready to go for our trip. Or so we thought. \n\nWe were quite young when all of this happened, and my mother was tasked with bringing my brother (two at the time) and I to reunite with my father.  We had arrived at the airport two hours before our flight. Because of strict rules with bringing children over borders, my mom needed written permission from my father that stated she was allowed to bring us. We didn\u2019t have that, so when we were going through the checkpoint, the three of us were detained while the immigration agents figured out what to do with us.\n\nThe agents told us they were going to have to speak to their supervisor and only he could give us permission to board the flight. They warned my mom that if they weren\u2019t allowed to let us on, we could essentially have to restart the process and come back months later with the correct paperwork. Thing is, my dad had saved up and we basically had enough money for this one time so it was now or never for my family. We waited for two hours, and my mother had given up on us being able to travel at this point, seeing as no one had come back in to check on us.\n\nOut of nowhere, this pilot walks into the room and gets the whole story from my mother. He tells us he\u2019s going to try and talk to the people in charge of letting us board and left. At this point, we were supposed to already have been on the plane and it would be leaving within the next fifteen minutes. My brother and I had no idea what was happening, but my mother was in tears. He comes back about ten minutes later, red in the face and out of breath. He tells us he\u2019s gotten the approval and we had to leave RIGHT NOW, or we would miss our flight. He grabs my brother and our suitcase and tells my mom to grab me by the hand and keep up with him no matter what. \n\nAs we were running through the holding rooms and all the way across to the terminal, he was yelling at anyone who was listening to tell the people at the terminal to hold the flight for us. We got there just in time and they somehow found seating for us all together. I think some people shuffled around when they saw how young my brother and I were. \n\nThis man that had nothing to do with the situation and just happened to walk into the room we were in and take an interest. If not for him, I might not have ever become a US citizen and my life would be completely different. He seemed like an angel at the time, and the older I get the more convinced my family is that he was. \n\nTL;DR My mom brother and I were at the airport visas in hand, ready to start a new life in the US. My father forgot to give his permission for us to travel and we almost never made it here. An angel of a pilot happened to walk into the room we were being held and then personally ran us to our terminal in just enough time to get on the plane.",

I was floored - it was $120 worth of food. It wasn't like she was paying for a gallon of milk. I said no so many times but she insisted. She said it was the anniversary of her father's death 20 years ago, and that paying for a stranger's groceries was the kind of thing he would do. So when she said \"please let me honor him this way\" I gave in and let her pay. I cried the whole way home, feeling like I had taken advantage of her, like I wasn't worthy of the help.\n\nI made sure to promise her I'd pay it forward in return.

And instead of being lazy or just sitting around, he decided to take up jobs that people who just start working there do, he refilled ice for drive through, he filled the condiment bins, he replaced soft drink bags, he refilled the lemonade and tea containers. One thing was for sure, when he was working he made it a point to leave as little work for front counter staff as possible, so they could focus on taking orders and being as efficient as possible in the drive through. Sadly, this morning Chuck died due to complications after a surgery, I\u2019m asking that you pray for his family and everyone he impacted. He was a great man, and deserves the world.",

In 6 more hours (33 hours since the last tweet), this will be down to 6 cases over the same time period - 33,7 hours, 34 hours, 37,3 hours, 38,5 hours, 40,3 hours and 45,9 hours. This should probably cover the interesting information.\n\nEdit3: The president has returned: https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1109787378242240514 The final count was 39 hours 46 minutes, which makes this the 3rd largest gap between tweets during this presidency.

A few candles burn with a professionally done photo of AOC at the center with what looks like a tuft of black hair.  Donny can't believe his beady little eyes.

Donald takes a bite of his second Big Mac in sadness and solitude. \n\nMeanwhile.

            "Sandy Creek Massacre?\n\n500 colorado cavalry were sent to track down natives that were attacking settlers (for good reason but that is a long story).\n\nThey ended up coming to a Cheyenne village that was known to be peaceful. It\u2019s leader, Black Kettle, was a voice of peace for the natives and had even gone to washington DC to meet with president lincoln and negotiate a lasting peace between Americans and Cheyenne. Lincoln gave him an American flag and told him that so long as it flew in their camp, no American would harm them.\n\nAnyways, this asshole Chivington was leading the cavalry, and saw it as some kind of noble duty. After months of searching for aggressive natives and coming up empty handed, the government ordered him to disband his force and go home. Chivington, now faced with the prospect of his crusade being an embarrassment, decided to attack Black Kettle\u2019s village, basically just to say he did something.\n\nThe Colorado cavalry attacked in the middle of the night in mid november, while everyone was sleeping. Eyewitness accounts are terrifying, and basically women, children, and men were run down as they tried desperately to flee across a frozen river. Black Kettle ran into the middle of the battle waving the American flag and screaming that they were friends of America, but the Americans turned on him and he was forced to drop the flag and flee as well. The fact that Black Kettle survived is miraculous, but most of his clan did not, and the few that survived the battle mostly died of hypothermia and starvation from literally fleeing through a frozen river in the middle of the night. \n\nCavalry men raped live and dead women, including children, and cut off mape and female genitals and strapped them to their horses as decorations.\n\nBlack Kettle and what remained of his clan ended up getting sent to a reservation, where they mostly starved to death, and Black Kettle gave up on peace as the younger generation flocked to warlords like Roman Nose and Crazy Horse. This ended up contributing to Red Cloud\u2019s War, as did most of the other atrocities in the West.\n\nOh, also Chivington was known to have said: \u201cNits make lice,\u201d a statement that referred to his campaign of exterminating native children along with everyone else. Oh and I\u2019m oretty sure Colorado nearly elected him governor after all of this anyways.",

I've never been much of an artist, but I gave it a try nonetheless... and about halfway through my first attempt, the girl started moaning and writhing beneath me in a way that seemed really, *really* exaggerated. Although I did my best to focus on my task, the motions of my partner made it rather difficult.\n\n\"Do you want me to keep doing this?\" I asked her.\n\n\"Yes! *Yes!*\" came the young woman's reply. \"Yes, don't stop! *Draw all over me!*\"\n\nAgain, the whole thing seemed more like a performance than it did an actual response to pleasure, and I started to get suspicious that I was being made the butt of some bizarre joke. Every line that I drew sent the girl into paroxysms of affected delight, until she finally moaned for me to put away the marker and get out my \"paint-sprayer.\" The rest of the evening eventually went on about as you'd expect from such encounters, despite a tiny voice in the back of my head asking what I'd missed about the whole situation.\n\nI finally got my answer when the girl asked to take a shower with me. \n\nIt turned out that what she'd *really* wanted was for me to scrub her skin until it was practically raw. (Suffice it to say that she hadn't needed to put on an act that time.) We wound up having an informative discussion after I'd washed the remnants of my drawing off her, and it came to light that she'd always liked the feeling of being roughly bathed. When I asked why she hadn't simply requested that in the first place, she sheepishly admitted that having a fetish for emulating a easel seemed less bizarre to her.\n\nTo each their own, I guess.\n\n**TL;DR: A young woman liked to be rubbed down while she rubbed herself off.**",

We had a one-time fling, and I never talked to either of them again.\n\n**Edit: Since people keep asking, I'm copying the long story from later in the thread.**\n\nIt was kind of dull, really. She knocked at the door, came inside, then made this \"joke\" that she was worried about catching me in my underwear. I joked back about how she could always leave and come back, and she said something like \"I might just do that.\" I told her if she was serious, I could just get undressed right there. She waited for a couple seconds (which made me think I'd gone too far), then said it would be more fun if she could help me get undressed.\n\nSo, yeah. We undressed each other, there was some mutual touching and foreplay, then we had sex. It was actually kind of hard to concentrate sometimes, because she kept squeezing my ass *REALLY* hard, but we actually got pretty close to having a simultaneous orgasm. I think we both felt a little awkward afterward, because we didn't even really talk. We just got dressed, she got the box of her daughter's stuff, and she left. I think the last thing she said to me was \"Let's keep this between us.\"\n\nAlso, the mom was better. The daughter was always a little bit mechanical, if that makes sense. It was like she knew how she was supposed to move, but wasn't really doing it for any other reason. The mom was a little too wild for me, but everything she did felt like it was supposed to make one of us feel good.",

            "Mutual touching/rubbing/groping with an attractive stranger without words in public transportation.    \n    \n#Edit: Here is the story.    \n    \nI used to live near a big city and was taking some courses in a place downtown for a few months. Those classes were at 8 am and the most convenient way to get there was to endure a 1-hour commute by bus. I say *endure* because of the terrible traffic and because, most of the time, all the seats would be taken so there was no way to take a nap on the way. My earbuds were pretty much always on. That was the case for most people in the bus every day, all sleepy, either taking naps, listening to music, maybe reading. Too early to have conversations.    \nOne of those days, as I was trying to stay awake while standing, I noticed that a young woman (early twenties, around my age back then) was standing next to me, also with her earbuds on. We certainly checked each other out and looked at each other from the side of our eyes a few times. As more people came into the bus and the bus rocked back and forth in the middle of traffic, first our feet touched, we both smiled, we turned slightly and then the bus stopped suddenly and somehow our inner thighs touched. Maybe it was the music we were independently listening to, but we slowly got closer and closer to each other. Because it was a bit cold early in the morning, it felt really good to feel each other\u2019s body heat. My left leg was in between hers. We would make eye contact briefly once in a while for a split of second. I saw her licking her lips, closing her eyes. Then we were pressing on each other, making slight movements, breathing on each other\u2019s necks. Our hands touched, I caressed her fingers, and she\u2019d grabbed my wrist and pressed my hand against her leg, while biting her lips like trying to hold a moan. Then it all just kept going. She took my hand to make me touch her waist under her jacket. I also took her hand and pressed it against my leg, I moved my hand up and it kept going. Everything was slow, soft, warm caresses, light squeezes. It got so hot. She slowly moved my hand wherever she wanted, but we were trying to act like nothing was happening. My eyes were closed. She squeezed my hand with her legs between her legs. We started exploring each other with our hands over our clothes first, but then my thumb was already in her pants and she was touching my penis with two fingers. Our faces touched.        \nThen one guy in the bus decided to stand up and offered her his seat. And that\u2019s when we realized that other people could see what we were doing. She said *\u201dNo thanks. I\u2019m fine\u201d* and did not take the seat. I felt like I snapped back to reality. A minute after that we couldn\u2019t really stand that close to each other because there weren\u2019t many people standing anymore. We were both still listening to music. My stop was the next one. We silently said goodbye with our eyes.    \nDuring the next hours, the blue balls were unbearable.",

            " My grandpa was in his late 80s or early 90s when he caused a minor fender bender on the way to a doctor's appointment. A couple of days later, he was having brain surgery to fix a bleed that resulted from the accident. After he recovered, he was required to retake the driving test. His doctor sent in documentation saying he was medically unfit to drive. My dad sent in some document saying he lived in town and would make sure my grandpa had transportation as needed. He was absolutely dangerous on the road and in the early stages of dementia. The state of Florida gave him back his license.",
            "Illinois does this.  Info from google:\n\"Specifically, Illinois: requires drivers age 75 and older to renew their licenses in person. requires both a vision test and road test for drivers ages 75 and older renewing in person. requires drivers ages 81 through 86 to renew their license every two years, and those 87 and older to renew annually\"\n\nWhen I took my 17 year old daughter for the road test, she was waiting with an older man who was taking his first road test since he was a teen.  They were both equally nervous.",
            "Yes. My grandma was still able to drive even though she could barely push the brake peddle all the way down. My grandpa had seizures and eventually had his license taken away because he wouldn't take his meds and had a seizure while driving more than once. My husband's grandpa drove into a ditch because he couldn't multi-task (adjusting the heat/vents) while driving.",
            "Yes. My 91 year-old grandmother has macular degeneration, cataracts, and is in the early stages of dementia. She failed her eye exam at one DMV but went to another DMV and somehow passed. She should not be driving as she's going to eventually hurt someone else, herself, or get completely lost.\n\nEdit: I didn't expect this to gain any attention at all. For clarification she lives in a small town of 600 people. The closest city with uber is 45 minutes away. She's still capable of living on her own for now. \n\nI think the only reason my family hasn't taken any action to stop her from driving is if something happens to her and she needs to drive to the hospital. I do not condone her driving whatsoever and have no control over the situation. My uncle and cousin live in the same town and help her get where she needs to go. The only time she drives, that I'm aware of, is to a small grocery store about a quarter of a mile down her road.\n\nMaybe small towns could start initiatives for teens or adult volunteers to drive the elderly around and get them basic house necessities.\n",
            "Absolutely. I\u2019m an auto adjuster and I once had his couple around 70 cause a terrible rear end accident while merging on the freeway. The old man was driving, and got confused somehow and hit someone going full speed. The old lady had a chihuahua on her lap and the airbag hit it. They took it to a vet but it died the next day. I had to pay for its euthanasia bill.  Other pro had minor injuries. The man sounded so broken on the phone. They never got another car and their little companion died. Their daughter called me to see if there was anything in the police report that explained why it happened and of course there wasn\u2019t. My parents are the same age and ride around with little dogs. My mom says that sometimes my dad looks like he forgets that he\u2019s driving and takes his hands off the wheel and she has to yell at him to stop. I\u2019m literally going to report him to their Secretary of State I\u2019df she doesn\u2019t take him to get a retest soon. ",

            "Yes. I\u2019m a young, healthy 27 year old who uses a wheelchair and drives an adapted van. Because of this I must be tested every few years. I have never had an accident, I have 0 demerit points, and have never even been pulled over. However, old people that mix up the gas and brake pedals and can\u2019t remember to put on their lights at night get a free pass to drive until they kill someone. ",
            "My grandfather (early 80s) got into a car accident a few years ago\u2014he backed into someone. And my grandmother, whose Alzheimer\u2019s has been growing steadily worse for several years, still is allowed to drive (possibly not now that they live in a home\u2014but before they did, I distinctly remember her driving us to the grocery store and her forgetting where we were going, the turn off back to her house, and so on).  I do believe they, and other older folks, should have to take another drivers test.\n\nLike others are saying, I agree people in general should be retested every few years. Maybe not terribly often, but I wouldn\u2019t mind retaking it every 10 years or so (maybe even more frequent with age?) if that would help there to be fewer accidents. ",
            "Sadly I'm having this issue with my father. He thinks I'm evil because both my self and mother think it's safer my 74-year-old father doesn't drive due to cognitive impairment visual difficulties and think at times due to medication he isn't compus mentus enough to be driving. Safer for him and other drivers and pedestrians. Sometimes you have to make the big decisions the hard choices for the better not just to make someone happy. I'll be the bad guy but at least people would be safe.  ",
            "What, absolutely. But I wouldnt even say apply it only to the elderly, everybody should periodically have to redo the driving tests. I say about every 10 years. ",
            "They do a road test when you are a teen and never again. Like any license, you should have to pass a test every few years to keep the license. \n\nEdit: To reply to many of the commenters, yes, I realize it could be prohibitively expensive to road test every driver every 5 years (maybe 10 years is better, then every 2 years after 65?) but I think with technology the way that it is, we could design a road test that could be done by a machine in a simulator where it gauges reaction time, adherence to laws and that kind of thing. I think it might be a good idea to road test people who have had multiple moving violations. I also think it would be a good idea to regularly give people a written test (by computer) just to keep people updated. The cost of doing nothing is higher insurance premiums, more death by vehicle and the fact that there is a real risk to letting people drive who no longer have the cognitive function to do so. My point was, I was given a road test at 17 and since then, the only other time I've had to prove any ability is a written test when I moved out of state. Other than that, I renew my license by mail and haven't been to a DMV in years.",
            "Absolutely. Actually, I think it should be a requirement for *everyone* to pass a driving test every 5-10 years. Do you know how many people legitimately don't understand fundamental rules of the road because they either lucked out or simply forgot?",
            "The writtem exams are so ridiculously easy for many states. If anything they should heighten the standards (for everyone, not just the elderly) to get a license. So many bad drivers out there. I have seen so many accidents in cities that were so unavoidable but there are too many people with unsafe habits on the road.",
            "Why limit it to just elderly people? Everyone picks up bad habits. Road conditions and laws change all the time, and people forget stuff.\n\n\nJust make it so you get retested every 5-10 years. Job done, safer roads, more income and no accusations of age discrimination. ",
            "I think this one is a no-brainer. You need to be tested every few years for most licenses, so why not also for a driving license?\n\nOnly testing 16-18 year old kids is a shoddy practice in my mind. Things change. You could even avoid the age discrimination argument by requiring that EVERYONE be retested every couple years, not just those +50 or +65.\n\nSadly, I doubt that any such system like that would be implemented. Regardless of care taken to not discriminate, there are roadblocks (pun intended). Just off the top of my head:\n\n* AARP would turn the legislation into an attack on the elderly. As America's largest special interest group, and one that caters mostly to America's largest voter group, you lose a key demographic  \n\n* Other special interest groups (Those for drivers, etc) would potentially have an issue with it, as it's an inconvenience.  \n\n* It'd be an infrastructural headache. The DMV/DPS/DOL is already woefully understaffed in most places, and people hate going there. Requiring motorists to go back more often would inundate those places even more\n\n* Requiring motorists to go to the DMV more often is a hard sell, especially when you invariably have to pay some extortionist fee\n\nIt would help with voter registration though, what with the motor-voter act. Take that as you will\n\nTL;DR: Yes.",
            "YES! I don\u2019t even know how my grandma is still allowed to drive. I\u2019m legitimately scared to drive with her. She\u2019s bound to cause an accident soon. ",
            "In New Zealand you have to renew your license when you turn 75, and 80 and then every two years after that. You also have to bring a medical certificate to show a doctor thinks you\u2019re safe to drive.",
            "Yes. To avoid the age discrimination argument, I would be perfectly happy to get retested every five years if this meant that everyone had to.",
            "Yes. It should be something we are consistently tested on, every 5-10 years maybe, then more frequent as you get older. \n\nI\u2019ve always felt this way, but I just recently learned that someone I went to high school with died in a car accident because an 88 year old man was driving on the wrong side of the highway... in broad daylight.  It was just last week. \n\nThe following contains a somewhat graphic description of what happened:\n\nThis guy was 26 years old, driving to go home or or meet some friends on a weekday morning, and he met his death in the form of a fiery car crash that left 60% of his body covered in 3rd degree burns. \n\nHe was stuck in the car for 20 minutes before they got him out. \n\nHe was on life support for 4 days before they pronounced him brain-dead and let him go.  He passed away Saturday. \n\nI barely this knew this person and hadn\u2019t spoken to him in years, but the fact that his life was stolen from him and he died, most likely in tremendous amounts of pain and fear, in a way none of us can imagine going, makes me so angry for him and his family.  \n\nThat man should not have been driving. He entered a major roadway, on the wrong side because he was confused, and ended up ending his own life and the life of someone who had only just started his journey. \n\nWe NEED to have people test and test and test again to make sure everyone driving is a safe and able driver. \n\n\n\nEdited to add the timeline ",
            "Yes! So much so. Its heartbreaking when an elderly person loses their license but it's taken away because they were potentially dangerous to themselves or others.. So many certifications/licenses need to be renewed every 3-4 years. Why is the one in which lives are at stake good for 80+ years?",
            "Every single time I've been nearly rear ended, cut off, nearly side-swiped, or any other near-miss auto accident it's been someone who was NOT even remotely elderly.\n\nI think there should be retesting of driving tests on a 5 or 7 year basis for everyone who drives, because people get complacent.",
            "If we can limit when people can start driving why can't we limit when people should stop driving?",
            "[deleted]",
            "I am 67. I did a bit of research when I noticed my reaction time was slower, meaning when other drivers do the unexpected, it took me a few more seconds to sort out what was happening. In some situations, those few seconds could make a huge difference. I'm healthy, I am not on any medication and have no specific issues, but I am aging. The cursory research I did was rather alarming, advising after a few accidents, it's time to rethink driving.  Seriously?  \n\nSo, I only drive during the daytime and in the neighborhood, where the residential speed limit is 25 mph. Short trips, paying close attention, and I'm ready to give it up if I have a close call. I may stop driving at 68 regardless, I don't want to risk hurting anyone. \n\nBut ... I have the option of riding the bus because I live in a suburban area with a main thoroughfare a few blocks away.  The reality in the United States is that our communities are built to accommodate cars, not people. As programs to help people are being slashed, what do elderly people do if they stop driving, have irregular or no public transportation, and they need to go to doctors' appointments, the grocery store, etc.!\n\nHaving systems in place that support the limitations that come with age would help, although that wouldn't touch entitlement or those who feel fiercely independent; regular testing would help in those situations. \n\nIt's a tough and complex problem. ",
            "Yes, because slowness can kill just as much as inexperience",
            "It should be every year after a set age.  I watched my grandparents go from able to drive to needing care within a short amount of time. Also the elderly are high as kite on lots of drugs   and will argue with you about it   like it's cool my Dr gave me 14 different scripts and I can drive. Yea right  if we were caught driving on the amount of dope oldies are on we would be arrested ",
            "I don't see the problem with everyone having to take annual competency tests.  ",

            "A friend of mine was driving on the highway at night. She was going around a curve in the left hand lane and an 80 year old man collided with her head-on. He'd been driving himself to the hospital (despite his family telling him not to) and took the wrong on-ramp. She suffered massive injuries, was told at one point she would never walk again, and has and will have major surgeries to fix everything. The man died on scene, after the paramedics had to decide who to flight-for-life out. She was almost passed over, because of how trapped she was. They took 45 minutes to free her, and nobody even thought to call her family until she was already at the hospital almost 2 hours later, despite them only being an hours drive away. This poor young girl was alone, without family or loved ones, for 3 hours, from being trapped in her car crushing her pelvis and then being whisked into a helicopter and taken to the hospital with no one to comfort her but strangers. When conscious she was begging them to call her mom, and trying to hand them her phone.\n\nShe was not only physically injured, but her whole life got messed up. She missed months of school, had medical bills up the wazoo, had to relearn how to walk, was accused of being a \"damn teenager texting on her phone\" by the local news *(did they forget he was going the wrong way on the highway? Around a curve? At night? In the fucking boonies?)* and then they published her name without her/her parents permission *(she was a minor)* and suffered hate mail and online retribution from the ignorant masses.\n\nThis man took a teenagers life and flipped it upside down. Her family rearranged their entire lives to care for her. There was no excuse for his actions, his negligence, or his families negligence. \n\nOld people should be tested and retested to make sure they're fit to make decisions, see, and follow the rules. ",
            "I always hear people say that doing this is discriminatory but I disagree. It isn't discrimination to make sure someone is physically capable of using something that can kill others.\n\nThat said, I don't think it should just be elderly. Licenses should be renewed *with a test* every 5-7 years in my opinion. Age isn't the only thing that causes dangerous drivers. Laziness and arrogance does as well. Someone thinks they've been driving for years so they'll drive like an asshole. Some people forget basic traffic rules and cause accidents. Everyone should be retested for competence. ",
            "Yes, if they can\u2019t operate the vehicle due to physical problems, they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to drive it. My grandma willingly gave up driving when her vision degraded. If she hadn\u2019t stopped herself, nobody would have unless she got into a possibly serious accident. It\u2019s similar to if I lose my glasses, I should not be allowed to drive. ",
            "Yes, because they are potentially more dangerous than new drivers. That being said, new drivers are equally as dangerous. \n\nSome of the elderly cannot see that well, almost/do rear-end people, drive extremely slow (which is very dangerous), and blatantly disobey traffic laws. \n\nThere would have to be a age that it would need to be mandatory to start taking drivers ability tests again. It ideally should be mandatory for everyone to take a drivers test every decade, at the minimum. ",

            "Medic here:\n\nI can tell some of you have never had to meet a deceased 23 year old's parents next to the car their kid just died in because they were \"t-boned\" by a guy (somewhere in his early to mid 80s) with dementia that forgot which pedal was on what side and accelerated through a red light and into a highway causing the 23 year old's car to roll off of the overpass. Police said later that he mistook meds and was hopped up on his pain meds as well, because he had misplaced his glasses and couldn't read the label. He lives with his wife and daughter. Not sure where they were during that. \n\nYou can debate the \"but grandpa needs to get around\" all you want, but it's putting more risk out there than needs to exist. This family's \"poor ole gramps\" killed a girl. \n\nAnd before anyone mentions it, yes I know other things cause crashes like that, no I don't think this wasn't of a clinically innocent cause, and yes I feel as much resentment towards drunk drivers, people on their phones while driving, and the idiot that was doing her makeup while driving when she hit my brother on his bike. \n\nIf things were my way, we'd test everyone more often. There's a whole branch of stupidity out there doing 55+ mph that needs to be managed. ",
            "why limit it to elderly people? i think /everybody/ should have to take an actual physical driving and vision test every certain number of years. doing it once a year would just be stupid, but every 5-7 years doesn't seem too unreasonable to me.",

            "I\u2019m a medical student and my attending physician gave me a report to do on this once. I\u2019m not sure how it works in the rest of the country but in PA, a doctor can recommend/condemn an elderly individual for a loss of licensure for driving if the physician feels that the patient is a threat to society. Driving habits are supposed to be asked about during a routine physical exam encounter and based on patient\u2019s response, the doctor proceeds accordingly.\n\nThis is a huge can of worms cuz it\u2019s just another debate of where we draw the line between safety and liberty.",
            "It's not a right to drive, its a privilege, and more pressing, a weapon. You need to be in peak health to drive otherwise you shouldn't fucking drive - it's just that simple! I don't want a family member of mine dying because granny got in the car and took a joy ride ",
            "Yes.\n\nWhen we were both 13, my best friend and a friend of his were hit by a car while skateboarding in a residential area. He died shortly after the accident, and his friend was pronounced dead a few days later after it was determined that he would not be coming out of the coma the accident put him in. The man who hit them was 84 years old and, as far as the investigation was concerned, not speeding or doing anything that might compromise his ability to drive a car safely. Why, then, did he accidentally strike and kill two young boys at a speed of 30 miles an hour? Perhaps something stemming from his age compromised his ability to drive safely; perhaps it was. But if it was, and he had received some sort of screening to determine whether or not he was safe behind the wheel of a car, maybe one of the closest people to me would still be alive ten years later.",
            "I've been saying it for years:\n\nOnce you hit 65 you should have to retake the road test every 2 years. \n\nGrandma been half blind since  '99 and still out here on the road smh",
            "YES. Of course, why is this a debate? I see so many old people really unable to drive a car normally",
            "Yes, but shouldn't everybody need one every so often?\n\nI know a lot of people whose driving skills have gotten worse as they age, all of which refuse to acknowledge it. The best example I've seen recently being an elderly gentleman who was driving down the wrong side of a divided highway and hit another motorist head-on. My parents attempted to stop him but were unsuccessful because they didn't want to drive the wrong way and cause even more risk. I wasn't there personally but spoke with them immediately afterwards. They stopped at the scene and were told by the cops that both parties were probably not going to make it and that they shouldn't even look at the wreckage because that's how gruesome it was. I felt bad for the old man even though I didn't really know him because he didn't know he was doing anything wrong. However, I feel worse for the person whose car he collided with, because they really weren't doing anything wrong and probably died. I didn't follow up to find out, but it did NOT look good.\n\n**TLDR;** Elderly friend of family was driving down the wrong side of the road and unknowingly causes deadly collision.",
            "How about everybody do a road test every five years? Why single out the elderly? People age at different rates.

            "Everyone should have to do this at some interval. An eye test simply isn't enough.\n\nThe main issue with people getting older isn't their vision, it is their ability to react and hit the brakes quickly."

            "I\u2019m on day 25 of working at a closed zoo.  I work with great apes, and their behavior has changed a bit.  They are generally very interactive with the public, so they are seeking even more attention than usual from us.  \n\nSome of them were suspicious at first of the overwhelming silence outside now.  They were climbing up high and scanning the area looking for everyone.\n\n*Edit* I forgot to mention the wild animals.  We are in a much larger park, and wild animals wander in all the time, but always scatter when the crowds roll in.  Now, there\u2019s bucks just walking around, raccoons and foxes out in the middle of the day.  And the squirrels... my god, the squirrels.",
            "Most of our animals are happy as long as we can keep their routines, feeding times etc. For some they need a little extra. We do public encounters with our koalas, wombats and snakes among others so we spend an hour or so a day cuddling and handling these animals to keep them happy. A few of hour koalas really fret if they don't get their cuddles. Otherwise we just try to continue to spend time with animals that are expecting human interaction and of course we can take things for walks around the place like I'm sure you've seen at other zoos. Our wombats love a run and sniff, dingoes as well.\n\nEDIT: Thanks all for the interest, questions and remarks. Thanks also for the awards. I don't work at Australia zoo for those of you asking, I do live on kangaroo island and our facility is pretty easy to find with some light searching.\nIt is a privilege to work with wildlife each and every day and it's something I take very seriously, but still appreciate the jokes and humour from everyone. If you have specific questions it's perhaps best to DM me (rip inbox) otherwise they'll probably get lost in the comments. Thanks again.",
            "For a lot of our animals, having the ability to interact with guests is actually extremely important. Even for primates to be able to play with kids through the glass, they are missing out on a lot of enrichment. Guests keep a lot of the monkeys entertained. I watch our guests all day long show our marmosets and capuchins selfie cameras and they LOVE to see their reflection. Guests will also show videos on their phones to animals and the monkeys totally enjoy it. \n\nWe have a rescue cockatoo named Row who sings \u201crow row row your boat\u201d to guests. When little kids dance and sing it to her, she gets really excited and feeds off their energy. So do our other cockatoos on exhibit. But now without guests to show off for, every now and then when it\u2019s quiet we\u2019ll hear her start \u201crow row row...\u201d and then she stop and huffs a bit and gets really quiet and sad because she has no one to sing to. Some of our animals REALLY miss having kids to show off for. \n\nYou also have to remember that animals in zoos for the most park have grown up totally accustomed to being around people 24/7. They\u2019re not wild animals at all really. They\u2019ve grown up in a very different social dynamic. Quite a few animals get noticeably depressed in the winter months every year when we have few guests, and then perk up in the spring when we get busy.\n\nEdit: In case anyone wants to see Row here\u2019s a video a person found floating around on the internet of her! \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js71vm_43nw",

The keepers now have to pay them more attention to and they also do stuff like hide food for them as a game\nAlso: sorry for the confusion, I am not a Zookeeper myself but I live close by the zoo and it was in the local news and such :)",

            "I'm an aquarium keeper, and I've certainly noticed a change. Fish are not as stressed as they use to be, as there are no longer children stomping around and banging on glass screaming \"NEMO, NEMO, ITS NEMO\" at every clownfish.  We brought some of our younger penguins down to let them watch the fish, and they were intrigued but confused as to why they couldn't catch them through the glass.  Our octopus has become much more friendly as well, and instead of hiding all day from people, enjoys playing with small baby toys or solving food puzzles.  Its been nice. I wish there were guidelines people had to sign to behave at zoos before entering, but at the same time, they are the lifeline we so desperately need to keep functioning.\n\nEDIT: This post has gotten more love than any other post I have ever made, so I'm going to capitalize on it. Now more than ever, zoos and zoo animals need your help.  I understand that it is a time of financial disparity for a lot of people, myself included.  But we as humans will be fine and overcome this.  Those who cannot are the species we help to conserve at AZA accredited facilities.  Without people having interest in wildlife, zoos themselves could now face extinction.  If you have a local zoo, or a zoo you just adore, please, donate.  Something as small as a pizza for the keepers of your favorite animals, or a donation the price of general admittance, all the way up to buying a membership or making a significant donation, goes so far to help us stay employed and caring for all our individuals.  We are doing our best during this crisis to bring you the best experience we can so you can social distance, too.  If you like what you see and have the ability, you can be sure that your donation is appreciated by every single keeper working through this time.",
            "I'm late to the thread, so I'm sure this will get buried, but I work for a very large, very busy AZA zoo.\n\n I work with the ambassador animals, so they are animals that are very used to the public. Pretty much like what everyone else has said, the animals are mostly confused that there aren't any people.  Our petting zoo animals in particular are super needy. The second they see or hear us they all come running over and start crying for attention. We're trying to give all the animals as much attention as possible, but we're down to a bare bones crew, so it's not as much as we would like. \n\nWhat I wanted to add, though, because I think it's incredibly interesting, is that we are collecting fecal samples from some of the animals to be tested for cortisol levels, which is a pretty good indicator of stress levels. That way, when guests come back, we can take samples for comparison to see how much guests impact stress. \n\nI think its really cool that we're taking this opportunity to see what we can learn about how guests impact the animals, and to see if there are potentially things we can do even better to improve the lives of the animals in our care. We were really hoping to do some behavioral studies too about things like activity levels, amount of the enclosure being utilized, etc. that are also important considerations for their welfare, but unfortunately we just don't have the time or staffing.",
            "My girlfriend is a zookeeper and animal behaviorist. She says their animals are becoming stressed. One of their African Grey birds has been plucking his own feathers. \n\nShe also mentioned that because they can\u2019t touch many of the animals due to the virus potentially spreading to another zookeeper, many of the animals are looking and acting depressive, not eating well, etc.",
            "Theres a bit of a balance of different behaviours that is kinda interesting. With no visitors there is more time for enrichment, to get more creative with said enrichment, trialing new things, and exposure to enrichment that has to be supervised which the animals are loving. Then there are certain animals that do seem to miss having public around - our younger (<5 years old) African Penguins are really seeming to miss being able to swim at the glass and interact with people. Higher intelligence animals we have had to come up with new interactions, lots of new training going on because they are \"missing\" the variety and variability of interactions with the public. \n\nThe snakes don't give a fuck though.",

            "My wife works at the gift shop for our zoo and the other day we had to go move some stuff around in the store because due to some heavy rains, it had flooded a bit. \n\nOf course we took a lap around the empty park (other than the keepers and few maintenance workers) and found that all the animals were really active and playful. A lot of them seemed really curious about us too. I\u2019m sure they get used to seeing crowds every day and were starving for attention.",
            "As a zookeeper coordinator I\u2019ve been working at the now closed zoo almost every day for the past month. Animals that are free roaming (peacocks, iguanas) are more active, and follow keepers around like they usually do with visitors. Most of the others don\u2019t show much change in behavior. Although birds like swans and flamingoes are using the edges of their habitats more.",

            "I work on an activity farm. There is a 22 year old Shire horse. He acts like a dick when there are customers around. With no customers, he's actually still a dick. That being said, he's still awesome.\n\nEdit: I've been asked what he does when there are customers. Basically, if he sees any customer feeding any other animal in the large barn where he hangs out in the day, he will stare at them and stomp his front hoof on the ground. That guarantees they look at him. If they don't immediately come over to feed him, he will start kicking the heavy metal bars that divide his area and the pen next door. This makes one hell of a noise. And he will keep it up, all whilst staring at the person with the food. If they feed him then he rewards them by slobbering all over their hands as he takes the food. Also, at the end of the day he is really good at telling the time. He knows when we close and what time he should be released from the barn and taken to the field/stables where he spends the night. If he isn't let out bang on time he starts kicking the shit out of the gate at the back of his pen. This is a big metal gate and it sounds like someone playing a giant glockenspiel with a sledgehammer. He will keep this up until it is opened.\n\nSome customers are just scared to hand feed him. He is massive and his mouth is big enough to easily fit someone's hand in. Some customers come up to me with their bag of food and ask me if I will feed him, because \"He keeps staring at me but I'm a bit too nervous to feed him\". I happily oblige. I love that ornery old bastard.",

            "Horse trainer/Barn manager here. My farm has 46 horses, about half are privately owned and boarded with us. Like most farms across the country we are completely shut down to all but essential staff. The horses are mostly pretty happy to eat, hang out, and do horse things. We keep our horses turned out 24/7, which helps them remain healthy, happy, moving, and socializing. They are starting to lose muscling at this point, with being worked/ridden. Months or years of conditioning just disappearing by the day. But it will come back once they are all in work again. But I can tell that they are missing human interaction. My personal riding horse was giving me the cold shoulder yesterday, probably because of the lack of attention. I have been trying to give the boarded horses extra attention, I am sure their owners are missing them terribly right now. They all seem to lean in a little more when I brush them these days.\n\nEdited to add the customary thank you to the kind Redditor fir the award. My first! It made my day, neigh, my week.

            "Finally a thread I can answer! \n\nNot a whole lot of change, but animals definitely missing out some enrichment of seeing guests, especially the otters that follow the kids in the glass under water. Takin, Maned wolves, bison, gibbons, BoPs, Lions, etc all are about the same.  Some of our animals that are skittish have been standing closer to the fence where guests usually are (zebras, gazelle) which is nice. \n\nIt's kinda this weird balance of being both more and less stressed. On the one side, I don't have to worry about keeper talks or BTS tours and I have more time to get everything done and spend more time with animals. On the other side we're skeleton crewed and there's less of us to care for the whole zoo so I'm working a lot more in areas I don't usually cover as often. \n\nThere's one kangaroo that still tries to box me while the emu is shifting \ud83d\ude44\nThe one peacock still really doesn't like taking his medications of course \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \n\n\nI have noticed that the crows in the city are behaving a bit differently as well and are being a lot braver lol",

More work for those of us still there, but the animals are all still getting top-notch care. We\u2019ve been able to take them out to new places they don\u2019t get to when guests are around. Like taking our porcupine to the manatee building and walking a cheetah past the rhinos. I think it\u2019s fun for them, but I haven\u2019t seen any animals acting differently.",
            "The majority of our display birds could care less, however our birds that do flights outside or routinely meet guests and do more interactive behaviors with the public have definitely noticed and they are not cool with their being no guests around. Of course I can only guess, and while this is a bit anthropomorphic, I dont think they understand the change and seem somewhat hesistant to enter a new environment (to them) as we try to maintain their behavioral skills. One of the macaws who is also excited to fly is now always looking around. Pretty sure she expects for 50 to 100 people to be watching her.",

Horseshoe crabs don't notice or care which is expected but the whitespotted bamboo sharks are also not really changing their behaviour really either which is good to see.

            "Well I'm currently stuck at home for the time being, but I've been in touch with some coworkers. Ultimately, the changes in behavior vary depending on how conscious each animal was of the guests to begin with, so for many there isn't too much change. Most of our exhibits are open during the winter when no one regularly visits so a lot of them are used to periods where guests don't arrive, just not at this time of year. I'm sure our Orangutans and some of the other apes have noticed because they love to people watch and interact with the guests but they are used to slow periods already. As for who is affected the most, I would say the geese around the zoo are probably the most upset by the change since there aren't any scraps around to steal.\n\nThat said, while our animals are still doing well, the biggest thing to worry about right now is funding. For many zoos, this time of year is critical for making money that will go to feed and supply our animals with the care they need for the year to come. With these closings, many zoos are likely to be struggling, especially if this continues. Meanwhile, many zoos are trying to find ways to interact and inform guests even still during this crisis. I recommend everyone take the time to check out their local zoo to see what streams or activities are being made available and please make sure to donate if you can. A donation at a time like this can really help our animals.",

",
            "In this thread: thousands of amateur money launderers that would be caught almost immediately IF these bills are marked and the serial numbers are being monitored. Paying for your bar tab or gas money with $100 bills that were from a bank robbery won't help you because those businesses will deposit them that night, the bank will scan them, alert the authorities, and they'll easily trace it back. The fact that you need to do this with 7500 bills makes it much easier.\n\nThe obvious answer here is to declare it and pay taxes, but that's boring. Let's assume we want to NOT pay taxes and keep as much of it as possible, without getting caught or killed.\n\nMy first priority would be to put it somewhere safe that wasn't connected to me and then figure out what to do. So make sure that there's no GPS tracker or anything in the bag, and then stash it in a storage space that I paid for with other cash. Even this I'd be careful about though, as I'm sure people keep all kinds of illegal shit in storage spaces. Don't want to draw attention.\n\nThen, maybe I'd try and figure out if they were watching for this cash. Maybe drop a few bills at friend's businesses or yard sales, and see if anyone turns up to question them.\n\nIf not, maybe ramp this up, but at some point it would seem fairly safe to just spend the money as cash over decades and not worry too much about getting caught. Would be much better to do it at different places, while traveling, etc, so that if you're wrong it's not easy to trace back to you.\n\nAssuming the bills are being monitored though, I think an overseas swap for crypto is probably the best option. Still pretty risky in that you need to bring the cash to a swap, which is a good place to get caught or killed, but maybe you can hire some attorneys and private security to help you facilitate the transaction. \n\n As far as getting it to another country, I'd go with a sailboat. Lots of people own sailboats and use them to sail around the world, and customs is unlikely to be carefully searching a boat that's leaving the US.\n\nI don't know, not a master criminal.",

Leave it alone for a while, then come back to it.  \"I've been thinking about it for a long time and I've decided to go to culinary school.  Any suggestions?\".  In the meantime, start your own blog about food - recipes, you cooking etc.\n\nWhile doing all this, continue to work your day job and pay off all your credit, loans etc.  You need a good credit score for later on.\n\nEventually you post that you've found a school and may not be able to post regularly, but will update your readers about what happens, what you learn, etc.\n\nGO TO COOKERY SCHOOL\n\nWhen you graduate, you will be credit free and should have a high credit score.  Naturally the next course of action is for you to open a  restaurant of your own.  You use your credit score to get a mortgage on a restaurant space with good footfall.  Open up, advertise and start cooking for real paying customers.\n\nThere will be nights when you dont have enough customers to cover each table.  Thats fine.  Grab some money from under the bed and run a few orders through the register.  Nothing extravagant, just a good meal for two people, a bottle of decent wine and maybe a few beers.  Payment in cash and a nice tip.  That money is now clean.  Deposit it in your register and then in your bank whenever you decide to do your banking runs.  Dont do this every time you have spare covers to fill, maybe just once or twice a week or so.\n\nPay the appropriate amount of tax or the IRS will go all Liam-Neeson-in-Taken on your ass.\n\nBest thing about this?  That money is freshly laundered and untraceable, you learned a valuable life skill and have a good chance at a decent restaurant to keep you in good money thereafter.",

Social sciences, psychology, human sciences, astronomy,  PC game development, philosophy and much more. It'd feel almost like I've gained another life, in this game that's ironically called life too. \n\nOh, and since the op says \"from now\", I may as well study more effectively for my internal examinations, as I am having a hard time doing so otherwise x)",

My professional life is jam-crammed full of smiling at people and pretending to give a shit and just generally making sure I have what I call my \"customer service mask\" on at all times. That mask is heavy, and it's exhausting to have to wear it.\n\nIf I'm by myself, I'm on my own schedule. I don't have to smile if I don't want to. I don't have to small talk. If I could live in a tiny cabin in the woods somewhere in the middle of nowhere New England, just me and my dog (and some goats and chickens), I would gladly grow old and die there. \n\nMy husband is literally the only person I've ever met that doesn't drain my \"battery\", so to speak. He can stay with me and my animals in my New England hermit cabin. Everyone else can go fuck right off.",

Whenever I was with people stress would fill my mind and gave me a little stutter, made my lisp\nreally bad and in general made me really upset. One day I realised that it was likely the people I was spending time with. They were very much more popular, shallow people who would dismiss you if you had a small arse or ugly face. So I went to go to talk to some old friends from primary and other people who weren't so popular and ended up making friends with them. Most of them are still some of my best friends now. When talking to them my stutter and lisp disappeared like magic and I found myself having a lot more fun with them being less stressed out. My confidence was also boosted. Now I would class myself as extroverted and having an all around better life\nAlso, using social media like Instagram and Snapchat looking at other people fucks you up and makes you really self-conscious. I now just use it to message friends and look at pok\u00e9mon stuff :)\n\nTL;DR popular people are often bitches talk to less popular people and your life will be so much better and not focused on physical appearance. Also fuck selfies",

            "When my oldest daughter introduced her first serious boyfriend, he was an awkward kind of guy, was pretty unremarkable, but he got super animated about topics that interested him.

Pretty sure she has been dating her for a couple years. She's angry, contrary, and bitter. Under all that baggage it's hard to tell, but I'm hoping that my home can be a place where she can just let whatever angers her so much disappear for a while and I can find out who she actually is. I've asked a good friend of my daughter's if there's ever been any signs of violence, as that's my only real concern, but so far it seems fine on that front. My youngest has always been a bit more subdued and contemplative than my others, so I'm hoping that whatever bitterness is in her girlfriend's life doesn't hurt her. This relationship is the most concerning one to me, because my daughter is a very sensitive person, and I fear for her happy, cheerful spirit.\n\n\nEdit: thanks for the silver and gold, kind strangers :)",

He told us they were refugees from haiti who moved to the us to better thier lives. He said his family one day just decided to move from our state to the other side of the country. We all would ask questions but he would just shut up. It was troubling but he was polite, seemed kind. He called me mom he was visiting everyday. Then my daughter turned 18 and they moved in together. I felt it was too soon but she thought she was in love.\n\nHe was still his nice quiet self in front of our family. My daughter began telling me he didn't want to cook or clean and just wanted to play PS4 while she worked full time. I told her to keep talking to him about how she was becoming unhappy. He would make her promises but continue to do what he was doing. She worked graveyards so he would say he worked during the day and she'd believe him. She had a puppy who he agreed to look after and clean up for as a shared responsibility. He wasn't doing this at night when she was at work or when he was off.\n\nShe had an opportunity to go to Disneyland for a week as a babysitter for her little cousins. After making sure her he was ok with it she went. She got home a day early to surprise her dog on his birthday. She found him lethargic with no food or water and no ac on In the hot az weather. She broke up with her boyfriend then and there. She said her dog was like her son and she wasn't going to stand for that type of neglect. \n\nI picked her up and her exboyfriend followed her out. He was polite telling me to not let her leave him I told him to give it a few days.

She said 'no as long as he's with you I know he will be well taken care of\". Her words made me joke with her and ask if she was going to run away or something she just laughed and called me silly.\n\nShe kept in contact with me and at noonish asked me to get her. We went and there was no answer. It sounded like the apartment was empty. We called the cops they did a wellness check 5 hours later after we begged and begged. We had searched everywhere and called everyone she knew but they both had disappeared.\n\nWe kept going back to the apartment hoping wherever they went they had come back but still nothing. A neighbor brought me a chair to sit to wait outside the apartment until she came. I sat staring at one point on the wall as long as I sat there. I had a fear so primal and deep it slowed down my thought process. Another neighbor came to me and said she heard we were looking for my daughter. What she said next made my blood run cold. She said \"I saw your daughter around 1230 or 1 her boyfriend was kicking her and dragging her by the hair into the apartment.\"\n\nI called 911 again because I knew whatever we found in the apartment was not something we would want to see. The 911 operator didn't believe me even after I let her talk to the neighbor.\n\nWe broke the window and i climbed in. I found my precious beautiful sweet amazing loving daughter surrounded in blood. She had been strangled and stabbed in the throat. \n\n\nThe spot where I had been staring all day was the spot my daughter was killed at on the other side of the wall. He had killed her before we got there and she bled out in minutes.\n\nThe kind guy who called me mom was really a monster underneath it all. He has no remorse. I was in disbelief and felt a misunderstanding had happened. I went and saw him once he turned himself in two days later. He said he did it because he couldn't live without her.\n\n\nNever let your loved ones be alone when they are breaking up or going to meet someone they just broke up.

You've likely had experience with them bringing over someone from the \"wrong crowd\" and this is honestly not that different. It's all about how you see them treat others but since they're probably teenagers, you can't read too much into things like what they want to do when they grow up and so on. I'd hope by your 40's or whatever you'd know enough about how to tell if someone's head is screwed on properly or not...\n\nIt's still important to let them explore and learn the odd rough lesson on their own - you constantly weighing in on how much you disapprove of their SO only drives them further to them. Although you don't want to be too late to interfere if things are getting a little too out of control - like that dad who killed his daughter's boyfriend for getting her into hard drugs and ruining her life, don't let it get there.\n\nAt the end of the day, no one can get them to break up except themselves. They have to learn what's best for them and figure it out on their own. Don't meddle *too* much...",

The girl pup insists on being the center of attention and greets every visitor with unabandoned glee - jumping, licking, tail wagging - you get it.  \n\nOn rare occasions, we noticed her behavior with a new visitor would be drastically different:  after a brief initial greeting, she will back up a few feet, appear hyper alert and bark continuously in a much higher tone like a high, panicky shrill.  She avoids all contact with this person. We used to shrug/laugh off these interactions off as a \"one off\" but when she reacted the same way over and over with the same few visitors, we started to take notice.  Over time, every one of those friend visitors turned out to not be \"friend worthy\" by our kids in one way or another within a few months.  \n\nSo now, we don't worry about it.

I want to see them try to engage with us because they know it's important to my kid.  If they're trying, and even failing, that's ok.  Just let me see you want to be polite and friendly.  If they come in and are rude to the siblings, see that everyone clears their plates but they don't want to, try to be dominant when it really isn't needed.... That's not a good sign.  \n\nYou can be awkward and shy AF and I'll love you as long as you try your best.

People physically covering up self-harm or psychologically covering up depression. Also sometimes track marks.\n\n4. People feeling unmotivated to wear bras or something more formal.\n\nEDIT: What I believe we've concluded here is that if you know someone who persistently wears hoodies, sweatshirts, or long sleeve tees when it's inappropriate for the weather, think about checking in with them to make sure they're okay. The only innocent (ASD is still a problem, and they might also need to be checked on because social isolation/comorbidity) one of these reasons is no. 4, except if it happens regularly, it could be a symptom of depression.

            "Time spent with my kids.\n\nPre-pandemic I would leave the house 5 days a week at 6:15am to commute to the office,  usually before anyone else in my house is awake. And I'd get home most evenings just in time to put them to bed. I'll never go back to that. The past 8 months I've actually seen my boys grow up in front of my eyes and I get lots of quality time with them every day, even with work from home.\n\nI know now what i was missing.",

            "My marriage.\n\nMy wife and I had to work from home together (separate jobs) from March until September when she had to go back to the office.  I am still working from home.  During this time, we became increasingly closer.  I have heard so many stories of marital problems being caused by Covid.  I literally miss my wife everyday she has to go to work.\n\nI meet her at the door like a fucking puppy.  They say absence makes the heart grow fonder.  Sometimes forced proximity does too.",

            "Most of the mom and pop stores in my town are gone forever. Some of these stores I grew up with, the nickle arcade, the tiny French bakery my aunt took us to when we got good grades, the only ramen shop open after 10PM, my favorite donut shop, the fancy British tea shop I never had a good date in but many London Fogs that were utterly perfect, the only dim sum place, the handmade mochi and tea shop, the only cigar shop in town to get fancy cigars... \n\nI lament the death of all these tiny businesses I took for granted. I always thought they'd be around. Now my community is left with just brand named box stores, no more originality and flavor. Just closed skyrise buildings surrounded by a garishly lit Denny's, Olive Garden, and Target.",

            "Working in an office, particularly in Japan.\n\nI live in Japan. Going to the office and spending all day here is a deep cultural tradition. Asking your manager at a traditional Japanese company to work from home regularly is on par with asking them \"Hey I just realized I'm Dragonkin, can you please work with the cafeteria to put live cats on the menu?\", you would get the same reaction. Even in cases of personal illness or family emergency.\n\nSo many companies here, even in the early COVID days, flat out publicly said \"Hah, no, we will NEVER be doing that 'work from home' thing, sorry. That's laughably na\u00efve.\"\n\nThen, the country issued a \"Declaration of National Urgency\" (not an actual Emergency, as that would entitle the govt to be actually accountable to the livelihoods of the people, just a very strong arm public stance and shaming businesses into following suit). Literally those same companies issuing the statements above were scrambling the next week to get their staff safely working from home, online, using remote meeting tools, etc.\n\nSo, that was a big game-changer. Still, everyone was thinking, \"Once the urgency order is lifted, we'll all be going back to work as normal\". Well, the urgency order lasted a few months. And those traditional Japanese businesses saw what happened to their bottom lines when they no longer had to pay for electricity, heating/AC, cleaning, office equipment and maintenance, subsidized travel expenses to/from work, soft items like coffee and snacks, etc... and so many of them now are singing the praises of a \"sensible work from home policy\" and planning for even long-term work-from-home options.\n\nNow the society is changing very rapidly to accomidate working from home. More people recently are less looking at buying their first house/apartment in crowded Tokyo outskirts/close cuburbs, and looking more to buying 1-2 hours away in the boonies where land is actually affordable and living is better.\n\nIt's watching a sociological essay/study unfold, live, in slow-motion.",

            "Movies, unfortunately. Cinema specifically. I'm sure a lot of production companies will take enormous losses or possibly file bankruptcy as no one is paying to go see movies anymore. The other issue being that no one can really *make* movies at the moment either. Travel bans all over, logistic issues, actors not able to be within close proximity to one another, and then all the post-production work that, for the most part **can't** be done from home.
