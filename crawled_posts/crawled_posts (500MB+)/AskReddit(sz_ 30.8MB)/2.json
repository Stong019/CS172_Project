That's just a thing you built up when you were younger to give yourself a stable identity and core values.\n\nThe you now is just as real as the you then. We all adapt to our surroundings and change to make our lives easier. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that.\n\nIf you're unhappy with your life now, you can adapt by changing. You need to believe that, and you probably know it since it seems to be something you're afraid of. But this is the real you now, and you need to focus on the needs of that person, not some idealized phantom from the past.",
            "Best advice I have is this: When we experience things, we make 'maps' of what happened. We all have maps of our time in school, how people treat us, all of our experiences. We also make maps about other people, we make assumptions about others based on what we see or hear. We get maps from others about us too, especially friends and parents. What they tell us we are, what we think they see when they look at us, what we think they think about us, etc etc etc.\n\nPeople tend to focus on maps, and label themselves, pigeonhole themselves into roles and what they think they should do, feel, or be based on the maps that they have.\n\nYou are not a map. You are a 3D terrain of whatever beautiful biome you want to be. Don't stare at a map all day and forget too look up at what it really is.\n\nEdit: holy cow, ty for medals.

I ended up finishing the degree I didn't want because I was so close. \n\nI ended up moving 1000 miles away after graduation, I have a job I love, which gives amazing benefits and they will even completely pay for me to go back to school if I want, so I might try that soon.",

I kept going to church, volunteering, trying to find new hobbies, considering people to date, etc. Eventually I began to realize which kinda of things and people I cared about.\n\n Within my friend group I started gradually lowering my filter and saying more of what I thought, gauging reactions and then instead of changing my filter, I shifted who I would spend more time with.\n\nIt really sounds trivial, and it is, but all you can really do is try to be yourself even if you don't know who that is.

They're all different, and you're never going to be good enough for all of them. \n\nThe only person that has to live with you 24/7, is YOU. So the best thing you can do is be good enough for YOU.

            "I had this feeling for all my life after puberty.\n\n\nThere were these high ideals that I always maintained and couldn't live up to them. Mostly because they were about saving the world and unattainable things like that. I spent an absurd amount of my teenage years studying philosophy and religion rather than dealing with teenage social issues like my peers. Ever since I was a kid, I had this goofy side though. When I wasn't pulling my hair out reading about semiotics, I would write silly stories to make people laugh.\n\nWhen I went to college, things changed. I began exhibiting some really dangerous behavior patterns, especially for someone with a huge conscience like myself. The line between my public and private life got larger. I began feeling I could no wrong. I don't really want to list some of the things I did here because of shame. But suffice it to say, you would have all hated college me.\n\nI'm going to skip to the end and just say this all got worse until I woke up one day and all my lightheartedness was gone. I was working a high paying meaningless job. I'd cheated on everyone I dated and thrown away every romantic relationship, some very painfully.\n\nMy life had become all about money, sex, and status.\n\nThe biggest epiphany of my life was realizing two things.\n\nOne, everyone goes through some form of this. We all try on different faces. If we find one that doesn't fit, we still tend to cling to it so that we don't have to change our current comfort level. This phase is normal and human.\n\n\nTwo, I was bipolar. Manic. My post puberty life was punctuated by periods of unbelievable energy and increasingly risky behavior. It put me on top - there were years where I had fans. I got up on stage and gave speeches and made people laugh and was the center of attention. And later it landed me in jail because the center cannot hold.\n\nBut with that diagnosis I finally was able to figure out my history and why I could never live up to those ideals. Because grandiosity is a textbook manic symptom too.\n\nThese days I don't push myself to do any more than love my family and enjoy the little things. I've lived more than most people do in a lifetime. I deserve a rest, at least for a little while.\n\nSorry this is so long.\n\n\nThe answer is that the normal cycle is to lose yourself for a little while and then find yourself again. Everyone has an existential crisis to some degree. You have to trust that this is normal and your real self is always there waiting for your return.\n\nHow you return, that will be unique. A death in the family, jail, overdose, failed relationship, financial loss, you name it. Something has to touch you deeply and it will happen. In the natural course of things we all take a big hit sooner or later.\n\n\nI don't like to generalize but the 20s are a time when people tend to drift away from themselves. After that it's really anyone's guess when you'll come back.\n\nBut since you're asking this question, I say it will be sooner than later for you.",
            "When one is so lost, so down the rabbit hole, surrounded by a fluid and dangerous environment, things stripped away and reconstructed in response to others, how can one tell what is real at all, let alone what is really you?\n\nSometimes, with the slipstream whipping away artiface and tears, I get a glimpse.  More I see how autistic I am, and how effectively adapted.  How my mother contoured my life.  How I have been loved, and how I have loved.  \n\nBut what is \"me\"?

            "I moved every couple years as a kid, it was always hard to remember who I really was since it felt like there were a bunch of different versions of me depending on where I was living. It was like I wasn't really just one person, but just a bunch of different versions of me. It's something I still struggle with, but spending more time alone has helped a lot. Also I don't see myself moving again any time soon since I'm in college, so I'm taking advantage of this time to really figure out my character. \n\nI didn't even realize how little I knew who I was until a friend asked about what my life was like before college, and I couldn't come up with just one answer. Instead of being my full self wherever I went, I adapted to the culture I was immersed in, and then got ready to change again once we moved to the next place. It was hard as a kid, but I was always pretty happy no matter where I was, and now I have time to settle down a little bit.",

We all have a core but have to put on layers as we get older and go through life's challenges. \n\nFor me, I have always been playful, curious as hell, mischievous, persuasive, imaginative, and a dreamer.

            "People are a conglomeration of many different things. And our history, our situation, our knowledge all changes us and will continue to change us. I can say I'm a brave person. I can also say I'm cowardly. They're opposites and yet I'm both, depending on my situation and how I'm feeling in the moment. People aren't static, they're dynamic. We are all who we are in the moment. Who we are in the moment depends on a variety of different factors. But I am not who I have been, and I'm not who I will be. I am me. And the only me that matters and the only one I truly am is right now. Am I irritable and short tempered right now? Then that's who I am. Am I determined, motivated, and disciplined right now? Then I'm that person. Who I was yesterday isnt who I am today. And I wont be the same tomorrow, or even an hour from now. You are right now. Embracing it in this way gives me the ability to change who I am in the moment. \"I'm a coward right now. But I dont want to be a coward, I want to be brave,\" and you realize you can be. Because past you doesnt matter, present you does. If present you wants to be different, then be different. Chances are, you'll want to be a different person in the future, and that's okay. Humans are made to adapt.\n\nLook at things like horoscopes or zodiac signs. The descriptions are so vague that the people who believe in them partly buy into it because, chances are, they exert those qualities at least some of the time.

Sometimes the \"real you\" may go ignored, because of protective ways you have learned to cope with the world. \n\nAfter all, listening to and being the \"real you\" is exposing the core of yourself to the world - the good, the bad and the ugly. Sometimes we have got so used to protection our true selves, our true self doesn't get a look in.\n\nThis can also create a disconnect. Because we are hiding the \"real us\", we grow discontent with ourselves. We know that we are not being authentic. We try to envision what we wish we could be, and because we are discontent, we may instead imagine an \"ideal self\". We view this \"ideal self\" as what we would be, if we just tried hard enough - if we didn't let petty things get in the way of being \"true to ourselves\" - but in reality, we are not the \"ideal self\".\n\nAnd it's often the straining to reach the idea of some kind of \"ideal self\" that prevents the \"real you\" from being appreciated, listened to, validated, honored. \n\nWe berate ourselves for not reaching that ideal.

I mean, my behaviours differ when I interact with different group of people, be if my nuclear families, my extended families, my school friends, friends I made during my degree, friends I made during my master, my colleagues, or even when meeting strangers. In a way, I\u2019m adapting to different social groups which makes it amusing when it happens that the two social groups know me in different context. Kinda like chameleon, I suppose. \n\nAt its core, my traits persist. How I approach a problem is still similar in nature. Ditto with my emotional reaction to stuffs.

            "Long ago, I read the book [Mother Night by Kurt Vonnegut](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9592.Mother_Night). It is a book about a man who has forgotten who he is, and has spent years (decades) adapting to surroundings but not being the real him. \n\nTo spoil the message (given in the prologue of the book), we are what we pretend to be, so we must be very careful about what we pretend to be. \n\nThis idea of a real/forgotten us is both an illusion to ourselves and irrelevant to the people around us. What you've done to adapt is who you really are. Even if it's just adapting, it's still the actions you take. It is how you respond to situations. What you do in these moments of adaptation are still your actions. \n\nThe moral of this book and the story it uses to tell it have helped me out a lot during episodes of existential angst, and for that, I highly recommend the book. In a meta-philosophical spin, I can interpret it as a call to live an authentic life. You haven't forgotten who you are by way of adapting, the real you has simply adapted to living in-authentically. This adaptation is an incredibly easy thing for humans to do, so it shouldn't be a cause for existential angst; at least, don't beat yourself up over it. \n\nMake a change. Any change. You are what you do, even if you are pretending, so do something that makes you happy, even if it's just a hobby.",

Not feeling like you know who you are, becoming detached from sense of identity and a lack of connection to your surroundings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy no means am I a doctor, but grounding techniques can help if you're feeling this way. Such as:  \n\n- Do something that causes physical sensations like holding an ice cube, touching something soft, or washing your face.\n- Say facts out loud, such as my name is ___ I am ___ years old and live in ____\n- Listen to familiar music that makes you comfortable, or turn on a movie you've seen often\n- Light incense or a candle and focus on the smell\n- Point out and focus on certain items in your immediate area\n\nI'm pretty late to this and it may get buried, but if you're experiencing any level of dissociation hopeful this can help.",
            "Lots and lots of self reflection. Ask yourself why you do *everything.* Look at your friends and ask yourself why you spend time with them.

Maybe even change your major. \n\nIf you still can\u2019t figure it out, look into the benefits of LSD/acid and see if you feel comfortable taking some.

            "This will most likely get burried alive, but here it goes anyhow.\n\nFirst of all sorry for formatting, on mobile and writing this on the way out the door to a Dr.  Appointment.\n\nI felt a little like that a few years ago.  I decided one day to start paying attention go the feeling you get in your gut when you express your beliefs.  \n\nIf you don't know what I'm talking about it's a philosophy thing.  Basically, you know that uneasy feeling you get in your stomach and heart area when you are arguing about politics with someone? You aren't supposed to feel that.  That feeling is only presant when you are just repeating something someone else said because it sounds good to you and you don't actually believe it.  You might think you agree with it but you didn't come to that understanding on your own and don't feel secure in what you are saying because there might be holes in the idea that you don't know about.  If you have made your own opinions without hearing them somewhere else first, (or at least you didn't start with a preformed openion.) You just won't feel that uneasiness at all.  It's truly enlightening to suddenly realize that most of your openions aren't actually you own.\n\nOnce you learn to pay attention to that feeling, you can start forming yourself based on what you really think about different stuff.  Now days I'm the kind of person who will be the only person in a whole room to say \"Wait, I don't think that's right.\". And the reason is there is so much less stress about being wrong or shunned because if that happens I will know that at least I had the courage and strength to stand up for what I believe in. \n\nAlso, I would like to say that I disagree with top comment guy.  If he just means that you adapt things like you dress and accent and what not, fine.  He's right in that case.  However, in my opinion you should NEVER allow yourself to be pressured into thinking something just because that's what a bunch of other people are saying.  If you do, then in that moment you have given up one more little piece of who you are.\n\nLastly, I used politics as an example in this because that's usually where people are most familiar with the feeling I'm talking about.  This feeling is part of many aspects of life.  If you've ever been unsure of what the old expression \"Trust your gut.\" Means, now you know.",

Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle, because the older you get, the more you need the people who knew you when you were young.\n\nLive in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard. Live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft. Travel.\n\nAccept certain inalienable truths: Prices will rise. Politicians will philander. You, too, will get old.

            "Honestly? \n\nIf you want more career satisfaction be as positive as possible at work. I mean it. I am cynical by nature and thought everyone around me loved my sarcastic one-off comments. Every meeting I would demonstrate biting wit at the ridiculous corporate bullshit being peddled. If there was failure I was there to point at it and laugh; and if success I was always there ready to \u201ckeep it real\u201d for folks. Apparently my attitude and sense of humor were not as appreciated as I thought.\n\nThen, disaster struck at work (a few years ago) and my skills were needed more than ever. \n\nNow mind you, I had been passed over a couple of times for promotions. I was salty about that because (and I am being honest here) I was a really really good candidate and am regarded quite well in my industry. I was stunned at missing out; and my dissatisfaction was not kept out of sight. \n\nWell back to the disaster. For some reason I took this opportunity to shut up and be a positive team member. This particular problem (not virus related) would have allowed me to sit at home, get paid, and do nothing while everything got sorted. A paid two week vacation without dipping into PTO\u2014nice. Let the suits sort it out while I laugh at their awkward attempts to right the ship; snickering with co-workers via personal emails. I was really looking forward to pointing out inconsistencies and ambiguous language in their directives. I was practically giddy with excitement with the prospect of watching them fall on their faces. \n\nInstead I put on my big boy pants, went to work, walked in the boss\u2019s office and politely asked if there was anything she needed. For two weeks I worked my ass off. Did everything I was asked, kept my pie hole shut (god were there opportunities for serious humor). I took a lot of initiative, and throughout I was positive and pleasant. At meetings I would offer constructive comments, take notes, and follow up on items\u2014even if I wasn\u2019t asked. I had become the dreaded \u201ctry-hard.\u201d Then the calls came: from every where in the organization. How do we do \u201cx.\u201d Can I do \u201cy.\u201d Mind you, in the past I would have provided a slightly sarcastic reminder of my \u201cscope\u201d of duties\u2014which didn\u2019t include doing their job too. Instead I was positive and cheerful. I was happy to help them get through the crisis. \n\nAfter the disaster subsided, I did not revert back to Mr. Point-Out-How-Stupid-Everything-Is, and kept a positive and cheerful demeanor. I kept my comments to myself, and went home and shared my list of comments I could have made with family. \n\nI noticed the more positive I became, the more people seemed to want to work with me; and the more responsibilities my boss heaped upon me. So I kept at it. And not one, but two promotions came (with significant raises)\u2014and now I am in a position that I really really enjoy. \n\nHad I only figured this out in my 20s I might have gotten where I am more quickly. One caveat, if your work is a suck-fest, don\u2019t be afraid to move on; with a positive farewell email and pointing out how much everyone meant to you...\n\nTL;DR: be more positive at work.",

Don't assume that you're going to find one single thing that you're passionate about and that it's going to be your career for the next forty to fifty years. \n   1. Hobbies aren't wastes of time. They can save your sanity, they can provide a second income, they can provide creative satisfaction, they are refuges of solace when the stress of your work day is threatening to break you.\n   2. Some hobbies turn into careers.\n   3. Be open to change. Changing careers doesn't mean you've wasted time with the first one. It means you're bringing all of that experience into a new line of work. That's a huge advantage over someone else at the same entry level, who is starting their first job and has never worked before.\n3. Stop worrying about getting old.\n   1. Do foolish (but legal) things. Laugh. Play. Dance like no one is watching, and apologize to those who were. Adulting is about handling your responsibilities. If those are handled (See #1 above and #4 below), you have earned the right to play. Act in theatre, learn to skateboard, pick up juggling, practice your Rick and Morty impersonations in the bathroom mirror until you're ready to do them in public. Do them in public.\n   2. Exercise. No, seriously. Work out. Get a personal trainer who will motivate you. Shop around. Figure out what you can afford. (See 1.2 above) Once you become fluent with fitness and have learned to listen to your own body, you can do it on your own. Don't assume you 'know how to work out' if you have never been guided before. You probably don't know. Like saving, it takes discipline and can seem pointless at first. When you get older, coming into it with a healthy body makes all the difference. \n4. Be kind. It's free. Being difficult will always cost you. Friends, jobs, opportunities, experiences. No one ever gets to their death bed and thinks, \"Wow, I wish I had been a bigger douchebag.\" If your life's narrative is that your boss is out to get you, your friends don't respect you, your family hates you, and that you just can't get a break... realize that the common denominator is you. Take responsibility. The older you get, the less tolerance everyone around you has for listening to you whine, and watching as you wait for life to hand you happiness in a gift-wrapped box. You are as happy as you choose to be.\n5. Remember these three things:\n   1. Courage is deciding there is something more important than being scared.\n   2. Given the options of risky growth and safe stagnation, choose growth every time.\n   3. Planning and preparation will overcome anxiety every time.",

Give yourself a non-negotiable 8 hour sleep opportunity every night. Ideally at the same time each night.\n7. Do not have kids outside of marriage\n8. Do not get married before age 23\n9. Learn about money, budgeting, debt, investing, finance, etc\n10. Read and study Marcus Aurelius Meditations, the Gregory Hays translation (978-0812968255)\n11. Read ALOT. Lots of non-fiction (history, biography, autobiography, philosophy, research-based psychology, etc)\n12. Constantly expose yourself to ideas and arguments you disagree with. Are you right-leaning? Expose yourself to lots of left-leaning ideas and arguments. Are you left-leaning? Expose yourself to lots of right-leaning ideas and arguments.\n13. Develop the skills of being punctual and organized. Being consistently late and disorganized is an ineffective way to go through life.\n14. Think very seriously about whether or not the time and money of a college degree is worth it for you. It might be. It might not be. But don\u2019t do it \u201cjust because.\"\n15. When choosing your job/profession/career, ignore the horrible life advice to \u201cfollow your passion.\u201d Instead, you should follow your aptitude. Identify what you are good at, find a way to use it to bring value to others, work like crazy to do that. The happiness/meaning/life satisfaction will come as a result of being able to build a good life for yourself and those you care about.\n16. Practice humility. Reality is complicated. The truth of the matter is that you probably don\u2019t know how to end war in the Middle East, end poverty, or solve any other of the world\u2019s problems.\u00a0\n17. If you live in the United States of America you should learn about guns. They are deeply embedded in our culture. If you are \u201cpro-gun\u201d you should understand the thing you support. If you are \u201canti-gun\u201d you should understand the thing you oppose so you can make intelligent arguments against it.\n18. Find a skill-based activity that you can work on and improve at over time. Piano, calligraphy, jiu-jitsu, golf, whatever. It's good for humans to have something they are constantly working on improving.\n19. Contempt is one of the most destructive emotions/attitudes there is. If you find yourself working for or with someone that has contempt for you and/or your work, be wary. Also be very mindful and cautious when contempt for someone else or what they do starts to arise in you.\n20. Don\u2019t blame things that are out of your control before you\u2019ve taken care of things that are under your control. As an example, if you are obese but also don\u2019t eat right, don\u2019t exercise, don\u2019t get good sleep, smoke, and drink too much alcohol, then don\u2019t blame genetics for your obesity. After you\u2019ve taken care of those other things, if you are still obese, then you can talk about your genetics.",

I would still feel the way the older one climbs into my lap when he's having a bad day. The blissful belly laugh of my infant is imprinted on my heart. And now those don't exist anymore.

By then, I'd probably come to the realization that I don't exist to her anyway, and any attempt to bombard her with my crazy would be abusive. \n\nEventually, I'd come to accept that it's all fake. I hope I wouldn't struggle with wondering if anything else is real. How do you know what to believe when 2/3 of your life was a fabrication of your own mind? The emotions would never go away. But I'm resilient enough to let the dream become a precautionary tale. I'd know what could go wrong with certain decisions, and the consequences would be much more real than any warning from someone else. I'd absolutely take a more determined career pathway.

            "I'd be happy. It's actually a wish to just wake up and see that nothing ever happened. I think about it daily.   \n\n\nRight at the end of grade 7, beginning of grade 8, my life went completely upside down. Parents divorced. Social workers and child services got involved. Police got involved. Years of therapy and counselling and psychologists. Moved around a lot. Mom took us to live in women shelters for a while. Problem is they didn't like me in the shelters cause I'm male and I would hear comments about how terrible I would grow up to be. Later on we had to use food banks. Lived in a cockroach infested run down townhouse. Had the power shut off several times. Mom, almost immediately, got remarried to a guy who was just as bad if not worse than my dad. Got beaten regularly by him. Nobody believed me and my siblings shunned me for it. Family moved across the country. Lost friends and family. Lost my chance at the education I wanted at a specific school. Years of stress and anxiety and abuse caused me to not be able to socialise properly, as well as made me have a difficult time learning making me fall behind. Tried to self teach for years but it only made things worse. Suffered from panic attacks for years where I would throw up daily for months on end. Any friends that I made just disappeared eventually, usually telling me to stop feeling sorry for myself, or get over it, people have it worse, ect ,ect. Just overall so much stuff to deal with over the last decade or two.  \n\n\nI do not feel good about living, do not feel good about anything that I do.

They both said they think weed should be legal and it's a waste of their time to go after pot smokers.\"\n\nA little while later the cops finished their food and left. One of them even smiled and nodded to my friend on the way out.

We got to the bus stop and just as we both lit up a cigarette a cop car pulled up with the same two cops inside. They had been sitting in the parking lot next door with their lights off waiting for us to come out of the diner. We obviously weren't old enough to be smoking cigarettes, and a check of our IDs confirmed that. They searched both of us and found a five sack of weed and a pipe in my friend's jacket.

            "Intrusive thoughts.  Nearly everyone has thoughts about pushing the old lady onto the subway train, swerving into opposing traffic, or stabbing their loved one in the stomach while cooking dinner with them.\n\nSome folks, however, take these thoughts very serious that believe that they might act them out.  It's called thought-action-fusion.  Most of us are able to brush them off, though.",
            "I have heard some variant of \"This is probably weird, but I feel if I am my true self around others than they won't like me\" more times than I can count. As I explore the formative situations to this belief alongside my clients it definitely pulls at my heart strings.",
            "The amount of people I see who feel like they should be grieving a \u201ccertain way\u201d and are afraid that they \u201cmust not have loved someone,\u201d or, \u201cmust not have cared.\u201d People grieve in all sorts of ways. The \u201c5 stages of grief\u201d are bullshit. \n\nI was consulting with another clinician who was seeing a couple whose daughter had died. The wife was convinced that the husband must not have cared about her because he \u201cwasn\u2019t grieving out loud.\u201d In reality, while she had been going to support groups and outwardly expressing, he had been continuing to work in a garden that him and his daughter had kept when she was alive, using that time to process and grieve as he did. Both were perfectly fine ways of grieving, however it is expected that ones grief is more than the other. They both ended up working it out however, he driving her and others to their weekly support group, her attempting to work in the garden with him on the condition that they didn\u2019t talk. Really sweet.\n\nTo that same extent, the amount of people who are unaware of their own emotions and emotional process is astounding. So many people feel only \u201cangry\u201d or \u201chappy\u201d and worry something must be wrong with them otherwise. Normalizing feeling the whole gamut is just as important. Recognizing what we\u2019re feeling as well as what it feels like in our body when we\u2019re feeling is incredibly helpful for understanding how we process and feel. As a whole, how we treat emotions as a society is kinda fucked. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.\n\nEdit: gamut not gambit",
            "I'd say a common one is believing that there's something innately, irreparably wrong with them that makes them unable to ever truly 'fit in'.

            "Two topics come up with regularity: when someone discloses to me that they were sexually abused as a kid, and/or when some is experiencing suicidal ideation. Both are something I hear from clients every single day, and so I don\u2019t find it weird at all. But, when I have someone in front of me who\u2019s talking about it for the first time, I know it\u2019s important to validate the fact that even though I might be talking about this for like the fifth time that day, they have never talked about this EVER, and are in need of gentle care to feel safe.",
            "That they do not know what they enjoy doing. Often they have people in they're life, including therapists, say \"try to do something fun today\" or ask \"what do you like to do when you have free time?\". Many people I work with do not know what those are. Once I explain that I dislike these statements /questions because they assume people should know the answer, and that many people don't, I can watch as they relax, take a deep breath, and say something to the effect of \"oh my, that's so good to hear. I have no idea what I like to do. That's part of the problem.\". More often than not they feel like they should know and that everyone else their age has it figured out. They are embarrassed to say that they don't know when in fact not knowing is very common. I couldn't even try to count how many clients I've had this conversation with.",
            "Unwanted intrusive thoughts are normal and do not mean you are a bad person (yes, even intrusions of sexual/religious/moral themes). By definition, these are thoughts that are unwanted bc they go against your own values and highlight what you don\u2019t want to do (eg, a religious person having unwanted blasphemous images pop into their mind, or a new parent having unwanted sexual thoughts about their new baby). However normal these thoughts are (over 90% of the population), the moral nature of these thoughts mean that often people experience a lot of shame and take many years before they first tell someone about them.\n\nEdit. Because this is getting more visibility that I realised : The occurrence of these thoughts/images/urges are normal. The best way to \u201cmanage\u201d them is to accept that they are a normal (albeit unpleasant) brain process, and a sign of the opposite of who you are and are therefore v.v.unlikely to ever do. Let the thought run its course in the background while you bring your attention back to (insert something you can see/feel/hear/taste/touch). I usually say something like \u201cok mind! Thanks for that mind! I\u2019m going to get back to washing the dishes and the sound/sensation of the water while you ponder all the nasties. Carry on!\u201d I literally say it to myself with a slightly amused tone bc I am always genuinely amused at all the wild stuff my brain can produce!!",
            "A common one in the time I was a therapist was simply \"I don't know\". \n\nYou'd be surprised how reluctant people are to admit that they don't know why they're feeling how they are. But that's exactly why you're (or were, I'm not a therapist any more) sat there with me; so we can figure out why together.   \n\n\nIt always put me in mind of a line from *America* by Simon and Garfunkel:  \n\n\n\"Kathy, 'I'm lost' I said, though I knew she was sleeping. 'I'm empty and aching and I don't know why'.\"",
            "Psychologist here. \nBasically, anything having to do with sex. There's so much shame. Sexual abuse. Sexual fantasies and fetishes. Erectile dysfunction. Infidelity. Becoming sexually assertive. I've been told that I have a good \"psychologist's face.\" I try not to have a strong reaction to normalize the discussion. \nWith adolescents, they are extremely anxious to tell me if they've relapsed or aren't doing well. They cut one night or they were suicidal. They're having a lot of negative self-talk or panic attacks. They'll come in, pretending everything is okay. It's usually in the last 10-15 minutes that they'll say something. They'll reveal that they worried they'd let me down. That I'd be disappointed in them. It usually turns into a discussion about policing other people's feelings and tolerating emotions. I explain that I care about their well-being and it's my job to monitor my emotions and reactions, not their role.",
            "Clients become quite fearful of admitting that they weren't successful since the last time they had a session. This could include not succeeding in using a coping skill that they're learning about, or not being able to complete a homework assignment I gave them. Humans aren't robots, and therapy is a lot of work. \n\nThat being said, I don't expect people to be perfect as they start to work on themselves in a positive way. It takes time to really commit to change, especially in relation to trauma or conflicted views that an individual holds. I feel as if the client doesn't want to let me down as their therapist, but these \"failure\" events are just as important to talk about as successful moments!",
            "That they don't like their family members, are angry/want to stop communication with their parents etc. I work in a country which Is more culturally collectivist, so not wanting anything to do with your parents makes you an asshole in the current cultural sense.\n\nWe deal with this almost on a daily basis. There is deep and profound shame in this and when we find that line of \"oh, it might be that your parents are toxic to your mental well being/trigger your trauma\" many of my clients actually get visibly angry with me. \n\nCultural psychology is so important, cause when I first moved here I had my American/European hat on, oh boy, did I need to adjust.\n\nEDIT: I'm in Ukraine \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6",

            "Some of the most common ones have been visual and/or auditory hallucinations and suicidal thoughts. I usually hear \u201cI don\u2019t want to be put in the hospital\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m crazy\u201d. Also, basically anything sexual. I\u2019m not going to judge you for being into BDSM, fetishes, etc. Honestly, I\u2019ve probably heard it before and I\u2019m not here to judge you. Same goes with any non-consensual experiences (especially if we\u2019re working through trauma).",
            "Psychologist in the US. To name a few: \u201ccompulsive\u201d masturbation, fears of being a pedophile/rapist (this is a common OCD fear), hoarding, sexual performance difficulties, history of sexual abuse or sexual assault (unfortunately it is VERY common), drug use, amount of money spent on various things, having an ASD diagnosis, going back to an abusive relationship / staying in an abusive relationship, grieving years and years after a loss, self-harm of all sorts, wanting to abandon their current lifestyle (for example, to have more sex, to escape responsibility or expectations), history of gang violence / crime, their sexuality (or asexuality), gender identity, the impact of racism / racial trauma, paranoia, hallucinations, feeling uncomfortable in therapy, not believing in therapy, difficulty trusting a therapist, fear of psychiatric medication, fear of doctors in general. \n\nI was surprised to see suicidal ideation on others\u2019 responses. Most of my clients seem to talk very openly about suicidal thoughts and urges from the start of therapy (which I think is super healthy). I think that most of the people I\u2019ve worked with had SI (current or history). As weird as it may seem, I can\u2019t imagine what a life without any thoughts about suicide would even look like. \n\nAt this point, I don\u2019t recall a time a patient said something in therapy and I was shocked or even thought, \u201coh, that\u2019s new\u201d. And imo, if you surprise your therapist, that is okay. \n\nI wonder if we asked Reddit, \u201cwhat are you afraid to tell anyone (even a therapist) because you think it is weird?\u201d - how many people would see that they aren\u2019t that weird at all.",

            "Hidden sexual dreams and fantasies about family members. More common than people think, and often stays that way and doesn't really interfere in the person's close relationships unless they allow it. Many things we dream or think are unconscious and involuntary, and the root of such things is often nonsensical.",
            "I do a lot of trauma work. Many people who have experienced molestation or sexual assault feel ashamed and confused because their bodies responded.  Having an erection/lubrication or even an orgasm does not mean you wanted the sexual contact and it is still assault. Clients often hold a lot of shame and confusion about this. They wonder if it means they wanted it or if there is something wrong with them. It is a tough thing to work through because of this. Assault is assault. Sometimes human bodies respond to sexual touch even when we don't want that touch.\n\nEdited to say: Wow! Thanks for the awards and likes. I hope that anyone reading this who is struggling with feeling weird about their reactions to rape/assault/unwanted touch feels reassured. I also hope you find a good therapist or a good friend to talk to about this. It is one part of your life story-but it isn't the story of you. You get to craft the narrative of your life. Maybe this is a chapter in that story, but it is not the whole thing. Trauma is a thing we experience, it doesn't get to define who we are.",
            "Usually it\u2019s sex related. Shame about their desires or kinks is common.

            "OCD gets misunderstood a lot. It\u2019s not just having a clean house or liking things to be organized. Common intrusive thoughts can include violent thoughts of harming children and other loved ones, intrusive thoughts of molesting children,  fear of being a serial killer etc. My clients can feel a lot of shame when discussing the thoughts or worry I will hospitalize them.\n\nEdit: thanks for the awards kind internet strangers!

            "I work with a lot of anxiety and trauma clients  Whenever I ask if they would describe their experience as being anxious about being anxious, I get a lot of 'omg, yessss.' Anxiety has such a physical impact in the body (heart pounding, trouble breathing, feeling faint or cold, tunnel vision) that we become aware of our body's reaction before we even notice the anxious thoughts triggering the reaction. Then we panic about why our bodies are flipping out when we're not even aware of feeling threatened, and the anxiety compounds on itself.\n\n Anxiety is like an alarm system in our bodies to signal the presence of (real or perceived) danger. What would you do if your alarm was going off at your house? Check to see if there's a real threat (scan your environment/situation to ground yourself in the present), turn off the alarm (breathing exercises do help, along with mindfulness techniques like body scans), and then investigate what tripped the alarm (process thoughts around the situation that read like danger to you). It's also important to note that danger doesn't need to be a gun getting pulled on you. Panicking during a presentation that could impact your job and threaten the way you pay your bills and afford your life can feel pretty dangerous if you think about it.\n\nedit: I'm an anxious person myself, and I respond really well to learning/knowing more about an issue. If you're interested, look into polyvagal theory. It goes into great detail around the mind-body response when it comes to anxiety and trauma.

There are some pretty simple questions we can ask to determine if it's hallucinating or just internal dialogue, and most often it's the latter.\n\nEdit: I want to clarify that not everyone has am internal \"voice\". Some have none at all, some have more of a system of thoughts that aren't verbal, feelings, or images.

            "Hello, therapist here. There are several:\n\n1. Speaking to their departed loved ones. Thankfully, theories now support this and don't consider it to be a sign they're not \"moving on with their lives\". I encourage my clients to explore the continuation of their relationships with the deceased. \n\n2. Small ways they've made progress in the week. I know this isn't technically weird, but my clients sometimes don't want to tell me this, either because they fear I'd turn round and say they don't need therapy any more, or because I might find the progress unnoteworthy. Both of which are totally untrue!\n\n3. That they're having bizarre intrusive thoughts of hurting themselves/others, sexual fantasies and so on. As a therapist, I'm trained to appreciate the whole world that lies between thoughts and action, and all it really proves is that we have an imagination. It's highly unlikely I'll need to break confidentiality, and won't call the police immediately. \n\n4. Sex related things in general. Eventually we'll talk about sex, and I'll see a weight lifted off their shoulders for how unphased I am by their apparently weird sex life. Honestly, it's rarely that weird, and we all have kinks.

One, incestuous sexual abuse is common, and that is not okay; and your therapist will *not* be disgusted or shocked if you choose to process this abuse. I say this because the guilt and shame are crushing, and I want anyone reading this to know that there is nothing wrong with you if you have been abused in this way. \n\nWomen and girls are also often perpetrators, which adds a wholly different level of shame and self doubt that I want to point out. It can be perpetuated by siblings, parents, aunts and uncles, and grandparents, cousins, and multiple family at different times or concurrently. Often, it is something which family knows about and yet does not intervene and/or blames the victims for. \n\nIt is not your fault if you\u2019ve ever been sexually abused in any way as a child. It\u2019s never your fault to get sexually abused as a teen. It is something we hear about often, and we will not change a single thing other than exploring if you want to work on how this is effecting you.",

This was common in recipes at the time, as it was assumed that preparers knew the method.\n\nIngredients:\n1 oz (28 g) caffeine citrate\n3 oz (85 g) citric acid\n1 US fl oz (30 ml) vanilla extract\n1 US qt (946 ml) lime juice\n2.5 oz (71 g) \"flavoring\", i.e., \"Merchandise 7X\"\n30 lb (14 kg) sugar\n4 US fl oz (118.3 ml) fluid extract of coca leaves (flavor essence of the coca leaf).\n2.5 US gal (9.5 l; 2.1 imp gal) water\ncaramel sufficient to give color\n\"Mix caffeine acid and lime juice in 1 quart boiling water add vanilla and flavoring when cool.\"\nFlavoring (Merchandise 7X):\n1 qrt alcohol\n80 oil orange\n40 oil cinnamon\n120 oil lemon\n20 oil coriander\n40 oil nutmeg\n40 oil neroli\n\"Let stand 24 hours.\"\nMerory recipe\tEdit\nRecipe is from Food Flavorings: Composition, Manufacture and Use. Makes one 1 US gallon (3.8 l; 0.83 imp gal) of syrup. Yield (used to flavor carbonated water at 1 US fl oz (30 ml) per bottle): 128 bottles, 6.5 US fl oz (190 ml).[29]\n\nMix 5 lb (2.3 kg) of sugar with just enough water to dissolve the sugar fully.

The formula is very similar to the one found in Pemberton's diary.[30][31][32] Coca-Cola archivist Phil Mooney acknowledged that the recipe \"could ... be a precursor\" to the formula used in the original 1886 product, but emphasized that the original formula is not the same as the one used in the current product.[33]\n\nFluid extract of Coca: 3 drams USP\nCitric acid: 3 oz\nCaffeine: 1 oz\nSugar: 30 lbs\nWater: 2.5 gal\nLime juice: 2 pints (1 quart)\nVanilla: 1 oz\nCaramel: 1.5 oz or more for color\nThe secret 7X flavor (use 2 oz of flavor to 5 gals syrup):\n\nAlcohol: 8 oz\nOrange oil: 20 drops\nCinnamon oil: 10 drops\nLemon oil: 30 drops\nCoriander oil: 5 drops\nNutmeg oil: 10 drops\nNeroli oil: 10 drops",

We went to the doctor the next day, caught the cancer before it spread and was able to surgically remove it about a month later. Got super lucky.",

Again doc said blocked gland.  Months later it\u2019s still not gone and she insists on getting a second opinion.  Stage 3 breast cancer.  Double mastectomy immediately followed by months of agonizing radiation and chemo only to find out it\u2019s now stage four.

            "My 33 year old husband was diagnosed with inoperable glioblastoma (most aggressive brain cancer) in January 2019, when he was 31. What caused him to get a check, was persistent headache that didn\u2019t go away with paracetamols and sleep. We discovered the tumours after taking an MRI. \n\nNeedless to say, our lives were changed forever. Now we are at the end of our journey, and it\u2019s been a harrowing experience for me as his wife and caregiver. It\u2019s a lonely journey. I don\u2019t wish it upon anyone and no one has any idea what glioblastoma is like, unless they have gone through it. The median survival time is 14-18 months. We are on our 18th month now.. and given days/ weeks left. Every day is a gift, and I\u2019m glad I get to be holding his hands every day, even if he\u2019s resting and sleeping most of the time. As long as he is not in pain, and that the morphine patches are working, that is fine by me... I can\u2019t handle him going through anymore pain.\n\nEdit: Thank you so much for sharing your stories, giving me strength and support, and I\u2019m so blessed to even be receiving all of your kindness. It\u2019s such a touchy subject and I\u2019m hurt all the time, but you guys being so kind, really makes me cry happy tears. I\u2019m so touched. I don\u2019t know how to describe it but I feel a little bit lifted. And that\u2019s more than I can ask for, from the Internet. My husband, Viktor, would have been so grateful, to know that he is loved and supported by more people than he thought he was. Thank you. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nEdit (2nd Aug): Viktor has passed away yesterday, on 1st August, 7.43pm Swedish time. He was surrounded by his brother and me and smiled a lot to the very end. At his final resting position, his face looked relaxed and a little smile can be seen by us too. I am still in shock, processing what has happened to us. I\u2019ll take the time I need to process this and grieve. I just miss my husband. I miss his laughs. I miss his smile. I feel loved. I know I\u2019m loved. So that\u2019s keeping me together. Thank you so much for your kind support even though we are strangers on the Internet. I am both saddened and moved by the generosity of others to offer support, love and to bare their personal pain related to GBM/cancer/loss in general. \n\nThank you. May Viktor find peace. I know he\u2019s not in pain now.",
            "My head and neck area became very swollen. At first I thought I was just getting fat, so I worked out a lot and ate better. This did not help. I also went to a local clinic and they thought it might be an allergic reaction and gave me steroids, which also didn\u2019t help. The thing that finally made me go to the emergency room and not leave until I had an answer is that I started to develop unexplained bruises on my chest. \n\nTurns out I had a huge tumor in my chest which had grown around my heart and was compressing the superior vena cava so blood couldn\u2019t flow back down from my head.

The main take away is if something is not right,  keep looking for answers and the right physician. \nHeavy periods do not usually mean cancer in pre menopausal women, but there is no reason to suffer through them.\nPost menopausal women should not experience any bleeding, one drop and you should go to the doctor right away.",
            "On Christmas Eve 2018, my Dad lost the ability to talk except for the phrase \"this is crazy.\" Called paramedics because we thought he'd had a stroke. Got him to the hospital where the imaging showed a brain tumor on the outside edge of his brain. The swelling caused him to have a seizure. He was transferred to a bigger local hospital. They did full body scans because it's pretty rare to just have brain cancer- usually it's a secondary for another cancer site. We got lucky in that it was the sole spot. Went through a craniotomy and 5 rounds of high dose inpatient chemo, and he's one year in remission!\n\nThanks for the awards!",
            "My cat found my cancer and bugged me about it until I went to the doctor.\n\nMy cat has always like to lay on me and \u201cknead\u201d part of my body with her paws. For 7 years it was random, various parts of my body. Then for about 6 months she started to focus on one spot on my chest. At first I chalked it up to her wanting to be closer to my face, but after a couple months I noticed that the spot she was focused on had become very tender. Then I felt a small lump in that spot. Due to my (relatively young age), it took me a couple of months to convince one of my doctors that it was a potential issue, but eventually I got tested and had a pretty giant tumor in that spot (plus other tumors elsewhere).\n\nYes, kitty got lots of cuddles, wet food, and Greenies as a thank you.",
            "I had a persistent pain in the middle of my sternum. Doctors thought it was costochondritis (essentially just inflammation of a joint). I stopped working out and lifting heavy things for 3 months but it didn't go away. Eventually I started having nightsweats and random aches. After I fractured my hip, I got an MRI and biopsy and they diagnosed me with stage IV non Hodgkin's lymphoma. I got chemo and I've been in remission for 5 years.\n\nEDIT: I'm seeing a lot of people describing a similar chest pain and getting scared. Not all chest pain is cancer and not all cancer is chest pain. I felt the pain in my chest because my tumor happened to be growing there. It could just as easily have grown somewhere else, and my story might have started with describing a persistent pain in the middle of my shin. \n\nIf you're worried about something, talk to your doctor!",

            "I was 17, getting ready for spring break back in 2010. Was making plans with my boyfriend on the phone because we were going to take his brothers to the zoo in a different city.\n\nLiterally in seconds there's this big translucent blind spot in my eye that is orange. I can see dark shapes behind it but it's super blurry.\n\nI figured I would just go to the eye doctor before I left the next day, but my sister (who actually works for the cancer center in my city) told me that I should go to the hospital because anything weird with your vision can be super serious.\n\nAfter 36 hours of Emergency waits, driving to specialists, they finally admitted me to the eye ward for a bacterial infection. Then they took my blood for a routine blood test.\n\nWithin an hour or so (as I was getting ready to sleep) a doctor and nurse come in. The nurse has a box of tissues. The doctor told me my \"blood is leukemic\" to which I asked \"okay, can I treat that?\" He was extremely unclear on what was happening, I was 17, my family had already left, and I had no idea about any cancers.\n\nI was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and started chemo that night after being transfered to a different hospital. They did a bone marrow biopsy the next morning and then sent it to a genetic lab in another province. When the test results came back they changed my diagnosis to Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia in the Blast Phase Crisis (final stage) that was caused by the Philadelphia Chromosome - where chromosomes 9 and 22 switch places and causes a mutation in my red blood cells. Told me I was the youngest person in the world with it, as CML usually takes a very long time to progress and the final stage doesn't show until around 65 years of age. That change in diagnosis changed my timeline. They had originally said 6 months to a year untreated, but now it was 1-3 months  if I didn't get a stem cell transplant or bone marrow transplant.\n\nAll this because I had blood clots happening all over my body because of the abnormalities of my red blood cell shapes - and the one in my eye presented itself in my vision since the vessels are so small.\n\nEdit - I guess I never finished off, I just celebrated 10 years in remission on June 17th this year and I'm healthy. My sister ended up being a 10/10 DNA marker match and I was able to get a stem cell transplant on June 17th, 2010. Still immunocompromised and taking Dasatinib everyday (chemo pill), but able to live my life. Covid has been really worrisome for me, but I'm just trying to be as careful as possible.

I went to the doctor once and they said I sprained my knees (I played soccer so it wasn't impossible). But they never got better. So I went back and they decided to take some blood tests just in case.

            "Trigger warning:\nSex and Blood.\n\nCervix cancer. A couple of times during sex blood would just randomly pour out of me. Nowhere near my time of month and no pain. Turns out that is one of the warning signs.\nThree surgeries later I have had my cervix (the mouth og the uterus) removed completely, bit by bit. They tried taking only what they had to, as lack of a cervix makes impregnation and carrying to term harder, but it kept reappearing. I Hope it's done now.\n\nEdit. A lot of women (and other concerned people) have been asking me stuff so here are the most common questions answered.\nKeep in mind that English is not my first language and that I am NOT a medically trained person.\n\n- It was during sex. He pulled out and it followed.\n- It looked like a quarter of a cup. It was enough to literally pour out of me and it pooled on the sheets.\n- Light spotting or a few drops of blood during sex is probably just due to chafing of the fragile tissue in the vagina. No biggie. A lot of blood like this or even just enough to coat your partners member is cause for worry. Do check your schedule, though. He may just have kick started your period.\n- It was not my period. It was nowhere near that time of the month and I - in any case - never bleed that much or all at once. THe blood was also fresh with no clots, like a nosebleed.\n- If at any point, during or outside of sex, blood starts randomly pouring out of ANY orifice (not just the vagoo) get it looked at. Even if it stops on its own. It is not a normal reaction. (Comments on knife-play not appreciated).\n- I was 26 years old when this happened and it was relatively short time after having a scheduled pap smear (maybe 6 months?).\n- I had previously been treated for genital warts (thanks a bunch Kenneth!) and have a low resistance to any wart-related vira, including the HPV virus which can trigger cell anomalies in the cervix.\n- I have since gotten the HPV vaccine, since even if I have already had this shit, it will strengthen the immune system. Apart from dizzyness and a slight fever, I had no side effects from the vaccine, and I REALLY REALLY recommend getting it. Mand, woman, all benefits. (You can carry and infect women with HPV as a male). And for the love of Gods: Get your kids vaccinated!!\n- The procedure is called a LEEP (Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure). These are done when you have localized cancer cells on the cervix and just removes the area with the abnormal cells. When the cancer is a higher stage, a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus), and/or chemotherapy with radiation are the usual courses of treatment.\n- Side/after effects of LEEP were very slight. I was sore and not allowed to swim, do heavy lifting or have sex for 4 weeks. That was it.\n- You can still get pregnant without a cervix, it is just harder because it isn't there to \"funnel\" in the sperm. You also have a greater risk of not carrying to term, but there are procedures to help with that.\n\n\nIf you want more info on this type of cancer, go to Jo's trust:\nhttps://www.jostrust.org.uk/",

It wasn't until the 7th doctor when he was finally referred for a [spinal tap procedure ](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/lumbar-puncture/about/pac-20394631#:~:text=tap%20(lumbar%20puncture)-,Spinal%20tap%20(lumbar%20puncture),collect%20cerebrospinal%20fluid%20for%20testing.) to determine if his runny nose was actually a [CSF leakage](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/neurology_neurosurgery/centers_clinics/brain_tumor/center/skull-base/types/csf-leak.html#:~:text=A%20CSF%20leak%20is%20a,and%20brain%20or%20sinus%20surgery.). \n\nNight after the procedure, we almost lost him.

            "I was 8 when I got Leukaemia (21 now), the first unusual thing was that I was constantly tired. I\u2019d just come home and lie down on the couch and wouldn\u2019t have energy for anything. My mom was just alarmed as I was a lively child but she first brushed it off as school and autumn moods exhausting me. \n\nAnd then I started getting red spots on my skin. Not breakouts, just red dots appearing right under my skin. \n\nFirst on my face, then on my neck, eventually they spread down to my chest. It happened within days and thankfully my mom called my grandmother, who\u2019s a cardiologist, and who ordered my parents to take me to a doctor. \n\nOther doctors could\u2019ve said it was a skin allergy breakout (I suffered from skin allergies before that) but this one noticed the signs, ordered extensive blood tests and then got me transferred to the haematology hospital within an hour.\n\nI still remember how I tried to be brave when they were taking my blood and how proud I was that I was calm through that whole evening.\n\nAnd that was the start of over a year of hospital life.\n\nIf my mom hadn\u2019t called my grandmother, If she then wouldn\u2019t order my parents to take me to the hospital, if that doctor then would dismiss the signs (which are not at all common with leukaemia) I would\u2019ve been gone within a week, maybe two. If I came there days, hours later, I would\u2019ve been beyond saving.\n\nBut in the end, 8/9yo me was happy to be allowed to spend whole days in bed playing the Sims 2 and that\u2019s what I choose to remember from that time.\n\nI\u2019d also like to say that my parants are amazing people who made sure to spend every moment they could with me, all the while working to support us (not all the meds etc were available through the local NHS) and they made this hard time so much easier for me.\n\nTLDR; I was 8yo, was tired all the time, had red spots on the skin, was very lucky that came to the hospital quickly and wasn\u2019t dismissed as an allergy, or I would\u2019ve been dead in a week.",

            "This question hits too close to home for me. I am currently fighting stage IV rectal cancer that spread to my liver. I am a late 50's male that was too stupid and arrogant to go get checked or have a colonoscopy when the doctors said I should. I thought I knew my body better than they did. That naive attitude will probably end up costing me my life. My family is what forced me to finally act, but unfortunately, too late.\n\nI have had digestive problems my entire life. Born with a faulty pyloric valve. Lousy eating habits, bad choices, lack of caring, have finally caught up with me. Everything has a price and the bill eventually comes due. I am paying now.\n\nThree years ago, in addition to my normal struggles, I started seeing red blood on the toilet paper when I went to the bathroom. Not all the time so I kind of ignored it. It eventually started happening more often. I did not tell anyone or go to a doctor. I just ignored it. My family kept pushing me to get it checked. I finally relented.\n\nIn January 2019, I had a colonoscopy. When I woke up, the first words out of the doctor's mouth were, \"I found something very concerning. This is not good.\" 4 polyps. He removed 3 but the fourth was too large and too close to my anus. He took a bunch of biopsies. They all came back negative. Whew, or so I thought. It was recommended that I have it removed surgically so in March, I had surgery and had it taken out. The surgeon wanted to remove the lymph nodes as well (it is the only way to be sure) but I said no because that meant a colostomy. I was not ready for that. The biopsy from the surgery came back in late March 2019. Cancer. The dreaded C word. I was shocked but not surprised. I had brought this on myself. In some way, I deserved it.\n\nAgain, the surgeon recommended removing everything to be sure. I said no. The chances were not great but not zero so I opted for chemo and radiation to see if that would get it. 5 weeks of daily chemo and radiation in May 2019. That was tough and it took a pretty big toll on me but I made it through.\n\nThe August scans looked promising. My CEA level (the colon cancer tumor marker) was dropping fast. My doctors were optimistic and telling me good things. My November scans looked just as good. I was told I was in remission and they would monitor me for the next 2 years. Wow. Dodged a bullet, so I thought.\n\nRight after Thanksgiving, I get a call from my oncologist, my CEA level has increased again and they aren't sure why. I need to get checked again. I wait it out through the holidays. In February 2020, I have a CT scan and a PET scan. I then have an EUA (exam under anesthesia) to check the original tumor. Not only is the original tumor back but the cancer has spread to my liver. 3 lesions.\n\nI went from being in remission to stage IV in less than 3 months. You talk about whiplash. My head was spinning. The hardest part was talking to my family about what was going on and what comes next. In April I started on infused chemotherapy, FOLFOX + Avastin. 4 hours of infusion followed by 36 hours of a pump worn at home. I did this every 2 weeks, 4 times, covering an 8 week span. I was told to pause after that so I could deal with my liver.\n\nTime to up the ante. I got into MD Anderson to see the experts. I have a huge team of doctors and specialists trying to help me survive. Even though I was told by my local oncologist last year that radiation was a one-time thing and I had my life-time dosage, MDA doesn't see it that way. They have a more specialized approach so in June, I went through a second round of radiation and chemo. Twice a day for 13 days at the end of June. That was hell and the following 2 weeks were just as bad trying to recover. I was honestly missing the infused chemo.\n\nOh, and towards the end of the radiation, I paused the final treatment so I could have a procedure done on my liver to zap the 3 lesions. Then I finished the final radiation treatment the next day. My local oncologist called me \"ballsy\" for putting my self through that. In some ways, I felt like I deserved to suffer.\n\nI have slowly recovered from all of that and I am about to start back up on the infused chemo. I have 8 more rounds that have to be completed over the next 16 weeks. I have been hoping that by some miracle, this would cure my cancer. My doctors give me a less than 10 percent chance. All of this treatment is just slowing the spread of the cancer. As they have all been telling me for over a year, my only real chance is to remove the original tumor with surgery. I am almost assuredly facing a permanent colostomy at the end of all of this. If I had listened to my doctors last year and had that done, I might have saved some of this suffering and be cancer free. Or perhaps not. I will never know.\n\nIn the meantime, I will continue to fight it. I will deal with the terrible side effects from the treatments. The constant running to the bathroom. The shitting myself time and again. The pain and irritation. The embarrassment. The humiliation. The sadness of knowing what I have and am putting my family through. I am not afraid of dying. I am afraid of letting my family down.\n\nAll because I was too stupid to listen to the people that know more than me.\n\nTrust me on this one people. Pay attention. Get checked early. Get checked often. Don't be me.\n\nEDIT: Wow. I am overwhelmed by the responses, the kind thoughts and words, and the gilding. Thank you all.\n\nIn reading your replies and my original post, I can see where it may sound like I am despondent and being too hard on myself. It reads worse than it is. I know cancer is an evil killer that is not prejudiced or biased. I did not help myself but I know I didn't deserve it either. \n\nAnother aspect I should have added to my post is that I am adopted and I have zero knowledge or information about my birth parents. So my medical history is a complete blank. It was this reason (and the pushing from my family) that drove me to get checked. For my kids. Subsequent genetic testing has shown that I do in fact have 4 variants making me more susceptible to certain cancers. Now my kids know that as well.\n\nThe message is simple. Get checked. If not for yourself, then for your kids and your family, present or future.",

            "Severe pain. I was 12 years old and woke up screaming and crying from the pain. Swiftly passed out right after. It felt like a knife had stabbed into my side and was just twisting over and over again. I had already had cancer once before so my family took me to get an MRI right after I went to school, and they saw a stomach tumor and immediately had me go to the hospital to have it surgically removed.",
            " I feel I must answer this question. I had signs of cancer for about a year before it was discovered. But my signs were not obvious. I had a backache that responded to massive doses of ibuprofen, so it went on for awhile. I had been to the doctor on numerous occasions, and was treated as a sort of neurotic, middle aged lady with aches and pains. I was treated for fibromyalgia (meds made me nutty), told to get massages, given cortisone shots in the knotty muscles on my back, etc. My husband finally accompanied me and demanded they do some blood work because he could tell this wasn\u2019t normal \u201caches and pains\u201d. Very telling blood work was done, but ignored, probably because the doc saw no emergency. I was finally referred to another doc who did more blood work, then left town. I was begging for results to no avail. I became weaker and could not go to work. I became feverish and was at last crawling back and forth to the bathroom to get in a tub of cold water. Finally, my husband said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to the emergency room.\u201d\n\nWhen I finally got in to see the doctors in the ER, they looked me up and down and asked questions . . I meekly offered that there had been some recent blood work done, if that would help. They looked it up, and immediately I was put into a room and given I\u2019m not sure how many units of blood. I was nearly bloodless!!\n\nAfter a week of extensive testing (bone marrow test, MRI, and continual blood monitoring,) a mass showed up on a CT scan. I had a softball sized tumor growing behind my esophagus, and it was bleeding into my stomach and being digested as a rare steak would be. That\u2019s why I never saw blood in my stool. The doc who never paid attention to my blood work in the first place came in and prescribed me huge bottles of vicodin. Needless to say, I never asked for her services again.\n\nI had a huge surgery, removing my stomach, much of my esophagus, my spleen, an adrenal gland and part of my pancreas. The surgeon wanted to go higher up on my esophagus, but if he did, I would never be able to swallow, and would have to have a feeding tube. But that didn\u2019t matter, because they only gave me a couple of months to live. My husband said no to this, and asked the surgeon, \u201cWhy not take our chances with chemo and see if that works?\u201d\n\nThank God they did, because 8 years later, here I am. I didn\u2019t die. And I can eat almost anything!\n\nThere is much more to this story, but I am here to say that the cancer symptoms were not at all obvious. I had never had heartburn or reflux - never smoked - but yet the tumor was in my esophagus. It had wrapped its tentacles around my spine, and that is what was causing the tremendous back pain all those months. Massages and cortisone shots did not quite cut it as cures for a large cancerous tumor. The pain after surgery was immense, but I never had that awful back pain again!\n\nI would say having somewhat regular blood work is probably the best way to find out if there is an unusual imbalance - that is what (FINALLY) exposed my cancer.\n\nI would add, since seeing a somewhat disbelieving comment on my answer, that yes, it is entirely possible to digest food without a stomach. And although I do believe smoking can cause cancer in some cases I in no way intended to bash any smokers but simply mentioned this because esophageal cancer is often linked to smoking.\n\nThank you for all the comments. I hope this has encouraged someone. I know when I was told I only had a short time to live, hearing stories of survival greatly encouraged me.",

She couldn't breastfeed while taking the meds.

            "Peeing out what appeared to be a pint of blood, completely painlessly. It was bladder cancer.\n\nStill took me 2 years until I got a diagnosis. Every time it happened, I'd go to the clinic and by the time I got there, I was peeing clear again, with only trace amounts of blood. They'd give me antibiotics for a UTI and send me on my way.\n\nTurns out, \"painless gross hematuria\" (peeing out A LOT of blood, with zero pain) is almost ALWAYS a sign of bladder cancer. As the tumors grow, they bleed, but the bladder heals (or rather, the tumors heal) incredibly quickly, so by the time you give a urine sample, it's over. And it doesn't happen constantly, just once every few weeks or months.\n\nFinally I caught it mid-stream, and ran to the clinic with a full bladder. I remember feeling so triumphant when they asked me to pee in a cup and I handed over a full cup of blood. I also remember the nurse's face. It was a student clinic, and I was a 21 year old woman. 21 year old women don't get bladder cancer, but I did. They got me a referral to a urologist within a couple days. They did a cystoscopy (scope in through the urethra to look at the inside of the bladder) and found 8 tumors.\n\nI've since found other women on the internet that had the same experience.\n\nI've also since had a UTI, years after bladder cancer. UTIs hurt REALLY BAD, and if there's blood, it's only a tiny bit. Ridiculous that they just thought I was exaggerating the blood...but somehow ignoring the pain?\n\nTl;dr, if you ever pee out what appears to be straight blood and feel zero pain, don't let them tell you it's just a UTI. You probably have bladder cancer. Demand a referral to a urologist and get a cystoscopy.\n\nETA: I forgot that they also kept insisting that it must have been my period, and I was just confused. Nevermind the fact that I wasn't on my period, and it's fairly easy to tell if blood is coming from your vagina or your urethra.",

In that time, dad stopped coughing as much and told us he felt okay, asked to cancel the ambulance and that just wanted to go to sleep. \n\nI said fuck no, let the ambulance get here and let the people with medical degrees and training decide if you get to go to bed or not. \n\nThey arrived - a senior paramedic we\u2019ll call Joe (late 30s, friendly) and a junior paramedic we\u2019ll call Sarah. \n\nThey both do standard tests, an ECG and a review of his meds (antibiotics). Joe asks Sarah for her opinion (presumably for her training) and she says he seems fine, the swelling at his glands is reasonable and in line with a viral infection. \n\nJoe says, \u201cWell look, it got so bad that you all felt the need to call 999.

Edit: I\u2019m under 40, so the diagnosis was unexpected.\n\nEpisodes of intense pain/cramping accompanying a feeling like I needed to \u201cgo number two\u201d were what made me get checked out. I sat on the toilet for about an hour, experiencing waves of pain, before a small amount of stool worked its way out of me. The first and second times this happened, I (mistakenly) thought I had overeaten the day before, and those two experiences led me to change my diet. The *third* time it happened was the worst of the three, and I *knew* I hadn\u2019t overeaten the day before.

A follow-up colonoscopy discovered the tumor, and a biopsy of my lymph nodes (nearby nodes extracted in the surgery) indicated that the cancer had spread at least that far. A CT scan showed spots in my liver, which a subsequent MRI confirmed were cancerous.\n\nIt\u2019s been just over a year since the initial tumor was cut out, along with a foot or so of my colon. I began chemo not long after that. I stopped chemo temporarily in the fall so that I could have another surgery for half my liver to be cut out.

I figured it was skin cancer at his reaction to seeing them. I spend a lot of time outdoors. He ordered a Punch test (super important). Two weeks later he sits me down in a chair eye to eye and says you have something called HLRCC - Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Cancer  (connection the bumps are fibroid's). A certified Rare Cancer which is hereditary. Men and women equally get it and often w/o the bumps to warn you.  I just thought ok it's not skin cancer I got this.

Plus, this was London, getting an appointment was an uphill struggle. When he finally saw someone for a cough - it was tongue cancer. Like a one in a million chance.

I said I'd gained some weight but I have always had a big neck and didn't think anything of it. After I had the baby, my neck seemed large still and the OB made an appt. with an ear-nose-throat specialist to check. She said I had a goiter but since I was breastfeeding surgery could wait. Well, the goiter started pressing on my windpipe when I laid on my side after a while so we scheduled surgery. Turns out it was a cancerous tumor not just a goiter and my thyroid had grown into my chest cavity.

I told him no one gave me one as of yet and his chin hit the floor. He couldn't believe no one thought to try.\n\nHe greased up his finger and found the mass right away.

They told her to take probiotics etc.\n\nOver the following 6 months, the pain got worse and she was losing an alarming amount of weight. Her doctor prescribed her so many antibiotics over this time because she was convinced that it was some kind of bacterial infection and IBS. She did send her for an endoscopy, but nothing showed up.

He told her that he thought it was most definitely not a liver infection.\n\nFINALLY, 2 weeks later she had a diagnosis.\nLocally advanced, inoperable pancreatic cancer.

            "I did this once because I had no choice. I had to be somewhere early for work that was 1.5 hours away. So I'm driving this whole time, before sunrise, drinking coffee, a little nervous for this work thing, and now I have to shit bad. I find a random Denny's and run straight to the bathroom. There's only one stall. I lock the door and turn to find someone clogged the entire bowl with paper and ass gaskets. I proceed to push out this ridiculous softserve mountain on top of the soggy paper platform. Like a McDonald's ice cream cone, but shit. The entire pile is above water. I had to hover and wipe just to avoid touching it. I had no choice but to top it off with a blanket of shitty paper. By the time I'm done, the summit is a good three inches above seat level. I could push that flusher 100 times and the whole structure wouldn't budge. Absolutely shameful. If anyone here is a Denny's employee in Northridge, CA that had to deal with this, I'm sorry.",
            "Used to work in a small office with two separate bathrooms, one on either side of our office space. Each was a tiny room with a toilet and a sink.\n\nThere was a guy who without fail, about an hour or two after lunch, would decimate one. Crime scene level mess, with the odor as well, and that odor would waft outward to the nearest cubicle residents, who complained daily.\n\nHe never flushed, and his excuse was that he\u2019d read how toilets create an aerosol effect when they\u2019re flushed, which sends a cloud of mist into the air, and he refused to endure that because \u201cwho knows who else used that toilet.\u201d Which meant someone else got the honor of being sprayed with his leavings.\n\nBoss told him he had two choices: flush and spray Lysol generously (which truly does little to abate the stench), or use the facilities somewhere else.\n\nI\u2019m sorry to say he chose to go to the nearest fast food place instead. To those valiant McDonalds employees, I\u2019m so sorry. You did not deserve that.",

They just get up, hit the lever, hopefully wet their hands, and leave.\n\nOther people clog the toilet. In my case we had a plunger but many bathrooms just don't for some ungodly reason. And even in our case, many people just leave because they don't know how/don't want to deal with a clogged toilet, again I blame bad parenting, probably just didn't get enough hugs as a child. \n\nOh, and there were a few people that put fucking paper towel in the toilet, those are the cat stranglers, you really have to watch out for them.",

I took my chances and chose the stall without a line. There was a shit mess evvvvverywhere! I really had to pee so I aimed where the toilet was hiding underneath all the poop. As I\u2019m peeing a line starts to form outside the stall because the next people in line now think the toilet is useable! I start freaking out because they are going to think I\u2019m the one who left all the poop! I finished peeing, opened the door and shouted I didn\u2019t do that! It was like that when I got here!

It was one of those legs to the wall, I can feel the separate layers within my intestines all being vacated type shits. It was totally thorough. \n\nI'm in a stall near the entrance to the public restroom. I can hear the footsteps and the comments of everyone as they enter. A boy and his father walk in \"It smells like poopy in here daddy\" or something along those lines. A few moments later a old voice yells from a stall to my left \"GOD DAMN. Prison rules, motherfucker, give us a courtesy flush on that shit!\" \n\nAt this point im trying not to laugh. This shit has been a non stop experience, my anus is open and I'm like a soft serve ice cream machine down there man. When its time to wipe I barely have enough room to drop in the TP. I left and never look back.",
            "About six months ago I came across one of these that will haunt me for the rest of my days.\n\nI mean, I've seen nasty shit covered bathrooms before, we all have. Some of us, I am forced to acknowledge, have covered bathrooms in shit themselves, may they burn forever in hell.\n\nThis... wasn't that. Everything was in the bowl, but I can't really say \"where it belonged,\" because this did not belong in any human plumbing. I've seen sewer mains that could not have transported this deuce. It was massive. We're talking \"the goatse.cx guy must have stopped here\" massive.\n\nIt was fully as large around as my calf, and I am not a small guy. I stopped, horrified, then lifted my arm before me, palm up, and looked at my forearm before looking back into the bowl. Again, it is not a small forearm, but it *looked* like a small forearm that day.\n\nIf that turd had been inside me, I would not have been able to walk. Had it wanted out of me, I'd have had to dull the poop knife enough that it could be applied internally. It led from just below the rim of the long-bowled, king-sized toilet right down to the drain, which it did not enter even a little, because it would not fit.\n\nI can still see it in my mind's eye and I wish I could not. It looked like something you might pick up while camping to throw on the fire bed, fully expecting to have coals remaining in the morning.\n\nI slammed the door of the stall and backed away, and then, I am embarrassed to admit, I stepped forward again and re-opened the door, not believing it would still be there, because I must have imagined it. I didn't imagine it.",

            "When we were in Greece I took a massive shit at a restaurant in the middle of nowhere. There was a sign when I walked in that appeared to show a person wipe their ass and then put it in the garbage. I thought nothing of it until the bowl wouldn't flush and realized the sign was literally telling me to wipe my ass and put the paper in the garbage.\n\nAnyway, the bus beeped its horn twice and I knew if I wasn't on that bus they were leaving me. So there I am staring at this massive turd and a pile of shitty paper not flushing. So I said fuck it, I live thousands of miles away from here and need to get on that bus.\n\nSo I basically sprinted from the restroom and paraphrasingly yelled \"SORRY I TOOK A SHIT AND DIDN'T THROW MY TP AWAY, I'M AMERICAN\" and they just nodded and said safe travels like Americans showing up and taking massive shits to just up and leave was normal. It was in that moment I truly understood where the USA stood in the world. Crazy times.",

            "Once, when I was around 10 I pooped in a public bathroom. To preface, this was a busy area at Disney World where you had to wait to use the bathroom due to how many people there were. This day I laid a log so large that I knew deep down it was meant to stay where it laid. Fate had a different plan though (and I found out that I\u2019m not a fan of automatic toilets that day) and my 10yr old self kept moving in front and out of the way of the sensor to flush. The toilet flushed each time, the war crime level dump didn\u2019t budge, until finally the toilet paper blocked the hole. While the back was turned, because I was a dumb kid who wasn\u2019t paying attention, I ended up having the toilet start overflowing and just barely saved my pants from the ungodly nasty shit water pouring out. The other people in the closest stalls were not so lucky. I like to think that they didn\u2019t get nasty shit water all over their pants, but this isn\u2019t a fairy tale. I was so embarrassed I had trouble ever flushing in public after that.",

            "This will get buried, but story time. \n\nI was on a road trip with a couple friends a few years ago, and ended up going into a moderately busy chain/buffet type restaurant to eat lunch. We are Canadian, and this took place in the USA, in the middle of summer. \n\nAlong the way I discovered a flavour of blue Gatorade we did not have in Canada that I loved, and I had been chugging those bad boys, as I have a condition that causes me to get dehydrated easily. This becomes important. \n\nWhile at dinner, I feel that rumble in my gut that tells me it's almost business time, so I head to the bathroom. It's very nice and clean, and I had my choice of about half a dozen stalls to do drop this deuce off. I do so without incident. \n\nI finish up doing my thing, and as I stand over the toilet, I notice that what I had left behind was not only a beast, but almost neon blue from this exotic foreign Gatorade.  Pretty cool, but not something I would think somebody else wanted to see. The toilet, however, had other plans. \n\nI tried to flush the toilet, and nothing happened. I try again and again, and this toilet has decided to go on strike. I'm not this toilet's union rep, so I'm in no place to negotiate. The washroom is empty at the time, so I decide I have to just leave it.  I depart the stall and walk over to wash my hands in the sink.\n\nAs I'm washing my hands, another gentleman enters the room.  Just as I'm turning to leave the room, I notice that of all the urinals and toilet stalls he could choose from, he walked right into the one I just defouled with what looked like a sentient blue alien deuce. Fortunately since he didn't see me walk out of that stall, and there were many options, it could not be concluded that I must have been the culprit.  But I admit I found it pretty hilarious that the least thing I heard while leaving the restroom was an exclamation of \"Oh, what the FUCK?!?\" from a stranger.\n\nI hope my giant blue turd didn't cause that poor man permanent psychological damage.",

There is some set up. Just read it.\n\nThis is the last time I made my dad laugh. Literally. This story.  He was scheduled for some tests at the hospital and so I went to be there to see what the results were.  It was an angiogram, so kind of a big deal. \n\nI woke up late and in a rush, I grabbed clothes out of the dryer.. However, we had washed a down comforter and it broke apart and feathers were everywhere.  Stopped by McDonald's and grabbed 2 egg mcmuffins , ate them on the way. \n\nGot to the hospital and immediately had to shit .. BAD.. Like, having to do \"the walk\" .. And, something was seriously wrong with my underwear too. I had not been to this hospital before and when I finally found the bathroom it was out of service.. But a nurse directed me to another. It was a single, handicapped capable bathroom. \n\nI ran in there, nearly didn't get my pants down fast enough, and when I did, feathers flew everywhere from my clothes.. From the comforter that broke. Clumps and clumps of feathers.. And then the explosion of liquefied egg mcdeathmuffins came.  Saying it was bad is an understatement.. Wiped and stood up to survey the damage. I was not prepared for the sight.\n\nThere was shit and feathers fucking everywhere .. It looked like someone shit out a god damn chicken.. It was a sight to behold, and I thought \" what would I think if I came across this? I would wonder about what the fuck happened forever \" and so I decided that someone else should have that honor.. To come upon something that looked like an Emu Shit Golem being born. And with that.. I left it.\n\nI told that story to my dad later that night, he laughed and laughed. This was February 11th, 2015.. 2 days later, on the 13th, my birthday.. He died of a heart attack. Miss you dad.\n\nEdit- customary \"thanks for the gold, kind internet stranger\"",
            "Not my story but a friend's that he told me:\n\nHe took a dump so massive in his Uni Residence building that it blocked the pipes and caused major overflowing and flood damage. He never claimed responsibility, knowing he had really fucked the place up. This event became a legend on campus. Fast forward to the repairs. He's walking on the floor below 'ground zero' when a maintenance panel in the ceiling popped down (not properly secured) and hit him in the head. As he was on a scholarship, the Uni accepted liability and offered a pay-out of $10k. My man took a shit so large he made $10 000. Fucking legend",
            "I once walked into a stall, saw a huge dump and just noped out of there to find a different one. They were all taken so I left.

            "Okay so this is my story and I can't be bothered changing accounts to a throwaway so... Hopefully I don't get any repercussions.\n\nI had a customer years and years ago. She hated me and I never knew why. I was polite, eager to help but not obnoxious. My boss theorised it was because I was \"a kid\". Mind you I was about 21 but looked around 15.\n\nI found out she worked as a cleaner for public toilets and that included a local one.\n\nOne day, I was serving her at the register and she was paying cash. Instead of handing the money over like a decent human, she tossed it and waited for me to pick up the coins. I picked up the coins and smiled asking if she was okay and brushed it off as an accident.\n\nOn my lunch break, she did it to the local Cafe worker, a girl who was around my age.\n\nI asked around and yeah, she did this to all the \"kids\" who served her.\n\nSo, I did what any mature 21 year old did. I worked in a pharmacy, bought some laxatives and waited after my shift. I went to the local public toilet that I knew she cleaned and let out the biggest, wettest, most cramp induced shit I had ever had. It hurt and I swear I lost a few kilograms. I pulled out a sharpie and wrote in the cubicle \"Treat us with respect\" and \"you throw money, we throw shit\" and so on.\n\nI did a stake out. I was a distance away in a parking lot and waited. I ate some Maccas and waited. Around 7:30-8:00 she arrived in her glorious uniform and her trolley of goods. She went in and came out and choked. I laughed and watched. She was in there for close to an hour.\n\nThe next time I served her, she was timid. She was scared.\n\nShe did not throw money at me.\n\nTL;DR: I took laxatives to get revenge on a cleaner who was mean to me and my peers.\n\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the awards guys. Here's a follow up. So about a week or so after this shit happened, she was back in to the pharmacy and she was all bitchy again BUT no money throwing. I decided to do one last, smaller, non-laxetive induced turd for her. This time, I didn't do a stake out because I couldn't be fucked. But I left a decent sized turd-baby in that porcelain with only one thing written in sharpie. \"WE ARE STILL WATCHING YOU!\"\n\nI reckon she got the message because she stopped being a massive bitch after that.\n\nLast I heard of her (because it's been like, 8 years now) is that she had quit her job not too long after and is a quiet and respectful customer now.\n\nRemember kids, violence is never the answer.

Tucked ever so carefully under the toilet seat, poised to explode on whatever unlucky soul sat next.\n\nHe lifted the seat and took out the packs, then proceeded to unload a MOAB into this Del Taco toilet, \u201cwould have made Saddam blush\u201d. He finished up, and made his way to the drink station to get a refill before leaving, in which time the two kids bolted in the bathroom to see the aftermath of their carnage and reset their trap.

Then he pulls out his phone to show us the picture he took. You know those alleged pictures of the Loch Ness monster? It was sort of like that; parts of it so large, it was breaching the surface of the bowl water. Big around as a baby\u2019s arm, with distinct layers from several meals.

            "We had a guy we called \"Lester The Nester\" at work.\n\nStory time.\n\nSo, I work at a large campus with dozens of buildings. Due to the nature of my work, the group I work with uses a lot of physical space relative to the number of people working in the building. As you can imagine, with such a low worker density, pretty much everyone in our building knows each other. Moreover, the ass-to-toilet ratio is primo...I mean there are probably more toilets in our building than people that regularly are in the building. The bathrooms were always clean. If you're poop shy you could always find a bathroom without feet under the stall. You could say that our building was the best kept pooping secret on campus. That is, until it wasn't.\n\nOne day I took stroll into the handicrapper to unload my morning constitutional. As you're anticipating, I happened upon an absolutely *battle* scene (much to my dismay). Toilet paper everywhere. Like, an entire roll laid upon the seat alone, with scraps of toilet paper scattered about, some dangling off the hand rail, balls of toilet paper on the floor. This person put a TON of effort into turning the first-class stall into their poop paradise. No amount of cheek sweat was penetrating the toilet paper ass-gasket that this poopetrator deposited. But, to make matters worse, the motherfucker left the most *heinous* diarrhea splattered *everywhere.* I don't even understand how they did it. The water was...black. Poop up the sides of the bowl. Some splattered along the rim. It was truly impressive. I can only imagine he decided to leave it so we could all appreciate his handiwork. What baffled me is that for all of the toilet paper he used, *there wasn't any in the bowl from him wiping.*\n\nMy mistake was thinking this was a one off occurrence. This went on daily for *months*. It was the most talked about water cooler topic throughout Lester's magnificent run(s). That is, until one of my coworkers caught Lester in the act. Turns out it was an intern in his early 20's that came from *all the fucking way across campus just to destroy our innocence.* I think the shame of being caught in the act scared him away, because he was never to be seen or smelled again. Sometimes I still wondered how he cleaned up his ass without leaving a trace of skidmarked toilet paper.  \n\n\nEdit: corrected a couple grammar mistakes.",

            "I have a confession to make.\n\nMany years ago, I was invited to an acquaintances 21st birthday party at a local Mexican restaurant.\n\nThis girl was someone I had partied with a few times, and we were on decent terms.  I went mostly cuz I knew she had a bunch of hot friends.\n\nSo I get there, and sure enough, beautiful girls are all over the place.  I knew I didn't have a legit shot with most of them, but a guy can dream right?   Plus, this was at a time when I was in pretty decent shape, and was putting effort into how I looked, so if ever there was a time for me to get lucky, this was it.\n\nSo we're having our drinks, chips & salsa, etc, and then the entrees get brought out.  I think I just had some chicken fajitas or something, but whatever it was caused some kind of fierce reaction in my stomach.  Towards the end of our meal, I knew I couldn't hold it anymore, so I excused myself to go to the bathroom.\n\nIt was a smaller bathroom, only 2 stalls, and 2 urinals, which is kind of odd, considering how big this restaurant was.  Luckily, I was in there by myself, so I absolutely destroyed that poor toilet.\n\nUnlucky for me though, is that this was one of those poos that just won't seem to come clean from your ass, no matter how many times you wipe.  By the time I got myself clean, I realized I hadn't done any kind of courtesy flush, so the toilet was pretty full of TP.\n\nI tried to flush it, but of course, it got clogged.  But it wasn't just a regular clogging toilet, this was one that kept running when it clogged.  So there I am, freaking out, as this toilet is leaking shitty water all over the place, and I have no idea how to stop it.\n\nSo I did what anyone would do in that situation.\n\nI escaped from the crime scene.\n\nI made it back to our table, with nobody the wiser.  A few minutes go by, and I saw some older guy make his way to the bathroom.  By this point, I'd imagine the floor was covered in shit water.  I didn't stick around long enough to find out though, as we paid for our bills, and left.\n\nTo whomever it was that had to go clean up that mess, I am truly sorry.  The toilet breaking poo ruined your night, and my excess booze drinking later that night ruined my chances of getting with any of the pretty girls at the party.",
            "When I was in college, I went to a fraternity house for a party. In the women's bathroom, someone took a dump and didn't flush. I shit you not, the monstrosity that was left was the size of a hoagie roll (like 8 inches long and 4 inches in diameter). One of the frat guys had to break it up with a gardening spade for it to flush. To this day, I have no idea how someone pushed that out their ass.",
            "I used to work at a pet store in college. In the winter it can get cold (PA) and people wear long Johns if they really wanna stay warm. Whatever. I\u2019m working my normal cashier shift, helping customers, etc. then my manager asks me to tend to some cleaning in the bathroom, which I\u2019ve never seen anyone else asked to do prior. After trying to coax my way out of the task to no avail, I was told \u201cthrow hot buckets of water at it\u201d.\n\nSo I go to the janitors closet and grab a bucket, fill it with hot water, and go to examine this mess that needed cleaning. Unbeknownst to me, there was poop everywhere. The wall, the seat, the handle, and the long Johns which this person shit in and left for me. \n\nFollowing direct orders, I took said hot bucket o\u2019water and started hurling it at the wall, toilet, floor, everywhere. After maybe 3-4 bucket fulls, I reported back to management to say I did as needed and was treated to a nice 15min break for my hard work. \n\nWhile I\u2019m sitting in the break room eating a snack, another manager comes in and said \u201cyou guys should see what happened in the men\u2019s room. Looks like someone clogged the toilet there is water EVERYWHERE\u201d.\n\nMe, being the idiot I was, replied \u201cthat\u2019s because (district manager) told me to throw buckets of water at it. \n\nHe looked befuddled, like if he just heard the dumbest thing ever. Questioned me why I would listen to someone that says to do that. So I grab the DM and he repeats, \u201cI told him to throw hot buckets of water at it\u201d.\n\nSo there it stood, a water soaked floor, splashed walls, with resonating stench of doodoo and smears still on the wall. We put a \u2018Bathroom Out Of Order\u2019 sign thingy in front and called it a day.\n\nAnd that was the last time I \u2018cleaned\u2019 a public bathroom.",

            "I was working at a Panera Bread a few years ago. This 16 year old kid, first day in the job comes up to me close to closing with this look of concern on his face. Like he has just witnessed eternity and his mind was trying it's damned best not to split from the strain of comprehension. He ushered me I to the women's restroom and bade me look I to the stall.\n\nNow I wish I was exaggerating the size of this thing. Thicker than a coke can (might've been twice as so), longer than a subway footlong was one, single unbroken, horrific LOG so fucking big it was sticking OUT OF THE TOILET like some curious horror wanting to stare at you over the lip of the bowl. \n\nI told the kid to not let any other customers in, went and got my assistant (I was a shift at the time) and between the two of us, wearing these long yellow hazmat looking gloves with food prep gloves underneath for extra measure hoist this whale of a turd into a trash bag, double, triple, quadruple bag this thing (hence how I know it was definitely bigger, couldn't close your hand around this thing and GOD DAMN was it DENSE.) And haul ass to the dumpster with it. Naturally the gloves went with it, they were technically for dish washing but I didn't trust any amount of sanitizing to make those things dish worthy again. We swore to never speak of it again and I spent the rest of the night in silent horror wondering if whoever had spawned that unholy thing was okay because how in gods name anyone could pass that from their rectum and still be in any condition called living is beyond me.",

My wife pulled into a Walmart or fred Meyer (I was really sick and don\u2019t remember where I was) and I hobbled to the restroom, stumbled into a stall, and pulled down my pants. As I was about to fall/sit I noticed shit already in the toilet and knew that what I was about to do was not only a horrible idea, but fucking gross as shit. It all came ripping out of me, I was in pain, crying, embarrassed. I swear there was a mound of mixed shit rising over the toilet seat. There was no way all of this was going down and I didn\u2019t even try to flush. I cleaned my self the best I could, I wasn\u2019t doing well and needed to be in a hospital. I wobbled out of the bathroom and past an employee that gave me a worried look, I told them I was sorry and made my way to the exit, found my wife, and woke up in the hospital where I stayed in ICU for two days. I\u2019m still very sorry for what I did and it\u2019s one of my biggest regrets.",
            "Military story: many years ago, in the army we were out in the bush somewhere on an exercise. Infantry protocol is that you go out \u2018through the gun\u2019. In other words you let the machine gun team know you\u2019re off for a crap. You also have to have at least your head visible at all times. The reason being, you don\u2019t want to get cut in half by your own team as you wander back inside your perimeter. Typically the machine gun team would see a guy go down to a bush and squat. All you see is a head and maybe hear a few straining grunts. All adult males... no big deal.\nA couple of years later, on the officer course, same deal. Out \u2018through the gun\u2019 to take a dump. Only issue is now there are women as well. Still not a huge issue; all adults and you only see a head.\nAs anyone who\u2019s eaten ration packs will tell you; you simply don\u2019t shit for about a week. Much like previously mentioned heroin stories, it\u2019s concrete.\nWe had one woman who was tiny. Super petite and pretty hot. She went out for a crap.\nAbout an hour later we were on the move and as luck would have it, we pass by the shit site...\nHow that tiny woman passed that 18\u201d long, 5\u201d wide WMD is beyond me. It must have measurably reduced her body weight. It was like an artillery shell just lying there. She hadn\u2019t even bothered to bury it.\nWhile not a \u2018torlet\u2019 story per se, I\u2019m convinced that if you can\u2019t be bothered to bury it, you probably wouldn\u2019t flush it either.\nShe didn\u2019t seem so hot after that...",
            "For an honest answer.... \nI once worked with a guy that had a condition called mega colon. His shits were ...no lie ...the size of Subway foot longs. Just the way his body was built. We had hard times placing him at places to work because he destroyed plumbing. So we had to always put him at a place with an outhouse. He even said he ruined his father in laws septic tank. I was his boss at the time so I was sent photos and complaints of what he left in bathrooms. Really feel for the dude cuz my ass couldn\u2019t handle that on a daily basis. \nAlso, I have a father in law who for a time had a colostomy bag. Apparently it can \u201cmalfunction\u201d, sometimes it leaks, becomes detached, gets too full, or in one instant tore while using the bathroom. We were at a restaurant and he sat back down, let the waiter know there was a mess to clean up and tipped them generously. \nSometimes it really is the little things we all take for granted.",

            "Story Time...I was a head resident in a women's dorm when I was in grad school.  One night I took the elevator down to the basement to do some laundry.  The elevator let out in a back hallway next to the only men's room in the building. I drag my laundry bag out to the laundry room and notice I'm dragging a brown smear after me. I quickly dump all my laundry into the machine and throw away the bag.  In sheer horror and curiosity I go back to the hallway and turn on the lights... there's poop plops on the floor.  I enter the men's restroom and there's poop everywhere,  toilet, seats,  walls.  \n\nI went to a fairly fancy,  high class, college.  The dorms were locked to anyone except residents and guests.  There were no sketchy strangers or homeless people on  campus... this means that poop explosion had to have been by some upper middle class, college-age boy. How someone had that tragic of a pooping experience,  in public,  and managed to escape without being caught covered in poop, is a mystery to me to this very day.

            "I have posted this in a previous thread. I just don't understand either.\n\n\"I was a bar tender for 10 years. One of my places of employment was too cheap to have a cleaning crew come in after Saturday night's festivities so I would have to do it on my Sunday morning shift. The bar tenders (and owner) who worked Saturday nights would get just as drunk and rowdy as the patrons. As a result, they would stumble out the doors with the patrons and lock up. It was like opening a time capsule when I opened up. It looked like staging for a Quinton Tarantino movie after a bar fight scene. I cleaned up blood, teeth, broken glass, puddles of vomit (everywhere, even in the indoor fake flower beds and under the booth SEATS), underwear, torn bloodied clothing, and feces in the toilet rooms. Soooooooo much feces. Pounds of feces in one particular dump where the patron held themselves up BETWEEN the clean toilet and stall wall and crapped like a sick, constapated, cow. A cow that never missed a meal but did miss a few weeks of being able to relieve themselves of natural daily pooping. It was splattered on all of the surrounding surfaces, buried the toilet screws that held it to the floor, behind the toilet, then spooged under the stall wall across the floor to the inner wall under the sink. Since it had been left to dry and harden for a few hours into a huge crispy edged fudge patty, it took a flat edged shovel to scrape it up (I guessed this is exactly why we had one in the closet). I dry heaved the entire 40 minutes it took to clean up.\"\n\nI just cannot wrap my head around \"why.\"",

Least of all a puny, wimpy public toilet with a measly flow of water. \n\nAnd in the end, I do feel pretty bad, but I really can\u2019t get the toilet to flush, so... might as well be proud of my poop. \ud83d\udca9 \ud83d\udca9 \ud83d\udca9",

The handling of this situation was not thought out very well. We know that within the first 20 years of every century since 1420 there has been a global outbreak. We know that it takes two or more years to recover. Nothing has been done to preserve businesses or keep certain industries alive. Stores are starting to run out of stock simply because people are staying home instead of making things for stores to sell. I went to Frys recently and almost half the store is empty. Stock on various items is just not available. I went to Michaels a few weeks ago and they are almost out of all of their painting supplies. If this continues, those stores will not be able to sell enough product to stay in business. This will have a ripple effect that will impact the entire economy. For reference, I live in the SW USA.

            "I hate to break it to you, but there really is no \"if\" here. Keep an eye on the million acre megafires and back to back to back hurricanes, the unprecedented absence of sea ice, the melting permafrost and massive methane leaks (not to mention ancient pathogens with the potential to cause new pandemics). Once it really sinks in that this is not only the new normal, but will continue to get worse, a whole lot of valuable property will become effectively unisurable / unsellable. Millions, if not tens of millions, of people will go bankrupt and relocate in a relatively brief time span. This will add pressure in safer (for a while) areas to already nearly exhausted top soil and ground water to say nothing of decaying infrastructure (In the US at least. Mileage may vary in developed countries). Between this and the continuing / worsening crop losses due to erratic flooding, intense winds (looking at you on both in two years, Iowa) etc. will very likely lead to food shortages. Homelessness will skyrocket. This will cause massive social upheaval and likely cause banks to fail. We're in that moment at the high point of the track on a roller coaster where you first feel your ass lifting out of the seat as you start downward. Make sure your seat belt is fastened.

The whole world is so connected now and the wealthiest countries knew that they had to support the lives and livelihoods of the weaker economies for their own protection too. Unemployment is of course high, but the basic structure of our economy is preserved and it can recover.\n\n[Why  we won\u2019t have a second Great Depression - remarkable advances in  science, epidemiology, economics, and many world institutions that  didn\u2019t exist in the 1930s](https://www.quora.com/q/duzzmyeobxjljrpq/Why-we-won-t-have-a-second-Great-Depression-remarkable-advances-in-science-epidemiology-economics-and-many-world-in)\n\n# PLEDGES TO HALT AND REVERSE BIODIVERSITY LOSS\n\nThe IPBES report in 2019 showed us how to stop and reverse biodiversity loss. The number one thing is to stop perverse subsidies that subsidise the bad actors that destroy nature services - we need to subsidise the good actors that are sustainable and preserve nature services. Several other things they specifically identified. We save 3 species for every 1 species we lose that's at the brink of extinction but we should be able to save them all.\n\nSo, the good news is that leaders of 71 nations have already signed the \"leader's pledge\" to do this and things are looking good in the lead up to the next biodiversity summit in 2021 when we should be getting firm commitments by many nations on this.\n\n[Leaders pledge to stop and reverse destruction of biodiversity by 2030 and make this part of the COVID19 recovery](https://www.quora.com/q/duzzmyeobxjljrpq/Leaders-pledge-to-stop-and-reverse-destruction-of-biodiversity-by-2030-and-make-this-part-of-the-COVID19-recovery)\n\nMany countries are using this for green recovery, it turns out that jobs making renewables or improving efficiency of homes  or protecting nature services are good for the economy and build it back stronger. Instead of a short term boost of jobs you get a long term self-reinforcing boost to the economy.\n\n[COVID-19  recession - protecting damage to economy and livelihoods worldwide -  many countries will use recovery period to rebuild industry favouring  green / renewables / sutainability / nature services / biodiversity](https://www.quora.com/q/duzzmyeobxjljrpq/COVID-19-recession-protecting-damage-to-economy-and-livelihoods-worldwide-many-countries-will-use-recovery-period-to)\n\n# CHINA TO TARGET ZERO EMISSIONS BY 2060\n\nChina has recently made a statement of intent to target zero emissions by 2060\n\nWith this new target the world is headed for 2.35 C by 2100.\n\n[With  China\u2019s new target of zero emissions by 2060, world targets 2.35 \u00b0C for  the end of the century - a reduction of 0.25 \u00b0C (Cambridge  Econometrics) - Carbon Action Tracker gives similar projection](https://www.quora.com/q/duzzmyeobxjljrpq/With-China-s-new-target-of-zero-emissions-by-2060-world-targets-2-35-C-for-the-end-of-the-century-a-reduction-of-0-2)\n\nPartly due to China, renewables are cost competitive with the lowest cost fossil fuels almost everywhere including cloudy UK where I live.  Prices of solar have fallen a remarkable 10 fold in 10 years.\n\nWith Perovskite another halving seems set to happen sooner rather than later - they are already beginning the process of scaling up to industrial levels of production as they refine the details of the technology - it looks promising. Once solar costs half the price of fossil fuels, which will happen at some point, it makes a pledge to zero emissions by 2050 easier.  [Perovskite could halve solar panel prices yet again, as soon as 2022 - already competitive with lowest cost fossil fuels](https://www.quora.com/q/duzzmyeobxjljrpq/Perovskite-could-halve-solar-panel-prices-yet-again-as-soon-as-2022-already-competitive-with-lowest-cost-fossil-fuels)\n\n# JAPAN TARGETS ZERO EMISSIONS BY 2050 - JOINING SOUTH KOREA, THE EU, UK, CALIFORNIA ETC\n\nJapan to pledge to zero emissions by 2050 - that's about 3% of world emissions, adds to South Korea, UK, EU, California and then India is 2 C compatible already and China statement of intent for zero emissions by 2060 which is nearly 1.5 C compatible - and many smaller countries. More and more of the map gradually turning to 1.5 C compatible.\n\nRemember we have until 2021 for countries to make their next round of pledges. Then another round in 2025 then 2030 and every 5 years from then on.\n\n[https://uk.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUKKBN2761EO](https://uk.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUKKBN2761EO)\n\nThe idea of the Paris agreement was never to be able to target 1.5 C in 2015. It was to make more ambitious targets, every 5 years, build our ambitions based on our experience from the last 5 years, built to a more ambitious target and so on. We are doing exactly that. Next round of pledges in 2021 then 2025, 2030 and every 5 years afterwards.\n\n# OVER WORST OF COVID19 BY END OF 2021\n\nWe can be over the worst of COVID19 by the end of 2021 with a vaccine.

They have now [signed agreements to supply a billion doses of vaccine](https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/cepi-expands-global-manufacturing-network-reserving-manufacturing-capacity-over-1-billion-doses) \\- their aim is 2 billion by the end of 2021 so they are half-way there already.\n\nThe 3% will be enough to vaccinate all key workers / health workers / vulnerable (care homes etc) and then to target superspreader events - a targeted vaccination like that can achieve far more than you'd expect from the % of the population.\n\nSome countries like the US, EU, Brazil, Mexico etc  have separate bilateral agreements to target all or nearly all their population early.\n\nThere are five oral vaccines, one of them, Vaxart, in phase 1 trials already - these would be as easy to take as any tablet and would make vaccinating the world much easier they also are far easier to make.\n\nThe most recent news was that the Oxford vaccine triggers a strong immune response in both elderly people and the very young and they also don't get bad adverse reactions in them either. That's all very good if it works as a vaccine. Still don't know if the immune response protects you - that is what the phase 3 trial will show.\n\nThe new thing is they have shown that their vaccine generates a good immune response in elderly people older than 55, and that it also has low reactivity - they don't have bad adverse reactions to the vaccine itself. They don't say what their source is for this data but will publish it soon. They don't yet know that the vaccine works because they don't know if the immune response protects you - that's what the phase 3 trials are for\n\n\\[usually an immune response does protect you but AIDS is an example of a virus that triggers an immune response that doesn't protect you, coronaviruses are not as bad as AIDS but they do have some of the glycan coverings that can make an immune response less effective so they have to deal with that\\]\n\n[https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/26/oxford-vaccine-prompts-immune-response-in-old-people-astrazeneca](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/26/oxford-vaccine-prompts-immune-response-in-old-people-astrazeneca)\n\n#",

If they are wrong, the world is about to change in ways you cannot imagine.\n\nThere is not one shred of long term historical evidence to suggest that NMT is right.",

            "Last week, FedEx delivered some of the gifts I'd ordered, but instead of placing them on my porch, they left them *behind my vehicle in the driveway.*\n\nI subsequently backed over them when I went to get groceries.\n\nEdit 1 - To try and answer some common questions from the comments: Holiday not really ruined, just a frustrating turn of events.  No kids, indoor-only pets.  Long, private drive separated by several hundred feet of woods in each direction from neighbors.  Packages were small enough to pass beneath the bumper of the truck, and positioned close enough that they could not be seen from the rear and side view mirrors.  I live in a remote enough location that porch pirates are a non-issue.  \n\nEdit 2 - I appreciate the condolences, but I urge everyone to remember that the people delivering these packages are going through a lot right now.  I can't imagine the stress of working during a shipping season of unprecedented volume, let alone making it through a year like this, when nearly every tiny bit of normalcy we experience falls on them to deliver.  A lot of these folks are probably seasonal temps just trying to do whatever they can to make ends meet during these trying economic times.  If I was responsible for carrying the happiness of hundreds of people on my shoulders every day, I'd probably do something like this myself.  They're just *things* anyways, and things are replaceable; and fleeting frustrations will fade to fonder memories that we can laugh at down the line.\n\nHappy holidays to all, and blessings to you and yours in the coming year!",

There nothing wrong with working on relationships and giving second chances, but know when enough is enough. You ARE good enough.\n\nI'll tell last year's story:\n\nMy Dad and his wife live in the Midwest. My wife and I live in California. In September, my Dad had asked my wife and I to consider moving to the same Midwest city as him and his wife. My Dad said he'd help us with moving expenses, buying a house, or whatever else we needed (my Dad and his wife are millionaires - my wife and I are not nearly as well off, but are just starting our careers). My wife and I talked about it, and we liked the city, and the prospect of getting some help buying a house (which we all know is a dying millennial dream) was enough for us to say yes. \n\nMy dad and his wife had just purchased a new home and told us that as soon as they sold their old home, they'd co-sign and/or help with a down payment on a house in their city. They hooked us up with their realtor right away and informed their realtor of the gameplan. We're looking at homes online the entire time and making a list of houses to view when we return to the Midwest for Christmas. \n\nFast forward three months:\n\nChristmas morning: After opening presents, in front of the ENTIRE family, my Dad tells me that he's decided he wants to put in a pool and doesn't want to help us buy a house. He then avoids me for the next three days, and the night before my wife and I are supposed to fly back out, I've had enough. I tell my wife to pack her bags and we'll stay in a hotel the last night. My dad overhears us talking about it, interjects (after literally not seeing him for three days, despite being in the same house) and I calmly confront him about the entire situation. His wife flies off the handle and literally bum rushes me from across the room, completely unprovoked, my dad has to restrain her. She tells me to leave and never come back. My Dad backs her up and says \"yeah, if you don't leave, I'm going to call the police\". I scoffed, pointed out that we were already leaving, and called an Uber. \n\nHaven't talked to him since - we blocked him and his wife. \n\nA year later, my wife and I are six months pregnant, I just got my dream job making great money - my Dad has no idea about either. Additionally, my brother and his girlfriend refused to visit my Dad for Christmas and have more or less cut contact with my dad and his wife. \n\nTLDR: Dad is a POS and now his kids want nothing to do with him.",

            "My sister went and died.",
            "So it was a group effort of my parents. Last summer during quarentine, my mom decided to finally divorce my dad. My dad had been an alcoholic for a while, and eight or nine years ago my mom had decided not to divorce because my oldest sister (14 at the time) would have had to be the sober adult on the days that us three kids were with our dad. Now that I (the youngest) am almost out of highschool, she felt it was safe for us kids to handle the divorce.\n\nIt's complicated and I've already rambled enough already, so I'll just say that my mom has had enough trying to make things work and my dad is in denial, thinking we can still work something out without going to a full divorce (he also blames himself for everything when it really just didn't work out).\n\nA week or two ago, my dad gave me a very emotionally distressed text that was basically an ultimatum, telling me to choose between my two parents. This gave me an opportunity to stop going to his house every week and stay with my mom indefinitely. Now it's christmas though, and we're spending christmas morning at his house so that he's not alone like he was on thanksgiving.\n\nMy dad means well, but he goes crying over every little thing and being around him makes everyone in the family depressed. Let's see how this morning goes. I'm on my way now.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention that my dad is now 7 months sober and counting. It means a lot to him, just it seems like no one cares.",
            "I wouldn't say it ruined Christmas, but my cousin died by suicide almost a month ago and my aunt called my mom crying this morning because they have to do Christmas without her. \n\nSort of put a damper on everyone's mood. To be clear, I'm not blaming my aunt, it's just really sad. My mom was crying, my dad was crying...it's just hard. \n\nWhen we have moments of joy, it makes me feel guilty because she's gone, and then I also feel really upset because I wish there was something I could have done. Just a sad time.",
            "My grandmother. She died. \n(I wish this was a joke, but she really did die peacefully the morning of 12/24. We think she waited specifically for that day because she knew we\u2019d be together and our Christmas traditions would help us get through the tough day.)",

So over at our grandma's we only get like a couple presents and half of them were clothes. Rock on for me because I needed some. But, my little brother (11) decided to say and loudly repeat \"Can we go home, all I got was clothes. I want to go home!\" This looked so disrespectful to everyone because all he was thinking about presents and he wasn't grateful. I got the same amount of clothes and the two other things I got their I thought were cool and made sure to SHOW my appreciation. Sorry for the rambling, it was just annoying when everyone is doing their thing and I'm the only one hears him being ungrateful",
            "My stupid fucking uncle. The story behind why I hate him is long and involved, but every year I hate him and my awful cousins just a little bit more. This year though? Fuck him. My 83 year old grandma had been caring for my 88 year old grandpa with dementia, incontinence, and legs so bad he could barely stand let alone get around. My grandfather was horrible to her because he was so confused he couldn\u2019t figure things out and lashed out at her. My mom went up and helped as much as she could, and I did too. My uncle never lifted a motherfucking finger, but made her feel guilty about putting him in respite care because of covid. She was all alone, no outside help could come in because of covid. And yet he bitched at her for even thinking about putting him in respite just so she could get a break from the 24 hour care.\n\nShe eventually snapped and had a mental breakdown from the stress and ended up putting my grandpa in respite, where unfortunately he suffered a stroke and died a couple of months later. Did my uncle help plan arrangements? No. Did he go to my grandma\u2019s at all the day he died? No. Then he insulted my mom because she didn\u2019t personally give him the funeral plans even though my aunt was there the whole time and could have told him at any time. \n\nThen, THEN he actually whines about not having a traditional thanksgiving dinner and made my grandma feel so guilty that she prepared dinner for his family by herself, ONE MONTH after my grandfather\u2019s death.AND did his usual thing of arriving 2 hours late leaving her sitting there trying to keep food warm. Like she has to do every year.\n\nThis year I said fuck that, I\u2019ll have Christmas here and you do whatever the fuck you want but it will NOT involve guilting my grandma again to make a whole Christmas dinner for your selfish, whiny ass.\n\nPlans changed and me and my brother (plus our spouses and children) are going to my grandma\u2019s on Sunday. But could he leave well enough alone? No, now he\u2019s intruding on my nice relaxed Christmas with my grandma and I have to be forced to be in the same room as his racist homophobic selfish whiny immature ass.\n\nSaving grace is my terrible cousins will not be there.\n\nIf he follows the same pattern as every year before though he will be 2-3 hours late and we will already be gone so it won\u2019t matter.",

And I have automatic tool changing with 20 pockets. \n  \nLong story short I figured out how to line up the jobs so they all have the same setup. \n  \nBlew the record out of the water with 30 jobs done in one day. \n  \nSaving the company tens of thousands in work hours. \n  \nAll because I didnt feel like doing all the setups that day.",

            "I worked a summer at a mortgage company as an assistant to the underwriters. My only job was printing documents and then hole-punching them to put in folders. They had a super fancy xerox printer that basically did my entire job for me, but the underwriters at this company didn\u2019t know how to click through printer settings to make the machine hole-punch as it was being printed. I showed them how to do it, and they resisted it suuuuper hard (like they didn\u2019t trust it? Idk). So I got to keep my job, but what was supposed to take me all day literally took me about 20-30 minutes first thing in the morning. So they started assigning me real tasks, and even offered to keep me on to eventually become an underwriter, too. Because I was \u201cso sharp\u201d (i.e. I knew how to use the very expensive printer they already had). I was just about to start grad school, so I had to politely decline... but I\u2019m pretty sure they didn\u2019t hire someone to replace me when I left. \n\nTl;dr: they had a printer that already did my job for me but didn\u2019t know how to use it.

            "I used to process HSA claims, around 10+ years ago. One system we had to use back then was an old as hell terminal program that took four line items per page, that's it. For a usual claim, no big deal, not to hard to keep track of things over 2 or 3 pages for a longer claim, most fit on one. \n\nHowever we had the dreaded shoebox claims. This was the person who saved up every receipt  all year in a metaphorical shoebox, and sent everything in, once a year, to empty their account. We hated them. Dozens or hundreds of line items totalling thousands of dollars. Just because you only have $500 in your HSA doesn't mean we get to stop there. If you sent in $4000 in receipts, I gotta account for it all. Totally killed your numbers for the day, and they tracked claims per hour religiously.\n\nThe main issue was double checking that everything added up right when you were done entering it, at four items a page it took forever to tally. So, I made an excel sheet. It was laid out so I could enter every single line, then run a macro that would calculate the needed totals, and dump all the text to a text file formatted exactly so I could select four items at a time, and paste them directly into the terminal window from the default starting cursor position, and every field would fill in automatically. Copy, paste, next, copy, paste, next, copy, paste, next... Etc etc. It easily halved my entry times, with way less work. Finding any typos was much easier, I just had to look at one column organized sheet instead of scrolling thru God knows how many pages of terminal text. It was great.\n\nI showed it to my Manger so the rest of my team could use it. She was horrified I would use something like that, as no human was \"double checking as they went along\". This despite demonstrable improvements to my error rates on large claims after I started using it. She ordered me to stop using it and forbid anyone in her team from automating any part of their job at all.\n\nI kept using it for all of the two months I stayed there after that. I had some of the highest claim per hour numbers and lowest error rates on her team. I never developed any more tools for them. Fuck her.",

Went on r/excel and found out how to make a mailer list and hours of work takes me 10 minutes. I didn\u2019t tell anyone this though so I just take my time. \n\nThen I had to make floor maps for restaurants to send to the company that puts them into our scheduling program.

Im fucken picasso with Microsoft paint.\n\nThen they wanted me to use excel to keep track of training teams. One of my coworkers used Smartsheet and loves to teach people things.

My job was \"materials associate\" which basically meant I drove a fork lift and staged parts that were built. The \"Engineers\" came up with a floor plan for all of the parts and where they needed to be staged. They used fancy lasers and measuring devices and built it all in CAD. After telling them it wouldn't work they said \" well lets see you do a better job\". I organized the entire 50,000 sq/ft warehouse so that each part was close to the machines that use them, it followed the first in first out method, and each department knew where their parts went when they were done making them (put up signs and what not). After that my job was basically pointless because the warehouse ran its self. I decided to teach myself how to use the welding robots in my downtime.

            "My buddy wasn't so much lazy as he abhorred inefficiency. So nearly 20 years ago he worked for a company that sold slightly differing models of widgets. His job was a secondary inventory of what widgets were in stock (primary was based on receiving and sales), and it was tracked with a long barcode. Widgets were stored in a warehouse and might be pulled by a salesperson to show a customer. Inventory was weekly and would take that long to collect, compile, and submit it the manual way his boss and predecessor managed the process.\n\nBack in the early 2000s, Palm had the handheld computing market covered and my buddy was pondering a future in technology. He approached his boss about purchasing a Palm device and a barcode scanner to modernize the process. He was denied based on cost/benefit since he was making minimum wage to do a basic thing and there wasn't anything else he could be doing. My buddy says screw it, buys equipment and spends his evenings making a really shitty app that will dump the info into Excel. He adds a couple additions like warehouse location to the data input/output and calls it good.\n\nHe asks his boss to start working early on Mondays. Boss figures why not since receiving is already there. Buddy walks the warehouse with his device scanning away doing 3 days worth of work in just under 8 hours. He leaves around normal people's lunch and goes home to dump the raw data. He spends the afternoon tinkering with the data output and eventually has a fully functional system.\n\nTuesday at start of business he hands the manager the weekly report. Manager is obviously shocked until my friend showed him what he had done. Manager pauses not knowing what to think, and allows him a half day at full pay since he worked at home last night.\n\nWednesday my buddy asks if there's anything else he could be doing to help out. He gets sat with the web design team and starts doing more techy stuff there. Thursday manager asks for another full report which is annoying because widgets can move around during business hours, but he gets it done. Friday his manager has another report and my friend goes back to work with the web team.\n\nSo my buddy has made his position all but redundant and he's developing html skills. He eventually finds a new job more in line with his talents. His manager of course asks for the hardware/software that's been in use over the last several months. My buddy offers to sell it to him, but the manager doesn't see it that way, he sees it as an in house developed thing that the company owns. My buddy laughs since he has the receipts for the hardware and the developed code on his home PC.  My buddy leaves and ignores subsequent calls from his old boss. Inventory returned to being a weekly task that consumed the entire week. My buddy still hates inefficiency to the point where he automates as many things as possible.  https://xkcd.com/1319/ is very apt in his life.",

            "TV/Film production.  I think most people dream of being the actor, the director, the people making the creative decisions, or the big shot producer calling the shots, but most of the people working in tv and film production are part of a machine, the grind, working in a system, trying to climb up to wherever they want to be.  Many don\u2019t get to actualize their creative vision.  Also the industry can be project based (job security concerns) and location limited (NY/LA, maybe other cities).  Pay can be low starting out too, though it can be good if you work way up.  But I did enjoy the type of people that work these jobs, a little more fun than the business folk I work with now.\n\nEdit: Just want to note I have a lot of respect for the tv/film industry.

            "Working in an animal shelter. For sure, it\u2019s probably less intense than zookeeping, but the amount of people who apply or volunteer expecting to come in and play with cute puppies all day is absurd. We\u2019re basically animal maids. You deal with animals of all sorts of behavioral and developmental stages shitting and pissing every fucking where and then you look over and this fucking dog named Chumbawumba swimming in his water bowl so you gotta fill that up six times and dry his kennel out and then you go and mop up the cat room around 10 kittens who want to eat your mop and also four children who are all yelling that there\u2019s puke in the floor and I MUST clean it, NOW. Not to mention all the extra behind the scenes work that the public never sees. How in the summer, during kitten and puppy season, the shelter built to house 500 max has 750 and I didn\u2019t take a lunch or sit at all for any of my shifts for the past six days. How the courts force us to put down animals that we know can be rehabilitated, but we don\u2019t get enough funding to fight it. How animal control just showed up with the fourth pregnant stray of the week but intake is full and even double stacked in some cases, so your coworker fosters the cats on her own. Not even to mention the shitty fucking people who do dumb shit and end up getting bit or scratched and the animal is the one who bears those consequences. I am the proudest shelter worker in the world. I adore my job, even at its hardest. I didn\u2019t sit for 9 and a half hours today and I found a cat turd in the cuff of my jeans but it doesn\u2019t matter because a bonded pair of adult cats got adopted today.

            "Being an extra in a movie. Now, it can be super fun (I especially love historical and post-apocalyptic/sci-fi/fantasy type stuff), but a typical day on set wasn't what I thought it'd be when I started doing it. Often we have to get up at 3 or 4 in the morning to get to holding, and if you're a minute late to check in sometimes they'll kick you out. Then we sit around in holding with sometimes hundreds of other extras, and we're usually sitting there for a good three or four hours before they start telling us to get ready to film. During this time we go through long wardrobe, hair and makeup lines where they reuse clothes (unless you bring them yourself), brushes and makeup without washing them.\n\nWhen we finally get to film, it's often the same mundane motions over and over (exceptions of course, and those are always fun) Then we either get shuffled around or go back to holding. Several more hours pass, we go film again. Hungry? You get lunch six hours after your call time, and a usually meager supply of snacks. In between takes it's more standing around, often in heat or rain or we all get shuffled into cramped spaces to wait. \n\nDays on set are often more than 12 hours, and I know someone who had to be on set for 26 hours straight. They can legally hold you there until they declared filming is done, so don't make plans for the next day. Not to mention that you rarely see yourself in the final cut. I'm not trying to bash other background actors or the film industry because I've met lots of awesome people and gotten to do some pretty cool things. For example, interacting with main actors in scenes, running around in the woods with fake guns or being a zombie. But when I did my first job as a teen, I definitely thought it would be a lot different.\n\nETA: Like others mentioned, I'm not part of the SAG union, and extras who are do indeed get treated better/more perks. Also, it may be different in Hollywood--I've only worked in Georgia. I've also been a stand-in, and I like that a lot better because you're treated as the crew rather than, well, as extra.",
            "FLIGHT ATTENDANT. 1) You are on call (on reserve) forever, have a terrible schedule, have no life, and make no money for 5-10 years. 2) While you work for peanuts, you can\u2019t afford to use your flight \u201cbenefits\u201d in any substantial way. 3) Then, when you finally get a chance to use your benefits for a trip, you have to fly standby which means you aren\u2019t guaranteed to get on the flight you want. 4) Then, if you do make it out of town you better have like a week off so you can make damn sure you\u2019re back in your base city in time for your next work shift. 5) Did I mention there is an act of US legislation (Railway Labor Act) that allows airlines to exploit so you don\u2019t get paid for certain work hours that you actually need to be working? For example, FAs don\u2019t get paid for boarding, or any time the plane is at the gate. WORST JOB EVER.\n\nEdit: Typos and clarity.",
            "Google Street View driver.\n\nYou're all alone for 8+ hours a day, can almost never take a break, need to constantly be \"on\" and focused (lest you crash the $25,000 Subaru with $60,000+ worth of camera equipment on it), you end up becoming an amateur meteorologist to keep track of weather patterns and cloud cover, and in my experience there are a lot of people who just get insanely upset at you, at Google, and the job in general for a wide variety of reasons. I enjoyed myself when I did it, but it was nowhere near as glamorous or fun as I or my friends & family assumed.\n\nEdit: Thanks to everyone who expressed an interest in my summer job from almost 10 years ago. I'll just answer the most asked questions here real quick:\n\nPay? $15 an hour, but contingent on hours driven, which were themselves dependent on clear weather to ensure optimal image quality \n\nWhy not drive every day no matter the weather? Google got around this problem by making you re-drive routes whose pictures turned out subpar. To prevent people double billing by driving the same easy route constantly, you also had a weekly quota of unique miles driven, so no double dipping.\n\nWhat could you do in the car? As long as the camera and the napping software (Edit: MAPPING software, thanks for the heads up) was running properly I was on my own. I listened to music, the news, and lots of books on tape. I could stop for short bathroom breaks whenever I felt like it, and had an hour guaranteed for lunch whenever I wanted to take it, which usually amounted to eating in the car on the side of some lonely rural road 90% of the time.\n\nWho would ever think this was fun or glamorous? All I can say is, back in 2012 most people I talked to were pretty excited, myself included, about getting the chance to do any work with Google, let alone this cool new project that would let you see what any place on Earth looked like at street level from the comfort of home. This was the era of Google Plus being a potentially exciting new thing, of Google Glass being the future of tech, and overall it was a different time. That's why everyone I knew thought this was a cool gig.",

            "Being a Character Performer at Disney.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, there are some amazing perks and truly magical moments. I know I\u2019m super lucky and tons of people would love to be in my shoes. \n\nBut the day to day work is EXHAUSTING in ways I never thought possible. Guests are ridiculously abusive...I\u2019ve had things said and done to me I never would have imagined. The company isn\u2019t always great - it highly depends on your leadership. And there\u2019s so much focus on your body and face (good and BAD) that it can be incredibly depressing and difficult emotionally. \n\nPlus, you have to accept that there\u2019s very little upward mobility. Most people \u201cgrow out of it\u201d and it\u2019s rough to know that one day you\u2019ll get \u201ctoo old\u201d or \u201ctoo fat\u201d and you will have to start all over in a new career field. So you constantly are thinking either, 1) what you\u2019re going to do when you leave, 2) how you\u2019re going to keep yourself there. I personally knew it would be temporary, and I now only work there seasonally while I have a \u201cnormal career\u201d. But Disney has a way of sucking you in. \n\nEdit: Hey, my first award!

Absolutely horrendous pay for hazardous work, in our training video they showed us the aftermath of someone who had been hit by an ATR-500 propeller and literally just smiled and said \"Don't do this\". Also what some people don't realize is that those bags dont magically appear on the plane. Some are loaded individually by hand (This is called loose load) and not into bins which is alot easier. You could be stacking over 200 bags in a space so cramped you cant even be on your knees if you are tall.

I only got the smell of cocoa when I passed near it...when I went there, there were no chocolates but just tons and tons of dirty cocoa powder( I'm not kidding, there were cockroaches too) and they apparently just made the raw industrial choclates in shape of huge cubes and the whole commercial manufacturing was done in another unit. It was so dirty and tedious job, I can't explain.After working there for 2 weeks I left the job and still the smell of chocolate gives me flashbacks and I dread of ever visiting that place.",

We had a lot of fun customers but A LOT of total creeps, plus the management were all crazy!\n\nEdit: A few quick stories\n\nI was 18F, 5'0\" with red hair. Had a creepy guy stare at me from behind the racks for a while so I got uncomfortable and went to the back room. The security guard radios me when the guy wants to check out. He bought all barely legal and redhead fetish videos. About 45 minutes later the phone rings and I answer, no one replied so I asked if anyone was there, can you hear me, that sort of thing. Hang up. Phone rings again, same thing. Thats when I learned that customers would call just to hear your voice.\n\nI had a 19F come in and say that she was a preacher's daughter and I ended up walking her through the store explaining things. She was a lot of fun and spent most of the time blushing.\n\nAn older man bought a blow up sheep with noise maker, and a gallon of lube with pump as a \"gag gift\" for a friend. I don't know that many people who would spend over $200 on a gag gift.\n\nWorking the night shift we got a ton of drunk people who were usually harmless. We were also about ten miles from a nasty strip club so we got a lot of their employees looking for outfits or shoes. Sometimes they would come in with random men and the men would spend a lot of money on them.\n\nThe assistant manager got caught changing the prices on items she wanted to buy and then taking her 50% employee discount on top of it. She spent like $300 or something in one day and walked out with what should have been $1,000 in merchandise. The security guard on duty that day got fired. They pressed charges on the assistant manager for theft. A month later the manager got charged with tampering with a witness because she tried to get the security guard to say stuff that wasn't true. The owner said the employees were supposed to refuse service to anyone who was gay or transgender. We never did. Owner would get drunk and log into our online camera system and mess with cameras so security guards couldn't watch the sales floor.",

            "Club DJing.  \n\nWhen I started out, I threw a monthly event in collaboration with a local skate shop where I would just play punk rock and hip hop for the most part, while we played skate videos on the TV's and had crazy giveaways like full decks or apparel or free drinks from whatever booze company was sponsoring me that month. It was a great time cuz mixing wasn't really part of the game so I basically did whatever I wanted as drunk as I wanted to be and still managed to pull in hundreds of people and dollars every time. \n\nAfter a year of these monthly events, it got tired and I decided to retire the event but in that year I got to learn a lot about mixing and real DJing and so I was asked to be the new in house DJ for the club and play sets every single Friday night. The money was REALLY good but I managed to pick up a nasty booze and drug abuse problem thanks to free/discounted drinks and patrons eager to share their coke or speed. So that's the first shitty part of the job. If you have little self control or an addictive personality, you're fucked. By year two, I couldn't afford not to DJ because of massive drug debts and beer tabs.  \n\nThe second shitty, but less heavy, thing about the gig was dealing with drunk college kids. Particularly college aged girls. I know dude-bro's get a lot of hate for the kind of shit they pull at bars and clubs (and I'm coming for them in a sec), but from a DJ standpoint, there is little worse than dealing with drunk, white, 19-21 year old girls. They're always the ones who come up to the booth and say some racist shit about the music, or come in and spill their drinks all over my expensive equipment that I couldn't afford to replace, or treat my work area like it's their VIP coat check. Nearly once a night, I'd have some drunk white chick remind me that she paid a whole $6 to get in so I better play Ja Rule or else she and her friends are leaving. They're literally Karen's in training.  \n\nAnd lastly... And the heaviest... honestly, after a while I felt like I was providing the soundtrack to sexual assault. I could see everything in that club from where my booth was, and the grab-assing and the predatory behavior exhibited by men on that dance floor bummed me the fuck out, and I felt like the soulless pop music about getting fucked up and getting laid that I was playing was encouraging it. No matter how many times I'd have security investigate something I witnessed or how many times I called out a douche on the mic or how many times we took to social media to let people know that this was a female-friendly club and that behavior was absolutely not acceptable there, it just wouldn't stop. A guy dumped his beer over my girlfriend's head because she rejected him and I said that's fucking it, I'm done.  \n\nAnd I'm glad I quit because it made it much easier to get sober.",
            "Just a quick PSA for those reading this thread looking for career advice: the answers here are inevitably going to be biased towards those who have had bad experiences at a particular job, and are not necessarily representative of that industry as a whole.\n\nI know this because I have seen several people say \"programming\", followed by a list of their problems on the job. And I don't doubt that those people are telling the truth; there are a lot of shitty programming jobs. But there are good ones too.\n\nI'm a programmer - been doing it professionally for about 20 years - and I love my job. In fact, the last three jobs I've had have been fantastic. Great pay, comfortable working conditions with reasonable hours, good coworkers (including managers), and interesting, challenging work. Sure, the work can be frustrating; that's unavoidable when you're solving difficult technical problems. But that's what they pay me for. Besides, the more frustrating the problem, the more satisfying it is when you solve it. I have no complaints.\n\nI have had shitty jobs for sure, but those are just individual jobs. If you find yourself in that situation, and you feel that this (whatever \"this\" is) is something you really love and really want to do, you shouldn't necessarily give up. If you can be patient and look for opportunities, you might be able to find a better one.\n\nI'm not saying this to invalidate what anyone here is saying; just to put it all in the proper context.",

            "I am an auto racing driver who works at an auto manufacturers experience program where anyone (yes ANYONE) can come drive the cars on a track with an instructor. \n\n Every day people tell me how lucky I am to have this job, all they see is us driving these relatively boring (to the instructors) street cars vaguely fast around a track. We all feel pretty whored out. The best way to describe the job is teaching several adults every day their first 30 minute piano lesson again and again, while they\u2019re mostly just interested in the novelty of sitting behind a piano and taking selfies. Also being polite is so difficult. No one says before their first piano lesson \u201cI\u2019ve never played piano but I\u2019ve always been interested and I listen to a lot of piano music so I\u2019m fairly confident\u201d and then ask their instructor \u201cSo how great was I?\u201d Like bro you just spend 30 minutes doing this what do you want to hear? We teach about 4 sessions a day, and it\u2019s 4 times of some moron not realizing how close they where to seriously totally a six figure car. A lot of people also think the instructors are just there to \u201cbaby sit you\u201d and make sure you \u201cdon\u2019t drive too fast.\u201d Like dude no one is worried about you driving too fast, we\u2019re worried you\u2019re going to scare yourself and hit the brakes somewhere stupid and upset the balance of the car and because you can\u2019t react quick enough because you\u2019re not used to sliding a car faster than around a parking lot or roundabout you\u2019re going to spin it. All while going probably 15mph slower through that same turn than a professional would. \n\n On your first couple hours of trying something new, you\u2019re not going to even approach the level of someone who has only done that craft from the time they where 15 to 30. Yeah you drive your corvette fast in the mountains, I\u2019m sure you have fun. That has nothing to do with the hours I spent pouring over post practice session data and video for weeks before a race. \n\n More than that, let\u2019s say I\u2019m a track day hobbiest who works here out of boredom or for fun, why would you argue with an instructor who spends 10 hour days, 4 or 5 days a week, on the same track in the same cars? \n\nThe worst thing are people who brag about \u201cscaring their instructor\u201d because they think they were fast. No... you made your instructor nervous because you weren\u2019t listing and you were making tons of mistakes but still trying to push the car to the limit. \n\nIt\u2019s shocking to me when people can\u2019t even correct a small slide or wiggle over in our safe area (where we let you play somewhere safe to make mistakes and you can\u2019t hit anything) and yet that want to drive at the limit on a track. If the car steps out on track over 90mph it\u2019s gonna be a lot harder to catch than at 20mph on our soft concrete!\n\n \nI am fully ready to quit this job. It\u2019s cheap thrills for morons.

She lived on a lot of bar garnishes and had to pretend she was drunk who kept passing out in the lounge. \n\nIt was a lot less fun than she thought it would be, with very little sleep and cleaning herself up in public bathrooms while worrying she would be caught doing so at any time.

Still drunk I couldn\u2019t find a way to get outta the room where the supply closet was but the door was locked.

            "Late to the party but I can chime in and further add proof if needed!\n\nI worked for carnival for 5 years, specifically in debarkation. Additionally, I worked for Disney Cruise Line and Princess Cruise Line. \n\nHere\u2019s what happens: We give you a card upon check in and that card is scanned the minute you step on board. Additionally, it is scanned when you leave the ship for either complete debarkation or excursions.\n\nAt the end of your cruise, debarkation starts around 7:00AM. Come 10:00AM we receive a list of people who have not yet had their card scanned. (It\u2019s impossible to get off the boat without getting your card scanned, unless you jump into the water, haha).\n\nThen a manhunt begins to get you guys off the ship so we can put a new 2200-2600 people on it. \n\nWe do not start boarding new passengers until every card from the previous voyage has been scanned.\n\nIn my experience, nobody ever waits and tries to hide. If you do take a cruise, book a flight that\u2019s a little bit later in the morning and go with the latest check out time you can.\n\nSo many people aim for debarking around 7:00-9:00AM. Literally over 1700 people will be waiting in lines that\u2019ll take well over an hour to get out of. Instead of waiting in line for the hour, stay onboard and eat some breakfast, take some last minute photos, and then when your time comes just leave, go through customs, and be on your merry way.\n\nI\u2019m the one-stop redditor for all cruising tips, haha.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m starting my commute to work but I\u2019ll be sure to answer all questions when I get there! :)\n\nEdit2: Alright, I'm back, time to answer these questions!\n\nEdit3: I'll still answer questions if you PM me!

            "In 1991 I took a ferry from Brindisi Italy to Corfu Greece. A guy I met in line assumed I didn't speak English, and he was telling his friend that they needed to smoke all of their weed because they heard that the border agents in Greece were strict. We became fast friends. I had booze too. I was going to sleep in the open air on the deck, but a French Canadian girl with a mustache kept trying to crawl into my sleeping bag with me and do the nasty (I'm a guy btw). It finally came to a point where I knew my only chance to get some sleep and get away was to rent a room, so I went and paid the extra money for a room to Corfu, they were going to wake me up when we reached port. I wake up and the pursers are knocking on my door. So I let them in and say \"Corfu?\". No. they say. I was a bit annoyed. Why the fuck are you waking me up if we're not at my port? I try to convey that, and then they say \"No Corfu\". Huh? \"Corfu gone\". Whaaaaat? I find myself being escorted up to some obviously policey kind of office with the pursers looking angry at me, but I finally get to somebody that speaks English and start ripping them for not fucking waking me up! \n\nI guess they didn't like my attitude because I was booted off on mainland Greece with no way to get to fucking Corfu. With a raging hangover. And I'm about to shit my pants. I start asking around the port how I can get to Corfu and where I can find a bathroom. Some random Greek guy took pity on me and helped me out, and suddenly realized that a rust bucket that was just about to leave was heading there! I rush over and pay, and it's not a tourist boat, it's the boat the locals take to work on the island. I make a beeline for the head, and a dude stops me. No using the bathroom while in port. I have to wait until they get past the breakwall. \n\nAt this point my clinch muscles have been getting a good hour or so workout, I'm sweating profusely, and the hangover is really kicking into high gear. I curl up in the fetal position next to the big cowl vent until we're nearing the breakwall and I head towards the head. We finally pass, and the dude opens the door. You know that sense of relief you get when you're finally at a bathroom after more than an hour of clenching? It was palpable. I get into the bathroom and I'm hit with a wall of hot stench. No worries. I can do the old curl the upper lip trick to close my nostrils. I'm on a mission. I open the stall door and... No toilet. This is Greece. It's a hole in the shit covered floor with two spots for your feet.\n\nNow at this point, something in the back of my brain is wondering why there is shit all over the floor. But too many other things were going on in my brain at the time that I simply chalked it up to the Greeks having prehensile anuses. \n\nAnd that's when the waves hit. My pants are down, I'm bending down to do the squat, and I hear it. Glurg glurg glurg glurgglurgglurgeglurghligligrglglrglrgg. Now since I had just begun the squat my eyes happened to be perfectly aligned with the hole. And there I see a black liquid mass working it's way up from the deep like an angry creature from the Earth's core. Those thoughts from the back of my brain come rushing forward into the spotlight! Now I'm strongly suspecting that the Greeks, well at least most of them, don't have prehensile anuses! There is a perfectly valid reason that there is shit all over the floor and I was witnessing it! I pulled my pants up and burst out the stall just as the morass arose from every stall, nipping at my heels as I skipped over the bulkhead and out the door. \n\nI returned to my fetal position on the bow. Clenching and shivering for the three hour trip to Corfu.",

Employees of the ship can\u2019t leave until every last guest has existed the vessel. So if a guest is taking their time to leave or hiding, they are potentially keeping over a hundred employees from going home.

We chose his closest friend to call his dad to say we have lost your son lmao - and his answer was \"oh I know we booked him a flight\" Turns out he ventured off the boat in a panic, somehow managed to find a British embassy and explained his situation - not sure how but they organised him to fly home without a passport.\n\nEverytime I see him I ask him to tell me the story again for a laugh.",

The liner she was on always awarded the staff member that found the person with some sort of bonus, but she never told me what it was.  \n\nI remember her saying that someone caused a ship to be something like six hours late to leave because they'd done such a good job at hiding, eventually they were found or gave themselves up and were arrested by port authorities.",

This is her account of a week on board...\u201d](http://www.oceanliner.org/stow_away.htm) \n\n[link to Podcast (Criminal) interviewing her](https://thisiscriminal.com/episode-118-stowaway-7-5-2019/)",
            "I used to work with Carnival Cruise Lines and had an active role in the debarkation process. Typically, debarkation would be a 3-4 hr process (I worked on the larger vessels). Guests would be scanned off the ship using their 'sail and sign' card(fancy term for on board debit/credit card). As guests are scanned off of the ship their name is checked away from the manifest. Any remaining names are then called over the shipboard PA system until they are either found or confirmed to be in the customs queue. A security sweep is completed on each deck, checking all bathrooms, crew only areas, open decks and guest cabins. Guest cabins are typically swept by housekeeping staff. Each member of the security team is given a physical list that they must carry with them from location to location until the entire ship has been swept (with exception to sealed areas such as the engine control and access, and the bridge).\n\nAny guest not making an active effort to vacate the vessel or attempting to stow away on the vessel is arrested and escorted off of the vessel by whatever law enforcement agency has jurisdiction in that harbor or port. I've only ever seen it happen once, and it is not pretty. You're taken forcibly off of the ship to a holding area, get questioned, searched, your belongings get searched, and you can be held for up to 24 hours. Followed by fines and I could only assume court appearances.\n\nThe other things that you might not think of if you're attempting to stow away is the effect you have on everyone else. Cruise ships unload one cruise and load another the same day. Delaying that debarkation process keeps those people sitting/standing in the hot sun. This is typically upwards of 2000-3000 people for larger ships. You also slow down the customs line as they will pull an agent or two for the questioning and ensuing paperwork. The attempt can delay debarkation, embarkation, and sail away for several hours. In other words, a would be stow away can delay someone's vacation and have it off to a rough start because they want to be selfish.\n\nPlease, when you leave your cruise, be kind a courteous to the crew that's helping you that morning, wait for you're debarkation zone to be called and when it is, try to say thank you to at least one crew member before you leave and dont be afraid to give them a hug. Most people that work on cruises dont see their family for upwards of 6 months and never have days off. They really do bust their asses to try and make you're vacation as memorable as possible.",

            "Not sure if this counts but my dad was an accidental stowaway once. \n\nBack in the 80's he was a repressantative for a major company in transport. One day my dad and his coworker were told to go to Ostend (Belgium) and asses a situation on the ferry to Dover. I don't quite remember what it was about but it had something to do with a truck on board. At the ship they were met by an customs officer who accompanied them down below. The job apparently took a little longer then expected. Suddenly both my father and coworker noticed that the ship seemed to be rocking a bit, as if it was at sea. The officer took them upstairs and lo an behold: they were on their way to Merry old England. The captain apparently had forgotten he still had people on board and had left the harbour.\n\nOnce in England, my dad, his coworker and the officer were briefly detained and then immediately put on transport back. Unfortunately, the first boat back did not go to Ostend but to Calais (France). So, when they arrived they had to call their boss and explain it to him. The boss then had no choice but to come and pick them up himself and drive them to Ostend, where there cars were.",
            "A ex coworker of mine left the job we coworked to he a cook for Carnival (I think, this was like 6 years ago, but I know it was one of the big ones) and he told me about how, on his very first trip, some dude was walking around their kitchen(?) acting like he belonged and everything but not actually doing anything. He had apparently snatched up a chief's smock from the trip before and with alittle confidence and charisma had managed to stay unnoticed for about 3 days. When the head chief finally called him out, he confessed immediately.\n\nNow for the climax- the chief offers this dude a golden ultimatum- he wont say anything if the dude actually works and will even help him get a job when they return. This motherfucker says he wont work for free so he got confined to a room and the police picked him up when they got back.\n\nMind, dude who told me this is a huge liar, but I thought it was a funny story none the less"

Related: taking you seriously when something upsets you even if it doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal from their perspective.\n\nNot losing their temper when things don\u2019t go their way. Example: do you want to be with someone who blows up when the car breaks down on a road trip and makes everyone else miserable or the person who calmly calls the repair service and tries to make the best of it?\n\nNot making personal attacks during arguments. Focusing more on how they are feeling and fixing the problem at hand, and then reconciling afterward, rather than lashing out with a list of perceived character flaws. Example: \u201cI feel disrespected when...\u201d rather than \u201cYou\u2019re such a disrespectful [expletive of choice]!\u201d\n\nGenuine care for you and others; a lack of self-centeredness. Being open to hear the perspectives of others, even when they don\u2019t agree. An understanding that they are not the center of the universe, they are not always right, and there is always something to learn.\n\nIn short: emotional maturity.",

            "We all know how Reddit feels about this.",
            "For those asking why would anyone consider opting out? \n\nI recently watched a video in which a mom explained how she lost her baby to SIDS. They found the baby unresponsive after his nap, air-flighted him to the hospital, and were able to get his heart started again, but he had no brain activity from oxygen deprivation, so he wouldn\u2019t be able to breathe on his own and would die if unhooked from all his machines. The baby\u2019s organs were all perfectly healthy, so staff approached the mother about organ donation to save another baby\u2019s life. Although the parents ultimately did choose organ donation, they explained that it was a big struggle. I was confused about that, until they explained why it was a struggle....\n\nFor context: When a baby is in intensive care, it\u2019s hard to hold them, because all the tubes and wires are in the way. In most modern bereaved parent of infants situations, the school of thought is that it is less traumatic to the parents if the child is allowed to be with them for some time after he or she is unhooked from machines. Most parents hold their baby while he or she dies, etc...In some progressive countries, they even have refrigerated cribs, so that parents can take their baby home for a few days and grieve in their own way. This is way different than the past, when doctors thought taking a dead child away ASAP, before the parents could see it, was best to reduce trauma (spoiler alert, its not).\n\nAnyhow, these folks knew their baby was going to die, but in order for organ donation to occur, he needed to be unhooked in the OR, because they transplant the beating heart of infant directly into the other baby. So these parents sacrificed their mourning time with their child\u2019s body, and didn\u2019t get to hold him as he stopped breathing, etc, in order to give another child the gift of life.\n\nJust offering perspective that people who are hesitant about organ donation are not monsters, and perhaps, more awareness of these situations will ultimately lead to more people choosing selflessness.",

One of the cornerstones of medical ethics is informed consent, i.e., docs need consent from informed patients before they do anything to those patients. Obviously, consent is assumed in cases of emergency, but beyond that docs need to explain the procedure, the risks, and benefits before doing pretty much anything. \n\nIt has never been accepted -- for good reason -- that docs can do something *unless* you specifically tell them not to.

As least from what I've seen happen to my family on multiple occasions, doctors make a lot of mistakes. Some of my family members have left the hospital with very serious and obvious injuries that the doctors didn't catch for some reason. Many people have valid reasons not to trust everybody in the medical field. There are fears that doctors might prioritize taking organs over saving someone's life, or that medics might not make sure that someone is actually dead before taking their organs. These fears might possibly be unfounded in some parts of the world, but in some areas there is corruption in the medical field.\n\nChoosing to donate one's organs is definitely very heroic, but it doesn't make those who decide not to selfish. Some people just aren't comfortable with it, and that's ok. \n\nI know that I'll probably get a lot of downvotes, but I think that it's important to represent other opinions in this discussion.

This view seems very unpopular here, and I've read a lot of arguments along the lines of \"There's no *you* left to own your body once you're dead, so what does it matter?\" But there are a few reasons why it might.\n\nDeath itself is not a simple thing. Historically we used a cardio-vascular definition of death (no pulse, no breathing, non-responsive etc.), but with the advent of ICUs we were able to keep people \"alive\" even when their brains had been damaged beyond recovery, to varying degrees. This led both to the miracle of organ donation as well to a move towards neurological criteria for death. Different juris dictions have used slightly different criteria for defining this idea of death (whole brain death, brain stem death, etc.) but in any event, donors have circulation, their lungs are filling with air, they usually have some form of limited neural activity, and are kept that way as late as possible for organ viability. Knowing what exactly each type of neural activity means is sticky business, and although there may be general scientific consensus on what types of activity lead to consciousness or subjective experiences of pain, it's all on a sliding scale from impossible, through implausible and plausible, to likely. Some areas are controversial, and at times there have been surprising findings about levels of consciousness (in coma patients, for e.g.) Because of all of this, in the American context at least, there was a movement on the part of some doctors to advocate for administering painkillers before organ removal, on the off chance that some of that residual neural activity could be enough to create some form of pain or suffering. It was shut down not based primarily on scientific arguments about the best interests of donors, but on political considerations about the best interests of recipients\u2014if the public saw legally dead people being given painkillers, it could lower confidence in the idea of brain death and undermine already low levels of donation. \n\nAll this has made me feel as though messy issues about life and death and bodily integrity, necessarily filtered through imperfect scientific understanding and the even less perfect human institutions deciding how to interpret that science, should be presumptively a matter of individual informed consent, not presumptively a matter of top down public policy. But it's been a long time since I studied any of this, and would love to be corrected or updated on anything I've written.",

Use your DNA for cloning? Perform experiments on your remains? Defile your remains in any way they so wish? Where does this \"public interest\" stop?\n\nHow will people be informed of such? Is it clearly laid out? Are they given various attempts at opting-out? Is it just hidden in paperwork?",
            "Yes, if someone feels strongly against it, they will be sure to opt-out. Those in favour will not opt-out, and those who are indifferent will remain organ donors by not feeling strongly enough about it to opt-out. It really should be the default option! So many people are not organ donors simply because they haven\u2019t thought about it and made a point of filling out the paperwork.",

            "I'm against this for a variety of reasons that have been stated by many in this thread already.\n\nI'm (semi) fine with donating my organs, but it should be opt-in, not opt-out.\n\nApparently this came into effect on the 20th May, over a month ago and I never heard about it until now (I live here). Heck, I only looked into organ donation to see what it was about (in more detail than \"you give your organs away when you're dead\") earlier this year.\n\nPeople mentioned lots of things, but nothing persuades me that this should be opt-out.\n\nSome people said you shouldn't care about what happens to your body when you're dead - well, that's for them to decide what they care about, not you.\n\nSome people said that many people don't opt-in despite wanting to. I'd give the opposite argument, some people wouldn't realise that it's opt-out despite wanting to opt-out - they would assume that the law would be the same as before.\n\nIt's meant to be a donation. According to google, the definition for this context would be, verbatim, to \"allow the removal of (blood or an organ) from one's body for transplantation, transfusion, or research.\"\n\nFor the definition of \"allow\", we have \"let (someone) have or do something.\" which expands to \"declare or decide that (an event or activity) is legal or acceptable.\".\n\nIn my opinion, they should have to declare whether they wish for their organs to be donated.\n\nYa'll are free to have your own opinions, of course.\n\nEDIT: From what I've read from the NHS website (still going through it systematically), the opt-out system actually seems good if you have living relatives or friends who can relay your decision regardless of whether you officially opt-out or not, as long as they're trustworthy. Of course, not everyone has someone that fits that criteria, which is unfortunate.",

            "One of my friends in high school voted for Trump during our second year of college. He grew up in a conservative household, was brian washed and really wanted a Republican court even though he knew Trump was a moron. Then he switched about 2 years later to being totally democratic. To quote him, he said \u201cI looked up every issue I cared about and all the facts behind it. And I realized that Republicans weren\u2019t on the right side of any arguments.\u201d",
            "I didn't vote due to my age, but I started getting interested in politics in 2016 when all this happened. I turned 17 in November of 2016. I felt pretty alone in supporting Trump. I was in the very tail-end of discontinuing my belief in Christianity at the time, and it felt like all of my friends, my girlfriend at the time, and celebrities/musicians I followed were all so against Trump. Since the latter half of 2017/first half of 2018, my values in social issues and politics have changed completely, and I am extremely left now. Though I was unable to vote and influence the election in any way at the time, I look back at my newfound attention toward politics and pre-mature values as inexcusable, but a sign of growth.\n\nA friend of mine recently said to me,  \"How are you not super conservative?\" after I confirmed that my entire family, both immediate and extended are right-wing Christians. I jokingly replied, \"I became an adult and decided that empathy is really cool.\" Though it was a joke, it really does just come to that sometimes with these issues. I now choose to think about how problems could be solved and why people might have made bad decisions instead of judging people, and I understand the bigotry in many of Trump's statements/policies.\n\nTLDR: In four years, I grew up a lot (16-20) and transitioned from pro-Trump to far-left.",

            "I was a Republican by upbringing. I watched no other news but Fox News via my parents until I left for college. Once I gained my independence living across the country for college, I started to develop my own views. I started to get my news from more reputable sources like the AP. I started to realize that many of the views I picked up from watching Fox all the time were very one-sided and often didn't result from an understanding of the full picture, and it definitely took a while but once I started looking at multiple sources, the biased wording common in Fox articles is easy to spot and easy to avoid no matter the source (both right- and left-wing bias, I should add).\n\nAt the time of the 2016 election, I was on the fence. Unfortunately I still held on to the last shred of \"the Republicans are the good guys, therefore I must vote for them and also the Clintons are power hungry tyrants\" that I had left over from my childhood. I regret that vote, but that election night marked the last time for at least the foreseeable future that I vote Republican. I'm currently a registered Democrat though I consider myself a fairly moderate liberal, and I find this position much better suits what I actually believe (not just what I'm told I believe like when I was a kid) and what I find important in how society is governed.\n\ntl;dr Fox news is basically propoganda and it's super obvious if you get your news from multiple reputable sources, which changed my views.\n\nEdit: spelling\n\nEdit 2: [here's a handy media bias rating site called Ad Fontes](https://www.adfontesmedia.com/) that I've found is overall fairly accurate with reporting on different media biases.

            "My political opinions very much lean towards the idea that the government should exist to help, protect, and serve the people, not control them. I felt, and still feel like, that is the opposite of how our government runs. 4 years ago I was a month past 18 and excited to finally have a vote! I can do something affect change! I can help the world be a better place! I was full of cynicism and hatred for the way the world worked I wanted to do anything to change it. At 18 years old and prepared with a southern public education and the words of my republican father I was so sure that electing a business man and not a politician would help. I completely bought into the Trump campaign, I believed everything he said. I was young and dumb and blinded by my anger at the world and he was going to fix it. So I went with my dad and voted for my first time with no doubt in my mind that I made the right choice, I got my sticker, I took my selfie, and I was proud. \n\nThen he won! I was so excited, something was finally going to change! So I waited, and I watched, and had things started to happen, and like everyone around me I made excuses, \u201cwe can\u2019t expect him to fix everything in one day\u201d and \u201cthat stuff is all fake, someone made it up to make him look bad.\u201d Then bad things kept happening, and more information came to light, and they kept making excuses for all of it. \n\nThen I got busy, I had a kid, I started my career, I was busy, and I didn\u2019t have time to pay attention to the news or politics, I have a baby for godsakes that\u2019s enough to worry about! \n\nThen life calmed down and I started having time to pay attention to the world around me and suddenly we were years into his presidency and nothing had changed. The world was not a better place, the things everyone was afraid of that I laughed off as garbage or impossible had happened. The things I made excuses for never stopped. Then I kept paying attention, and things kept getting worse and I had to accept the fact that I was wrong, I made a horrible horrible mistake, and it had hurt a lot of people, but those people were still abstract in my mind, no one I knew had been directly affected by these things he had done yet, not in a major way. \n\nThen things kept getting worse, and the pandemic started, and the choices he made started putting millions of people in danger, and a lot of those people were people in my life every day, my mom is extremely high risk, my boyfriend had to get tested, my kids are at risk, and the feeling got worse. I was put in the position to understand just how bad things he\u2019s done have hurt people. \n\nI regret voting for him, I regret that it took me having to experience the negative effects first hand to fully understand how badly I messed up. I wish I could take it back every time I am reminded Trump was elected in part because of me. I will not vote for him in 2020, I don\u2019t know who I will vote for yet, but I\u2019m going to make sure I\u2019m absolutely as educated on all the candidates as I can be, and I\u2019m going to try again, I\u2019m going to make a choice I am proud of and hope like hell I\u2019m right this time. In the meantime I have spent as much time as I can learning about all the things I thought were garbage in the past, and doing my very best to tell everyone I possibly can that they need to listen.\n\n\nETA: holy crap this blew up! \n\nFirst, sorry for the wall of text, I wrote this late last night and I\u2019m on mobile so formatting is hard, I tried to make it a little better by splitting it up. \n\nSecond, I am at work right now so I\u2019m trying my hardest to keep up with reading the comments but most of that will have to wait another few hours until I\u2019m off. \n\nThird, thank you so much for all the awards (my first gold!!!) and upvotes, I was shocked last night before I went to bed when this had 2 replied and 10 upvotes, so waking up to this feels kind of like I\u2019m in the twilight zone. \n\nI want to be clear that I did not post this to get a pat on the back a kuddos from internet strangers, though I super appreciate it! I posted this in the hopes that someone would see it and realize that they don\u2019t have to keep supporting something they know is wrong just because they openly supported it in the past. So to the few nasty replies about hot I don\u2019t deserve the praise, that\u2019s fine, that\u2019s not why I posted it, but you talking down to me for admitting I was wrong and that I\u2019ve learned and moved on is the exact reason I posted this, because shitting on me for what I supported in the past is the reason so many people will never admit they were wrong. So if you\u2019re reading this and you still support Trump because you think you have to, you don\u2019t. You can learn from your mistakes and grow. You can help the world change. Your political stance is not a lifetime commitment.\n\nEdit #2 holy crap another gold thank you!!!",

I am less concerned about making sure there\u2019s no welfare fraud if it helps people that truly need it.  \n\nBtw I was always socially liberal, I just felt like most social issues didn\u2019t belong in politics.

I\u2019ve gotten married, watched my husband get diagnosed with a disease that would bankrupt us if I didn\u2019t have a government job and it changed how I saw people. No one should have to decide to go bankrupt to get treatment they need to survive. I\u2019m now willing to pay a little more so no one has to suffer like we were so fortunate not to. I\u2019ve also taken multiple diversity and equity trainings since 2016 that have helped me understand concepts like how saying all lives matter dismisses the point that some lives aren\u2019t being treated like they matter. \n\nJust personal growth and this sense of not wanting anyone to suffer.\n\nEdit: Well, I didn\u2019t expect any movement on this post, it\u2019s a little overwhelming! For those calling me garbage - I hope that makes you feel better, and if that\u2019s how you approach people you want to change and grow, you\u2019re going about it wrong, but that\u2019s just my opinion from the trash can. For those with kind words, you\u2019re definitely not garbage people and I\u2019m thankful for your well wishes. My husband gets the lifesaving treatment he needs nightly and we\u2019re hopeful for the future.\n\nFor the questions about why I figure I\u2019d pay more in a universal healthcare system, I\u2019m very fortunate - to cover myself and my husband with the best tier for us is $14.33 a month, with a $250 deductible each, and a $1,500 out of pocket maximum (Edit: I didn't give thought to what my employer pays, and the idea that I might get more if they weren't paying that cost - more ignorance on my part! I'd cynically believe they'd just save the money, but I suppose they'd have to share to be competitive.). So for many people, some form of universal healthcare would save loads of money but I don\u2019t imagine it would for me. It just wouldn\u2019t matter to me anymore.

Happy to say that I do much more research and don\u2019t just go in the voting booth blind. I\u2019m now pretty far from conservative",
            "I voted and then went to the grocery store with a couple of my younger children. There was a very nice young Hispanic kid working and he helped me put stuff in my car so he could collect my buggy. He noticed my \u201cvoted\u201d sticker on my child and asked me who I voted for. I was instantly hesitant to answer truthfully and I realized I felt shame. After trump actually won, I said \u201chow much damage can one man really do\u201d?  \nThat 24 hrs has haunted me the last 3 yrs. And now I\u2019m self quarantining w/my family since 3/15/20 and I\u2019ve had too much time to think about what a colossal mistake he was...and voting republican Bc the ones in office now are all a death cult. It\u2019s been eye opening. I\u2019ve told my family if I get covid-19 and die they have to put on my tombstone, \u201cI died Bc I voted for Trump in 2016\u201d.",

            "Can\u2019t relate directly to the question, but it gives me so much hope reading through these responses. I was 15 back during the election so definetly couldn\u2019t vote, but still was fairly updated and aware about the political world. \n\nMy household has always been in favor of trump, and I remember always hearing that most kids usually follow their parent\u2019s political beliefs, but I always felt off about what they\u2019d say about him and how\u2019d they defend him when he did something wrong or said something horrible. Hearing what my family would say at times broke my heart and scared me. \n\nThe biggest case of this was recently when he pushed back on the health protections for lgbtq people. My mom is very aware I fall in that spectrum, and when I tried expressing to her that she kept continuing to support that man, despite him doing things such as not giving a damn and showing signs of being against the blm movement (pushing away protestors to take a photo-op with a bible, and \u201cwhen the looting begins, the shooting begins\u201d), when both my mom\u2019s daughters are black, and in response to telling my mom how much fear I felt when he pushed back on the health protections, keeping in mind I and my 2nd-oldest sister both are lgtbq, her response was \u201cbut if it wasn\u2019t for him, we\u2019d be at war with Russia and North Korea.\u201d\n\n\nI have so much hope now for this upcoming election, especially now that I\u2019m able to vote. I\u2019m counting down the days until November. I hate that people who can\u2019t see how horrible of a man he is exist, especially considering majority are full fledged adults, and I\u2019m just a kid, yet I\u2019m somehow more able to see how horrible of a man he is.",

            "My story is a lot like other people's here. I grew up in a small \"Christian\" town where everyone was conservative or quiet and climate change was a hoax the climate scientists told us so there would be an economic need for them. I was taught basically that the government is out to get you and so we must have as small a government as possible. Had I done any research on Trump I might have known that wasn't even his goal. But anyways, I was 18 and had gone to the big city for school where there were maybe 5 conservatives. I felt like the world was going crazy and for some arrogant reason, I thought I was seeing what no one else was. I voted for Trump without a second thought.\n\nFast forward a year. I dropped out of that school and moved back to my hometown because I felt like I couldn't handle being around \"liberals\" for three more years. I started going to community college where I took a macroeconomics class and learned about economic policies from something other than a YouTube video. Once it became clear that trickle down economics doesn't work, I started to wonder what else Democrats could be right about. That ultimately led me to becoming the BLM marching, Bernie Sanders campaign donating, climate change believing progressive outlier that I am.\n\nEDIT: I don't want to spam the comments with my giving thanks so I figured I'd throw in an edit. I cannot say thank you enough to the people who are supporting me here. This hasn't always been easy. My friends all think I'm crazy and have \"given in to the machine\" or something. It feels like every time I bring this kind of stuff up with them or my family, it becomes a argument. I know this is a long road, and by no means am I done. Six months ago if you would have asked me if I was racist I would have told you there was no way, and now I'm learning all about systemic racism and really just how the actions of a few impact the lives of so many. But anyways, thank you and please, try to be patient and don't get discouraged when talking with people who hold the views I once did. Yes, there was one moment where everything clicked, but there were a thousand books, internet comments, TV shows, movies, and any other thing you can use to communicate that put me in a position to accept what I couldn't. Last time, I promise. Thank you.\n\nEDIT after getting gold: Wow. Thank you. Woops. Broke my promise. I don't want to be that guy, but please, don't award me for this. If you can, give money to your local food bank or if you don't have extra money, consider donating blood.

Voting for Hillary was tantamount to killing a baby with your bare hands. I didnt like him, but I didnt know it was THAT bad. A few months post election I caught wind of a rumor that he had a rape allegation. I wasnt aware of this, and I did some digging. Also, within a year and a half most of my ideological views changed drastically as I deconverted, and I started looking at more sources for news and information. Suddenly I realized that I had been the product of very concerted propaganda efforts by right wing cable news, and those who take it as gospel.\n\nI educated myself, and ever since I have been deeply involved with keeping up on what goes on in our politics.

I reflexively voted for the republican candidates in 2016, including Trump, and I deeply regret it now. After he was president, I knew Trump did bad things, but didn't have the mental energy to dig into it.\n\nThis year, I got deeply sucked into reading and informing myself about the spread of the coronavirus when it started in Asia. Trump did one bad thing after the next, crippling our response and confusing the public. This resulted  in a country divided when it should have been united against the virus. It all got my attention and enraged me. Finally, I saw the petty and selfish things Trump has been doing. The pandemic has really shown everyone's true colors.\n\nThen George Floyd was murdered and peaceful protests were met with more brutality. Trump encouraged the violence and orchestrated a brutal unconstitutional clearing of peaceful protesters to get a photo op... That was the last straw.

            "Not me but my Mom has done a complete 180 on Trump the past few months.\n\nAs far as I can tell, before this year she mostly got her news from email forwards, my stepdad's Facebook feed (she doesn't have her own), and chatting with my grandma, who is a lifelong Republican who donates regularly and only watches Fox News 24/7, believes in all sorts of conspiracy theories, etc. Plus occasionally she would watch the local news on TV.\n\nBut two things happened: One, my Mom finally got a smartphone, for work, because they moved their scheduling to an app. So now she has an aggregate news feed. Two, the pandemic happened, so she actually started *reading* that news. All of the sudden she's reading *everything*. Fox, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, just everything all the time.\n\nShe keeps calling me to talk politics now because my stepdad just thinks literally everything is fake now (He's never believed in the moon landing so that's not exactly a new thing, it's just gotten worse). And all of the sudden she's asking me if I know about all these things Trump's done, a lot of it is old crap from before he even won the election. She's just all of the sudden catching up on four+ years of craziness and she's completely mortified.\n\nBefore now I thought she was a lost cause. She would always defend Trump when he came up in conversation, and whenever I mentioned something awful he'd done she just kind of ignored it and changed the subject. I don't really know exactly why the switch suddenly flipped so hard. Pretty much everyone else she knows besides me is very conservative, and I only visit every few months, so I guess it just wasn't enough volume to cause enough dissonance.\n\nShe still defends her original vote for Trump because she hates Clinton like nobody's business, but she has 100% turned against Trump and isn't going back.",
            "I didn't, but almost voted for him in 2016 thinking he was a successful business man that would grow our economy and pay off our insane debt. Instead we got the largest deficit (pre covid), tax cuts for wealthy, and found out he really wasn't that successful, just a con man who didn't pay contractors. Hard not to make money when you're a professional cheater\n\nEdit: Reminders:\n\n1) I did not vote for trump. Please stop asking me how/why I could have voted for him.\n\n\n2) I hate trump. But I'm starting to realize why Trump supporters feel so isolated and defend him. When everyone attacks me for my honest opinion and even at my own admission that I breifly \"drank the orange koolaid\" it just pushes me away from the Democratic party. This sort of discourse is why our country is so divided, and why Trump can hold on to his base. You're playing into what Trump wants by relentlessly  attacking his base like they aren't human for considering him. I'm an independent who cares about the economy and for a minute he seemed like a good choice. But after seeing more of the content of his character I voted for Hillary. Instead of saying \"HOOOWWW COIUULDD!! YOU!!!!!\" drop the condescending attitude and listen for a minute. That's how you can help reunite this country and get rid of trump in November. Also, thanks for the gold!",
            "I\u2019m so embarrassed to admit it... \n\nHillary has just always been drilled into my brain as the epitome of \u201climousine liberal establishment candidate,\u201d and I was livid with how Bernie got shafted (voted for Bernie in the primary). \n\nWhen election day came, I was coming from work at an auto shop, they were all pumped on Trump and I thought \u201cworst case scenario, he fucks up and looks really dumb and hurts the GOP, right? It\u2019s not like the people around him would actually let him cause any real harm right?\u201d \n\nI was really wrong.\n\nEdit: \n\nA ton of people are asking \u201cI don\u2019t get it! How could you flip from Bernie to Trump?!\u201d \n\nTLDR: I was 24, na\u00efve, and more focused on \u201cfuck the two party system\u201d than \u201chey let\u2019s make this country a good place for everyone to live\u201d \n\nI was raised pretty conservative, and Clinton was like a swear word in my house. I was raised Mormon so sex scandals are just about the worst thing a president could do (back then at least). I left the house in 2010, and was much less exposed to the news at college (BYU). I served a Mormon mission from 2013-2015 and missed a lot of the news cycle of Trump during that time too. \n\nThe only political ideal I really had at the time was \u201cfuck the two party system.\u201d I felt like Bernie was a great answer, and would represent the best interests of the people. Hillary was so ingrained in me as \u201cevil\u201d I couldn\u2019t see her in a more realistic light. \n\nSo, since Bernie was out, and Trump seemed like less of an \u201cengrained in the system\u201d candidate, I fell for the last minute hype and voted for him. \n\nI never said it was logical, just that I regretted it haha.\n\nEdit 2: \n\nSome people pointed out I didn\u2019t answer \u201cwhat changed my mind\u201d \n\nI never really *liked* trump as a candidate, so it didn\u2019t take much to change my mind. Honestly, I think a lot of people that are responding are being disingenuous and think that Trump hasn\u2019t done *anything* wrong. I don\u2019t claim to be an expert, but I feel pretty strongly that Trump is objectively a poor leader and that should be apparent to everyone by now. \n\nFor one, he has absolutely bungled the COVID crisis, and his desire to downplay it for political gain is gross. \n\nThere\u2019s the one thing. It wasn\u2019t the one that changed my mind (it was probably how much he was golfing from the get go, or me developing a better sense of empathy and leaving a toxic conservative lifestyle behind that did that) but I think it\u2019s good enough to change anybody\u2019s mind who isn\u2019t Trump \u2018r Die.",

Trump won my swing state by less than 10K votes. \n\nI told fellow republicans Trump isn\u2019t conservative and will damage the party for a generation. I feel I am still correct in this assessment. I\u2019m really disappointed by this more than anything. Not because he merely spoiled conservatism for a generation, but worse yet (and something I never imagined) he totally *redefined* conservatism at a Reagan like scale. I saw, as just one example, free market advocates begin supporting trade barriers and things of the like. I\u2019ve watched Trump these past 4 years slowly poison the conservative well. He has infused populism into conservatism to where it is no longer recognizable to what I subscribed to years ago. \n\nI will be voting Biden this year and not protesting on the grounds I think they are both bad. I had a false view that the president doesn\u2019t really matter (always saw them more as a figure head) but now realize it matters who is in that office.\n\nI just want civic peace more than anything . I just want any competent president that doesn\u2019t dogwhistle to the extreme right or left. But especially the right because at least the extreme left has there hearts in the right place even if I find their methods and policies disagreeable. I miss the tranquility of the Obama era, even if I disagreed wildly with him too. I want someone who will bring us together. I don\u2019t know if Biden is up for that monumental task, or if anyone is for that matter, but Trump sure as hell is not. I look forward to seeing him lose this election. \n\nDon\u2019t believe a word out of my mouth feel free to check my post history. You will find I do not agree with the left on most things. But I will be voting Biden.\n\nEdit: piece \u2014> peace",

            "All through school they taught us you can never truly delete anything online and even if you delete it someone can still find it. While this may be true if you seriously pissed off a master computer hacker but for the average person this claim is completely BS.\n\nI went on a few dates with a girl a few summers ago and I really liked her. All of a sudden though she just vanished. Like her Snapchat was deactivated, completely disappeared off Facebook, Instagram, everything. I tried texting her a couple of times but she never responded.\n\nI got a little worried because she\u2019s not the type of girl to ghost like that and she struggles with suicidal thoughts and mental health issues so you can see why this might be concerning. Since she wasn\u2019t responding and I didn\u2019t really know any of her friends to ask about her I went full social media creep mode to try and at least find out what happened to her. I figured if she had killed herself there would be something online about it.\n\nWell I didn\u2019t find anything, like literally no evidence that this girl even existed besides a picture of her on her brothers Facebook page. I didn\u2019t even know she had a brother he was just the only person that came up if you searched her name on Facebook. Googling her name also yielded no results. Since I could literally find nothing about her online I figured she had just blocked me for some reason and I eventually gave up. I tried searching her on Facebook a couple times over the next year or so but nothing ever came up.\n\nThis past summer she popped up in my Snapchat friend suggestions and honestly it was such a relief to finally see some evidence that she was alive. I added her not expecting her to add me back but she did and she actually messaged me. We met up again and went for a hike and grabbed dinner together to catch up, turns out she was going through some rough times and didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone and disappeared but she\u2019s doing much better now.

            "During some in-depth discussion on the *Lord of the Rings* lore, the conversation turned somewhere deep in the appendices, or in some additional notes of Tolkien's, to the future of Middle Earth, specifically of the Hobbits, hundreds of years after Elessar's reign. He, as you may remember, designates the Shire a protected area that men cannot enter.\n\nAs time passes, these rules are gradually forgotten. The men harass the Hobbits, forcing them to become more secretive and reclusive. Their culture suffers; they forget their music and books, their cookery and their stories, and become 'like animals', 'hunted by cruel men for sport'. The passage ended with the notion that Hobbitkind had not been seen more many years, though there was a chance they could be deep in hiding, or that they had forgotten what they were.\n\nIt was depressing as fuck, but this discussion took place online in about 2009-2010 and I haven't, since, been able to find the source. I recall wanting a source and being given one, and I followed the links and confirmed it myself, reading the depressing passages although not committing the exact text to memory - was it a LOTR appendix? A separate letter detailing the Hobbits' sad future? Could even have been Chris Tolkien's musings, I honestly don't know. I have wanted to refer back to it in the years since, but as I say, I can't find it. The only line I remember with clarity was the 'hunted by cruel men for sport'.",

The story took a more bisexual turn after a while, and he ended up with (at various points) his hot neighbour and a harem of boys from school. So far, so normal-ish.\n\nEventually, I can only assume because the writer ran out of ideas, he started conjuring up fictional characters to bone, starting with -- and I promise you, this is as true as I remember it -- Count Chocula. Cue long descriptions about the Count\u2019s long, pale fingers all over his body, and even though the boy isn\u2019t into it to start with, eventually he concedes, drops to his knees and begins to suck cock like a pro.\n\nSpoilers: yes, it tastes like chocolate.\n\nNo matter what I try, I can\u2019t track it down, and it\u2019s slowly driving me insane.

            "During the Christmas season when I was a kid, my parents would often play recordings of carols sung by cartoon characters. While most of those are well-known enough to be easy to find today, one of them has seemingly been erased from existence.\n\nBased on what I can remember, the song in question was a slow, largely incomprehensible reimagining of \"The Twelve Days of Christmas.\" It was ostensibly performed by either Chip and Dale (of *Rescue Rangers* fame) or David Seville with a malfunctioning tape-recorder. (Also, no, it wasn't the version of the song which features Alvin shouting \"*I'm getting tired, Dave!*\" toward the end.) I was maybe seven years old when I last heard the piece, and to this day, I have literally no idea what the lyrics were.\n\nNow, that last claim probably seems ridiculous in the context of discussing a Christmas carol, but honestly, the song sounded like it had somehow managed to rearrange several important syllables. As those chipmunk-like voices sang, all I could hear was this:\n\n>On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me...     \n>A part-eating swan... fir... treeeeeeee...\n>\n>On the first... day of... Christmas... my true love... gave to me...     \n>A part... eat... ing... swan... fir... treeeeeeee...\n\nThis unintelligible mess continued for several virtually identical verses, then suddenly transformed into a strange bastardization of a more-familiar melody:\n\n>Six geese a-laying     \n>Eight maids a-milking     \n>And a partridge in a pear tree\n\nAnyway, my recollections have almost certainly been altered by time, and for all I know, the indecipherable nature of the song was the result of a low-quality recording. Even so, I'd really like to hear it again, if only to finally experience a holiday wherein I'm not haunted by the frustrating memory of trying to decipher the lyrics.\n\n**TL;DR: There are chipmunks and part-eating swans in my head, and I want to evict them.**\n\n------\n\n**Edit:** /u/hauntedbalaclava has managed to track down [the song that I remembered](https://youtu.be/Ll7L0zTEQHc?t=825).

Chance it could have been a movie but I think it was a show it was likea head to head race but each team has like 5 people and shoot guns and on the good guys team one of them was a samurai kind of guy with a mecha sword but the aim was to get round the track I think. Have never found it even after people giving suggestions feels bad \ud83d\ude2d\n\nIGPX (immortal grand prix) is the closest thing to what  I imagine that someone has said maybe it was this.\n\nI swear I remember a scene where some guy is just like I will hold them off go and he pulls out his sword and jumps down and fights them before I think he loses.\n\nIt looks like it was called heavy gear it fits everything I said hahaha looks hilarious."

Communications have been severely disrupted, and the number of casualties and the extent of the damage are not yet known. We shall bring you further information as soon as possible. Meanwhile, stay tuned to this\nwavelength, stay calm and stay in your own homes.\nRemember there is nothing to be gained by trying to get away. By leaving your homes you could be exposing yourselves to greater danger.\nIf you leave, you may find yourself without food, without water, without accommodation and without protection. Radioactive fall-out, which follows a nuclear explosion, is many\ntimes more dangerous if you are directly exposed to it in the open. Roofs and\nwalls offer substantial protection. The safest place is indoors.\nMake sure gas and other fuel supplies are turned off and that all fires are extinguished. If mains water is available, this can be used for fire-fighting.\nYou should also refill all your containers for drinking water after the fires\nhave been put out, because the mains water supply may not be available for very long.\nWater must not be used for flushing lavatories: until you are told that\nlavatories may be used again, other toilet arrangements must be made. Use your water only for essential drinking and cooking purposes. Water means life. Don't waste it.\nMake your food stocks last: ration your supply, because it may have to last for 14 days or more. If you have fresh food in the house, use this first to avoid wasting it: food in tins will keep.\nIf you live in an area where a fall-out warning has been given, stay in your fall-out room until you are told it is safe to come out. When the immediate danger has passed the sirens will sound a steady note. The \"all clear\" message will also be given on this wavelength. If you leave the fall-out room to go to\nthe lavatory or replenish food or water supplies, do not remain outside the room for a minute longer than is necessary.\nDo not, in any circumstances, go outside the house. Radioactive fall-out can kill. You cannot see it or feel it, but it is there. If you go outside, you will bring danger to your family and you may die.

            "Not technically first day but second day. \n\nWhen I was 20 or so I got hired to be a temporary floor member for Forever21 during the holiday season. \n\nMy training started a week before Black Friday so the store was already kind of in chaos. On my first day of training I walked in and the floor manager gave all the new hires a tour showing us the facility and layout of the store. After this I was assigned to a veteran floor member to shadow and get an idea of what my job was and what my duties would be. As soon as I was assigned the manager dipped never to be seen again. \n\nAn hour and a half into my shift my shadowee got an emergency family call and had to take off for a week. When this happened I found some other floor manager and explained the situation and asked them who else I should shadow. The managers response was \u201cjust do what you can by yourself you\u2019ll be fine, everyone else is busy.\u201d Figured we\u2019ll ok I\u2019ll try\u2026\n\nI don\u2019t know if any of you have shopped in the women\u2019s section of forever21 but during seasonal sales they will have multiple articles of clothing that all look almost exactly the same but with slight differences (ex. A white cardigan with 4 buttons that looked literally the same as a white cardigan with 5 buttons). The best part was these different items were often placed in completely separate parts of the store and it was the job of the dressing room to return the unpurchased items to the correct section so the employees could put them back on the shelves. Well, these employees fucking sucked and I didn\u2019t know if they were a part of my section or not so I\u2019d spend a ridiculous amount of time trying to find where they go before realizing \u201cwait this isn\u2019t even my section I\u2019ve checked literally every rack\u201d so I\u2019d put it back on the sorting rack and move to the next item. More than 50% of the stuff I was told to reshelf wasn\u2019t my section. I just did as best as I could and got ready for my next miserable day. \n\nThe next day I come in and the store manager pulls me to her office and tells me how slow I was the day before and if I want to keep working here I need to be very fast. I explained my lack of training and unfamiliarity with the store and she told me if I didn\u2019t know where the clothes were in sections I should come in my free time and memorize where stuff was at. I spent the rest of my shift putting clothes in random fucking places then never came back for a third shift. \n\nFuck that place and their management.",

First shift after interview is listed as framing, but I\u2019m put on cash and told that actually most of my shifts would be cash since they\u2019d found someone else for framing. I spent the next six hours giving everyone who came to my register 20% off of everything and then never went back.",

I get pulled by my supervisor who just tells me to run back to our office. These teens as young as 12 had escaped their block.

I made it through the multiple day training but there was so much stupid shit going on I almost thought I was on a hidden camera show.\n\nAll of the employees complained about how hard they had to work while simultaneously not getting enough hours. Nobody understood why they were hiring like 4 new people (I was one of those 4).\n\nTurns out it's because they were progressing through a sexual harassment complaint that required restructuring of the store and firing of some employees. This was known to HR and explained to new hires (against company policy), but wasn't known to the employees, apparently some of whom still worked there, *including the fucking person doing the training*. She was really inappropriate and said not to worry about the sexual harassment stuff, that everything would \"go back to normal\" soon enough and we wouldn't have to \"be so uptight.\" They fired her the day before I started, along with one of the cashiers who trained me.\n\nShe also offered me terrible guidance for the application process. They were looking for part time help and two of the three days they needed help on I had off from school. I told them I could work nights most nights, but if they needed daytime help it had to be on those days. She said if I was too restrictive they wouldn't keep me on, lied to my boss about my availability to make me \"even more attractive than I already was\" *wink*, and told me to schmooze them a bit and I'd make it further. She said in the end it wouldn't impact anything, and I'd get those days.\n\nMy first week's schedule I was working mornings every day that I was in school, and I wasn't given any hours on my days off. Aside from the fact that I was given 2 times the hours the position called for (when other employees were shorted), my work schedule way literally impossible to consolidate with my school schedule.\n\nI only went to work on my \"first\" day to tell them I was quitting and that their application process was a fucking mess. They couldn't figure out how so much went wrong and then they asked who trained me and everything made sense. They thanked me for \"at least showing up to quit\" unlike the other 3 they hired, who just stopped returning their calls and no-showed their first days.",
            "A long time ago, not long after getting my papers as a chef I had an interview at a hotel for a position in the kitchen. The Executive Chef and I chatted in his office for about 20 mins, at the time I remember him coming off as very arrogant which is quite common in this field, I didn't think much of it at the time as the pay was decent and the shift was what I wanted. As I was leaving his office I turned to leave through the dining room (the way I had come in) which was closed at the time it was another hour or so before service started and he says to me \"No not that way, go through the kitchen, you're not good enough to go through the dining room.\" I was so surprised by what he said, I just did what he asked without a word. Later on after I had got home I phoned him up and said that after having a close look I decided that his menu wasn't good enough and that I wouldn't be accepting his offer.",

I wasn't sitting in a seat as the van had no seats in the back. As I put my hand out to steady myself I accidentally laid it across a portable radio that had its antenna extended but the antenna was also broken half-way and razer sharp.\n\nIt sliced the palm of my hand clean open 3-4 inches. I can only describe what I saw as gruesome. I said to him to pull the van over and I needed help. He saw my hand and just threw me a plastic bag, the kind you'd get at a supermarket and told me to wrap my hand in it.\n\nThen .. he continued with the deliveries, at-least he delivered the remaining books himself.\n\nI should have been taken to a hospital or at-least home to my parents.

            "I got hired at a very small knock off dollar store in an old, failing mall. The owner was foreign with a very thick accent. He told me I'd get $6 an hour but neglected to mention it was under the table. I spent about an hour stocking the very overly cluttered shelves before I was told to get more chips out of the back storage area. I walk back there and theres about a dozen men sitting on boxes all cramed into a small back room. I asked where the chips were and these guys all glared at me. They started speaking in another language and rapidly motion towards me. Then one guy got up and asked what I needed. I told him I was supposed to get a box of chips and he got a box out of the pile and handed it to me. The entire time these guys are all staring at me. Everything back there looked shady as all hell and it was very uncomfortable. \n\nA while later I had to use the restroom which was also in the back. These guys all just wordlessly glared at me while I went into the woman's restroom. While I was in the restroom, someone tried to open the door. I was the only woman there.

She stops responding, I decide I want to be petty over the 40 bucks so I get the statw labor department involved, dude goes in there and makes her pay me for the hours including the first \"staging\" hour. Couple weeks later I got my 40 bucks, never went back to that restaurant.\n\nEdit: Firstly, \"petty\" is not how I see it two years later. Im VERY glad I did this and sharing the story with others in my city I learned this practice was very common with local restaurants. Hopefully others learned to stand up for their labor too from my small experience.\n\nSecondly, this restaurant closed down a couple weeks after I got that paycheck.

Rather than call me. He would come out, pinch my skirt and pull to the kitchen. Needed me at the cash machine? Again, come over to where ever I was, didn't matter if I was serving a customer, and would grab my skirt to pull me. That act in itself, made some customers uncomfortable. Mind you, one couple left an almost 50% tip in the end. But I think it was more out of pity and embarrassment on my behalf. I was supposed to come in the next day but I called that night and said the job wasn't for me. I came in a couple days later to turn in my apron and he just took a wad of cash out of his pocket and paid me then and there. God, he was creepy. I think it was a smart move to quit.",

            "Edit: it might help to say that this was in 1999. Also, B&BW. My bad. \n\nBonus story: I also did one shift at Steve Madden about 6 years later. They didn't tell me how to get into the building (it was a morning shift in a mall, and I'd explicitly asked if I would have to enter the building at a specific entry point). The music was blasted all day and hurt my ears, and I was harassed all day long by the day manager to buy a pair of boots. We were required to wear a current pair of Steve madden shoes (6 months). I tried putting it off but she wouldn't leave me alone. They were mad when I called to say I was quitting. And funny enough. I quit both places and worked at a pet store after. They also tried to avoid paying me until the IRS got involved. \n\n\nI did one shift at Bath and Body Works. First I had to come in for like a 4 hour session of watching videos and I'm not even sure I got paid for it. Then they told me to come in for the 430-830 shift. \n\nDuring the shift I was:\n\nChastised for not following customers who had asked to be left alone, told to try to grab children to put the new sparkly lotion on, and continually harassed to sell things to people. When the store closed at 830, I was making conversation with a worker about closing. I had mentioned having worked at Toys R Us before and wanted to compare the closing times. She told me that they normally got out close to midnight. \n\nHave you ever been in one of these stores? There's no reason why a fully staffed store that size should take 4 hours to close. \n\nTold the manager not to even bother putting me on the schedule. She was surprised and gave me the stink eye for the remaining hour we were there. Ridiculous. \n\nAlso they insisted on \"abbreviating\" the store's name to BB&W. Say that and then say Bath and Body Works. \n\nHow many syllables did you save?",

I was lucky I didn't fall asleep behind the wheel on my way there (and home). \n\nLater that evening (after I got some sleep), I drove down to IHOP and told them I quit.

The front door is open, and from the inside of the hearse in driveway I can just smell death. Legitimate, real, death. It\u2019s unmistakable and you never forget it. \n\nI greet my boss, and the first thing he says is, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry man. If I knew it was gonna be like this, I wouldn\u2019t have made this your first call. I\u2019ve never seen one like this.\u201d No hello, no nothing. so I immediately start internally freaking out because I have no idea what\u2019s about to happen. \n\nHe tells me that not only am I going to be driving the body to the funeral home.

Think of the most filthy house you can imagine... I promise you it was worse. The deceased had suffered a heart attack at the top of his staircase, fallen down the stairs, and died, landing in a crumpled mess at the bottom. And stayed there. For four days. Before his family came looking for him. This was not going to be an open casket funeral, to say the least. \n\nSo now we have to get him out of the house. The body was close to 350 pounds if I had to guess, and stiff as a board. I\u2019m not a big guy. 5\u20198\u201d, maybe 155lbs. So, because of where the body was positioned in the home, and because of what a mess the house was, a gurney was out of the question. We were carrying this body out in a sheet. It was the most I\u2019ve ever struggled in my life. After getting the sheet under the left side of the body, my glove ripped. I said to myself in my head \u201cI should definitely replace this glove.\u201d A cop gives me a replacement glove. And boy am I glad I replaced that glove, because when I put the sheet under the other side of the body, I pulled my hand out absolutely covered in diarrhea. I had to use all of my concentration to not puke on the body at this point. Nerves, heat from the summer, and all my senses except taste were assaulting my stomach at this point. It was tough.\n\nThis is getting so long, so I\u2019m gonna wrap it up quickly.\n\nWe get the body in the hearse, I drive it to the funeral home, and I think, \u201cCool, I\u2019m done now\u201d. Wrong again. I then had to learn how to prepare a body for the mortician. I had to strip this decrepit, rotting body naked. More nausea ensues. When I was done, I drove home in silence. Got home, sat in silence staring at the wall for about an hour. \n\nWorst experience of my entire life. I quit the next day.

I had another job to fall back on with my old employer both times, so I wasn\u2019t going to endure a bad situation.\n\n1.) Battery factory. The position I went into was on a line basically making car batteries (AGM). The working conditions were decent and the pay was good. The treatment of workers was terrible. Production goals were ridiculous, they worked everyone to a pulp, left aching after every shift. From what I saw in my short time there, supervisors were chomping at the bit to hand out write ups and terminations to anyone making more than new hire pay.\n\nMy \u2018oh fuck no\u2019 moment was week 2 when they wouldn\u2019t let a coworker that I started with off for her grandmother\u2019s funeral. Sudden death, they were close. She cried through her entire shift. Zero absence, zero excuse policy during first 90 days. No job is worth that nonsense.\n\n2.) Rice cake manufacturing plant. Again, good pay, decent facility. AC and heat was a big plus here. This one was a doozy. I gave it a week. People training me warned me to avoid learning any other jobs in the plant, as the company could and would call you in on your days off to work to fill absences, and ding your attendance the same as a call in if you couldn\u2019t come in. \n\nOn top of that, I can never eat rice cakes again. The little black grains in rice crispy cereal or rice cakes aren\u2019t burnt pieces, they\u2019re moldy ones or bugs that got knocked out of the feed system that was overdue for cleaning. The cooking process was considered to disinfect the product well enough not to worry about it. \n\nThen came the epa violations, where we were literally washing large quantities of flavoring syrup and other waste down the drain into the water supply. The company said this was a no-no, and it is very much so, but then turn their back and basically say don\u2019t let us see you do it but it\u2019s the only feasible option we\u2019ll leave you.

            "Laboratory scientist. Was on my second day, getting trained on assisting with bone marrow processing after bone marrow aspiration. I\u2019ve done it before, but still had to be shown, of course. Basically I just take the bone marrow collected by the doctor, usually the pathologist, sometimes the surgeon, and prepare slides bedside and take them back to the lab for processing.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never had or watched a bone marrow aspiration before, it\u2019s pretty violent. First, you lay on your side, then the doctor locates the landmark on your hip (posterior iliac crest), then lidocane is injected from the outside in to the surface of the bone, then a large bore needle is inserted forcefully into your bone to access the marrow, because bone is incredibly dense and strong. Usually, the doctor is trained and it is a routine procedure.\n\nAt this hospital, however, the person performing was a radiologist. I was thinking, weird, but there\u2019s no reason radiologist shouldn\u2019t be able to do it. It was actually done in the imaging room, too. Before starting, the pathologist - my boss - popped his head in and said \u201cdid you look at the PowerPoint slides I sent you? You\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Warning bells started going off in my head, especially when after needle insertion, everybody was told to exit the imaging room so a CT can be taken to see how close the needle was to the bone. Sterile field was broken, of course. After a few tries, and a few CTs later, the needle is finally on the surface of the bone. My trainer was feeling uncomfortable because this was highly irregular. The patient was sedated the whole time, which is not usually the case. The procedure was completed, the trainer and I came back and complained to the lead pathologist. We were basically told to keep our mouths shut and our heads down, and it wasn\u2019t our job to tell other doctors how to do their job.\n\nI called and quit the next morning. I wasn\u2019t gonna get thrown under the bus for something else in the future if this is how they do things in their old boys club. That hospital closed down a few years later.",

For some reason, I was walking in a part of the city that was completely deserted a couple days after the outbreak.\nVery faintly I heard someone crying. I approached and found out that it came from a backyard. If I wanted to see who it was, I had to climb a high fence. When I walked into the backyard I was fucking horrified, there was a crying little kid, like 3 years old on a leash, tied to a pole.

Along the way, we somehow were exposed to radioactive waste that gave us all super powers or other mutations. I remember so vividly being able to use my mind to move objects with ease, and I threw donuts at my brother, whose skin had turned as hard as stone. This one girl on the cruise that we all universally hated (for reasons I can't remember) received a really random and useless mutation - she grew a really fat lizard tail, like a leopard gecko who has eaten a lot lol.

            "A long time ago, I had a dream that there were ghosts living in my family's garage. Nowhere else, just the garage. I somehow became friends with one, but she was unable to speak to me, leave the property that the house was on, and wasn't able to show any facial expressions that wouldn't be considered terrifying. Me and my ghost friend were playing on the house porch and two guys were trying to break into the house. She tried to stop them by scaring the living heck out of them by making a terrifying face and screaming the most blood curdling scream ever right in their faces. I wasn't able to see the face she made, but I somehow knew it was there, and all I could hear was the scream. The people trying to rob the house ran off, but instead of celebrating, I curled up and started crying because of how terrifying the scream was.\n\nI absolutely loved that ghost, and I forgot that her whole purpose was to scare people, but she did it to protect me and the house. I still cried though, and she tried to cheer me up the best way she could. Then I woke up. I knew that was a dream, but I didn't want to leave my ghost friend alone knowing the last time she saw me was when she scared me to tears by accident. I tried to go back to sleep, and I did, and I somehow successfully reentered the dream, only it was several years in the future. The garage still had a couple of ghosts in it, but not nearly as much, and the rest seemed to be oblivious to humans. I was going into the attic and found some pictures in there of me around the age I was friends with the ghost, and on a picture I saw a very faint image of her face standing next me. I went down the attic and woke up.\n\nI didn't get to tell the ghost that I forgive her or anything, and I still feel some sort of emotional attachment to her. It was probably the best nightmare I've ever had, and one of the dreams I've wanted to go back to the most, just so I can tell her that there are no hard feelings.\n\nEdit: Thanks for comments everyone. I was just procrastinating and scrolling through Reddit and saw this post and thought, \"oh ya, that happened to me once\". I was seriously not thinking much of it and wasn't expecting this many people to be interested in it. This has made my day how many people have interest in this. Thanks.\n\nAnother edit for good reasons: For y'all out there, this is about my dream where ghosts exist and one of them I became friends with. I appreciate the support in the comments, but please stop wishing/hoping that we meet in real life. A ghost is a ghost. I would feel physically ill if I saw a ghost, wholesome or not. Thank you for your time.\n\nOne last edit because of skepticism: It's been like,  5 months since I left this comment here, and looking back on it, I probably should have cleared something up. I remember this dream pretty well because I wrote what I remembered from it on a piece of paper that I had brought to my room before I went to sleep so I could draw. I used to read it every now and then and I had memorized most of it eventually, and had written a very short story based off of it. I have since lost both of these pieces of paper and they've probably been thrown out by accident by now. Either way, I hope that clears something up regarding my memory of this dream, and yes, I know that my edits are starting to become the length of my story, you don't need to tell me.",

            "Oh boy, here we fucking go. I had this dream which I still remember vividly, even if I was 9-10 at the time.\n\nSo, I was walking down the street and met my primary school teacher, a cute old lady with the driest humour ever, we talked for a bit and she invited me over to talk and drink some tea.\n\nI enter her house, she makes the tea and we sit in this area with 3 walls made out of bookcases, in between there were these 2 somewhat fancy chairs and a round low coffee table. We talked for a bit and she starts telling me how she brought me here for a good reason, and she just, does some magic or presses a damn button or whatever and a wall opens exactly like in Dexter's Laboratory.\n\nShe invites me in, and I see all these people, doing a variety of stuff, people being tied to metal hospital tables, in tubes, whatever. Everything had this technology kind of blue and I walked through this huge mall like revolving door. I realized I fell asleep a bit after walking, so it must've had some kind of sedative or something.\n\nAnyway, I wake up, and in my fear I am tied to a metal table, without any skin, I can see my muscles, all of them, move, twitch and contract all while I am fighting to break loose from the table. That teacher comes by and says to me in the lines of \"don't worry, it's all part of the procedure\". I see other people around me, exactly in the same state.\n\nShe releases me after a bit, she gives me this spandex dark blue suit and told me to wear it. After I put it on I could move like, somewhat of a superhero, I could run really fast, I could jump really high, I was very agile and nimble. She told me I am some sort of recruit and that she has a mission for me.\n\nAfter that I just remember teleporting to someplace by my home, with a gal that I knew by me as my \"duo\", with the task to catch this, black-invisible morphing dog? I remember aiming at that thing with something, like this bulky black blaster, after which, I woke up.\n\nYou can tell that my young me was VERY pissed for not being able to be a superhero.",

It was a great dream, and it was so vivid that when I was waking up, I thought, \"*Crap*, I left my snakes on the couch out with the birds.

I was relieved that it was just a dream because it seemed so real. However, about 10 minutes later I fell back to sleep and the dream actually resumed. I remember think \"oh my God this isn't a dream\" within the dream. The rest was even more vivid and terrifying because I was convinced it was real.\n\nThat was a pretty tough night but it was interesting how my dream managed to resume itself, and it did it in such a way that I was convinced the incident was actually happening.

Somehow I was the last person to go through the door. When I reached the tarmac, there wasn\u2019t a single person in sight. Even the noises from inside the airport had stopped. Up above me the clouds were blacker than night, and purple lightning was striking frequently. As I walked out into the middle of the tarmac staring into the heavens, airplanes started crashing down all around me very cinematically. Honestly the sight took my breath away, and not in a good way. It was very dreadful and dramatic, I can still see it in my head if I focus. I woke up just as a 737 crashed right on top of me. I have a pretty crazy imagination.",

I sneaked into the building at night cautiously proceed to the room where the target is working. Through the glass door I could see him working on his PC. I used a silenced pistol to eliminate him. After the assassination I was curious why I was sent to kill a low level target, so I was snooping around in his computer and stumbled upon some rather interesting classified files which were linking the president of he country doing something which could destroy the whole country. Little did I know they were monitoring the PC and I was caught reading those files. There were backup agents set to kill the target if I am not able to. They were ordered to terminate me immediately.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore I could process the information I started getting attacked by the other agents. 3 agents enter the room and I was behind the desk, so I removed the pin from a grenade and wall banged them.

I reached the president's room I threw a grenade in the room, somehow he managed to escape it and wen outside the base. I followed him and people were running away from something and there was ash falling from the sky. A volcano was erupting and lava was flowing towards me. I see the president on a base on the volcano protected by some shield. I was jumping over the rocks being carried by lava to reach the president and then I woke up.

            "I awoke in a white bed, in a whitehouse/plantation house/pantheon type building. I do not understand how all 3 buildings could coexist as one but my head made it so. I got out of bed, and noticed i was wearing a red flannel, blue jeans, and had short hair. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI walked outside. Alls i could see was fog, a few pine trees. There was a slight breeze in the air. Air grazed by my face gently and cooly sending goose bumps down my arms. Then i noticed, i was standing on a moon pool. I looked down at it, the stars and moon shined down in such a pale blue haze. I looked up, and noticed a slender figure at the edge of the fog\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI watched as it...no her get closer i began to make her out with more and more detail. She had long black silky hair that swayed gently with the breeze, a few more feet i noticed she was wearing a white dress, and then when the lack of fog revealed her true form, did i notice her pale skin. She had a oval, and very beautiful face\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe stared eachother in the eyes, then she says to me \"Its time to go\" in a soft but commanding way. I tell her \"No...not yet\" in a stern, but unhostile tone. We just exchange glances at eachother for well over a few moments. her eyes scream your going to regret this but i hold to my decision. Just then i notice a little demon dog thing by her side.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen i wake up...in a cold sweat... in the middle of the night...as 9 year old me. I had dreamt i was much older than i actaully was. I wanted to go back so bad and figure out what it all meant  where did she want to take me, why had i stepped into that body? till this day this dream lays in my head vivid as the night it happened.",
            "Okay so I didn't wake up in the middle of this dream, I actually got through most of this dream, and decided that it had to end before it could actually end. If that doesn't make much sense, I understand, so here's the story:\n\nA few years back, I was going through a rough time, so to try and relax I decided to just take an afternoon nap. My dream started off in white void where some lady at a reception desk told me I was dreaming, and because I was stressed out and a lot of my work bore no fruit, and I was just border line depressed. The lady at the desk, said that she works for a dream company or something that operates between reality and dreams, and that they usually extend their services towards people who find themselves incredibly stressed, and allow them to have full control over their dreams so that at least in their dreams they can relax. However, they only provide their services a single time for one person. She continued to tell me that I would be allowed full control over my dream and proceeded to give me a lesson on the time difference between reality and dream time. She then gave me a contract that basically said that I would in this dream for 3 dream years, if I somehow managed to die, I'd wake up, if I decided I wanted to wake up, everything I do in the dream would be undone and would wake up, a whole bunch of stuff like that. After that she told me that she had to make sure that I didn't do anything TOO extreme that could harm my mind, so she would act as my supervisor.\n\nWhen I was given full control of my dream, I was basically able to do God level tasks, created my own universe and personally developed galaxies and solar systems. Just so I wouldn't waste time, tall of those tasks were done in like a planetary scale of Sim City. I spent the first \"year\" of the dream crafting my ideal reality and making countless celestial bodies, at a certain point I even designed and brought to life various species' and personally created certain humans. I got to be the God of my own universe.\n\nDuring the second \"year\", I watched most of my creations bloom and evolve all on their own. But there was one solar system I grew incredibly fond of. To fully immerse myself in that experience, I decided to give myself a human form and explore the planets I had created, but instead of the eyes of a god, I saw it in the perspective of a human. But I didn't want to waste my 3 years , so since  I was in full control of everything, I manipulated time so that I could experience a life time in the span of a few seconds of the 3 years I was given, but this was only in effect when I was in human form. My supervisor was always near my side so that I wouldn't be alone and end up doing anything extreme, but she allowed me to do this, as I wasn't breaking the rules of the contract, just bending it. I witnessed the evolution of my planet's life, and the development of its civilization. I wandered the planet which I populated with ruins, fictional like creatures, wondrous environments, and even explored the cities my creations built. I interacted with the people I created, various races, like demi-humans, intelligent monsters, etc. A total anime kinda thing. I traveled from planet to planet and experienced a science fictional life or traversing the stars, and discovering new species. My supervisor was like a traveling buddy and the we ended up becoming good friends. So in my second year, I lived for thousands of years exploring my universe, along side a friend.\n\nUnfortunately, at the near end of the second year, a galactic war broke out, and people caught on to who I was and tried to hunt me down as they saw me as a failed creator. My own creations sought my destruction, and I didn't have the heart to destroy everything that I created, I loved the reality I made, and erasing it would've broken my heart. However, that wasn't enough to stop them from trying to kill me. If I were killed, I'd immediately wake up, so I decided to just get away while I could. But to my dismay, my supervisor got caught in the crossfire, and was fatally injured. Even though I had full control, I was unable to heal her as she told me that since she was not part of the dream I was in control of, my power has no effect on her. So I did the only thing I could think of at the moment. I ended my dream 1 year early. Since as I stated earlier, if I were to do that, everything that happened in the dream, it's existence, and it's effects would be undone; if I were to end my dream now, she wouldn't die. I watched my creation, my ideal universe disappear before my eyes. Even though I didn't have the heart to do it before, I had to convince myself that they were all just figments of my imagination, and that they weren't real. Just seconds before its complete disappearance, I bid farewell to my world.\n\nAfter everything was gone, I found myself back in the white void with the girl waiting for me. Thanking me that I gave up the 1 year of near omnipotence I had to save her life. Even though she was grateful, she was upset that that meant the contract was broken, and \"they\" failed to fully accomplish their goal and fully relieve me of my stress. She blamed herself that such an experience was cut short because of her injury. I told her that it was alright, and that \"All dreams end anyway and that I probably would've spent my last year screwing around anyway\". She then proceeded to explain to me that I was beginning to wake up, and that I may not find my way back to this room ever again. Even though we spent so much time together, became close friends, and shared many experiences together, we both held back on a tearful goodbye. She got up, bowed, and said, \"Thanks for coming, I wish you good fortune when you wake up, and I hope to see you again.\" After that, everything went white.\n\nI immediately woke up afterwards, and didn't feel stressed or tired at all. I have full memories of the dream, and decided to get to work with an optimistic attitude. Though I still have my ups and downs, I've noticed, that ever since that dream, I've been having fun and just enjoy my life. But that was the greatest dream I have ever had.",
            "I had a dream a few years back that I was at this party and met a girl. We hit it off, really connected on a lot of things...but then it hit me: I was dreaming. \n\nI told her that I was bummed because I just realized it was a dream. She didn't believe me, so I asked her what her last name was. She just stared at me blankly. I told her she didn't know cuz my brain hadn't given her a last name, but that we should just enjoy the time we have together. \n\nThen I woke up and fell back to sleep. \n\nI was at another house party. I remember walking around sort of aimlessly until I saw her. She remembered me and we spent the rest of the dream hanging out and holding hands and whatnot. \n\n...Afterwards, it kinda fucked me up for a few days.",

            "Ok so I was dreaming of something weird that actually turned into the concept for a story I\u2019m writing. \n\nSo there were two islands that were shaped almost like crescent moons. The inner parts of the moons faced each other creating a circle of ocean between them. \n\nThere were two big nations on each with smaller settlements trying to win their affection and trust. The smaller settlements were trying to get in the good favor of the big cities for protection. \n\nIn the center of the islands was a large sea monster that occasionally attacked the people so they had huge walls with monster heads on them to try and deter it. \n\nEach city had its own politics, societal views, traditions, etc... The coolest thing in my opinion was that even though the cities competed against each other, they still worked together to have a stable economy and made sure each other had the materials to withstand the attack\u2019s. \n\nI wanted to know more when I woke up. I wrote down everything I could remember and around a year later I\u2019m still adding to the setting. Just got 10,000 words today and I\u2019m actually really happy about it.",

I notice his arm is blackened and missing the hand. I say \u201cSir, are you alright?\u201d He ignores me and starts walking jerkily forward, waving his arms like he\u2019s feeling his way around. I call to him some more, but he never answers. I realize he has been in a fire or explosion and can\u2019t see or hear, and is desperately trying to find help. I look around and see the husk of a house that either burned down or possibly exploded. I\u2019m afraid to touch the man because it might cause him great pain. I start calling out for help myself when a van drives up. I\u2019m relieved but then three men get out and start mocking me and the injured man. They tell me they are time travelers and start joking that I\u2019m going to burn in that house along with the other man (presumably they\u2019re going to take me back in time so that I burn, too?). I walk quickly away to try and get away from those guys. I feel bad for the other guy, but I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s anything I can do now.\n\nSome unknown time later me and my wife are walking together. I\u2019m still anxious over what happened before. We start walking through a kind of tunnel, though it\u2019s more like a canopy of trees. Through the end of the tunnel we can see a house burning, but it\u2019s like it\u2019s in reverse, and eventually the house is totally fine. Now I\u2019m incredibly anxious because I know that\u2019s the house the time travelers said I would burn in, and I can\u2019t stop myself from walking toward it.\n\nSuddenly there\u2019s an astronaut(?) at the end of the tunnel and he\u2019s running toward us. My feelings about him are complex. It\u2019s possible he\u2019s trying to help us in some way, but there\u2019s a feeling of inevitability, like he can\u2019t help, or that he\u2019s going to somehow cause a terrible thing to happen. As I watch him approaching it gets darker and darker until I can\u2019t see anything. But I can hear the crunch of our footsteps as we walk and the heavy breathing of the astronaut as he runs toward us. I feel something touch me, and before I can figure out if it\u2019s the astronaut or my wife I wake up, terrified.",

The upstairs hallway continues for about the same.amountnof length and the stairs go downstairs at a hair pin turn to the right. Instead of having a wall be next to the top platform of the stairs, the landing continued. On that platform I saw my mom's older sister & her daughter playing with her kid. As I watch them play on the carpet of this landing, it seemed as if we were outside playing in the grass but on the carpet on the same time. As I approach them I notice that in the corner of my eye I notice something at the bottom of the stairs. \n\nI look back down the hairpin to follow the rail of the stairs that banks back to the left. At the bottom of the stairs, offset by a few feet, I see a wooden park bench. It was oak & old, with that greyed out color from age & weathering. Rustic and rusted it stood there. I turn to look at it straight on and on the bench I see my grandmother. .. sitting there enjoying some breeze & the grassy interior that was now my house. I turn back to my cousin, her kid, and my aunt and say, \"do you see her?\" And point turning back to my grandmother.

Who are you talking about?\"\n\nI turn back and say, \"it's Medzmama (grandmother in Armenian), it's Medzmama right there!\" And point to the bottom where she is. They say no one is there & are looking where I am pointing exactly. I turn back to look and she is there. I said forget them I'm going to go to her. I ran down the stairs and as I ran I truly felt myself becoming a kid again, like a small incompetent motor skill equiped kid, running down flooding with joy to see those who love me and I loved them. I got to her at the bottom and embraced her in the most warm hug the world left and I was crying in her arms. She looked different, much younger and fuller. When I looked up at her (I'm a 6'5 man, she was a 5'9 woman, hence the child like feeling), she just looked at me like she had for the 15 years I knew her for. \n\n\nThe most peaceful sleep I've ever had. I've had dreams of my grandmother since her passing, but they have diminished the further I get from the day she passed away. This was the first dream that she was in 7 years, completely out of no where and made me cry joyfully that morning. Told my parents & my mom (my grandmother in this dream is her mom) teared up and said, \"I'm glad she came to you to protect you.\" \n\nWhen she passed away, I had this \"missing hug feeling.\" Sounds silly but I yearned for her hug again and how she had protected me. That lasted for months when she had left us. The hug portion of this dream... Was a trip, it was integral and nothing I could have forseen or predicted. This dream was in October 2018. Weird to be a grown ass man and have this come through. Miss you Medzmama, thank you for visiting me I'll see you again, God is good"

I wanted to help you. \n\nI know when you are unable to transfer out of your wheelchair, it is a frustrating situation. It must be absolutely maddening when the house manager can not remove the seat in the center of the theatre (which was bolted to not only the cement floor, but to the rest of the seats in the row) so you can put that wheelchair there. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that our ADA seating were at the front and rear of the theatre, and not where you purchased your ticket. I\u2019m sorry that when you called our box office, you did not mention your inability to transfer out of your wheelchair. \n\nBut you did not need to yell and curse in front of everyone waiting to watch Miss Saigon. You did not have to hit me. You are the first and last person I ever issued a refund to just to get you to stop screaming. \n\nWhen you needed to get back to the lobby and were unable to push your wheelchair back up the ramp, I again tried to help you. First, I offered to push you up myself, but you insisted I should not touch the wheelchair (please note: no one had ever called me a f-word/c-word before, kudos to your creativity). \n\nI then offered to find your now absent husband/boyfriend. It wouldn\u2019t have been hard to find him, for he was at the bar ordering his third whiskey (lobby had only been open for 20minutes at that point). But again, you vehemently declined assistance.\n\nBut I must say, it was rather astounding when you stood up and proceeded to walk the wheelchair back to the box office of your own volition. I say astounding, because when your husband/boyfriend asked why you were leaving, and you said because you \u2018didn\u2019t want to sit in our fucked up seats.\u2019 \n\nI then assumed you had a condition whereupon sitting for long periods of time caused great discomfort. I then asked if there was a way to further accommodate you so that you may see the show. Then your husband called you \u2018an old bat who was just trying to get free tickets. She\u2019s not disabled, it\u2019s all an act!\u2019\n\nI bid you both a goodnight. 1 Star.

Granted, the system has pushed them in that direction as well, but they typically have a better idea of where they want their carreer to go and are willing to put in the effort to obtain that goal. By comparison, I and my cohort mucked about a bit more.",
            "Students are not afraid to just be nice to each other. I teach elementary art and it is so nice when a kid who is pretty unskilled in art show another kid their work, and instead of getting laughed at (like when I was in school) kids are just so sweet and will say things like \"Wow, I really love that!\". I hear kids telling other kids \"I think your work is beautiful\" or \"I really like your ideas!\" and I just think of when I was in art kids made fun of my work. In general I really don't see kids being bullies as much as they were when I was a kid. I went to school in a really nice district too with few problems but I was bullied. Kids here have a MUCH worse home life than kids at my old school and while they could choose to take it out on others.. they don't. Kids help each other too. They know if a student is \"special\" and will try to help that student out. They'll offer to walk them to the bathroom, or help them with their drawing, or very politely tell them to be careful with things.",
            "My GF is a teacher and she is amazed at how uncool drinking and driving is. Kids are like \"that's stupid you will kill someone...\" They literally make fun of kids who do it.

            "They seem generally kinder to each other, especially to the kids who are different.

Even the \u201cjock\u201d kids and big snotty idiot kids who would make perfect bullies are inclusive, kind, and even sometimes *protective* of my son. \n\nI\u2019ve told all of them how appreciative I am, and even got a few of them Christmas presents this year.

            "I'm not a teacher but my GF's mom is a teacher and it sparked a dialogue. \n\nWith the dawn of meme culture, kids are getting competitive with comedy at an early age. When I was a kid, I had un-diagnosed mental health issues so I was bullied a lot, and the only thing that kept me alive was developing my sense of humor. Sad as it is, young people have a pecking order and cliques, but a few things can transcend those boundaries and one of those is humor. Coincidentally, I was into internet humor, meme culture, and PC games way before my peers were. Wanna hear something crazy? I was bullied for that. Specifically and mercilessly. If you ran a meme page and had a nice gaming pc at 10 today you would be a GOD. It's honestly made a lot of kids that don't fit in have at least SOMETHING in common with their peers. All you have to do is yell FORTNITE or whatever meme is going around that week and boom you have a friend. I had one time where I was able to make friends like that and that was when Pokemon came out, similar concept. You might think that kind of stuff is \"cringe\" or annoying or stupid, but if it can prevent someone from wanting to kill themselves at 12 like I was, I'll allow it. Of course I don't need to have it anywhere near me, but that's a different matter. ",
            "They are generally independent and self-reflective. When I first started teaching I thought I had simply lucked out getting students who were consistently bright, engaged and curious, but having now taught at 3 different universities on 2 different continents, it seems to be a general trend across universities.\n\nThey are also, as noted elsewhere, generally kind and empathetic, and both my male and female students are usually pretty emotionally mature.",

            "As a student currently in highschool, the big thing for our generation, at least in decent schools, is that failure isn't cool. Sure if you suck up to the teacher and obsess over studying you'll get made fun of a bit, but the kids getting Fs get made fun of a lot more. A lot of the 'popular' kids are actually really smart and get top grades. There's a general awareness that we all need to do well and a lot of aspiration for the future. ",

            "They really get each other. As much as they diss on each other, joke around, and yes, get to the point of blows, they can usually put issues aside. Sometimes to a fault, but overall they are pretty understanding of each other.  ",
            "Not a teacher, but a former after school care counselor. Even though it may have just been the schools rules/conditioning, the kids were generally so good at apologizing, owning up to their actions, and being accepting of others apologies. (After whatever situation transpired has calmed down, of course.) They always knew to kindly and carefully approach whoever they hurt, make eye contact, and word their apologies in such a way that effectively communicated their apology for the correct reasons. And those being apologized to always knew to say \u201cI accept your apology\u201d as opposed to \u201cit\u2019s ok\u201d. Kids in my day couldn\u2019t figure those kind of communication skills out until at least middle school or high school. The only time I would get a sarcastic \u201csorry\u201d accompanied with an eye roll and running away would be from a kindergartener, or an older child facing other difficulties. ",
            "Taught art for a spell a while back:\n\nI know that a lot of people say shit like \u201coh these children and their all consuming technology\u201d, but a lot of kids are so excited about learning to make things using their devices.\n\nA big part of the sculpture class I taught was to make a statement using a 3D printed sculpture.\n\nEven take something like Minecraft, I know it\u2019s a big meme, but it\u2019s a huge sandbox to build things. I remember being a young teen when I came out- we would get so complex with our builds.\n\nKids are learning to create in an incredibly different way. It can be really irritating when they latch onto something and run it into the ground, but they love learning new things, and creating new things, in an increasingly relevant way.\n\n",

Every social group plays video games. \n\nKids are a lot more literate than when I was in school. Even if they speak English as a second language, the ubiquity of the internet has done wonders for basic literacy, although a lot of mistakes due to the way words sound are still common (their/there, should \u201cof\u201d and could \u201cof\u201d, etc) ",

            "The majority of my students are in the 18-22 age range. I\u2019m 37, for reference. Students are far kinder than they ever where when I was a student. They go out of their way to help each other, and they are much less judgemental than my cohort was. For the most part, they are really polite and respectful. I know a lot of professors deal with problems from cell phones, but I find that if I tell them to use their phones respectfully and only for class purposes, they do. The only real problem I seem to have with this cohort is the constant headphone wearing, but I think that\u2019s a battle I\u2019m just going to lose. \n\nEdit: Wow, my inbox! Thank you all for responding about how headphones help you in class. For what it\u2019s worth, I allow students who need them to use them, provided they are registered with disability services. I also allow them in lab classes. It just gets really frustrating in lectures for me to have to repeat instructions because students couldn\u2019t hear over their headphones, or when someone is too busy rockin\u2019 out to listen to the lecture. I\u2019m going to have to think of some strategies to help those students who need them while still making sure they\u2019re not being disruptive or missing important stuff. \n\nEdit the 2nd: I am truly, deeply sorry for my spelling error.

            "I'm a little late to the party on this one, but I'm a high school teacher. I teach both Honors and Inclusion classes, so I get a great variety of kids. Today, one of my students was very harsh to an autistic student who tried to politely sit next to her and charge his laptop. She said \"you're not sitting next to me!\"  and put her leg in the chair so he couldn't sit down. Before I could respond, 5 of the \"tough\" girls in the class immediately jumped to the autistic student's defense, calling the girl rude and really letting her have it. They were firm and composed in their defense of the student and probably made the kid's day. Teaching can be rough sometimes, but they made me really proud today. I think a lot of our modern day students are compassionate for others and incredibly intelligent. Don't let their abuse of smartphones fool you!",
            "I teach on the college level. From what I can tell, many of them seem more open to having a variety of kind of friends. Where I teach has a big hook up and party culture, but they seem to have genuine cross-gender friendships despite that, and in my opinion, that's been good for them.\n\nEdit: I feel like I should specify, since this comment blew up, that this is dependent on who's available to your in terms of variety. For example, I went to a very racially diverse undergrad and had all kinds of friends. My students go to a very very white college and do not have racial diversity in their friendships as a result, but I think a fair amount that is structural.\n\nI also feel kind of like the bad guy here, but it's interesting that men in fraternities came up, because a lot of times they are the exception with my students. They'll really only hang out with their brothers, and depending on the fraternity, can be really awful to women.",
            "[deleted]",
            "The high school students I work with today seem significantly more emotionally intelligent than those of my generation, especially the young men. They are aware of their own feelings and are better at separating their feelings from fact (i.e., they're more likely to say \"I'm feeling X,Y,Z, negative emotion right now\" than \"Ugh, this teacher just hates me, what a bitch\"). They're also better at seeing and accommodating emotions in other people. There's more awareness of and sympathy for mental health issues.\n\nHere's an illustration: The other day, some of the students I coach were conversing and one young man asked how frequently they had a good cry. They all answered. And he said, \"I think I'm overdue for a good cry,\" and his peers started suggesting good movies to induce tears.\n\nIt was an utterly shocking scene for me! Great, but nothing I would ever have expected.\n\nKids can be stunningly introspective and empathetic when you ask them to talk about their interpersonal issues. There's a real effort to perspective-taking that goes beyond what I encountered at that age.\n\nAlso, the students I work with have some selection bias, to be fair, but the ones I encounter as a whole care a lot about current events. It's like it's actually cool to know and care what's going on, and it's uncool not to. This is very different from how I grew up. I think a lot of them would agree with the statement \"Being smart is cool and learning new things is fun\" which seems simplistic, but isn't true to everyone. I think it's related to the pressure to get into college. This pressure to be more well-rounded in your interests is a double-edged sword: kids get social capital from being exposed to different ideas and cultivating interests, but it's also a difficult race to model yourself into some ideal.\n\nEdit: I should clarify that I am a coach, not a teacher, so my sample size is more homogeneous. I am also in a unique position where I regularly interact with urban public school kids (mostly low-income students of color) largely white, wealthy suburban public school kids, and first-year college students.

This is a self esteem free zone.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Edit:** Thanks for my first highly upvoted comment on AskReddit! I hate it! Let me address the main things people keep destroying my inbox with:\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYes, it is good to be at a healthy weight. However, if you're only working out because you think someone won't be into you otherwise, you're doing it for the wrong reasons. If someone doesn't like you at slightly above your ideal weight, they don't actually like you. They either aren't that into your personality or they're shallow. Not worth your time or tears.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYes, physical attractiveness is important in romantic courtship. However, it's hardly the most important thing. People can find you more attractive after getting to know you. If you have a shit personality, it doesn't matter if you have perfect abs.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat I wrote above is paraphrased. It's not a one to one. The point of the conversation is: barring being at an extremely unhealthy weight (see morbid obesity and anorexia) or some serious malformality, personality is more important than looks. And if someone doesn't like your looks at one weight (barring the above) they're not going to be more interested at a healthier weight. If they are, they aren't worth it other than for a quick shag. If you want to get to a healthy weight through diet and exercise, do it for you. Don't do it to impress others. Your motivation should be self improvement, not landing a shallow boyfriend/girlfriend.",
            "As an ex-college Prof, contrary to belief, they seem better at helping each other out and giving their point of view on a topic or idea.  \n\nWhen teaching before, they would try to explain to each other how I explained them to do it.  Now, they go look for other ways, both good and bad, on YouTube and explain different things they have found on YouTube.  \n\nThis mentality can be bad if it doesn't always hold true ( I taught math), but other ways of explaining I hadn't thought about.

The students I've taught, whether at a school that was generally dysfunctional or at one that runs really smoothly, question authority and speak out against perceived injustices in a way that kids in my generation (I'm in my early 30s) did not. They are *absolutely* aware of the spread of misinformation and attempts to control people's thinking through propaganda, and they are massively better prepared to see through it than any generation before them.\n\nThis is the only generalization I can really make, tbh. I've been at schools with negative cultures where the kindness that I'm reading other people talk about in their responses was nonexistent. I'm at a school now that is so relentlessly positive and loving that if I hadn't taught at other schools I might think it was a generational thing.

I don't feel politically charged one way or another on the topic, but I do wish there was more of a solid matriculation plan for families. Printing permission slips in 27 different languages (this is not an exaggeration) is not exactly meeting the needs of each family when it comes to them understanding what is expected of them as a parent and what is going on in their child's life. That's a whole other whale of a topic though... the point is, the students don't seem to notice the explosion of culturally different children. Like, at all. More than half of my females wear a hijab over her hair for various religious reasons. No one bats an eye. A fifth of the class is fasting for Ramadan? Oh, that's cool, man. Little Fadilla speaks Swahili? Woah. What does it sound like? Cool! Let me show you where the lunchroom is. We frequently talk about family food traditions and it is a ball hearing what each child's favorite food is. I love it. \n\nWhen I was in school, we had one kid from a foreign exchange program and he was a damn celebrity. Now, we have don't even teach ESL (English as a Second Language) any more. It's ENL (English as a NEW Language). That's because most of our students who speak a language other than English speak at minimum 3 or 4 languages and several I can think of speak 6 or 7. It's incredible! I see this as a massive step in the right direction. Instead of pockets of cultures, I simply see heterogeneous groups of kids being kids. Sharing lunches, trading pokemon cards. It's awesome. ",

I have a severe facial pain disorder and have had numerous procedures and brain surgery, and my kids take better care of me than my coworkers. They take care of each other, too.\n\nWhile they aren't afraid to fail, failure isn't a badge of honor. It's cool to be a \"smart kid.\" This isn't something I saw first starting 14 years ago.

What blows my mind is how these children interact with him.  I drop him off occasionally and when I do, the other kids all will say hi and ask him how he's doing, even when they know he probably won't respond to them.  They invite him to play in the classroom and on the playground, and they are just genuinely nice kids.  When I was a kid, special education students were completely segregated from the mainstream students and we weren't taught about what made them different or how to interact with them.  It really makes me happy and gives me hope, not just for my son but for the next generation as a whole.\n\nAlso, teachers, you guys rock.\n",

Their teacher left an MLK worksheet and asked that I talk about him, so I found his \"I have a dream\" speech on Youtube for the kids to listen to while they did the worksheet.  When he got to the part about dreaming that little white children and little black children joining hands and playing together, one little (Indian) boy shot his hand up and asked why he dreamed about that.\n\nI explained that in MLK's day, children of color were not supposed to play or mix with white children, and that they were sent to different schools, eat at different restaurants and couldn't even share a water fountain.\n\nThe appalled little faces turned towards me shook me a little; and when one little (white) girl said \"But we're all together now, so he's got his dream.\"  I teared up a bit.\n\nThe kids are alright.

My whole life we've rarely argued and during my entire upbringing we only had a few actual fights... All of which were 100% my fault. The point I'm making is that my mom is a really sweet, genuine person who did an amazing job raising two boys on her own.\n\nWhen I was 12 I had a bad day and got home in a mood. I wasn't quite looking for a fight per say, but I was being a crabby, snappy, negative jerk. Mom put up with it for a while and then had enough. I can't recall the catalyst but she wanted me to do something and I refused. So the count came:\n\n\"3...\"\n\n\"2...\"\n\nAnd I interjected, \"1, BITCH!\"\n\nThere was a stunned silence for a moment and then she looked at me with rage in her eyes. \n\n\"I-I-I'm sorrrrrryyyy!\" I pleaded but I had crossed a line and punishment was coming. \n\nShe moved so fast, like a blur and I was frozen. I was taller than her but she scooped me up, thrust me in a chair and told me to, \"wait there.\" Her voice had both ice and heat \u2014 how is that possible?\n\nShe came back with a bar of Ivory soap which she jammed into my mouth.

After about another five seconds of silence she just told me to go to my room. \n\nI learned two things that day: \n\nIt might not always pay off but it's always better to try and stand up for yourself. \n\nLock your doors because the fight ain't ever over \n\nShe threw a flash bang into my room then proceed to whip me with her belt.

            "Not the couple getting married but the Best Man and Maid of Honor who were married to each other. Best Man's speech was all about how hard it was to be married. \"I've been married for a year and it feels like 100 years.\" Maid of Honor stands up to give a speech and just says \"Ditto.\" It was so awkward and really brought the whole room down. Brother of the bride stood up and gave a nice impromptu speech about teamwork and having a partner to go through life with. How happy the family was to have the groom join their family. Best Man and Maid of Honor were divorced within a year. Couple who got married are still married 30+ years later. I sometimes wonder if the speeches actually were helpful in how not to act as a couple. \n\nFor me the complex backstory. Bride's brother is gay and has been in a longterm relationship for 40+ years. At the time he gave his speech about marriage he couldn't marry the man he loved and I think his passioned defense of marriage was born from that. When people would say they were against gay marriage because it makes a mockery of marriage I'd think of that night. The married couple who had no respect for marriage could easily marry (and did over and over again) and the man who stood up and defended marriage could not. He's married now and lovingly takes care of his husband as he battles health issues.",
            "She told me two days before that she found her fianc\u00e9 annoying and that she didn\u2019t like him and that he was AWFUL in bed.\n\nShe was visibly, endlessly uncomfortable at the rehearsal wedding/dinner combo.\n\nThen she sobbed the ENTIRE morning, day-of. She ended up not getting any makeup done cause she wouldn\u2019t stop scream-sobbing and refused to get dressed, stalling the wedding \\~35 minutes.\n\nShe then said 45 minutes of \u201cvows\u201d that she had prepared (9 pages of things like inappropriate vows to friends and family, his parents and sisters, none of them her husband), and then ALMOST didn\u2019t say \u201cI do\u201d. Managed to get a, \u201cuh, yeah, okay, yeah I do\u201d out of her almost a full 60 seconds after she was supposed to say anything.\n\nI could go on for HOURS, but it was the most painful and awkward wedding I\u2019ve ever been to. I\u2019ve got my money on 10 months. We\u2019re 1 month in.\n\nEDIT - 2.5 month update \u2014 I\u2019ve distanced myself from them completely. She is really clingy and likes to gossip about how awful her husband is and I really don\u2019t have the time. She\u2019s also told me they\u2019re in couples therapy after I expressed negativity towards some extremely concerning things she said regarding their relationship + lack of communication. But, I\u2019m still betting on 10 months because she believes it\u2019s all his fault and truly believes his parents and sisters are exactly the same (news flash, they\u2019re all lovely people).\n\nEDIT #2 - 5 month update \u2014 I no longer associate with them so I\u2019m out of the loop regarding juicy details. Last I heard they keep moving all over the country and fight non-stop. No more lovey-dovey images on social media. Seems to be right on track for a 10 month breakup.\n\nEDIT #3 - 2 year update \u2014 I WIN. (Well, kinda) I feel like that's horrible to say. ~~Does that make me a bad person?~~ It's been two years and I've been meaning to update this post for a while. My original bet was 10 months. They lasted 1 year and 10 months, almost to the day. I wish I could say that this entire journey has been bittersweet, but honestly it's been hilarious and funny and sad and unnecessary. I feel really, really bad for my husband's best friend. She trash talked him all over facebook and shared all their private text messages. It was disgusting on her part and he really didn't deserve to deal with her shit. I'm so glad he's free from her now!",

            "I've got two:\n\nOne of my good friends got married and I'd never met her before the wedding because \"she's just shy.\" On the wedding day, she was belligerently drunk before the ceremony even started and couldn't even get through the lines she was supposed to repeat (i.e. \"I promise to love you\"). She ended up slapping the groom, spilling champagne on her dress, and then crying under a table while he tried to comfort her. They lasted about 4 months.\n\nAnother one was my wife's friend. She's a very conservative, religious white girl who married a black man. Most of her racist family didn't approve of the marriage and didn't show up. But she planned the whole marriage around race. Like a vanilla cake for her and a chocolate cake for him, the wedding colors were black and white, and even the meals were white meat for her side and dark meat for his. It was extremely uncomfortable as a guest. They lasted 2 years (but broke up because he was abusive and almost killed her, rather than the weird racial tension).",
            "Source:  My Wedding.\n\nWe'll start three days before.  The wedding was a ren-fair style wedding outside at a large gazebo and the Maid of honor had promised to purchase a stylized dress for my bride that they had agreed on.  THREE DAYS before the wedding she calls to tell us she had no money and was embarrased to admit it....so we literally hand-sewed ont together in 24 hours.  IMO it turned out pretty nice for what we had...\n\nBrides mother was supposed to pick up the cake in ATX and drive an hour south for the wedding.  She left her house 30 minutes before the wedding to pick it up.  When she finally showed up (hour late) the cake was DESTROYED....she put it in the back seat and drove like hell all the way down, just slamming it against box with every turn.\n\nDuring the one hour delay, there was almost a fist fight between two groomsmen because....well the MoH showed up, IN THE DRESS THAT SHE WAS 'UNABLE TO AFFORD'.  Obvious attempt to upstage the bride.  The same MoH during her speech after the ceremony started it of by saying 'When we all met, I did not like Drakkarim411 at all, however I found that he grows on you...like a fungus.'\n\nNeedless to say my entire side of the family was super cold to all of this.\n\nSince all of these issues were on her side of friendships or families, I was told to suck it up and we'll discuss later.  I sort of assumed that a lot of these 'friends' had just shown themselves the door.  Quite the opposite.  In fact, two years later when I accepted my first well paying job out of college, it became an issue that it was an hour and a half out of Austin...so she decided to just stay in ATX to be with her friends.\n\n...I mailed her the divorce papers and since she couldn't be bothered to even show up to the hearing....I've never seen her again.",
            "Not at the wedding itself, but I used to work at a David's Bridal. Bride came in with tons of friends, we did the Say Yes To The Dress Thing, and an hour later she'd standing there in $3,000 worth of stuff and doesn't have any money with her or in her account. She decides she wants to apply for the store credit card, I run it through the system, and she gets denied. She then calls the groom for his info (which, to be fair, people did all the time), and he tells her no. She threw a HUGE fit on the phone with him, standing on the bridal stage, literally demanding \"WHY NOT? WHY?! WHY!!\" like an actual child over and over again. I've never seen a 30 year old age backwards so quickly. She was just a brat. Literally stomping her feet in front of me, all her friends, and the other bride in the store. \\*I\\* was embarassed. At the end of all of that, she hangs up on him and her friend is like \"I'm so sorry you can't get your dress\" and the bride stops crying instantly and just goes \"Oh I'll get the dress. I just have to do this at home and when he gets mad enough he'll come get it for me so I'll stop.\"\n\nSpeechless. Sure enough. Girl came back two days later with her man and he applied for the credit card and bought the dress. He was livid and silent, and she was smug as hell. Can't imagine they're having a happy marriage if they are still together.",
            "I\u2019M WITNESSING ONE FROM THE SIDELINES NOW!!! \n\nMy wife\u2019s brother just got married this past May. Bride\u2019s mother is a big DIY person and went a little nuts with extra flowers, table pieces, decorations, etc\u2026  Note I said extra, it was already decorated by the venue, she just took it upon herself to buy and add way more stuff.\n\nAnyway, a few weeks ago she sends my MIL (grooms mom) and email with receipts of all the extra stuff she bought ($7,000 worth!!! ) and asked that she pay half since it was technically set up in time for the rehearsal dinner for guests to enjoy. It\u2019s causing a huge rift between the newlyweds since the bride is taking her moms side.",
            "My wife got invited to a client's daughter's wedding. The couple were both drama students. Many of the bridal party were drama students. The maid-of-honour's toast consisted of tearful declarations of unrequited love to the groom, along the lines of 'if it couldn't be me, I'm glad it's my best friend that's marrying you'. The best-man's speech was a lusty declaration of 'if it doesn't work out, call me, babe... like the previous time you called me.' Other toasts were similarly weird. A guy at the table I was seated at was a friend of the bride and said to me that he was 'this close' to standing up during the 'speak now or forever hold your peace' thing. I'm still not sure if the whole thing was a bunch of emotionally fucked-up 20-year-olds, or one big piece of performance art.",
            "I was maid of honour. Me, best man and the couple went into a separate little room to do the signing stuff. Bride excused herself to go the bathroom and the groom started making pretty mean remarks about her cooking (sth she's passionate about) to the officiary. She came back, heard they were talking about cooking family meals together and gave him the warmest smile, thinking he had praised her. He scoffed awkwardly and changed the topic. That always stuck with me. He wasn't laughing WITH her but AT her, behind her back.\n\nThey lasted 7 months.",

I wasn't around for what actually set it off but it ended when the bride got in the middle, got an elbow in the eye and the happy couple left for the night. This was in rural Canada.

The best man's speech didn't mention the bride at all and basically boiled down to \"Groom, you're married now but our bond is older and stronger, all of our hunting and fishing trips together are the best thing in our lives, can't wait for more.\"  Such a sad, desperate atmosphere.

I particularly cringed at \"it's because we so get each other and are so comfortable that he can call me dumb slut as a nickname.\" They didn't last the year.\n\nOne where the wedding was all about the groom promoting his band. He even \"sang his bride a song\" that was literally just him showing off his vocal range with some classic piece. She stood up and joined him on stage half way through and he looked annoyed that he had to share the limelight. They lasted about 2 years (he was sleeping with the other vocalist in the band.)",

            "This was my sister's best friend and it was a bachelorette party moment. Bride had been having an affair, everyone knew it. The groom's friends tried to tell him, but she convinced him they were making it up. I mean, at that point it was just sad. She actually had the balls to force fiance to apologise to the guy she was sleeping with for the accusations. The night of the bachelorette party she actually took all her bridesmaids back to the other guys house and spent the night with him. He came to their wedding.  It was SO AWKWARD. Everyone knew and everyone was talking. The groom was told, but chose to overlook it. After the wedding she insisted the other guy come on vacations with her and her husband and included him in all their social functions. Now, if they're non monogamous, whatever, go crazy! But her husband was an absolute wreck about it for years and she just kept gaslighting him. No one could convince him to leave her. She told my sister that affair guy insisted he would never marry her and didn't want kids so she was using fiance to get them. They ended up divorcing two years later after their second child was born. She immediately moved in with affair guy and they did end up getting married.\n\nEdit: I wanted to add a little more context since this comment blew up a bit. Everyone involved in this story was really young, except affair guy. He had already been married and divorced and had a few kids of his own by then, but he was still well under 30. The original couple had been together since middle school and all this went down between the ages of 21-23. I think the husband was just really naive and invested in the relationship. Small town marry your high school sweetheart and live happily ever after bullshit.  Affair guy did NOT go with them on their honeymoon, but he was included in group vacation plans before and after the wedding. Other people in the friend group did start refusing to go if he was involved. The bride had this really twisted power move that husband was not allowed to disrespect or offend affair guy. Any jealousy or suspicions were his own insecurities and anyone who said they were sleeping together just didn't understand platonic friendship. Affair guy was just a good friend, her best friend really, and husband needed to get over it. Bride and affair guy are still married and the second child is likely actually his. Groom married a girl they went to high school with and seems content.",
            "The groom took the stupid cake thing to an extreme. The bride had given him his bite, and mushed a little on his chin or nose. He then took a piece and MASHED it into her face so hard that I was expecting her to end up with a bloody nose. Cake and frosting got up her nose, in her eyes, down the front of her dress, etc.\n\nThe bride had to go get cleaned up, had her makeup re-done, and was ugly-crying within an hour of saying, \"I do.\" He didn't give a fuck.",
            "I was kindly included in a last-minute plus-one to the wedding of a family friend who I'd never met before. At the rehearsal dinner (or the German equivalent, the Polterabend) the guests smashed ceramic and porcelain items on the ground. I was fresh in Germany, so this was all pretty out of context and frightening, but my boyfriend explained that it's a tradition - reminding the couple that life is sometimes difficult and you have to work together to clean it up. \n\nThe bride kind of half-heartedly motioned to the groom to sweep it up. He did a little bit, then just moved on to talk to his friends, leaving most of the shards strewn around the yard. Additionally, I don't think I saw the couple talk to each other once over the next three days of celebrations. \n\nIt was a gorgeous wedding, and I'm so grateful that I was invited (really good way to begin living in a new country), but it wasn't surprising to hear that they'd divorced a few years later.",

My friend is getting shots of every body getting dressed up at the same time because the groom, groomsmen, bride and bridesmaids are all getting ready in the same room. The groom decided to have his bucks party (bachelor, stag do) the night before so they're all hunger over as shit and snorting line after line of coke, something that is making my photographer friends job hard because she can't get any nice shots of the groom or groomsmen without these illicit drugs in view. The energy in the room is getting uncomfortable so the bride asks if they could take it easy on the coke and get a couple of nice photos. The groom yells \"Shut up, cunt\" and keeps snorting. \n\nThe girl who got my friend the gig said they divorced like 4 months later.\n\nAnother friend of mine was pressured into marrying his girlfriend of like 8 years because she dropped an ultimatum, propose to me within a year or we're done.

The groom had three best men, as well as ushers etc. His sister and one best man read something during the ceremony (and then all three said long speeches about him at dinner).

She basically told him when he left that he would never see her, or hear from her, or about her again. She dropped all friends that had a connection with him (after he left) and made sure he would always live his life wondering if he made the right decision and what she was up to.\n\nI really hope his dying thought is about her.

He told me what he saw in the house the night before was enough for him to know this wedding was doomed and they should not be dating, let alone getting married.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT in an attempt to answer some of these questions:  First, this was about 20 years ago and we are all in our 40s now and have moved on with life since.  So,  I dont know why the mother wasnt there. I just remember thinking it was weird when I noticed she wasnt, and then later heard they were on the phone with her.   The roommate was visibly angry when I went to pick him up for the wedding.  Outright refused to come, and I think ended up moving out and basically disappearing after. He was a big dude who worked as a bouncer at clubs and my impression was he had to go into work mode the night before in his living room and wasnt happy about it.  I never heard details and I wouldnt have felt right asking for them.  I am still friends (in the sense that I see them every few years) with both the bride and groom, see my comment below for how they turned out. Happy ending considering.  I should also add, the years in which they dated and got married, all of us were very heavy binge drinkers. We were in our twenties and worked service industry jobs.  It seemed normal almost for this much drama to be around.  Looking back I dont have the same opinions. No one involved ended up in rehab or prison and all live relatively normal lives now.",

I just stood there in disbelief fuming while she kept shouting and motioning for me to dance in front of all our guests. \n\nTo boot, we had set a budget, she exceeded it, then her parents decided to chip in 5K, and rather than use it to offset what we were over budget, she decided to spend more. \n\nIn retrospect, that should have been a huge clue that she didn't respect me at all. Cheated on me and ran off with some guy like a year later. Got 'remarried' before we were legally divorced. Her parents never did hand over the 5K, because they'd put a provision on it that we had to go up north for a weekend and take some stupid Christian financial planning course their friend ran. My ex was also an atheist and didn't want to do that, but knowinglu spent the money we didn't actually have. Ffs.",

The kids all had a conversation: What should we do? Should we ask about it.  That should have been our first clue that it wasn't a good idea for them to get married.  But lack of perspective made us oblivious to the obvious.... So we pressured them.    \nHey! You told us you were going to get remarried, when are you going to do it?   \n\n\nAnyway, then we suddenly found ourselves in a courtroom, speaking to the judge!   He was wise, and asked to speak privately to my parents, and I am sure asked them: Why are you doing this, are you sure?

As the prince rises from the debris, the face of the king grows pale at the sight of the foul monstrosity that has been brought into this world as a human-chicken hybrid. Before he can react, I force the king to the dungeon. I take out the rage that has developed in me over the years due to my fallen brethren, in the only way I know how. I lather both of our bodies with honey mustard. For days, nothing can be heard from the dungeon but the sharp screeches of an adult male chicken. On the 7th day the king's body is no more. I withdraw from the dungeon and take my rightful place on the throne, surrounded by my queen, my subjects and a harem of the most beautiful chickens the mind can imagine. I live out my days happily, but occasionally reminiscent of my family before the rebellion. Food was scarce in that time. I am not proud of what I had to do, but I am no longer just a petty survivor. I. AM. THE CHICKEN KING!!!",

            "The majority of those chickens are sadly born and raised in conditions that won't even let them walk effectively, let alone swarm someone. Then, quite a few of them are also chicks. But, that being said, even if all 19,000,000,000 chickens were completely healthy, adult, and free roaming, this question has been posed by someone who has seriously never seen the all-encompassing stupidity and hopelessness of a chicken. It's incapable of thought or learning anything. It's scared of everything. No chicken has ever died a natural death - it's always, *always*, eaten by something. The chicken is the perfect prey. Every meat-eating animal thinks it's tasty.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTry buying a couple dozen chickens. Apart from the fact that they shit everywhere indiscriminately, they're really good for yards. They eat any and every pest. Unfortunately, being such natural prey, they're hunted by everything. You'll have to build a chicken coop and usher them all inside of it at night. Predators and animals that you didn't even know were located around you will flock for miles and miles to set up camp outside of your chicken coop and pick them off at night, one at a time. The things that aren't big enough to eat a chicken, will be small enough to sneak in and eat all their eggs. If there was a chicken rebellion 19 billion strong, a full quarter of them would be eaten by wildlife before they even reached humanity's front line. Then, once they reached us, we'd just do what everything else did and eat them. The question isn't how would we battle them, it's how would we effectively chase them down and consume them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nListen well, city slickers: Living on a farm is a horrible, nasty business. I know you're all thinking \"Man, wouldn't it be nice to drop this rat race some day, get out of Chicago, go live in the country somewhere with my partner and just live a quiet farm life?\" You're a fucking idiot and you should never do that. Be grateful for your office job that let's you live in a nice apartment where everything is taken care of by calling the maintenance man. Be grateful you don't have to shake your boots before you put them on, just in case a scorpion got inside them last night. Be grateful you don't live in a place where not only are venomous snakes plentiful around your property, but it's also your own responsibility to get rid of them. You're not ready for the kind of fight that living on a farm will bring you. What you ARE ready for is a battle with a giant flock of chickens with brains barely sophisticated enough to provide it with basic instincts. An army of 19 billion chickens would be put down so quickly and efficiently that it would be over before most of the world even knew it had begun.",

I'm at work tonight and unable to respond to everyone but, as other people have said, if someone becomes unresponsive do compressions... Don't waste your time trying to figure out if they're having a heart attack! To the people who took the little course offered on the website I really hope you found it valuable! \n\nEdit 2: Yes please do check for a pulse before cracking ribs.

A castrato is a male singer who has been castrated before puberty. Basically, if a young boy had a high voice in choir or something along those lines, they would be castrated while young so that they wouldn\u2019t lose their abilities to reach the high pitches because their voices wouldn\u2019t drop due to puberty. Honestly, the recording completely creeps me out because it was such an awful thing in the history of opera, and it\u2019s so creepy that only a little under a hundred years ago did the last official castrato die.

            "In the documentary Paris is Burning, there's a moment where a drag queen named Dorian Corey is getting ready and she says:\n\nI always had hopes of being a big star. But as you get older, you aim a little lower. Everybody wants to make an impression, some mark upon the world. Then you think, you've made a mark on the world if you just get through it, and a few people remember your name. Then you've left a mark. You don't have to bend the whole world. I think it's better to just enjoy it. Pay your dues, and just enjoy it. If you shoot a arrow and it goes real high, hooray for you. \n\nMy impression of her was that she said it with extreme world-weariness like all the fight had gone out of her. [Here is a clip of the scene.](https://youtu.be/wV18KXos0xQ)\n\nAfter Dorian died, a suitcase was found in her apartment with the decomposing body of a man who had died from a gunshot wound to the head. He had been dead for about 15 years, and Dorian died 3 years after Paris is Burning was released, meaning at the time of shooting the film she had had the body in her closet for many years.

I watched one of the videos, and it's him complaining about his loud neighbors (which was hypocritical of him, since his actions were much worse than giving loud parties or whatever that made him complain about his neighbors). One thing that I remember about the channel that was taken down was that people started commenting on his videos, calling him a pedophile, cursing him and telling him to rot in jail. I personally didn't comment anything, but I supported these comments, since the guy is a horrible person, who destroyed lives.

At least, I'm convinced that the McAfee service is just a virus that makes you pay similar to some of those other viruses that get your photo via your personal webcam, lock your computer and show you a copy pasted photo of a \"legal document\" urging you to pay a ransom, what was it, ransomware.   \n\n\nSo my belief is that Even though most people may use McAfee as a computer firewall security service, it's more than likely a scam.

Social media groom minds.\n\n.\n.\nEDIT: Wow, over 11k upvotes! If we may assume that 1 in 10 people bother to vote at all, this means that my post has been seen by over 100,000 people! This illustrates the amazing power of the internet. \u00a0The irony is not lost on me that my most popular post ever should be about how social media have become overly commercialized to the point of being a scam =)\n\nThings I learned from the comments & some light research:\n\nMany of you quoted the old saying \u201cwhen the product is free, YOU are the product\u201d. The earliest attribution that I could find was to an artist named Richard Serra in 1973. To this I could add, \u201cthere is no such thing as a free lunch\u201d.\n\nBuilding and running the internet is not free. In fact, several sources state that the internet consumes over 10% of the global electricity supply. \u00a0Let that sink in for a bit... \u00a0Using 10% of the global electricity supply is equivalent to running about half the USA (or Germany + Canada + South Korea + France + UK + Italy). \u00a0Put another way, 10% of global CO2 emissions from electricity generation are due to running the Internet.\n\nIf we estimate that 50% of internet activity consists of sending around advertising and spam, we have to ask ourselves: is that really worth spending 5% of the world\u2019s entire electricity supply on? \u00a0Or would it not be better to dial that fluff wayyy back and start charging users a fair fee? \u00a0Speaking for myself, I believe that the internet is an invaluable addition to our lives and I would be willing to pay a fair & transparent fee for an ad-free, tracker-free, spam-free, bot-free internet experience, certainly if that means that we will also save 5% of the world\u2019s global electricity. Note that I am not saying the Internet should be censored, far from it!\n\nOf course, designing and implementing something like that will be very difficult; I think we will need to look to the EU for innovations in this space.\n\nI also learned that my ad blocking settings were overdue a refresh. I found that on my iOS (iPhone, iPad) in particular it is hard to find effective ad blockers. \u00a0This is due to the fact (TIL) that Apple does not allow browsers other than Safari on iOS; the Firefoxes and Chromes you download on those devices are simply copies of Safari with a different jacket slapped on to it (for which Mozilla and Google pay Apple a pretty penny no doubt).

            "One that isn't mentioned much (that I've ever noticed), also doesn't generate much sympathy since it scams businesses instead of individuals...  the BBB is pretty much a scam.  They can collect reports on businesses who aren't members (plus merely not being accredited is supposed to be bad).  But businesses have to pay for the priviledge of being accredited.\n\nAs far as what it actually does... nothing really.  I worked for a large company at the executive response level before, responding to FCC and BBB complaints among other duties, and generally you just have to summarize your response of what action was taken... it's akin to sharing account notes basically.  So... essentially complaints don't do anything at all.  Nothing is going to happen if you make a BBB complaint in 99% of cases, it's just yelling to get an officially posted response of the same answer you didn't like the first time. However... if you do not answer them or even refuse to pay for the useless service, then you get dinged because BBB accreditation is supposed to mean something.  It's pretty much the white collar equivalent of a protection racket.\n\nI'm sure there are very very rare cases where legitimate complaints were resolved... but most of these could have been merely by asking for a supervisor.  Filter out those cases, then you have an absolutely miniscule amount that perhaps could be considered legit (meaning I had to tell supervisors/management they did something wrong/correct any actual issue).  And for that miniscule number, I'm pretty sure you could always find alternative pathways that still didn't justify extorting businesses for the priviledge.  I'm not sure that I can think of one single \"good thing that was there\" case in a few years worth of handling these complaints.\n\nThe only thing it is good for in the slightest is spotting complete and obvious scams.  But even then (from anything I've ever seen personally at least), it's literally obvious scams... meaning you shouldn't have needed the BBB to notice.  I'm talking like... a computer software company that sells burned cheap copies of Windows and such... super obvious stuff.  And yet for this miniscule service, they get to charge most businesses for \"protection\" (accreditation), because a great BBB rating is ingrained as good and no accreditation has successfully been ingrained as bad.  Also consumers are trained to think a complaint hurts a business rating... it does not at all.  Not responding to a complaint is the only thing that hurts the rating.  Or not bothering to pay to be accredited.\n\nI mean if you tried to start your own business on the same sort of model, I'm pretty sure you could end up with charges lol.  The closest thing is literally a mob protection racket. You can pay us for protection (from bad/no accreditation), and in exchange we won't beat you up (declare in neon letters that you didn't pay us to be accredited).

There are 155M employed Americans today.  So if ever American ONLY uses the teleportation to commute to work then 70 people per day will die just commuting.  NTSB says about 100/day die in traffic accidents (all driving not just commuting) so the numbers are reasonably close.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow consider 2nd order effects like, if everyone else used the teleportation, my commute would just be me and interstate shipping transportation, My individual chances of having a traffic accident go way down with fewer commuters on the highways. So the option A or B of driving or teleportation math starts to change in favor of driving.  Assuming only organic matter and personal belongings (because modesty) can teleport and not large crates of oranges and barbie dolls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso figure that with a drastically reduced number of variables on the road would make self driving vehicles an even better/safer proposition.  And my commute becomes an hour long peace and quiet time to read or netflix.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm convincing myself to the no column here.

            "That's better odds than flying in an airplane at 1 in 3 million.",
            "There are 12.5 deaths per billion vehicle miles due to motor vehicles in the US. What we want to know is the average distance you have to cover when you get in the car before you achieve a 1 in 5 million chance of dying.\n\nThe odds of dying while driving isn't linear. For example, if you drive 80000000 miles, that would look like you have a 100% chance of dying and at 160000000 miles you have a 200% chance of dying. That is obviously wrong. What we want is a probability distribution that gives you a cumulative probability of dying of 0% at 0 miles and 100% as you approach infinity miles.\n\nWhat we need is a ~~Poisson~~ Exponential Distribution. Exponential distributions work over continuous scales instead of discrete scales. This distribution follows the format:\n\n* Pm(x) = 1-e^(-x\\*k)\n\nWhere,\n\n* Pm is the probability of dying per commute.\n* x is the distance traveled per commute\n* and k is the probability of dying every mile. (12.5 deaths / 100000000 miles)\n\nSo, after 50 miles, your probability of dying is:\n\n* Pm(50) = 1-e^(-50\\*12.5/1000000000)=0.000000625\n* or a 1 in 1600000 chance of dying\n\nThe probability of dying from the teleporter is a constant:\n\n* Pt(x) = 1 death / 5000000 commutes\n\nAs you can see it is independent from the distance driven. What we need to know is where the two proabilities are equal:\n\n* Pm(x) =Pt(x)\n* 1-e^(-x\\*k)=Pt(x)\n* 1-Pt(x)=e^(-x\\*k)\n* ln(1-Pt(x)) = -x\\*k\n* \\-ln(1-Pt(x))/k = x\n* x = 16.0000016 miles\n\nYou need to drive just over 16 miles before the teleporter becomes safer. Interestingly enough, the answer I got when I interpreted this as a linear distribution was 16 deaths per mile. So for small improbable values, you can interpret the distribution linearly.\n\nEDIT: There's something wrong with my method. It assumes the probability of dying is linear. That means if you drive 80 million miles you will die. Standby...I'm going to fix this.\n\nSecond Edit: Okay. I've got a proper distribution now.\n\nThird Edit: You have a 50/50 chance of dying after 55.45 million miles. It isn't relevant to the teleporter question. I just thought you would like to know.\n\nFourth edit: It is an Exponential not Poisson distribution\n\nFifth edit: Fixed the spelling of discrete",

However, the tie he chose to wear was a one of kind street map of San Francisco and I still had all the documentation to prove it. The district attorney\u2019s eyes widen and he informs the judge.

            "Little late to the party but here goes, and obligatory not my client:\n\nCompany I worked for at the time was doing due diligence before acquiring a small tech startup. The COO of the tech startup was a well-liked guy in the company, friendly and outgoing. Though we had heard rumblings that the COO was rather hands-on with the work and with female employees. Apparently there was a walk-away package proposed to the COO that would let him keep a sizable portion of his post-acquisition bonus because a young woman who worked in their sales department had filed HR complaints against the COO and obtained counsel. I sat in on the meeting with the COO and the company's retained lawyers while they grilled him about his contacts with the young woman. The COO denied ever having contact with her within the company without multiple other people present (those people said his behavior toward her in the meetings didn't raise any flags). The COO emphatically denied having any contact with her outside of work. The lawyers asked the question a half-dozen different ways and each time the COO denied any out of work contact.\n\nLater we meet with the woman and her lawyer with the COO not present. Her lawyer gives us a rather graphic card that came with a bouquet of flowers addressed to her from the COO. The guy had an account with a florist linked to his credit card. When the company-retained lawyers confronted him he said, \"But *I* never had contact with her. It's not like I delivered the flowers myself.\"\n\nCOO got terminated for cause so no walk-away package. At her request the woman was given PTO until after the acquisition then moved to another one of the companies under our umbrella.",

No big deal, if she does a driving improvement course they court will usually dismiss or reduce those, since her driving record wasn't bad.\n\nWhen I showed up for her, I found out that she had been driving 70 *up an unplowed snow lane*, to get around all the others cars travelling in the lane that had been plowed because they were driving too slow. I didn't know it was even possible to drive 70 on fresh snow. The officer stated he'd already cut her a break by not writing the ticket for reckless driving, and the judge politely agreed he didn't feel comfortable reducing it under those circumstances. When I called her up after court to confirm, she did, claimed she'd just forgotten to mention it. Now maybe I've lived too much of my life in the South, but that just boggles my mind as a detail you'd forget when hiring a lawyer for that incident. I would have told her in advance that hiring us was a waste of money, not to mention the hassle of taking an 8 hour class, and she should probably just go ahead and pay this one. I legitimately do that all the time during consults; give my honest assessment if the case is even worth doing, and so by omitting that detail she harmed herself for no reason. At least she took it well and didn't get defensive.",

I asked the family and the client if he had requested modification before, because the law said that for his conviction, he could only request modification twice for any one sentence, regardless of if they were granted or denied. Swore up and down he'd never filed before. You can see where this is going. After spending a few hours going over records and preparing documents, a copy of the CCS (the case record basically) finally arrived. He'd personally filed for modification SIX TIMES since he was sentenced with handwritten pleadings that were all denied. So the one he hired me for was a waste of time and would never be considered at all.",

            "There's a rule you're supposed to follow when questioning trial witnesses and that rule is to never ask a question you don't know the answer to. Despite this rule, lawyers often ask small, apparently inconsequential questions which are necessary to set the scene but are so inconsequential or obvious that their answers are fairly presumed. This case was an exception to that general presumption.\n\nThe defendant was arrested on a warrant and transported to jail. After booking him into jail, the officer returned to his vechicle and discovered a baggie of drugs sitting right in the middle of the backseat. The defendant was charged with possession.\n\nAt trial, the officer explained that he routinely searches his vehicle before his shift starts and after any time he transports someone in the backseat. The defense attorney tried to poke holes in the story but the officers testimony was remarkably call consistent. The officer was fastidious about checking his vehicle. The appearance of the drugs coincided with the defendants presence in the vehicle.\n\nThen, as the defense attorney was running out of questions, he threw out THE question: was there anyone else in the backseat of the vehicle. It was a hail Mary. Even when there are multiple arrests, police tend not to transport more than one arrestee at a time if they can help it. There was no reason to believe anyone else could have feasibly been in the backseat with the defendant.\n\nThough it's no surprise to you, the defense attorney and prosecutor were stunned when the answer came back as \"yes.\" Turns out, the defendant was with his girlfriend when he was arrested and the officer courteously agreed to drive her to her apartment before taking her boyfriend to jail. This fact was not included in the police report, the officer never told the prosecutor, and, shockingly, the defendant never told his attorney. There was a palpable pause as this fact sunk in. Since there was another person in the back seat, there was more than enough reasonable doubt.\n\nProofs were concluded and the prosecutor threw out a half-hearted closing. The not-guilty verdict was a given. Because of this case, I learned to never assume a fact no matter how obvious it may seems.",
            "I am actually a lawyer, but I was only watching this trial, not participating. \n\nSo the case was, that Woman A had hit Woman B in the head with a heavy beer pint at a bar, and Woman B got pretty serious injuries. The defense claimed that Woman A had not hit anyone with the pint, but instead had just thrown the pint into a random direction, and it happened to hit B in the head, thus it was an accident and not a battery. Well, the prosecution had a CCTV tape from the bar, and it was shown at the trial..\n\nAnd the tape CLEARLY showed in HD as A walked behind B, and smashed the pint to her head so hard that the pint shattered on impact..\n\nI looked at the defense lawyer and his jaw literally almost hit the table. The prosecutor also noticed this and asked something along: \"Thrown, eh?\" And the defense lawyer said that due to technical difficulties he couldn't get the CCTV tape open on his computer when he was reviewing the evidence. Woman A was found guilty.\n\nSo yeah, I was completely dumbfounded.",

Guy shows up and is doing the depo when my dad notices the guy is wearing the exact ring he's claiming was stolen.  My dad slides a note to the lawyer telling him the guys wearing the ring.  Once the note got slid the guy realized what happened and put his hands under the table and took the ring off.  They asked him to stand up and lo and behold the ring fell to the ground.\n\nAnother one is a guy claiming a break in and theft.  Immediately things weren't adding up as the window was broken out instead of in.  The guy submitted Polaroids of items he claimed were his like TVs and such.  Thing is in the Polaroids you could see the reflection of the store they were in on the glass.  He also claimed numerous CD's/Records but oddly enough every single one started with an R, S, or a T.  We're talking 100's of CD's/Records.  My dad was about to deny the claim in person but noticed he had a gun on the table so decided to do it over the phone.  Ready for an escalation?

In his arrest, a bunch of goods were left in warehouses to rot, and their owners, his clients, were never paid.\n\nThis attorney showed me that this smuggler had assets, and that he had gone to the criminal trial and gotten the judge to set aside $2 million of the criminal penalties to settle his client's debts.

I worked on the case for a short while, but luckily moved on to other things.  The other two attorneys worked on that case for over two years.  At one point, they negotiated a $1.5 million settlement of all claims.  The attorney in charge rejected the offer, because he was convinced he could get twice as much at trial.\n\nIn the end, the case settled for $200k, because none of the clients would enter the United States to testify, for fear of being arrested.

He told me he was very drunk that night, but had made it to the lobby of his brother's apartment and was waiting for him to come down to get him upstairs.  I take this information and run with it, bringing photos of the apartment complex and the bylaws to court.  My goal was to prove that the lobby of the apartment was secured to guests and residents only, which would arguably take the drunkenness out of being \" in public\".\n\nThere is no formal discovery for minor infractions in my state.  Since there isnt a real option for a plea deal on the minor charge and wanting to ambush the officer with my argument, I do not discuss the case with him and we go to trial.\n\nThe wheels came off the wagon when the officer  testified that he encountered my client at an apartment building on the other side of the city.  He was outside at the call box, not even in the lobby of this different building, rambling amd barely able to stand.  I'm whispering to my client about this reversal and he slumps over and says something to the effect of \"sorry, I meant to go to my brother's apartment.  Maybe that's why he couldn't find me? And he sounded angry on that phone?\"\n\nCross examination was not fruitful.  It was basically \"officer, are you really sure it happened where you said it did and not at this other apartment building miles away?\"  Closing argument, that he wasn't that drunk, also didnt get us anywhere.

            "I'm late to this, but I'll share mine anyway. \n\nTl,dr: client forged the bank statements that her entire wrongful foreclosure case was based on. \n\nWe had clients who said the bank wrongly foreclosed on their house. The wife provided bank statements (their checking account was in a different bank than their mortgage) showing that they had made their payments every single month for the past several years. I checked through each one to make sure they all showed payments and looked good. There was also proof that the notice of foreclosure was never actually delivered to them.\n\nThe bank was baffled. Expert witnesses we talked with confirmed that during the recession, a lot of banks' record keeping had gone to shit, and a wrongful foreclosure could definitely result from that. \n\nWe got to mediation, and the first thing the bank comes back with was that upon close examination, they had noticed one tiny error on the bank statements, so they were calling off mediation and subpoenaing statements from the bank itself to check against our clients' statements. Our clients were pissed, and so were we. So what if the bank had made a tiny error?\n\nThe opposing side got the subpoenaed statements a couple weeks later and sent them to us, and I had the joy of comparing them. I quickly noticed that there were differences between the ones from our clients and the subpoenaed ones in the \"electronic withdrawals\" section. Our client had used a PDF editor to delete an entry in that section on every statement, add the mortgage payment, and then adjust the totals, carrying them over each month. \n\nWe approached our clients about it, and we said \"these look forged. We can drop the case or you can explain what the issue is.\" The wife said \"we should probably drop the case.\" She never confessed to us about forging them, but without a doubt, she had forged them. Her husband had no idea. He actually wasn't on the call where we accused her of the forgery, and he called a few weeks later asking for a case update. That was not fun telling him his wife had lied to him for the last year and a half. \n\nThe opposing side said they'd be ok with us dropping the case as long as our clients paid their attorney fees.

            "Not a lawyer, but a manager in an unfair dismissal case. \n\nOne of the shift supervisors caught a call centre worker making private phone calls during his shift. (All employees sign an agreement that they are not to use office phones for personal calls.) She told me what she had heard and we checked the phone records and found he had made over a dozen calls to the same number in the previous week. It was very clear that they were private calls, because they were calls to a gay sex line.\n\nNow, the specific number he was calling was totally irrelevant as far as I was concerned, but given the potentially sensitive nature of the calls I decided that it would be best to call him into the office (with witnesses), discuss what we had found, and issue him with an official warning. I typed up the warning and had it printed out and ready to go. \n\nWhen he came into the office with his chosen witness, I asked him if he was aware of the company's policy on private calls and he said yes. I showed him the phone number he'd been caught dialing and asked him if he recognised it and if he had called it from the office phones. He IMMEDIATELY lost his shit, started yelling, and kicked his chair against the wall, before shouting at everyone that he quit and storming out through the call centre, hurling profanities left and right at the top of his lungs. I let my manager and the HR department know what had happened, and got statements from everyone involved (including his witness).\n\n2 days later - he turns up at the office with his solicitor, demanding an immediate meeting with the General Manager. His solicitor wanted a big compensation payout, demanded that I be immediately fired, and suggested that he was going to pursue criminal charges against me personally for \"hate crimes\" because his client said that \"I had fired him for being gay\". The General Manager called me into the meeting and asked me to give my side of the story. I showed the solicitor the signed agreement regarding the private calls policy, the call records which showed all of the calls he had made during his shifts, and the warning I had typed and printed - for making personal calls. I pointed out that at no point had the fact that the calls had been to a sex line been the issue, and that his sexuality had nothing at all to do with what had happened. I then pointed out that I had signed statements from 3 witnesses that his client had quit, and not actually been fired, and reminded him again that the company was only going to give him a warning in the first place and had no intention of firing him at all. \n\nThe solicitor took 2 or 3 deep breaths, apologised to the GM and myself for wasting our time, and specifically to me for the threats of legal action which \"were not justified in light of the ACTUAL evidence\" and walked out, literally pulling the client behind him...\n\nThe cherry on top?

It's rather simple, all he'll say is \"Not Guilty.\" The guy agreed and I was excited.\n\nCut to an hour or so later. I am seated next to this guy, I enter the plea, everything is fine. Then the Judge asks \"Sir, do you have any questions for the court?\" The guy, after having been explained the process thoroughly by advising attorney, says \"Can I just confess now?\" All I could hear was the residual ringing of my ears left by a soul leaving one's body. The Judge gave me the most pitying look I've ever seen, and said \"Sir, I think you need to consult with your counsel.\"\n\nMy advising attorney then came up, tapped me on the shoulder, and said he'd handle it. Like a shamed puppy, I scurried back behind the bar. The attorney quickly conferred with the client and the plea went ahead as planned. Later he told me to get used to that, as functional addicts tend to become experts in making people think they understand what they've been told.\n\n\nEDIT: Grammar, clarification.",

            "I have an opposite kinda case. A friend of mine leased a house in his name and moved in with two other friends, everything is cool it's a real party house. After about 6 months he has met a girl and he decides to move in with her. When he moved out he didn't change the lease and the other guys assured him they would pay the rent and look after the house BUT one by one they leave and then all the new occupants have no ties to my friend who has the lease. At some point they stop paying rent and the agent calls and tells them they will be evicted. So they have a huge fucking party and trash the place totally.\n\nMy friend calls me and asks if I will help him clean up his old place as the agent has rung him. I agree and meet him at his old house (I had some plaster repair stuff, paint and things to get a rental through an inspection) Well we walked through the house and the damage was total, I mean there were no cupboards in the kitchen (what was left of them was on a fire out the back) Every door was busted off it's hinges. Every room had holes you could walk through in the walls. There was no way to repair this house without gutting and rebuilding the whole inside, not to mention the damage to the gardens. We wandered through the house in shock, it was fucked and so was my friend. \n\nMy friend went and spoke with his dad who has a friend who is a lawyer, who asks for a copy of the lease. We go to the agent and ask for a copy of the lease, they tell us that the damage bill is about half the value of the house. They photocopy the lease and then give us a copy of the ID that he used when signing the lease proves friend leased the place, his drivers licence. We go to lawyer who looks things over and then looks at the ID, laughs and says \"you were only 17 when you signed this, you can't sign a legal document unless you are 18 or older\" We go back to agent and point this out, they lose their shit BUT they can't do anything, they even had to give the bond back because they were not legally allowed to take it in the first place.\n\nTLDR Friend signs lease for rental house when 17 it gets trashed totally agent wants money, friend wasn't legally allowed to sign for lease, not responsible.",
            "Family friend is the lawyer here, representing someone accessed of embezzling 2 million dollars from the company she worked for. The embezzling was discovered through lavish spending, including the accused buying multiple 100K cars for family members while on a salary of 80K. The case is going OK otherwise, as there are problems with some of the evidence. Defendant decides to hold a press conference and claim she won the money at the casino. Obviously this kind of thing can be checked, so the lawyer asks the client to immediately hold another press conference to say she misspoke. Otherwise she is fucked because they'll be able to tell she is lying about the source of the money (and lying shows knowledge of wrongdoing). So she holds another press conference and says she misspoke. Except then she adds onto her statement and says it wasn't her who won the money at the casino but her cousin who won the money at the casino. ... ... Lawyer had to drop the client at this point. To make matters worse, the 25K she paid him sat in his escrow account for a while because it was obtained fraudulently (unsurprisingly). I don't believe he got the total sum in the end and had to go to court, but the public face of the crime was valuable in terms of advertising. The embezzler got fucked pretty hard as tax evasion was also involved, not surprisingly.",

            "Our client was a home health care worker for the elderly and home bound. One of her clients left his estate to her when he passed away, about a year after she was hired. The surviving family was pissed, and sued her for undue influence, etc. \n\nFrom everything our client said, they just got along really well. She quit working for her company to care for him full time, they went on small trips together, and were together every day. In contrast, the surviving family was only a great niece who lived several states away and hadn\u2019t spoken with the deceased in a decade prior to his death. So we thought we had a legit case of a man expressing his appreciation for the woman who cared for him in the last two years of his life. \n\nTowards the end of the deceased\u2019s life, he began making plans to change his will and leave his property to our client. In several produced emails, she \u201cjoked\u201d that they should just get married and avoid the hassle. Cue the accusations that she\u2019s a gold digger, etc. So we stress to her that they\u2019re going to come at her from this angle and she needs to be prepared. \n\nBefore her first deposition, we prep our client for days. She is a little out there, and her demeanor in general is rather off putting, so we went above and beyond in depo prep. There was nothing we didn\u2019t ask her a hundred different ways and times. \n\nFirst ten minutes of the deposition, our client is asked about her marital history. She states she\u2019s been married three times, which we knew. She then goes on to say that SHE HAS BEEN ENGAGED ELEVEN TIMES BUT ALWAYS BROKE IT OFF BECAUSE THEY DIDNT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO SUPPORT HER LIFESTYLE. To top it off, she states that while she\u2019s never been arrested, she did spend two weeks in jail for contempt for refusing to obey a judge\u2019s orders and hiding evidence in a previous lawsuit. She spends the rest of the next 16 hours (two days) alternating between arguing that she doesn\u2019t remember basic information like her phone number and insulting opposing counsel and calling him names. \n\nMultiple times during breaks and such we ask her what is going on, tell her to calm down, review everything we went over to no avail.

            "IANAL.  I was in a visitation/child support case with my ex over our 3-yr-old.  We had both moved on and gotten remarried.  Our visitation order was for him to pickup our child from my house at 6pm on every other Friday night.  He frequently would show up at 9pm or later, with no call ahead of time to let us know what was going on, or even show up the next day when he felt like it and expect us to not only be there but to be waiting on him.  This was before cell phones were popular, but both he and I had one, so he had a means of contacting us.  After one too many incidences, my husband and I set up our video camera (yes, I know, but this was over 20 years ago).  We placed it where it would record our TV (so they could see the evening news for a time stamp), our home phone (to prove we weren't called) and our driveway (to prove he never showed when he was supposed to).  After six months or so of this, we head to court.  He told his lawyer that he was there, on time, every visit, and we just wouldn't allow him to see his son.  The judge asked us to go to a private room with our lawyers to see if we could work things out.  Once there, the other lawyer (M) jumps on my lawyer ( F who was 8 mos pregnant with twins) about how her clients were lying and we were scum, etc.  She calmly leaned over, picked up the first bag (out of about 5) and laid it on the table.  She explained that it was full of tapes from the visitations he never showed for, and said that all the bags had the same.  She then asked if he would like for the judge to come in and watch the tapes with us.  He asked us to leave so he could confer with my ex.  He \"conferred\" so loudly the judge had to send someone in to quiet them down.  Needless to say, we got everything we asked for (I was very fair).",

            "Not my story but happened to one of my sisters from a couple years ago.\n\nA little backstory. My sister had a daughter in college with this guy from our reservation. Our family didn't like him because he came from a notoriously bad family and thought she deserved better than him. She was working and going to school full time while he sat around and sold weed. Big \"contributor\" to the household.\n\nAnyways after they have the baby, he starts to want to spend more time with his son from a previous relationship. I guess it's so the kids know each other. The issue with this is that he didn't have a income so my sister pays for the trips with her scholarship returns. It's a burden but she finds a way without asking us for help.\n\nOne day she runs away from home with their daughter. It comes out that their 3-4 year relationship was one of domestic/drug abuse and manipulation. Looking back at it now it's easy to see the signs but it came as a surprise at the time. The next weeks are full of us moving her out of the house and extreme baby-daddy bullshit.\n\nThey go to court to settle this out. He lost custody of his other child and didn't want to lose custody again. My sister didn't want her or their kid to be involved with him ever again. We kept wondering how he lost custody previously, was it the result of his drug abuse, lack of financial stability?\n\nMy sister is granted temporary full custody and there's another court meeting to establish visitation for him. Not what she wanted but she was hopeful that she would find a way to have full custody.\n\nShe goes into their court meet and he's late. At first it's nothing out of the ordinary. Eventually he shows up and you could smell the alcohol on his breathe. He gets in a arguement with the judge because he thought the meet was about establishing custody not visitations and ends up throwing a chair at the judge. The guards tackled and restrain him. They run his name and it turns out that he has a couple warrants so he gets arrested.\n\nSister gets full custody and we've never seen or heard anything about him since this. My favorite part about his blow up in court is that in the previous meet, he had told the judge that he didn't have any problems with alcohol or his anger.",

I mention that we have the surveillance and could go ahead and review it, and she pleasantly agrees. Her and her reasonably well-dressed husband come in, joke a bit about how awkward this all is, and sit down across from me. I turn the monitor around so we can watch what happened.\n\nIn the five minutes of surveillance provided, The first four minutes were a mundane scene of a receptionist answering phones with a pair of double doors behind her. I fast forward. Then, cue the music. I watched my client kick open a pair of double doors, screaming at whatever was on the other side. She leaves. The comes back in, screaming again and re-enters the double doors. Then I see security guards gently escorting her out, as she is screaming at them. Security stops at the double doors. My client goes over to the reception desk, and leans over the counter to...you guessed it...grab the computer monitor, take it over her head, and bring it smashing to the ground. She gives a finger to security and leaves.\n\nWe watch the next thirty seconds in stunned silence, and the tape goes black. Now, I knew enough to watch my clients reaction during this, and she was a goddamned statue. Didn't move. Stared at the screen with the smile of someone who has killed before. Probably.\n\nThe she turned to me and said \"So, what are you gonna do about this?\"  I didn't know what to say, just kind of stared at her. \"Well, uh, probably work on a plea deal. Hopefully you pay them and get a couple of hour--\"\n\n\"I didn't do it\"\n\n\"Well, yes you did. I just watched it.\"\n\nShe stands up and without breaking eye contact, grabs my computer monitor, lifts it up, and smashes it on the ground. She picks up her purse and walks out. Her husband follows, but turns to me in my doorway and gives me the finger, shaking his head in a \"for shame\" kind of way.\n\nI did not take the case.",

He'd been calling her, so we took him back to court to enforce the protective order.  What she had neglected to mention to me was that he had been calling her because she had taken a baseball bat to his car while it was parked outside of his work and left a note taped to the steering wheel that said something to the effect that if she ever saw him out with \"that bitch\" again it wouldn't just be his car she came after with a baseball bat.  \nIt's been 20 years, I do appellate work on commercial cases now and do pro bono Chapter 7s for legal aid clients.

He then said the police had rushed in and taken him to the floor, injuring him. He said his previous firm had told him to drop the case after getting written advice from counsel, which rang alarm bells, so I asked to see the advice. After reading it, it became very clear why they had told him to drop the case. CCTV had been reviewed; he had been shouting and screaming at the staff, and threatening to set himself on fire, then started picking up objects and waving them around.

            "Not a lawyer, but I was volunteering in an advice centre. A guy came in with a sad story about being unfairly evicted and homeless. He had been living in a council flat, which for non-UKers is a heavily rent-subsidised apartment owned by the local council. It is very hard to get these in my part of the country, as the waiting lists are years or decades, although you can get priority if you are homeless, disabled or in otherwise unsuitable accommodation.\n\nAnyway, his story was that he had had to go back to his home country for a while due to a family illness, but he still paid the rent, and he asked another family to check on the property to make sure it was OK. The council had come by while the other family was in the property, freaked out and said they weren\u2019t allowed in there, and they phoned the client and told him he was being evicted for breaking the terms of the lease. And people were throwing around all these terms like leasehold and freehold that he didn\u2019t understand because his English was bad. \n\nSo I got all righteously enraged and phoned the council up to beg them to change their mind, because the guy had a family emergency, was just trying to look after the place, was entitled to have visitors, etc. The housing officer then told me what he had actually done was walked into a commercial letting agency, signed a form saying he owned the flat, and rented it for six months to an unsuspecting family at four times the price of his council rent (the family were then massively inconvenienced as they had to find someone else immediately).  And he was lucky they hadn\u2019t gone to the police who would have charged him with fraud. \n\nI felt a bit awkward. \n\nI still don\u2019t understand his reasoning behind coming in to the advice centre and lying to the volunteers when obviously the other side of the story would come out.",

            "Backstory: I met a dude through another dude, and he and his pregnant girlfriend had no where to go. I had an insane amount of acreage and I felt bad for the guy, so I let him stay in his RV on my land, and I even hooked him up to running water and electricity, all of which I paid for. He had a part-time job delivering furniture and never made enough to pay me the paltry 100 bucks he promised to pay me every month for helping them out. When I'd confront him, he'd tell me he just never worked enough hours to provide for his girlfriend and pay me. I mean I'm sure the copious plumes of marijuana smoke coming from his RV, which was tiny, and contained his pregnant gf, didn't help matters (I blaze too, this isn't a judgement on tokin', but a judgment on not paying your rent before toking). So, proactively I got him a job at the hardware store I was assistant manager at until I finished my degree. This was 11 years ago.\n\nHe came to work, and after 2 hours on his first day, just left. Like walked out, went back to the RV which was parked next to my house, and never said anything and never returned. Told me it was a bullshit job that was beneath him. It seriously ruined my reputation at that store and luckily that wasn't my career path or anything.",

My response was \"on what shelf does this go?\" He told me to go sweep the entire parking lot (roughly the size of a football field).  I laughed hardily into his confused face. Oh, did I mention it was raining? So again, he tells me to go sweep the parking lot and not to come back in until it was complete.

Fourth day, accused lead engineer of being a racist.  Fifth day, submitted his resignation to HR, then tried to take it back.  HR didn't play.

            "I took a temp job for a 2 week period where I literally saw hundreds of these!\n\nThe contract, I later found out, was a \"telemarketing company\" run by a shady fucking lawyer that found a technically legal way to commit fraud and was exploiting it as fast as he could to make bank before the loophole got closed.\n\nThis meant it was ***exceedingly easy*** for a new hire to say something which would constitute \"actual fraud\" completely by accident.\n\nHow easy could that be?\n\nOne use of the word \"we\" on a phone call was instant cause for dismissal.\n\nI showed up on the first day with ~30 other people. They brought us into a conference room and we were told we were all hired and would start work that day... but that more than 2/3 of us would be fired that day.\n\n15 minutes to practice the extremely short script, a 45 minute lecture on the things you must never ever say while closing and 30 minutes to practice our closing and we were on the phones.\n\nHe undersold it, 3/4 were fired easy. Same as the next day and every day thereafter.\n\nEDIT: They were cold calling people \"on behalf\" of legit charities asking for donations that would go to fund a completely legitimate list of things those charities would use the funds for. The \"fraud\" part was that the charities themselves had nothing to do with the guy. He just collected a fuck ton of money then made sure that at least 10% of gross collections were donated to the correct charity so he couldn't be prosecuted for theft and he never implied any connection to the charities themselves (thus no 'we') so no fraud. The other 90% was \"obviously\" his operating costs. CEOs don't come cheap...",
            "Let's call the guy, F, for Forgot because I don't remember his name. \n\nWe had a group orientation our first week at a new job. First day there is a blizzard, it wasn't a surprise we all knew it was coming so we all plan accordingly and are 5-10 minutes late. Even our boss was 15 minutes late. F shows up 2 hours late! F claims there was an accident and he had to help a woman and child out of a car. Boss rolls his eyes and gives him the benefit of the doubt, we proceed with orientation. F is constantly interrupting the presentation since he worked with a similar company previously and he felt he knew everything. In between his interruptions he kept constantly needing to go to the bathroom. \n\nWe are taken out to lunch, where F makes everything about him and belittles the female moderators who took us to lunch.\n\nAfter lunch we have individual training on our computers that will take a couple hours, F falls asleep. Moderator wakes F up and he can't focus on any of the tasks, yells at her that it's nonsense and there's no way she'd be able to do it. F demands she prove that she can do the work, she tells him she doesn't need to prove anything to him and that everyone else is well past where he is at. \n\nF continues to yell and is escorted out. When another employee comes to get his things for him, they open his water bottle and it stinks of booze. He's fired that afternoon.\n\nThe next day, Day 2, our boss tells those of us who were early how F called him the night before crying and arguing that he did nothing wrong. Shortly after telling us this story, F shows up! He has no memory of the previous day or more importantly being fired! He again is escorted out.",

I know someone who fell into this, but ended being serious injured on their way to work on the 1st day. They were in the hospital in a coma for a week. Management didnt blink an eye and still said no call/no show.  \n\n\nEdit: Saw all the replies. I guess it does depend on the state to keep it a no call/no show firing. In my state, PA, as long as they do not discriminate, they can fire you when ever they want. If they're smart, they do not say why as they do not have to, just that your services are no longer needed.",

I have since moved on to a new job and as of me quitting on July 12th, 2019, nothing was done against this manager that I know of. I do still have friends working there (for the time being, seeing as many of us are quitting in droves) who will keep me up to date, but as of now I know nothing. Sorry to make it a lame ending with no outcome but I needed to get out of that place before I jumped off a cliff or put a bullet in my head.\n\n**ORIGINAL POST**\n\nMy office manager has a huge giant massive HR case being built against her because she's been pulling royally shady shit.\n\nLast year, some of us had been having issues with system access at my job, thankfully not me. It's a known issue and it's been getting fixed here and there, but then it rears it's head again. \n\nAnyway, about five or six months ago, a friend of mine in another department started losing access. My office manager (who is my boss' boss, she runs the whole friggin' meghilla.) tells this person to go home for the day since you don't have system access, and specifically told that it wouldn't be held against her.\n\nSo, what the hell, its not like she can do her job anyway right? She goes home. This happens about 8 more times where she comes to work and her systems don't work and she is told to go home.\n\nNow, fast forward to about two weeks before the year ended. The girl whose been being sent home gets called over by her manager and told that she has to sign a final written warning. When asked why, she is told its because she has used all her FMLA AND sick leave. She said that is not possible and asks for proof before signing the document. Her manager pulls up all the times and days it was used and, lo and behold, it was every single time she was told to go home because of system access.\n\nThis is, of course, illegal as shit. My coworker did not choose to go home, she did not choose to use her FMLA and Sick leave. My office manager DID THAT FOR HER. \n\nSo just about three weeks ago, my coworker gets called in to our office managers office and is told that she needs to give up her medical records. \n\nAlso illegal as fuck.\n\nShe declined and told her she will not do that and is still not signing the final written warning. \n\nShe then proceeded to call HR with all of this who then tells her, \"It's funny you should bring this to our attention because you're not the only one whose called us about things like this happening with her. We're building a case against her as we speak.\"\n\nShits about to go down and im fuckin here for it. I hate my job, and I've actively been looking for a new one, but part of me wants to stick around to see if they tote her ass off to jail, or the mass shitshow that will happen when she's fired.\n\nEDIT: woo boy this got blown out of proportion. I promise everyone if I\u2019m around for the aftermath, i will update somehow lol. No clue how long this case has been being built by HR and no clue how long it will take to come to fruition but if I\u2019m here for it, and it does, I\u2019ll definitely do something to update everyone whose interested lol.\n\nEDIT 2; ELECTRIC BOOGALOO-\nNothin' so far folks. I think this case might take longer to build than you or even I am thinking... Trust me when I say, I wanna see this come to fruition just as much as you guys do.\n\nEDIT 3 (4/18/19); Still nothing guys. I'm starting to think nothings going to come of it... or if it is, it's not going to be any time soon. I will post a new thread in some subreddit somewhere when and if it happens, providing I still work there.",

At the end of the year, I thought it would be nice to have everyone sign a card for him, but when I took it around people started giving me these weird looks. \n\nFast forward to halfway through this year. One of our teachers showed up with a change of her last name. It was now Mrs. Bob. I congratulated her and said I didn't even know she was seeing anyone - to which she laughed and said \"you're so bad\". I was confused and shook it off.\n\nLong story short, I just recently found out that she and Mr. Bob had fallen in love or something and he left his wife for her. He literally divorced his wife on a Thursday and was married by Friday. I had no idea until she mentioned his first name and that they were moving out of the state. \n\nLooking back on it, I face palmed so much. His wife at the time also worked for the district and at one point I ran into her and expressed how much I would miss working with Mr. Bob. She gave me a weird look and said, \"Yeah, well apparently he's been pretty miserable\". To which my dumb ass responded, \"Well let's hope he finds what he's looking for.\" I assumed it was all about his job satisfaction. \n\nI'm such an asshole.",

Every time he was supposed to visit, something \u2018came up\u2019.  He was sick twice, then his daughter was sick, then he got ran over, then his moms dog is dying.

My friend believed him at first and kept trying to ask him what hospital he was at but he wouldn\u2019t tell her.  He even sent her a picture of the car.  So my friend messaged another friend of hers telling her what happened.  Long story short, the other friend asked my friend to send her the picture and she did some investigating and found an exact picture and article of a wreck that happened in a different state!  So the guy fucking lied about being in a wreck.  When my friend confronted him about it, he started laughing his ass off and told her it was this elaborate practical joke he was playing on her.  Well she believes him.  It\u2019s all a big fucking joke and I don\u2019t know who to be more pissed off at, the guy for being such a shady character or my friend who is so damn naive.\n",

            "My ex-girlfriend was supposed to be married this weekend (I was invited). The mother in law and fianc\u00e9e came over to her apartment and berated her in front of her family for reasons unknown. Long story short: Wedding is cancelled and over 50+ people were not able to get refunded. Currently by the beach sipping bottomless mimosas.",
            "*Long story and I guess it's interesting for me because I've been watching this unfold for the past years, but I can imagine outsiders might not find it equally as thrilling.*\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 works closely together with two colleagues: one is my best friend (let's call her Beth) and the other is his best friend (let's call him John). We like to hang out with Beth, John and both their significant others.\n\nBeth is getting married to this really good guy, Jerry, this year. He is nice and sweet, although his jokes never really land, and to be fair: I find him kind of boring. Jerry and I never seem to be able to keep a conversation going for longer than five minutes. But no biggie, I'm not the one getting married to him.\n\nThis is where John comes in. You see, when Beth started at this workplace years ago, she was single and instantly smitten with John. She found him nice, funny and handsome. Only John was in a longterm relationship, so nothing came of that, except friendship. (John, Beth and my fianc\u00e9 are something like the Three Musketeers at their workplace.) Along came Jerry in Beths personal life, and he and Beth started dating.\n\nMeanwhile, Beth and John stayed very good friends and colleagues. Then, two years ago, Johns longterm girlfriend cheated on him. He ended the relationship. In the mean time, Beth and Jerry had started living together, but things weren't running so smoothly: Jerry is away for work A LOT, and due to a combination of circumstances, he was away for almost eight months.\n\nIn this time, Beth and John became even closer than they already were. They went out for beers with colleagues, but they would be the only two hanging around until the end of the night. She has this special tone in her voice when she talks to John. A lot of people started making little jokes about them being a couple.\n\nOne night, there was this work party. John put his new status as a single man to good use, flirting away with a lot of female colleagues. Beth, though, kept hanging around him. At one point my fianc\u00e9 pulled her aside and asked her if she noticed that she was cockblocking John big time. 'Either you man up and just kiss him like you want to,' he told her, 'or you back off and leave him to it with Shelley from accounting.'\n\nBeth backed off for a bit, but later that night, she had to go to the bus and John offered to walk her there. And when they were there, waiting for the bus - talking, laughing, goofing - they looked at each other and there was this... spark. They ALMOST kissed, but at the last moment Beth pulled away because, of course, she was toghether with Jerry and didn't want to do that to him. Plus, John is her friend and her colleague, so kissing him would probably just complicate things in stead of improving them.\n\nSo they both just kind of... acted like that never happened. Beth told only me and my fianc\u00e9 about this weirdness between her and John.\n\nQuite soon after this, John got into a new relationship. This girl, Natalie, is a sweetheart, only she is quite possibly the polar opposite of Beth.\n\nSoon after John and Natalie started dating, Jerry proposed to Beth. And she said yes. We were all very surprised, not only because he asked her to marry him so soon after this rough patch they just went through, but also because they were together for only two years at this point, and Beth was only 25, which is quite young/soon in our country.\n\nIt seemed as if, as soon as John heard the news, he also wanted to do something drastic. After just four months of dating, Natalie moved in with him. She instantly started replacing all of his stuff with things that were more to her taste, up until the point where it feels like I've set foot into someones Pinterest board when I visit.\n\nJohn and Natalie don't really seem happy. Beth and Jerry have been planning their wedding for the past two years, but Beth tells me that sometimes, she is doubtful of what could have been between her and John. Of course, soon after admitting that to me, she rushes to add that it would never work between them, because she is super motivated and he is still doing the same job he started in and even started working less hours because he makes enough money to live comfortably.\n\nNatalie has been dropping hints about getting married, buying a house and having kids from the moment she moved in with John, and this september they're going on a big road trip. He is going to propose. We all know, even though he didn't outright tell us. If he chooses this path, this time next year he will have an expensie Pinterest wedding coming up, plus probably a mortgage and a baby.\n\nMeanwhile, Beth and John keep doing fun stuff toghether - having drinks, working out. Natalie has started to give Beth some snark because of it. But when I talked to Natalie about our friend group, she only said super nice things about Beth, almost desperetaly so.\n\nI know Beth has her doubts. I know John has his doubts. But it seems like they go through with their respective Big Life Altering Plans as some weird game of Chicken.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I just feel like there will be a moment in the future when the feelings they bottled up all come bursting out, and by that time there will probably be kids and other high stakes involved.\n\n**TL;DR: my best friend and my fianc\u00e9's best friend obviously have feelings for each other, but they pretend that's not the case and are both planning on marrying other people than each other. Shit WILL hit the fan eventually.**",

I don't play, so where it said \"employee comments\" on the write up I said \"see attached\" and typed out a 3 page defense talking about how I thought it was unfair and how I thought people had been getting treated unfairly for a year now.  the next day I got called into a meeting by my boss, and his boss, and his boss and an HR rep so they could grill me about it.  by the end of the meeting we had all figured out that it was actually the HR rep who had been screwing with people for a year now, and the anger shifted completely away from me and onto her.

She said the house was frigid and the heat was only kept at 62\u00b0 but he has a server in the house so that's not connected at all. /s  His partner is in school for his doctorate so my brother is paying for almost everything.  During this time his first dog was diagnosed with cancer and he was really disconnected and sad during her visit.\n\nFor SOME reason though, all of this and some other happenings made her think he can't possibly pay for this house and he's hiding it from her.  I had to listen to all of this and suppress the urge to tell her she's crazy.  I figured I would let it go because I have no idea what's truly going on.\n\nMy brother's dog passed away not too long after this so we were talking over the phone and her visit came up.  He goes on to say everything that she told me but in his perspective.  Not too different, but then he says that my mom took his partner aside to ask him if they were ok and if my brother was treating him right.  This wasn't the first time she's done this either.  She apparently \"warned\" my brother's partner when they started dating that he isn't exactly easy going and how high maintenance he was.\n\nI was pretty shocked and appalled.  We've known for years that she is probably narcissistic possibly borderline but this really sealed the deal for me.  I couldn't finish a book describing the shitty things she's done but I'm pretty disgusted with her.  To top it all off she said that she thinks he has the narcissistic tendencies.\n\nTLDR:  My mother is such a narcissist she thinks my brother can't afford his new house and has tried to interfere in his relationship behind his back but has the gull to call him the conceited one.",

Completely unnecessarily.\n\nCut to when I turned 38 & got more info by asking 40 specific questions to my Adoption agency. I found out my birth mother had a son *before* me! She had given him up for adoption too. So that made me 1 of 3! I found him. We both then met our birth mother. She had gotten married and had 4 kept kids...my half siblings. That made me 1 of 7!\n\nI met my birth father who had gotten married and had 3 kept kids...also my half siblings. That made me 1 of 10!\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I did a DNA test, which I'm still waiting on the results of. Meanwhile during the course of a text conversation with my birth father's daughter, she told me he had had a daughter *before* me and his 3 kept kids through his marriage! That makes me 1 of 11!\n\nAnd I still haven't received my DNA test results yet! I am suspicious there may be more half-siblings out there waiting to be discovered!

Some people would take theirs off casually and not make a big deal out of it but I was more of a stickler so I got used to wearing it in and outside of buildings, as well as in cars when I had to travel with other workers. \nI forgot all the time that I was wearing it. I actually had someone point and laugh at me wearing my mask in my car. All I could think is that it must be nice to work remotely and not be conditioned into feeling weird without a mask, like I was before I wore one all the time. I mean, I had a mask tan line from how much I had to wear it. \n\nSo when I see somebody I used to think was weird for wearing one, I now understand since I've been there. \n\nI still get irritated when I see people wearing them with their nose sticking out or backwards(there's a reason it's layered the way it is).",

When my parents got divorced, my Dad was a successful attorney and my Mom was a stay-at-home Mom with a little work experience in retail. My Dad didn't want custody of my sister and I, and my Mom really couldn't support us. She was able to use Child support money to get herself a degree and start a career that benefited us greatly in the long run as it set my Mom up with a decent career. My Dad and his second wife were always angry when they saw we had shoes that were getting old or jeans that were getting a little short, and my sister and I would hear about how he was giving my mom \"all this money for nothing.\" As soon as we turned 18, he summarily quit paying anything and didn't offer to help with college at all.\n\nIf he had been able to use the legal system to compel my Mom to spend Child Support in a specific way, I might never have gone to college and my Mom might still be working a register at Department Stores with no hope of retirement and probably on some kind of welfare.

Perhaps the car needed to be fixed or something that's not directly related to supporting a kid.

Kid says he has a bad day at school? Must be being psychologically tormented. \n\nParents will dispute the brand of cereal they buy, the cost of their haircuts, and how much these kids actually need the things that are bought for them.

            "The comments about saving reciepts, keeping track of expenses, etc sounds like a lot of work to add on to a single parents list of responsibilities. It may not seem like it, but taking kids to and from various after school programs, to and from daycare, school, and then working 40+ hours a week all while managing the household alone are a lot to handle without the added responsibilities some people are suggesting. \n\n  I understand that seeing things itemized or tracked would make the parent paying child support feel more at ease about where the money is going. The easiest way to see that your child is being taken care of appropriately is to just talk to your child during visitation and take part in your childs life as well. Most single parents aren't blowing all their money on themselves. The majority of middle class single parents spend all the child support on their childs necessities, and then spend a large portion of their own income on their childs wants and needs as well, while making large sacrifices to their own lifestyle.",

If an individual is granted child support, how they choose to spend that money is entirely up to them.\n\nThe courts should only get involved if there is actual evidence of misuse or that if the child is suffering or being neglected.",

Thus, I don't see the point of this other than to give anti-government types something to scream \"government over reach at.\"\n",

If not, how they spend it is on them. \n\nI hate giving 1/5 of my money to someone that takes care of my kid roughly 5% more than I do, but I understand the logic.

            "Child support worker here, and this is just insanely unrealistic. First of all, \"supply the court with proof of how the child support money is spent\", yeahhhhhhhhhh. How do you imagine that works? Monthly hearings? That's thousands of tax payer dollars spent on judges, clerks, county attorney, CSSU, to just be present. Once we are in this prove your expenses hearing, how does the custodial parent then do so? Here in Colorado child support money can be loaded onto a specific card, so I guess that can be tracked but who deems what is appropriate expenditures and what is not?\n\nWe field this question daily from non-custodial parents. Our answer is simple, and pretty logical in my opinion. If the custodial parent has a roof over the child's head, clothes on their back, and food in their belly, then the money is being spent correctly. If the CP has enough left over to treat themselves then good for them. They're raising your kid and certainly deserve to have some personal pleasures in their life too. \n\nEdit: spelling is hard, and sorry if it sounds bitter. I get this question literally daily and it drives me insane, clearly. ",

Rob gets paid on the first of the month, and receives child support on the 28th.  The day he gets child support, he buys a $150 pair of boots, a $60 pair of pants, and replaces parts for his motorcycle for $300.  Karen freaks out that most of her money has gone to Rob's hobbies.  Rob produces receipts that show he spent $400 on groceries, $150 on summer clothes for the girls, and $500 in day care.  It came out of his paycheck rather than her child support.  He argues that in fact he did the right thing as a father by providing for them earlier in the month and treating himself later.\n\nThe vast majority of 'wasting my child support' cases are like that.

If we were to divorce I know he would be shocked on how much he would have to spend on them, or how much child support he would have to pay.

It's none of my business how she spends her money as long as I know that my kids are getting the best that we can provide them.",
            "Any normal person who receives child support gets far less than it actually takes to support the child.  The child support is the non custodial parents portion of cost, not just \"money being given to the custodial parent.\"\n\nPart of the money they get goes directly to buying the child food/clothes, etc, but supporting a child also means putting a roof over their head, utilities, gas to get them to and from, paying for school supplies, or a field trip, or replacing a lamp they broke, or paying for a family trip to the movies...\n\nThere are both direct and indirect expenses to having a kid, and hardly any non-custodial parent covers the entire cost via child support.\n\nTherefore, the custodial parent rolls the child support into their general fund and then takes care of the child.\n\nIf the custodial parent has remarried and has more kids, they will pay for everything together, and so it would be impossible to separate out the one being paid support from everything else.\n\nChild support is based on what the non custodial parent can afford and what they should be providing for their child if they had custody.

            "So, what -- all my exhusband, the cheating bastard, has to do is see the kids for a few hours a week and every other weekend, but now it's MY job to keep track of receipts and purchases on top of all the other shit I already do that he doesn't just so I can show him what I spend child support money on?  Yeah, no fucking way in hell. ",

            "Neglectful parents are not going to suddently become functional parents by providing an income/expense report.\n\nFar better to invest the money that would be spent on oversight in early childhood support services, so the money they do get goes further and to invest in educating the parents on what a child needs.",
            "I generally think that would be a bad idea.",
            "Because child support hardly ever even gets paid, so I spend my own paycheck on bills, soccer camp, school pictures, hair cuts, etc. I leave myself for last, so when child support finally comes through, since I've already paid for everything for the kids, I might use that money for things I need. I understand there are moms out there that live purely off of child support, but there are also mom's like me that work hard and rarely ever get any help. If they made a child support card that can only purchase child-related items would be useless for those that hardly ever get paid child support because those items would have already been purchased out of the mom's paycheck.

Neither one of us said the other couldn't buy something for him.\n\nDoing this would entwine the state even further in matters it shouldn't be involved in.

As long as those expenses (which are disclosed to the court) meet or exceed the support order, itemization is unnecessary.\n\nHow about including a provision requiring how money is spent by the noncustodial parent? My ex spent money on a motorcycle, packs of cigarettes, music equipment, etc. I haven't seen any support in over a year and have no idea how I am going to afford her college bills starting next month. \n\nI'd be gleefully happy to voluntarily itemize how the money is spent as soon as I get the $64,000 that I am owed in back child support.

The house is my asset and my mortgage is my liability, but my children get the benefit of shelter. How do I best allocate the mortgage per child? By % of the household headcount? Or by square footage of their individual bedrooms? Then what about rooms we share, like the kitchen or bathrooms? Do I allocate a portion of the property taxes to each child? Insurance? Utilities?\n\nThe next largest expense is healthcare. We have a family plan for health insurance, so that too would have to be allocated per child. How is that best achieved? By actuarial risk? \n\nOur third largest expense is food. Keeping track of which child ate how much of each food item would be next to impossible. I'm not running a restaurant where everyone gets a bill nor a prison where everyone is served an identical tray. I honestly don't know which child ate the last banana or who drank more of the empty carton of milk.\n\nExpenses like clothing or after school activities are easy to break out per child, but represent a small fraction of overall child rearing costs.",

It doesn't matter! Child support is there to make up for the loss of income caused to the parent who has the greater amount of custody.

            "Not only would it be impossible to prove, but that's a disaster for administration checking all those receipts.  We don't do it for welfare recipients and we don't do it for child support.  It is much easier to, if you suspect them of doing something wrong with the money, arrest them for that.  Criminals are usually stupid, since the smart ones don't get caught.  \n\nSecondly, unlike welfare, child support is a case of one person v. another.  The government has no say what people may do with money involved in that private transaction, nor should it.  As long as the child is well taken care of, which is verified by the parent paying support, then it is clearly spent well.  ",
            "I'm against it. It's illogical to trust a parent's aptitude enough to award child support, but then to distrust the parent enough to require proof of how that money is spent. ",
            "1. Very few people are financially organized enough to show that proof.\n2. This would just be a fresh way to put poor people in jail. Honestly, we've got more of that than we need.",
            "I mean, that money is meant to relive the financial burden of having a child. So even if that money isn't specifically being spent on the child, it's taking the place of the money that was, if that makes sense. ",
            "I get your intent, but Child Support is a reimbursement in a sense, not a pre-payment.  That is, the supporting parent, is paying back what was already spent on the care of the child.\n\n\nPlus, in instances where the courts assign a different amount of weight to how much each parent should pay, how is the one paying less supposed to say that the other parent can't spend more money on nicer things?",
            "I don't think the government should be parenting parents.",
            "I once worked for a month for a government employer. We were housed and fed. In the past people were given a simple stipend for their food daily. In an effort to be more \"accountable\" we had to submit all receipts. To do so we would, as a group begin the process Friday after lunch and got back to work when everyone was done. One day it took 80 of us over an hour to complete the task. After that someone else had to verify our accuracy. Long story shorter, no money saved, but a great effort in stupid to change optics for the taxpayer. At the end of the day it cost taxpayers the stipend, an hour of my salary, and the salary of another person to administrate. "

We have all been walking around town, not knowing what day it is or where we are meant to be.\n\nI spent almost a full 24h knowing that my dad was defending his property, but not knowing whether he was ok.\n\nI spent NYE without power, internet, water, or phone reception. Every road to our north and south were closed due to fire. We were hearing of people we knew driving their cars into the lake to escape  I passed midnight in my car, with ABC radio playing, eating a Christmas cookie and drinking warm white wine.\n\nI heard the radio announce a man had died a few kilometres to my north. Dad was a few kilometres to my north.\n\nWe turned on the BBQ the next day to cook up meat that was going bad quickly. I had his ute at our place (he had already evacuated his valuables). We had the door open and ABC radio on. My dad walked up and made a snide remark about leaving his car idling. His eyes were really blue and I could tell he had been crying (he NEVER cries). But at least he wasnt dead. And the farm had been saved - he stopped it with a rake.\n\nThousands upon thousands of tourists fleeing the town by car. One lady had been in her car since 630. It was 430 the next morning by the time they moved. 22 hours - not including the two hours she had to go before reaching her destination. Usually a 3h trip.\n\nThen, later that week, dad came to our house for the day because we had power back. He got a call in the afternoon - could he come back home, because the farm was on fire again. The roads were blocked and he was stuck. He almost drove through a creek in his tradie van trying to get there despite my pleas. It was about 8 hours of not knowing if the property would be ok. During that time, fires flared up on two sides of my own house, so we bounced between hosing my yard amd worrying about the farm.\n\nJust after midnight, an old neighbour of dads stopped in and told us the house had been saved. We had a cuppa and talked for an hour about what the fuck had just happened this week.\n\nComparitively, we got off so easy. But it was still the scariest week of my life.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to add...Usually my town is buzzing with tourists this year. While its nice to get a parking spot in town, the ghostly quietness is choking our small businesses. \n\nEDIT2: Not allowed to shout out specific insta handles so have removed the name of the start up who is prokoting bushfire affected businesses.",

KEEP AT LEAST 4 LITRES OF WATER IN A CONTAINER IN YOUR CAR AT ALL TIMES.\n3. please make sure you check coolant level in your radiator if possible. the coolant level should be at most a couple centimeters below the coolant fill neck. if your coolant level IS low, and you don't have premix coolant on hand, you can use tap/hose water in an emergency.\n4. please check tire pressure levels and fill to recommended pressure. this can usually be found on the sill of your car door or in your vehicle user manual. you can refill tires at most petrol stations. \n5. also make sure your spare tire if full and holds air too.\n6. make sure your washer fluid is FULL. this will help with ash and debris in an emergency situation.\n7. check headlights, blinkers, and taillights and replace any blown bulbs if possible.\n8. make sure all your windows on your vehicle are CLEAN, remove bird droppings, mud, ect. you want as much visibility in a heavy smoke condition as possible.\n9. make sure all your mirrors are as clean as possible, for the same reason you clean your windows.\n10. make sure window wiper blades work adequately or replace them. Supercheap auto has wipers for 80% of all common vehicles on the road for relatively cheap. they can fit them for you if this is an issue.\n11. buy jumper cables for your vehicle if possible. this might help you, or others if their battery develops issues. also, u/sirboddingtons suggest using buying a jump pack too which is great advice. most can also charge USB devices and often include torches which are certainly handy in an emergency.\n12. keep a small first aid kit in your car at all times. just basic.\n13. keep duct tape, sharp knife/razor blades, zipties, rope, basic phillips and flat head screw driver if possible. generally good things to have in your car.\n\nplease don't overlook these. the majority of these things can be done at little to know cost and might save you in an evacuation.\n\ngood luck to everybody. hopefully we see some rain today\n\nEdit: thank you to the awesome Reddit users that gilded this post and helped it gain more visibility in the thread. It is much appreciated, thank you for the help.",

Much better conditions than we were expecting! There's meals at the mess three times a day, a swimming pool and other facilities available for evacuees to use. As its not an operational base is a lot more relaxed than we were expecting. \n\nUnfortunately we were hit with a couple of unforseen events, with a grass fire nearby putting the barracks on alert. This coincided with us losing power (and no backup power other than emergency lighting).\n\nThe defence personnel are doing an amazing job under difficult circumstances. It's clear that evacuations of this scale aren't something there was already a plan for, but they're doing great under the circumstances. I half expected that by next fire season there will already be plans and processes in place for running defence facilities as relief centres. \n\nHopefully we'll be back home in the next day or two when conditions have improved.\n\nLastly, if you want to help donate funds or volunteer.

            "Australian's and others, I implore you to sear this memory into your brains and DON'T FORGET. Even when the fires are over, we have lost so much and will need a lot of support to rebuild. In the age of social media it's so easy to move on when things aren't immediate but it's going to take years to recover what isn't already lost. Once everything has settled, go to a small town and spend your money there. There's an initiative called emptyesky which hits the nail on the head. The idea is to take your empty esky (insulated box, usually for keeping beers/snags (sausages) cold when camping) and to visit the affected towns and spend your money there. Visit the local butchers, markets, old sweet store and buy fudge for every child you know. Volunteer your time and find a local community that's planting trees. If there's interest I'll start compiling some info about local tree planting communities. Follow @emptyesky on instagram and keep an eye out for local businesses that are in driving range of you that need support. Please and thank you x",

            "Alright then people here we go. I'm one of those Aussies that generally lurkes reddit and doesn't post a whole lot. These fires tho, they do make you take stock of your life and actions.\n\nThere are two things we are all really mad and scared about down here. 1 The fires. 2 Our \"Leadership\".\n\nOn number 1, we do call our summer 'Fire Season' for a reason. We regularly have fires in the summer months that cause property loss, (think farms with lots of land, large rural properties, bush land or scrub land) this is something of a fact of life here in Australia outside of the major cities where most of Australia lives. \n\nThis has led to the largest volunteer firefighting force in the world. Each state has its own force because it's just fallen under the states responsibility. The state of NSW has roughly 70,000 volunteer firefighters in the RFS that respond to emergencies like our summer bushfires, and in VIC (another state) the CFA as just under 35,000 volunteers. This is outside the professional coordinators and other roles that come with such a large organization. \n\nThese volunteers come directly from the communities that are being affected by these current fires, it is a not uncommon story to hear that while a squad of firefighters defended a house from being overrun from fire, the peoples that helped defend that property had lost their property over the course of the night/day. \n\nThe volunteers have been out there roughly since the start of November all on their own dime, this has had a massive effect on a lot of volunteers sacrificing income in the lead up to Christmas and over the new year, as they have for the most part either depleted their personal paid leave or in the case of some had to close the doors temporarily on the own small businesses. \n\nSome volunteers fighting fires without a break for days/weeks at a time. We hear from their spouses/families via various social media postings how they go without food/sleep for way too long and are always just exhausted. Our volunteer force was never meant for this level of fire in Australia. It is too prolonged. It is stretched so thin as to almost have broken. We have lost firefighters this season, 3 that I can think of from the top of my head, and I honestly don't want to find out how many more we are going to loose before this all ends.\n\nThe sheer amount of fires that are raging around the country is also new. The best thing to visualize it is from the Guardian [https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/ng-interactive/2019/dec/07/how-big-are-the-fires-burning-on-the-east-coast-of-australia-interactive-map](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/ng-interactive/2019/dec/07/how-big-are-the-fires-burning-on-the-east-coast-of-australia-interactive-map)\n\nThe experts acknowledge that only major rain fall will put some of these fires out. Let me say that again for people who may have read it without grasping what this means,  **WE CAN NOT PUT OUT SOME OF THESE FIRES.** Not without rain assistance.\n\nSo in summery go and check out the hastag on twitter **#AustralianFires** for sources and firsthand accounts. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow on to point number 2.\n\nOur Prime Minister **took a holiday** while the country was literally on fire, he went overseas to Hawaii and it took reporters to track him down. It was only at the deaths of two of the previously mentioned firefighting volunteers that he came home and faced the cameras.\n\nOur PM has repeatedly denied meeting a group of ex-fire chiefs (ex- hiefs because they were mostly into retirement age) that were trying to let us know the risk of our current reality. This group was trying to get a meeting since march of 2019.  So the experts know this was going to happen, they knew that a fire season of catastrophic proportions was the risk that was imminent, so instead of taking the meeting and being presented with the evidence our Prime Minister just didn't meet with them. \n\nThen there is the operational range of firefighting (large aircraft/ water bombers) that was rejected roughly about four years ago by the same party in government.  [https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/government-rejected-major-air-tanker-expansion-20200103-p53onl.html](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/government-rejected-major-air-tanker-expansion-20200103-p53onl.html) \n\nOur PM's response to the crisis was so slow, so ineffective, so incompetent that there are now calls to have him either resign or be dismissed by the Queen (still our head of state).\n\nThis is our centre-right part in Australia called the Liberal party. They have long been the party that has either outright denied climate change, spread misinformation that it is not man made or shown at best a token effort to tackle the issue. \n\nThere have been CISRO (Gov science funded body)  reports on climate change for many years, even going back more than 10 years. [https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-08/economic-bushfires-billions-ross-garnaut-climate-change/11848388](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-08/economic-bushfires-billions-ross-garnaut-climate-change/11848388)  These reports are scarily accurate about our current fires.\n\nThis is what we are terrified of here in Australia.  The fact that these are some of the worst fires in Australian history and the fact that our leadership simply refuses to even be engaged on the conversation of climate change in any serious way.\n\nThe last prime minister that did something on Climate change got outed pretty fast. That was Julia Gillard of the Labor party who introduced a Carbon Tax, the only proven effective thing in Australia that started carbon pollution trending down.  \n\nWe need help in Australia, and I am not sure from where and when it will come.",

Makes me tear up thinking about it. \n\nI say this for a political reason too - our gov has purposefully underfunded emergency services - thus donating to emergency services is effectively enabling this behaviour by our government. \n\nThe animals really need your help and would not ordinarily be beneficiaries of gov help. \n\nPeople choose to live in the Bush (including my family) and accept the risk of losing our homes. \n\nTo a lesser extent People choose to fight fires (very noble choice, yes)\n\nThe animals didn't have any say or choice in this, they're just getting their home destroyed and they have no say in it. \n\nDon't worry about the people here. We will be okay. We have insurance and a welfare state and high taxes and money from selling shitty minerals. \n\nHelp the animals though if you can.

            "Recently Melbourne, my hometown and the second biggest city, has had bad air quality and sometimes I can't go outside because of my smoke induced asthma. My point is, some people think that only the non metropolis area is being affected and while that is half true, almost every major city has lots of smoke",
            "I'm no where near the fires luckily, but my family is. They haven't been able to leave their house in a week due to how thick the smoke is. They're less than 100 kilometres away, and they're waiting it out as they've been told it is likely the fire won't reach them. That doesn't mean they haven't had bags packed and sitting by the door in case they shouldn't need to run and desert everything. The house backs right onto a dry forest, where the kangaroo population used to be increasing due to the number fleeing north, but now you can't see any cause they're dying from smoke inhalation. Straight fire isn't the only risk to our animals.\n\nMy aunt is a volunteer with a kangaroo protection service and has flown from the other side of the country to come and help raise some of the many Joey's left abandoned and homeless after their mother's left them or died while fleeing. Many of them are just dying from the stress, and people are scrambling to find safe places for them. \n\nAs I said I'm no where close, but the smoke still makes it to our skies, and the city still looks foggy in the middle of the day, and the heat is unbearable. The entire country is holding its breath waiting to see what's going to happen. We are all affected by these fires in some way, and we all want to see them stopped.",
            "We haven't been affected by the fires directly but we have a hell of a lot of smoke covering the town. I'm getting married a week from today. Every time I feel excited or happy about the wedding, I immediately feel guilty and like I don't have the right to be happy. It's been a real struggle. I worry about smoke ruining the pictures and the ceremony and have to remind myself that, thank god, we are not on fire and we have it good. We might have to cancel our wedding if it gets any worse over the next week. I really don't want that to happen. But again, at least we are not on fire.\n\nHonestly, even complaining on here I feel terrible because there are SO many people that have it much, much worse. I just don't know where else to put my thoughts.\n\nI feel for everyone directly affected. I can't even imagine. I feel stupid for complaining and I feel stupid for being happy.",

She noticed weird things: a batch of soup depleting faster than usual, missing eggs, damp towels in the hamper when she hadn't used any, extra dishes in the dishwasher, etc... This went on for months, she thought she was just being forgetful. One day she heard some thumping around in her attic and went to investigate. She found some make shift living quarters. Small radio, hot plate, sleeping bag, pillow, food wrappers, etc... She called the cops who came to keep an eye on the place. They ended up catching a homeless man climbing a tree, trying to sneak into her attic window. He had been doing this almost daily. He would wait for her to go to work, then go down stairs and help himself to food and amenities. The funny part about this story is they got to know each other throughout the ordeal, and the guy was actually very respectful, just down on his luck. She didn't press charges, instead, let him move in, helped him get a job, and he lived in the attic until he got back on his feet. Creepy shit with a happy ending.",

            "Before my Dad died, he once told me a story from when he was in Vietnam in the 1960s.  He told me about a mission where he and one other American with five CIDG strikers (South Vietnamese villagers turned fighters) were tasked to emplace seismic ground sensors along a trail network deep in the jungle.  He said they were about two days into the mission when he and two of the strikers split off from the main group to go watch a nearby trail intersection.  He said the jungle was pretty quite that day, just the sounds of birds and bugs and an occasional monkey.  He said they had been watching the trail intersection for about three or four hours and were deciding on whether to move further down the trail or to turn back and link up with the rest of the patrol.  Before leaving the cover of the brush my Dad said he checked the trail ahead of them one last time and prepared his men to move.  Now here is where the story gets interesting and he told this part with absolute dead seriousness.  He said just as he started to step out onto the trail he sees a light skinned Black Union Cavalry Soldier in full battle gear laying alongside the trail just shy of the intersection.  My Dad said the Union Soldier had two pistols, a Spencer rifle and a short curved club at his hip.  As my Dad was trying to process what he was seeing, the  Soldier looked directly at him and smiled.  Then the Soldier slowly placed a finger up to his lips as if to tell him to be silent and then motioned my Dad back off the trail.  My Dad said he signaled for his men to remain hidden and he recalled that as he slipped back into the jungle on one side of the trail, the Union Soldier did the same on his side of the trail.  Less than 10 seconds later he said the lead element of a group of NVA (North Vietnamese Army Soldiers) walked right through the trail intersection some 30 feet away.  My Dad estimated that the group was comprised of some 70 - 80 Soldiers equipped with automatic rifles, light machine guns and rocket propelled grenade launchers.  He has no doubt that his entire team would have been wiped out on the spot.  He said as soon as the enemy Soldiers had passed, he and his team beat feet out of there as fast and as quietly as they could and rejoined with the rest of the patrol.  He reported the enemy Soldiers his team had encountered, but decided not to say anything about the Soldier he had seen.  My Dad kept this secret for many many years; only telling me just before he passed and earlier only telling his Grandmother on her death bed in the 1970s.  He said when he told his Grandmother, she smiled and without opening her eyes told him, \u201cyou saw Old Red Tom\u201d.  Red Tom was my Great Great Grandfather.  He was a half Black / half Creek free man who was a scout for the Union Army during the Civil War and later served with the U.S. Cavalry in the American West.  He was know for carrying two pistols, a Spencer rifle and a Creek warclub into battle.",

            "A female friend in college disappeared from a party at another university in the city town 25ish miles north of our school.  She had arrived with another friend who I believe had driven.  At some point she split off to play corn hole or something and was later inexplicably gone.  Phone calls went to voicemail, police were called, but she was simply missing.\n\nAbout 10 days later she was found by a homeless man who witnessed her crawling up to a bus stop in the city, begging for help.  She had broken a leg and an arm, and was in very bad shape.\n\nAt the (quite large party) she had her drink secretly drugged and was then led off by a group of men into their vehicle.  She was taken to an apartment where she was drugged, repeatedly raped, and locked in a small room in between with a bucket to use as a bathroom.   At one point after being injected with heroin and raped, she somehow managed to convince one of her captors to allow her to use the actual bathroom to clean herself up.  This bathroom had a small window to the outside, and with the shower running, she managed to squeeze out and fell from the third story into a large hedge/bush.  From there she crawled from the apartment complex to the road and bus stop, where the homeless man saw her and called police.   Many cars stopped upon seeing her, making her captives unable to recapture her.   \n\nThree men were later arrested for the crime after surveillance cameras allowed police to locate the apartment which she jumped from.   She returned to our university almost two years later, graduated, and became a nurse.  She was obviously traumatised, never \"partied\" again, carried a gun everywhere she could, and somehow moved on with life.    It was a terrifying tale none of us ever forgot.

            "100% true as it happened to me. It's probably more spooky than scary. I'll let you be the judge....\n\nMany years ago, before there were cell phones we had these things called  pagers strapped to our hips. Someone would page you with their phone number and you would call them back when you got to a phone. As an \"on call technician\" working in the Audio Visual field, my pager would go off all the freaking time. Like most people who used pagers, our clients  knew that if you followed up your number with a 911, that would  indicate to the technician to stop what they were doing and call right away. Although I was always busy I rarely if ever got 911's. One  afternoon traveling from Orlando to Saint Petersburg via Interstate 4,  my pager goes off with a number I don't recognize, followed by the 911. I  find the first exit, and pull into a little truck stop looking place outside of Plant City, to use the pay phone. This takes maybe 3 minutes tops. I walk in, ask for some change and head to the wall where there  are 4 pay phones to choose from. I pop my quarter in and dial the number  displayed on my trusty pager. It rings........ and rings...... and  rings....... and rings. I'm thinking to myself WTF ?!?! Who would page  me with a 911 and not answer their phone? it's just about then that I  notice another ringing sound in addition to the one in my ear..... I  pull the handset from my ear and two phones over on the wall another pay phone is ringing, but with an incoming call. I hang up my the handset and the ringing stops on the other phone. I walk a few paces over, pick  up the handset and look at the phone number printed above the buttons , I  look at the number on my pager, I look at the number on the phone, I  look at the number on my pager again, I look at the phone AGAIN.....  except for the 911 they are identical. I kinda loose my breath for a  second and then I make my way over to the girl at the counter and ask if  she saw anyone use the pay phone. She said I was the the only person in  the store in the last hour. The whole episode probably took 15 minutes,  but man, I was freaked out! The hair on the back of my neck was  standing straight up and I just wanted out of there!   \n I get about 10 miles down the Highway and come upon a scene that looked  like a bomb went off.......4 car pile up involving a tractor trailer  hauling a load of steel that had come loose, State Troopers and  Paramedics just arriving. I pulled over to the side and helped the best I  could, but it was all pretty much over once it began. I have no idea  why I got that page or from whom or what but I'm convinced that if I  hadn't, I would not be alive to write this today.",

The school district was in the middle of a big restructuring so even though we were only a couple grades apart my brother and I went to different schools and took different buses. This left me as the last person to leave in the morning and the first person to get home in the afternoon, which meant it was my job to make sure all the lights were off and the door was locked. \n\nOne morning I noticed the basement door was open and the light was on so before I left I turned off the light and closed the door. When I got home that afternoon the light was on and the door was open again. I just assumed that I\u2019d forgotten to actually take care of it when I noticed it in the morning so I went over to turn off the light and close the door. When I got to the top of the basement stairs I looked and there was a big shadowy male figure towards the bottom of the staircase. I freaked out, slammed the door and pushed a bunch of boxes against it and then went and hid in my closet. For months I didn\u2019t tell my family because I was positive what I had seen was a ghost and didn\u2019t think anyone would believe me. \n\nThen about a year after that incident my mom and her boyfriend realized that small amounts of money had been going missing for months (totaling around $800-900, but never more than $60 at once). So we all walked around the house with flashlights trying to figure out how they could have gotten in. Turns out some creep was climbing in through a small hole in the outside of the house, shimmying through a crawl space, then coming up into the house through the basement. Realizing I had been alone in the house with him on at least one occasion was one of the worst, most terrifying moments I\u2019ve ever had.\n\nEdit: whoa this blew up way more than I expected.

A short time later, calls started coming in to 911 about a car going the wrong way down the highway at a high rate of speed. They made it about 90 seconds before a head-on collision with another vehicle, driven by a father with two children and another child along for the ride.\n\nThe crash annihilated both vehicles. The only survivors were Kirby herself, and the child who was along for the ride in the other car. There were pieces of children all over the highway. She was sentenced to 215 years in prison.",

His neighbor had a couple derelict cars parked up near his garage that he took parts from occasionally.   \n\nThis neighbor of his started hearing noises while sitting in his living room, coming from his front yard. Every time he'd go to the window, there would be nothing there. He assumed it was a raccoon or a coyote or whatever. He kept hearing the noise so he'd go outside to look around but would find nothing. He'd put out traps and occasionally catch something, yet the noise persisted.  \n\nSoon, he started claiming that he was hearing voices coming from the front yard, like whispering. He'd go outside and look around the perimeter of his property but would find nothing. It was persistent so he'd started calling the cops. Every time the cops came and looked around and would find nothing. So they told him he needed to stop calling them for this, and perhaps get a security camera or whatever.  \n\nSo this guy thought he was losing his mind. One summer evening he couldn't sleep, so he went to the back patio to smoke a cigarette. Suddenly, he heard voices coming from the front of his house. He put his cig out and snuck around to the front and got there just in time to see the doors to his derelict conversion van silently shut. He ran back to the backyard and went inside his home and called the police to tell them what he had seen. The police arrived and approached cold (i.e. without lights/sirens) and when they approached the van, the doors swung open and a bunch of people ran out in every direction.

The bedstead was hinged and they would tip the sleeping victim into a vat of boiling liquid immediately below, thus killing him.\n\n [https://www.theostrichcolnbrook.co.uk/history](https://www.theostrichcolnbrook.co.uk/history) \n\n [http://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/content/articles/2009/05/05/ostrich\\_feature.shtml](http://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/content/articles/2009/05/05/ostrich_feature.shtml)",

            "Alright, so my pre-school teacher who also ended up somehow changing jobs and becoming my 11th grade english teacher had a super interesting life. Her mother had some super famous book, her father worked high up in the government, but enough about her family. First, let me describe her to you, she had dark hair and blue eyes (you'll see why this matters in a minute). She told this story every single year to the new students in her class...when she was younger, she was driving through Arizona on a two-way road while her boyfriend at the time was following behind her on his motorcycle. For those who don't live in Arizona, certain stretches of it can be quite isolated and deserted. She said that they were on a long drive (it's been about 6 years since I was in her class so details are fuzzy), but basically her and her boyfriend both knew the destination where they were heading by memory and eventually got separated by a few miles. A man who was behind her in a Volkswagen beetle kept pulling up beside her into the other lane (no one was coming) and motioning at her to pull over. She somewhat ignored him the first few times, but he kept doing it and began getting more frantic each time. She said that she believed that he spotted something wrong with her car, so she saw a parking lot off the road for a deserted gas station and pulled over. Once pulled over, she said that she instantly got an eerie feeling. The man was suspicious and kept telling her that he saw something wrong with her headlight and insisted she get out of the car so he could show her what he meant. Her boyfriend who was a few miles behind her, eventually caught up and spotted her car at the sketchy gas station. Right as she was out of the car, her boyfriend began to pull in. As he did that, this man got into his car and SPED off like his life depended on it. \n\nThey later were able to identify that the man was Ted Bundy. She said she cannot imagine what would have happened to her if her boyfriend had been even another 3 miles behind her on the road.\n\nEdit: Spelling/ clarity of details",
            "Years ago my now husband worked for an industrial laundry company in their head office when a PR disaster happened that also mentally screwed up a number of people.\n\nTheir company collected laundry from large hospitals and medical type businesses eg care homes etc and cleaned them - you can imagine the sort of heavy duty cleaning, bleaching, boiling  etc needed to remove those sort of biological contaminants.\n\nOne day a laundry cart went through the usual bleaching, boiling cycle before it dropped out into a conveyor belt to be sorted for drying/pressing when there was a horrid scream.\n\nA small newborn baby\u2019s body had been discovered tangled up amongst the sheets, it had been \u201ccooked\u201d.  The laundry workers were distraught, the whole place had to be shut down, police called and the laundry tracked back to the hospital to discover what happened.\n\nIt turns out a (thankfully in some ways) stillborn baby had been left in the cot waiting to be taken down to the hospital mortuary after the parents had said their goodbyes and covered it with a blanket but somehow one of the nurses hadn\u2019t realised (just on shift was the best guess) so just grabbed up all the linen out the cot and off the bed in the delivery room with the body bundled inside and emptied it into the laundry hamper/trolley thing.  The other nurses/parents assumed the baby had been collected by the mortuary to be stored awaiting their funeral decisions.\n\nThe laundry was found not to be to blame but the parents were devastated and the hospital took a lot of flack.  The poor laundry workers who discovered the body ended up being given counselling before eventually quitting.  The laundry did amend its practice to individually emptying each laundry hamper into the industrial machines instead of just tipping them in to stop anything like that happening again.\n\nEdit: just found it in the news paper turns out I miss-remembered the how of getting into the laundry basket slightly wrong\n\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-97455/Dead-baby-thrown-hospital-laundry.html",
            "Have you heard of the Nazi so bad that other Nazis, in particular fellow SS Nazis, constantly tried to get him and his unit disbanded and arrested? No?! Well his name was Oskar Dirlewanger, and his unit was nicknamed \"The Black Hunters\" or the \"Dirlewanger Brigade\". \n\nOskar Dirlewanger was an early adopter of the Nazi party. He had been thrown in jail before for being a pedophile. Eventually when World War II broke out and healthy *ideal* Germans were dying in droves on the Eastern Front, Oskar's old pal Heinrich Himmler (Head of the SS) granted him a command of a unit made up originally of German poachers, and eventually German criminals being held in civilian jails / camps, and military criminals. His unit was essentially designated as a rearguard unit meant to hunt down enemy partisans (or in most cases civilians in occupied countries).  Oskar Dirlewanger SS unit was responsible for many atrocities. Some atrocities so barbaric and bad other SS units reported him and his unit for atrocities. A few examples, which have been popularized in film, include taking an entire village in Belorus and putting them in a church, locking the doors, and setting the church ablaze. Anyone who tried to escape was shot by machineguns and rifles. This unit raped, tortured, and murdered its way through Eastern and Central Europe. During the Warsaw Uprising they were sent to help squelch the uprising. One of their atrocities committed was going in to a children's hospital, telling the nurses and staff that they were there to secure the church. Ok. Once the church was secured they raped the female staff, and some of the wounded and sick female children victims, and then went around shooting everyone. If anyone was found to have survived they were bayoneted.  These guys were so horrible that other Nazis looked down their noses at them, and constantly filed complaints and reports against them, but with no real success. Thankfully by the end of the war this unit was destroyed and its leaders and criminal soldiers were hunt down like rabid animals.",

He went to grab something in the trunk, leaning over the seat, and it tipped backward and pinned him, upside down, against the back of the car in a position such that he couldn't get himself out. \n\nHe called the police TWICE.

            "In the late 1950s the Soviet Union spearheaded a campaign to convince the World Health Organization that Smallpox could be eradicated.  Smallpox is a highly contagious disease that is specific to humans.  Insofar as we know, no other species on earth can get or carry smallpox.  \n\nIn 1977, the last case of Smallpox was identified and snuffed out.  The disease was eradicated.\n\nHowever, rather than destroy the final genetic samples of the disease, the cold war super-powers decided to store it.  Some went to the Soviet Union and some went to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta Georgia.\n\nThe Soviets began a weaponization program.  \n\nThis means that they tried to make a stronger, more contagious, more lethal strain of smallpox.  They tried to cross it with other diseases like Ebola, creating entirely artificial \"chimera\" diseases.\n\nThey grew smallpox in the lab *by the ton* and kept it loaded, ready to be fired on missiles into the United States.\n\nBut it's not a missile that's frightening.  A single glass ampule of the stuff, smashed against the wall of a subway station in New York or Chicago or Tokyo could spark a global outbreak.\n\nVery, very few people alive today have been vaccinated for smallpox and there are but a scant few doses of vaccine available.   In the event of an outbreak our ability to manufacture vaccine would be rapidly outpaced.  \n\nIf the wrong person got their hands on the Soviet Smallpox Bioweapon, billions could die.\n\nNuclear weapons are bad enough, but they, at least, require a general war to break out in order to bring about an end to human civilization.  A smallpox bioweapon doesn't require a war; just one security breach.",

From within the fortress, Russian troops emerged, coughing up blood and lung fragments, covered in bandages made up as improvised gas masks as well as chemical burns, they returned rifle and light artillery fire at the advancing Germans, the German troops didn't bother firing back as they just ran back to their lines, their commanders claimed \"they're already dead, give it twenty minutes and go take the place\" to which the soldiers remarked \"it is not men protecting that place, but the devil\" Osowiec Fortress never fell during the war, as when the German troops went back months after there was already fresh defenders.

Anyway, they noticed a girl on the dance floor who looked super out of place. She had sweatpants and a t shirt on and wasn\u2019t wearing makeup and had her hair in a ponytail. She also had a backpack on. Basically, the exact opposite of typical club attire and not at all what someone would usually wear to this place. They said that she seemed very dazed as well, and more importantly, there was a very large man grabbing her and grinding on her and she was just kind of standing there letting it happen.\n\nOne of my friends tried approaching her to ask if she was alright but the guy spoke for her and insisted that he was her boyfriend and that she\u2019d just had too much to drink but that she was okay. Everyone was suspicious but at that point there wasn\u2019t much else they could do so they just kept an eye on the two of them. Eventually the guy left the dance floor to go to the bar and my friend was able to talk to this girl again. She said that she was EXTREMELY out of it and that it seemed more likely that she had been drugged rather than just drunk. The girl managed to convey that she didn\u2019t know the man she was with and wanted to leave. So my friend grabbed her and made for the exit, but not before this guy came back. He IMMEDIATELY flipped out, got right in my friend\u2019s face and started screaming at her. It escalated to the point that he eventually swung at my friend who just barely dodged the punch. Thankfully, someone else had went and found a security guard and they were able to prevent this guy from hurting anyone, meaning that my friends and the girl were all able to leave safely. She was still super messed up when they left so nobody could get the full story out of her but she did say that the guy had been following her around town all day. \n\nThe really scary part is that the bar staff couldn\u2019t technically do anything other than throw this guy out after my friends had left. One of them called the cops and gave them a description of the guy but they said they couldn\u2019t really do much other than be on the lookout for him.

We had more than a dozen, each with a few engineers assigned to specific ones in shifts. These things were run 24/7 as they provided power to not only the mining shafts, but the large town that was build underground to house all the miners and their families; we\u2019re probably taking 20,000 people here. Now these boilers were breaking down constantly and if more than 4 went down at once, the power was cut to the town to keep the industrial sector powered. If the industrial sector ran out of power, the air pumps would go down\u2026resulting in death, so yeah.

I\u2019d been out cold for no more than 4 days. My brain had conjured up this whole world, people, buildings, experiences whilst I was out cold. It was utterly surreal. I tried to talk to my then girlfriend about it and she kind of focussed more on how serious my condition was, so I never spoke of it again with anybody.\n\nNow I\u2019m sure a lot of people have these types of a hallucinations. But this was so crazy-real. It wasn\u2019t like I was seeing pink dragons in my bath tub, I had 30 years of memories in my head of a life I\u2019d never lived. A wife. Kids. Friends. Work colleagues. I could remember them all, but none of them existed.\n\nThis realisation threw me into a deep depression for a while. I'd omitted a whole bunch of detail from the story due to how, even 9 years later, it makes me feel sombre. \n\nIt scared me how my brain could conjure up something so real, that wasn\u2019t.",

This is how it was told to me:\n\nA family member of mine is friends with a man (middle aged) whose wife sadly died while taking their dog out for a walk through a rural area they where visiting. They had driven up to a farm along the road and gotten out when the dog tore from her grip and ran off. She ran after it to the back of the barn (where the huge open dung-cistern was).\n\nThe farmer wasn\u2019t home, so when he came back later in the day, he found her car and thought it weird that a strange car had just been left there, doors open, with no people noticeably near by. He went around searching for his unexpected visitors and eventually found them.\n\nWhat he found was something I had never even imagined before hearing of this.\n\nThe dog had fallen into the cistern of deep, liquid waste from the farm animals. The edges on the cistern where way too high up to reach from liquid surface level and the woman must have panicked, because she had jumped in after the dog to save it and that\u2019s where her life slowly and brutally came to an end.\n\nThe fumes that accumulate from that much dung are very toxic. The woman, after being unable to get back out, had lost consciousness and drowned, along with her dog, in a pool of cow shit.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine a worse way to die. I think about it now and then and hope that no one will ever die like that again. Poor souls.",

His parents were not even allowed at the trial because they were black.\n\nHe spent 81 days in prison, and his parents could only see him once during this time. On June 16, 1944, Stinney was executed in a horrible way. They strapped him into the electric chair, which was too large for a 14 year old, so they had him sit on a bible. His father was allowed to say a few words to him, and then they started strapping the face mask onto him. He was whimpering and crying. He was electrocuted with such high voltage that his face deformed. But because he was far too young, the face mask fell off during electrocution and everyone could see his face get morphed. One of his eyes fell out and his teeth were steaming afterwards. Tears were streaming down his face as he died.\n\nThe story sends shivers down my spine. He was only 14.

He was charming, she said, and went to dinner with him a few nights later at a local student bar/restaurant. He kept pushing wine on her, ordering more when she declined, and his stories/history surrounding his \"residency\" didn't track. She said she had to use the restroom, left out a back entrance, ran to a restaurant near campus owned by a family friend, and called her father. Her dad was there within 15 minutes to pick her up and as they pulled away from the restaurant, they saw Bundy walking around seemingly looking for her outside the bar. \n\nShe thought he he was just a lying creep, no idea of who he really was until he hit the news a few years later when her dad called her and said, \"Turn on the news.\"",

About an hour later as she\u2019s tossing and turning, she said she saw a faint outline of what appeared to be someone standing at the foot of her bed. As soon as she screamed, she realized the outline was truly that of a man as he bolted out the door and out of the apartment. \n\nShe told my brother she\u2019s been sleeping with a bat under her bed ever since that day."

            "Good morning.\n\nProtests have largely stopped because of Covid-19.\n\nSome members of the pro-Beijing party are trying to push Article 23 amongst all the paranoia and attention focused on the pandemic. Link here:  [https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3077109/its-no-time-article-23](https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3077109/its-no-time-article-23) \n\nAside from that, police resentment still lingers. The people haven't forgotten. There are still blatant incidents of police misconduct taking place against journalists.\n\n [https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3074155/pepper-spray-arrests-hong-kongs-tai-po-district](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3074155/pepper-spray-arrests-hong-kongs-tai-po-district) \n\n [https://www.hongkongfp.com/2020/03/22/pictures-tear-gas-pepper-spray-arrests-hong-kong-protesters-mark-8-months-since-yuen-long-mob-attack/](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2020/03/22/pictures-tear-gas-pepper-spray-arrests-hong-kong-protesters-mark-8-months-since-yuen-long-mob-attack/) \n\nThe double whammy of protests into the coronavirus has hit retailers and businesses especially hard. A drive to the hospital the other day has just rows of shops that have closed down or are close to closing down. I suspect things will pick up again after the epidemic dies down. We know that economic downturns are not good for civil obedience. \n\nOur country (from a social perspective) is fucked.",
            "Hi am HKer, but not one of our braves (we call the frontline protestors the braves!). \n\nWith COVID-19, it's become more and more risky to gather for protests or anything like that, so mainly large activities have subsided, except for some (e.g the gathering to mark the Yuen Long attack a few days ago). Some smaller activities (which are equally important to the movement) such as Lennon walls, lunch with you, etc, are still ongoing. \n\nBut I can really go into detail about the protests before COVID-19. There were moments when I was protesting that it got bloody and violent. It turns in the blink of an eye, really, once I was at a memorial for deceased student Chow Tsz Lok and the moment the clock hit 9PM (the official \"curfew\" for large, unauthorised gatherings, apparently, there was police in riot gear surrounding the park we were in, asking anybody young and dressed in black for their IDs and basically arresting anybody that refused. It didn't get too dangerous that night because the memorial was still considered a religious gathering. But in other protests, such as the one that happened in Central, it can get bloody really quick. In the middle of the protests, at 5PM (rather than 9PM as the police said), they suddenly disapproved of the march and ordered everybody to evacuate. Which was impossible, because Hong Kong is a tiny city and there were hundreds of thousands on the streets. So when we couldn't do it, they set up water cannons and fired tear gas. In another protest in Central, back in the occupation of CUHK, they fired tear gas forty minutes after the protest began, right when people were beginning to join. It was pretty much impossible to avoid getting hit by the gas. Then they started grabbing people (mostly those dressed in black) and quite literally beat them up right in front of me. \n\nThere's been so many times I've seen police abuse happen right in front of my eyes. I saw a teen dressed in black just *walking* near the vicinity of a protest and a police grabbed him by the scruff of the neck and slammed him against a wall. I saw a boy bleeding from the head after he got hit by a tear gas canister. I saw an old man that tried to shield a protestor from the police get pushed onto the floor like he was nothing. I met with university students from HKU when they occupied it to bring them food, and it literally broke my *heart* when I saw the baton marks on their arms and wrists and the bruises on their faces. And they told me I was too young to be there and told me to leave. These people are kind people. It hurts me so bad to know that they are risking their lives like this. I implore everybody to not forget about Hong Kong.",
            "Throwaway, obviously.\n\nNot what you would call a hardcore frontline, but have been to various protests and inhaled tear gas.\n\nTBH, even before the virus broke out,  the amount of people going out to protest has dwindled as time goes on, with a few special occasions seeing a sudden influx of people going on peaceful walks and rallies (at least that's the nature of the event, obviously the gov and popo disagree) when something outrageous happens. But on the frontlines though, most people are very supportive and friendly of each other, and you'll basically get all the help you need should you just speak up. \n\nIDK if international media reported much on the two incidents where the police basically blocked in two universities, fired a crazy amount of tear gas and arrested a lot of protestors but after that, a major issue that kinda popped up were that with a lot of more experienced frontline protestors arrested or under bail, the less experienced had to step up. What happened was that in the following protests, people were definitely less organized and aware of what to do; many times we've seen people just provoking the police and not running away in time, or just occupying a spot until a lot of people just get arrested.\n\nAfter the breakout of the Wuhan virus, there's been a lot less protests, but similar events still garner a lot of attention from protestors and a lot of us show up to these events, such as monthly gatherings on the 31st to Prince Edward station due to the incident where police basically entered the station and a train and used a lot of unnecessary force on citizens last August 31st, or holding vigils for those who have fallen from the protests.\n\nPsychologically though, I think all protestors, frontline or not, are mentally exhausted. Our government manages to go lower with each policy they make, and police brutality just gets worse every day while there power remains unchecked. I'd go as far to say that we are really desperate, but we're still not giving in.\n\nThanks for asking, it means a lot that internationally, people still care about us!",
            "HKer here, but not front line protester.\n\nPublic gatherings have most subsided as most organizers don't want to risk further contagion. There are still people who come out and block the roads on monthly anniversaries of 721, 831 and the death of the college student protester (I think thats 1113).\n\nThe prosecution from the government hasn't stop. Just yesterday a councilwoman was arrested with some charge that was not used since 1967. RTHK which produces documentaries and satire show are under attack from the pro-Beijing camps. The Police beat suspects until they are too injured to attend their court hearings.\n\nBut on a some fronts the fight is still continuing. Volunteers still put up poster art on walls even though the risks of just doing that has been greater and greater. There are people planning the strategy to Legco (legislative council) election that will take place near the end of 2020. You see pictures of masked protesters holding the \"Free HK, Revolution Now\" flag around Hong Kong to remind people not to forget about the cause and the people who made sacrifices for it. Groups are still trying to get other countries to pass legislations to support our fight for freedom and autonomy. Some individuals are trying to sue the police in a civil suit.\n\nAlso some pro-Beijing legco members are pushing to pass \"Article 23\", a national security law which will effectively end freedom of speech and assembly. There has been a lot of talk about for to push this back so I guess we will see.\n\nI feel like everyone are realizing even though the pitch battles with fire and bricks are what draw the headlines, but we are in for a long fight. Preserving our culture, our language and our values in the long run is as important as anything else. I know the odds are stacked against us and all anyone can talk about is how powerful the CCP is, but we are not giving up yet\n\nFree Hong Kong, 5 demands Not One Less\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold and awards kind strangers! If you are interested in helping the Hong Kong protesters there are a lot of resources and discussions over at r/hongkong.  There are some easy things you can do like following high profile protesters on Twitter and youtube. Or supporting legislations to ban exports to HK police if you live in the US or Europe.

My cousins have been wary with protesting ever since they were arrested being caught up in the university siege, but they've told me that there's always been those minor acts of civil disobedience as of late that resonates with me.

Efforts now have been focusing on preparing ourselves physically, mentally, and getting enough resources for protests against Article 23 being pushed in our legislative system. \n\nHere's an excerpt from Wikipedia:\n\nIt states that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region \"shall enact laws on its own to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition, subversion against the Central People's Government, or theft of state secrets, to prohibit foreign political organizations or bodies from conducting political activities in the Region, and to prohibit political organizations or bodies of the Region from establishing ties with foreign political organizations or bodies.\"\n\n\nEveryone here is expecting a round 2 for Hong Kong once the outbreak is over and our government tries to push it again.

This wristband can be taken off easily and by one hand. Quarantined people can then walk around the streets and go totally unnoticed, possibly infecting a ton of people.\n* The wristband has a QR code on it to enter a website, which takes forever to load, and often doesn't load anyways.\n* The government has made excuses for a mainland elderly couple who were supposed to be in quarantine and ventured outside, asking for understanding and sympathy (although they were wanted people).\n* The government has not enacted any measures to keep those in quarantine inside, only visiting and providing information on what to do and what not to do. HK already knows its people are selfish so idk why they're not doing anything stricter.\n* Tourists have been banned only recently. Borders to China were only closed after medical workers refused to go to work.\n* Carrie Lam, the CEO has put a ban on alcohol, her reasons being that people under the influence are more likely to interact with each other. She mentioned nothing on closing bars.\n* She has also encouraged HK to not wear masks unless they feel sick, which means by the time they are wearing masks it will be too late anyways.\n* Government promised to distribute masks to the public but ultimately didn't manage to produce any.\n* HKDSE (HK exams) are postponed and not cancelled, even though IB, A levels, and IGCSE are cancelled for us.\n* A plan is being made to name a park over a protester who's body was found in the sea (unknown if it's suicide or the police killed her).

We always strive to get as much international attention as possible. \nThere hasn\u2019t been much large scale protests because of the virus. Most people are staying at home. \nHowever police brutality hasn\u2019t stopped. \nOn Mar 8, police went to many people\u2019s homes and arrested them, possibly related to the PolyU siege. Some people reported hearing screams of \u201chelp me\u201d that night. The same night, there was a memorial held for Chow Tsz Lok, and police again treated participants with unnecessary violence and sprayed pepper spray at reporters. \nSimilar things happens on Mar 21 when people gathered to protest what happened on Jul 21 last year.",
            "Chinese Mainlander studying in and standing with Hong Kong here. \n\nI have never really been a frontline protestor BUT I have witnessed what frontline is like quite a few times.  Especially when the police stormed our campus (CUHK) and fired over 2000 tear gas bombs to the frontline protestors resisting police violence with petrol bombs and bricks. \n\nFeel free to ask if you have any questions! Have a lot of stories to share with if you are interested!",
            "I live in Hong Kong but my parents doesn\u2019t let me go to the front line but I still have a fire in my heart",
            "Hongkonger here.\n\nThe amount of protests has dropped since the outbreak of the \"COVID-19/Coronavirus/China Virus\" (what so ever to be politically correct), and the police force has engaged in action to arrest protesters who participated protests in the UST and Chinese Universiry protests in November,2019.\n\nAlthough I am not really a front line protester, more like a messenger who runs along the front line and the back, the tear gases are really dangerous (as its name, make our tears come out, make us choke, damage our lungs). And like real battlefield, if we go the wrong way, we are surely doomed.\n\nThere are unknown numbers of \"Real frontline protesters\" since we don't have a commander or leader among us, the police, citizens and us all know that there are some squads, but the number and amount of participants are unknown (thousands? ten thousands? hundred thousands? millions? Who knows?)\n\nDuring the outbreak, we look at the Internet and check if there is any country that is affected by the virus, drop down the statistic and leave it as a record. I can't further explain how we are doing this, there are people reading.\n\nSurely you may have seen us helping ambulance to get through, marching unitedly. It's not rehearsed but because Hongkongers are a kind-hearted group of people.\n\nYou can ask me if you have any concerns.",
            "Frontline protester here, started going out in 2014 (Umbrella Movement) and participated in most major \"battles\" since 612 of 2019. Since Chinese New Year, Protests aside from the 21th and 31st of every month to remember the 721 Triad attack and 831 police attack have been smaller in scale. The most recent battle was to stop new public housing tower blocks from being used for coronavirus (it was always called \"Wuhan Virus\" in Chinese, even pro-Beijing camp) containment, as they are located only hundred meters away from other occupied blocks. To force Carrie Lam to close up borders, there have also been attacks on the border and transit, which combined with the doctor and nurse strike has forced closure of most borders with China Mainland. **The current battle is about shopping, dining and posting on the internet, which I will explain later.**\n\n\nLarge scale demonstration (hundred thousands marching peacefully from Victoria's Park to Government HQ) has stopped since the local elections. The historical victory for the Pan-democrat and localist has given Carrie Lam and Beijing a message, forcing them to face the reality that their \"silent majority\" simply doesn't exist. About 60% Hong Kongers are pro-democratic and under 20% people still support the government. The police morale was low and they are afraid to admit their identity off duty. The \"Blue Ribbon\" hardliners still attack young protesters when they put up Lennon Wall and such, usually with riot police stepping in later so they can escape and the police would arrest the wounded victims.\n\nThe police has initially given a bit, only to get more violence and hateful than ever after the new police commissioner [Chris Tang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Tang) stepped up. He is a ruthless commander that cares nothing about image or moral. He supports the police for any criminal action and denies any accusation, even when it is fully captured on TV. Due to a flaw in the system, the police and prosecutor gets to pick the judge for each case, which they always pick the most biased, pro-Beijing ones. Many protesters get maximum sentence, and many innocence gets thrown in prison for months, only to see charge dropped due to lack of evidence. Dozens of civil lawsuits are on the way. The police can get away with any crime, the police force simply refuses to identify the policeman responsible for each attack. When someone doxxed him for civil lawsuit, the police just arrests everyone who shares such information on social media. They are turning HK into a de facto Police State.\n\nBut what people really worry is the surge of disappearance and \"suicide\" cases, a large number of bodies found are teenagers dressed in black clothing. Our volunteer \"scouts\" even noticed police vans offloading cops in the area hours ahead of body \"found\". Kidnapping is also common - the police admits using unmarked car and plainclothes to arrest protesters, just drive by, stop and grab. They won't notify anyone unless the victim's friend and family report it to the police, then he/she will be found in custody, usually beaten or sexually assaulted. The Hong Kong public cemetery has over 30 burials of unidentified bodies since the beginning of 2020, a large increase over last year. Some of us starting carrying knife, I guess it gives some hope to avoid getting killed or framed for 10 years in jail.\n\n\n**However we are winning other battles**. The \"Yellow Economy\" has grown significantly, making Carrie Lam and Beijing worried. Vowed to only support pro-democratic \"Yellow\" businesses, the movement has moved from restaurants to supermarkets and then other businesses. \"Blue\" pro-Beijing businesses have historically dominated the market and suppressed \"Yellow\" businesses, yet this is changing. As Wuhan Virus is hitting hard, restaurants close down and most survivors are Yellow ones with banners and slogans on the door. Last night I dined in Mong Kok, 70% of restaurants left open are Yellow. They measured body temperature and sterilized the hands of every customer before letting in, just like what the doctors suggested. A number of Blue businesses have turned coat to join in. Pro-Beijing/Chinese corporations are quickly losing revenue from this 7-million people market and the rich are putting pressure on Carrie Lam.\n\n\nAs someone else has said, hardline pro-Beijing legco members are pushing the \"Article 23\". This is however not supported by the rest of the pro-Beijing camp, which still hopes to get votes from moderates. The Legco election is coming, it is not very powerful and the way the system is set guarantees pro-Beijing members will always be the majority, but we will be gaining seats no matter what. The future is uncertain and people are getting beaten, charged or murdered, but the fighting spirit is still high and we won't quit until all five demands are met.\n\n\nGlory to Hong Kong.",

There was also news about an asshole who was imposing his opinions and cursing at protesters face to face \u2014 he was put aflame by the protesters. Though he was an asshole, I think there are some things that protesters have done which makes them seem like \u201crioting\u201d and they are really breaking the law despite their \u201ccalm and controlled\u201d protest. \n\nI\u2019m not from HK but honestly I\u2019m pro-HK in this because someone has to stand up against China trying to take over everything.

            "Anyway you cut it a shitty system will produce shitty politicians.\u00a0\n\nRanked choice voting in my opinion is is the law that would best reform our political entire system.",
            "There are some senior politicians who are substantially older than 65 who are incredibly sharp and seriously paying attention to the concerns of their constituents. There are politicians and justices under 65 who are completely out of touch and prioritizing their own interests. So I don\u2019t think capping age will make any kind of meaningful change. The bigger issues are that the current two-party system, electoral college, gerrymandered districts, and constraints on voting rights in black and low-income communities have resulted in politicians who are not elected by the population majority. On top of people in office who don\u2019t represent the majority, the two party system lowers the quality of the available candidates which in turn lowers voter turn out because neither option are particularly appealing. I think something like France has where all politicians are in the same primary and then the top two are elected would result in better presidential options. You could then potentially have a libertarian candidate running against a democratic candidate with a viable chance of winning, or a no-party candidate running against a Republican or any number of combinations. The mayors in my city don\u2019t affiliate with any party and honestly it\u2019s refreshing. It\u2019s like having someone competent in charge without any political drama.",
            "Why stop at the presidency? How about for all elected officials",
            "I think the US should implement a ranked choice voting system. I think that will have a much bigger impact on our political system.",
            "The President sets the precedent. 65 is when it\u2019s time for people to retire. Sit down, make room, live out your days in peace. Set that tone for the American people.",
            "Yes, absolutely. Both Joe Biden and Donald Trump are way too old to be president. So was Regan when he ran 40+ years ago.\n\nHell, I'd even go further and cap the ages for all elected officials at 65.",
            "Yeah.  Even arguments about mental fitness aside, I think we should limit to candidates who would at least be reasonably expected to spend a couple decades in whatever world they create.\n\nedit: By the teats of Thor, this was apparently the most upvoted comment on June 9th of 2022.  Reddit sent me a little badge over it.",
            "All politicians should fuck off the second they hit retirement age. Those who would hit it during their term shouldn't be allowed to run for office.",
            "Yes I would. And if you need to know why just look at Joe Biden, Donald Trump, and Diane Feinstein to name a few.  This country has way too many geriatrics running it.",
            "I don't see how we could determine that 65 is the magic number for such a cutoff.\n\nPeople age at different rates. There are folks with dementia in their 40s and some 90 years olds are still sharp as a needle.\n\nThe better question to discuss is how to fix the way the Executive is chosen.\n\nIs there a way to do this that would *tend* to yield better executives and stop putting partisan hacks in office?",
            "I would support it. Not only for the obvious issue of \"old people have mental health decline\" and the debate of mental disorders like dementia but a generational thing too. People who are 65 and up lived totally different lives than me at 26 even if we lived generally in the same or similar location, finical status, and social groups. Some of these politicians say they worked at McDonalds when in college too and bought a house and paid for their education at just $2 a hour. In 1960 $2 had the same buying power as $18. That's more than my previous *factory* job which was just $16 an hour. How do you explain that to them? Even Bernie wants a $15 min wage which is not even a living wage anymore.",
            "I am going to be the unpopular opinion here. I think having an age limit really does take away experienced candidates who have dedicated their lives to public service. While the majority of those people don\u2019t actually run for office, i think we do underplay how important experience and wisdom is important for a leader. Nelson Mandela was 75 when he was elected president. I have had professors in college who were so intelligent, compassionate, and overall good people who  were over the age of 65. I know that the majority of people who run for president or who are in politics don\u2019t fit that narrative, but I think it\u2019s still important to keep that door open.",
            "Feels like something voters should be able to decide for themselves.",
            "We need more politicians who actually want to improve the systems we have rather than line their own pockets with money. We fucking can\u2019t though because the two candidates that actually mean much in the elections suck.",
            "I don\u2019t care about age, only cognitive ability. There are plenty of 65+ who are mentally sharp and carry a wealth of experience. I would maybe support cognitive exams for all candidates, but the process could easily be corrupted. Ultimately I think voters should be able to vote for whoever they choose, and make their own determination about mental fitness. And candidates ought to do the right thing and step down if their mental abilities have been compromised.",
            "nah. i just want term limits across the board. \n\ni don't like old people making decisions that play out over decades but i also don't like saying somebody can't do something *strictly because* they're old. they might be the best person. \n\nbut we never get the best person for president. the two party system is broke. so age limit on presidency doesn't really matter. they'll find some other garbage person to put up there that'll keep the status quo going.\n\nbut screw this 30+ years in congress nonsense.",
            "Maybe 70 and it should apply to Congress  . We should not have people with dementia running the country.",
            "The president isn't the main problem. The main problem is congress, *then* the president. Term limits for *everything* appointed or elected, including the supreme court. I'd set the age limit at 70, but if someone is elected or appointed at 69, their term is a single year. \n\nSo as an example, the presidency has a two-term limit of four years apiece, don't change that. Congressional terms are two years, so set a limit of four to five terms (ish). Supreme court, maybe set terms of 5 years apiece, with a limit of 3 terms. We don't need a government with dynasties of inertia.\n\nETA: I love the responses this is getting. Yay actual discussion! What we have *right now* is inherently flawed and undemocratic, with large swaths of our representatives not effectively representing much beyond their own political ideology (and, in various cases, representing their monetary sources rather than their constituents). The above is a pipe dream, of course, but there's got to be *something* better.",
            "I don't know. I don't like that we're run by a bunch of fossils either, but I don't know if a hard limit at an arbitrary age for all people is really going to work out in reality.",
            "Absolutely.\n\nLimit 4 terms in the House, 2 terms in the Senate.\n\nIf you're running for President you must be 65 or younger when your term starts to be eligible.\n\nAdd in ranked choice, public finding of elections with zero private donations allowed.\n\nReform the Senate so that states are guaranteed 2 senators but can up to 10 based on population.",

            "It's neither liberal nor progressive to support ageism.  If you want to fix politics, criminalize accepting special interest money; criminalize financial investment above and beyond 401Ks/IRA/s/index funds during terms; institute term limits; decrease the election cycle to a 6-month period; and mandate 100% transparency in existing political beliefs, financial investments, and political goals.  Further, like any job, a mid-year and annual review are required.  You must report to the voters why you've failed in a campaign promise, and how you can resolve that moving forward.    Finally, bi-weekly interviews are required -- with questions fielded not from the press exclusively but from voters.",
            "Gotta be at least 35 to be President, seems absurd we don\u2019t have and end cap.",
            "I am absolutely astonished at the number of people who are saying yes. The best person for the job should be in that position, regardless of age.",
            "I prefer insisting on a cognitive exam.  Why?  My great grandfather practiced law until he was 96.  He was sharp as a tack and still winning case, so he was in demand. \n\nHe died at 99.  He was still mentally sharp but by that time he was physically frail.",

            "Wouldn't that be ageism? Not all 65yr Olds are created equal. This question kinda assumes every 65yr old is on deaths door or something.",
            "Not particularly. I haven\u2019t seen much correlation that the age of a President determines their efficacy",
            "No.  Age limits are arbitrary.  There are 80-year-olds that have the mental capacity to lead.  There are 30-year-olds that don't.  \n\nIn theory, the problem of accidentally electing a senile president would be solved by the electorate... not being idiots.  Easier said than done... but I just don't think age discrimination is the fix here.",
            "I absolutely would support an age limit, which should be no higher than 70. This is no more \u201cageist\u201d than the age 35 minimum is ageism.\n\nThere are several careers where mandatory retirement ages exist, like pilots, and surgeons.

            "I think this is a valid point. However, a system that essentially monitors all national politicians and their actual spending and partner\u2019s spending would be a better fix. I\u2019m fine with paying a senator or congressmen a million a year with extra to account for children along with a retirement that is substantial, if it means that he or she cannot have any investments or outside income. Taking the money out of politics would help take the age out of it too.",

            "A man meets a woman while vacationing in a major city. She lives there, but he doesn\u2019t. He\u2019s leaving for his home on the other side of the country the next morning. They wander the streets of the busy city all night long, chatting constantly about their hopes and dreams.  They watch the sunrise wrapped in each other\u2019s arms.  When she takes him to the airport the next morning, she\u2019s clearly upset. She\u2019s never met anyone she gets along with so well. He offers to stay in touch with skype and they exchange usernames-but she isn\u2019t too hopeful about the situation.  When she gets home from the airport and lets her computer wake from its sleep mode, she notices he\u2019s added her before ever even getting on the plane, only moments after she left him according to the time stamp. \n\nLater that night when he\u2019s settled at home he logs onto skype to see her icon is online. He messages her instantly. Their playful banter and easy conversation flow long into the morning hours. Over time their weekly skype sessions become daily. They begin to show each other their home cities-taking their phones with them to skype anywhere they can. He walks her down a street festival where music and light pour from every stall. His head phones in only he can hear what she has to say to him. She makes an hour long drive to her parents\u2019 house, and he skypes with her on the drive, keeping her entertained with car games and random trivia. She sends him a recipe she found online, and that night they make and eat the same meal on opposite sides of the country. They begin to look forward to seeing each others skype icon alight every single night without fail. They even turn on a tracking app that helps them see how far the other has to go before they are home. They fall asleep while skyping and wake to each others sleeping form. \n\nBut distance makes all things hard. Months pass. Both their data bills are through the roof. He begins to feel a lack of connection to her-the real her. She feels like all she knows of him is the face of her phone. As if the device and the person are one in the same. They miss one skype. Then another cause he has to work. Another cause she fell asleep while waiting for him. One day, though they pre-agreed to skype that night, he never even shows. The icon stays unlit and though she tries to keep her mind steady, she feels the cold hard stab of doubt in her chest. Was it something she said? Did? Is he with someone better for him? One that doesn\u2019t pester him every day? She checks the tracking app. Nothing. His isn\u2019t even turned on. Sending another stab of doubt through her. Where could he be that he doesn\u2019t want her to know? Why is he hiding his movements? He never seemed like someone who\u2019d do that. But did she ever really know him? Or just the online him? Another hour passes and though she tries to keep occupied, she can\u2019t stop checking. Still nothing. In her frustration she throws down her phone and the screen shatters. The white light bleeding black from every crack into the screen. Angry, hot tears spring to her eyes as she watches the grey icon flicker away completely. \n\nHer doorbell rings and as she swipes away her frustrated tears she apologizes to the phone. Picking it up off the floor, she wipes away spare shards of screen glass, as if that will turn back the clock. She knows it can\u2019t hear. It\u2019s not a person nor the thing she\u2019s angry about but, it did nothing wrong. With phone in hand she walks to the door where there he stands. A duffle under one arm, too big to be an over night bag. In the other he has his phone out. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you online?\u201d He says \u201cI was gunna surprise you. But my flight was late.\u201d She launches her self at him, into his arms, causing his phone to fall to the ground. No more devices between them.  \n",

            "Wow. The responses. Some good soon are clearly trying to be funny, but some are disturbing. \n\nLook, it is important to be on good, if not, friendly terms with your neighbors. You will have them in your life for a long time whether you like it or not. \n\nThe responses that recommend short, vague answers where you follow up with questions of your own are the best. You may very well discover a new friend or you may both realize you don\u2019t click and you will naturally not take it any further. But you will be left with a neighbor that is at least on good terms. Remember they may be the person to notice you being robbed when you are not home, or notice the smoke from a fire first, or be accepting of the noise from a large party you decide to throw.)\n\nThere could be a lot of reasons they are talkative and not all of them are them just being nosey or a dick. (They could be genuinely interested, lonely, had a bad neighbor in that house previously, etc to name a few. )\n\nEdit:\nWow. This really blew up! Thank you for all the awards, gold and silver. That\u2019s never happened to me. I\u2019ve tried to read all the comments and clearly the whole concept of community, neighbor, friendship, loneliness, etc has struck a nerve. I hope that OP finds something useful and relevant to his situation.",
            "I\u2019ve learned this lesson a very hard way \nI\u2019ve know my neighbor (56m) for around 15 years and considered him a family friend. He watched me grow up and our families have even takin a vacation together. He was always nosey and asked personal questions but I shrugged it off as that\u2019s just how he is. That was until my girlfriend (20f) moved in with us. He slowly became more and more friendly with her. Asking her where she works. About her family. And slowly changing his personality to hers. I suspected something was going on. Keep in mind he is married with a daughter still in highschool. One day I came home from work and my girlfriend was sharing a beer and talk with him in his garage nothing out of the normal he frequently invited us over for beers and what not so I thought nothing of it. A few days later my girlfriend comes to me in tears. And not of sadness but of frightened tears. After what seemed like forever she told me. That the night she had a beer with him he told her horrible things. That he wanted to f*ck her brains out and steal her and tie her up. He\u2019s thought about breaking into our home and taking advantage of her. He as well broke into her car and was leaving her love notes. My once friendly neighbor went crazy. I confronted him about the situation and he admitted to it and told me I was no good and did not deserve her. And keep in mind he told me this in his backyard with his wife and daughter home. Fast forward a month later. (In this time he hasn\u2019t showed his face since). My girlfriend gets off work early and as she is walking into our house he was hiding in the bushes asking if she was afraid of him. She ran inside and we had to call the police. And for the next Two months he sat on his property line next to ours with a small foldable chair and just watched our house. So the best way to deal with a overly nosey neighbor is to cut the convo short and walk away.",
            "If you're not very open to chat, just keep things polite yet quick. It's nice to have a good relationship with your neighbors. If they do delve into personal questions, just say \"that's a bit personal, I'd rather not talk about that.\" Most important thing is to be polite. Don't be an asshole, or act standoffish when it's not necessary.\n\nHonestly, just use some common sense. Don't be a \"redditor\", is all I'm saying.",
            "Try having a neighbor who tracks when you leave and arrive back home. Talks to your boss about your work schedule and when you're actually supposed to be at home. Asking my boss if I had Covid when she noticed I hadn't left the house in a couple days. The list goes on and on. I fucking hate nosy neighbors, is your life really that miserable you have to worry about STRANGERS?! I told her off and we are currently looking to move. Some people are just bad neighbors.",
            "I had an old neighbor like this once. \n\nIt was back when I lived in a small conservative town in the US midwest, still pretty freshly married and also freshly out my own with my wife. \n\nAnyway, my wife and I would always be sitting on the front porch of the place we lived (upper\\lower styler duplex) we both worked a lot. Seeing as how we were working minimum wage jobs at the time we *had* to work a lot so we could pay bills, and eat, *and* put some money back. So the little time we had to relax and unwind together was pretty precious to us, (still is tbh). \n\nSo a few months pass of us living at this place and one day this very tall, very bald, black man just walked up onto the porch while we're sitting there relaxing. We've had a pretty good amount of sketchy people see us on the porch and either ask us to bum smokes, or if they can have some loose change, or if we know where to get *\"any good drugs\"*\n\n(I only mention his race because this is *very* conservative town in the pretty rural midwest)\n\nWe kinda look at each other and him as he's walking up, and say \"Hi how are you?\" Not knowing what what to expect. \n\nHe replies, \"haaaaayyyyyyy, how y'all doing tonight? My name is Thomas but y'all can just call me T. I just wanted to stop by and introduce myself, I live in that house right over there, *(holds his arm up and flips his hand down to point at a nearby house very effeminately)*, and I just wanted to let come meet the neighbors, and let y'all know if you need anything ever. Just let me know. Welcome to the neighborhoooooood\"\n\nUs: \"oh hey thanks for introducing yourself man! My name is Atlas_is_my_son and this is my wife Atlas_is _also_my_son. That's very cool of you to walk over here and do that, we've only met our upstairs neighbor so far, and that's because I work with him and we have some beers with him occasionally. Think the neighborhood is nice so far, etc etc, small talk.\"\n\n\nHis response to this (to me) was, \"Ooooooo, you mind if I come and smoke a cigarette with y'all and talk for a second? I'll fill y'all in on *all* the dirty details of the neighborhood. Nothing too bad really sorry, it's not dirty, but I'll just tell y'all a little about the other neighbors. \n\nBeing too polite to say no so far at this point, \"yeah sure, come on up and have a seat wherever you'd like\"\n\nSo he grabs a chair beside me and sits down. \n\nLooking at my wife, \"so is you two really married?\"\n\nUs, holding hands and wearing our wedding bands, \"yeah, working on our first year pretty soon\"\n\nThomas, still looking at my wife: mmph girl you are *one* lucky lady to be married to a MAN that looks as good as this. I'm not gay or anything but guuurl if you didn't say you was married just now I'd be trying to get him to drink some beers with *right now*. (Now looking at me, bashfully) Heeheehee. \n\n\nAnyway, I'd say anywhere from once a week to once every few months, Thomas would randomly see us sitting on the porch and come up and make vague flirtatious remarks to me, and tell us how wonderful we were and how happy he was that we were neighbors. \n\n\nHe eventually came out to us officially (lol), and was so happy that we were still accepting of him \"even though he was a sinner\" he cried and told us we were the biggest blessing he ever had in his life. \n\n\nMany many times he was annoying, and I\\we just wanted to sit on our porch alone and enjoy the peace and quiet. But as a gay black man, in a small mainly white, very conservative, town, he needed our support more than we needed the peace and quiet those nights. \n\nAnd oddly enough, even though he wasn't an incredibly bright man in a lot of regards, he always seemed to say something that was incredibly insightful and thoughtful to what was going on with us either at work, or with distant relatives or something that there is literally no possible way of him knowing about us, and he always said in about himself. \n\nHe drank too much and smoked to much weed, but he was always just looking to escape the pain of literally everyone being un-accepting of who he was as a person, and him just wanting to be liked. \n\n\nAnyway, there isn't a happy ending or a sad one. \n\nMy wife and I moved back out west to be near family and finish school after we had our daughter, and that was the last I heard from Thomas. We exchanged phone numbers so that we could stay in touch, but he never contacted me and the two times I tried to contact him he was out of minutes or had maybe gotten a new phone number.",
            "I 'made friends' with my neighbor at the beginning if lockdown. Now whenever I go out front of my house, he comes out. Every single time. Even when we just open our front door, he comes out and just sits. \n\nOne time, amazon dropped a package off when I was working on the side of the house. He opened his window, proceeded to YELL to me that amazon had delivered a package. \n\nI don't go out of the front door anymore, unless going to my car. I just hang out around back and even take my dogs on walks leaving through and arriving through the back yard.",

            "My partner and I just moved in to a house and got cornered by a neighbor for 30 minutes. My Midwest sense of guilt needs to clarify a few things.\n\nWe were on our way to do stuff, this neighbor started talking and didn't stop for 30 minutes. I'm not exaggerating. Half an hour. Non stop talking AT us, not with us. We tried every little polite out we could take. Plenty of \"welllp\"s and \"Damn, that's crazy\"s and even a few god damn \"well we should really get going\"s. I even started leading the conversation into the middle of the street hoping a passing car would seperate us. None if it worked. We only finally made it out of there because it got dark.\n\nI've decided the next time this happens I'm just going to tell her politely, but firmly, that I need to take a dump and then just walk away.\n\nEdit:the replies to this are hilarious. I tried every single one of these things. I have no explanation why it took so long to finally end the convo.",

            "First I must say... many of the answers on here made my day.  Funny people today.   :)\n\nAnyways, I am generally a magnet for weirdos, so I have oodles of experience with this.  The simplest way to deal with the nosey person is turn a lot of the questions back at them. \n\n \"Oh, thanks for asking, but I really need to know where you bought that fern.  It's so neat looking\".  \n\n\"Oh, my job is boring.  Tell me what you do for a living\".\n\nMost of these busy bodies are looking for info to tell others.  They're so bored in their lives they have to know everyone else's business.  Either turn the question back at them or practice giving vague answers that say nothing.\n\n\"Oh, we've been married a while.  Y'know, time flies\".\n\nIf you can't or don't want to talk to them, make sure you have very visible headphones on (even if your not actually listening to anything).  Don't remove them when they speak to you.  Either just lift one each time they speak or leave them on and yell really uncomfortably loud when responding.  Occasionally misunderstand what they said because you couldn't hear them.  If they push it, say you're listening to classes to learn a foreign language for work.  The boss put you on a deadline to learn it.  (Pick an obscure language)\n\nIf all that doesn't work (those extra special nosey people), start feeding them really strange information that they'll sound weird repeating to the neighbors.\n\nOf course, the best remedy is to just talk to them for a minute, then excuse yourself and tell them you really have to get back to whatever you're doing.  Then step away.  But it's sometimes fun to mess with the annoying ones.",

            "I don't mind overly friendly neighbors as much. Giving a short vague answer to certain questions you're not comfortable with is probably best. \n\nThe problem I have currently with a [new] neighbor is that they are not respectful of others space or property.

They let their kids run all around my driveway, play with my doorbell, throw rotten fruit in my backyard. One of the adult men likes to leave his trash in front of my driveway, constantly yells at night. Power washes all of his cars and rv's close to my driveway (all day).

            "Not mandatory, but there was a voluntary program like this in the US in the Depression.  It was called the Civilian Conservation Corps.  Participants got room and board, clothing, job training, and $30 a month, of which $25 had to be sent home (most were single young men, so it went to their parents & younger siblings), in exchange for working on various projects on public land throughout the country.  The reasons for it were both to provide jobs and because the Dust Bowl had opened people's eyes to the fact that the US was not a bottomless well of natural resources.  (Erosion was a big cause of the Dust Bowl, and the Dust Bowl was a factor in the Depression, so it all tied together.)  They were also called \"Roosevelt's Tree Army,\" because one of the big things they did was plant trees for erosion control.  \n\nIn my state, they built most of the state parks, a lot of them in areas that had been deforested for charcoal manufacturing and were marginal for agriculture.  You can still rent out cabins that they built, and they're great--really attractive, and shockingly inexpensive.  (I'm actually going to stay in one next week.)  Some of them have photos from the CCC days on the walls, and it's really neat to look at them and know that you're still enjoying what they worked on.  \n\nI'd definitely support a program like that today, but I think making it voluntary is (putting ethical considerations to one side) more practical--for one thing, you would have to pay participants (just like people drafted for military service get paid), and it would be very expensive if everyone did it.  Plus having it be voluntary means the number of participants can be matched the amount of meaningful work to be done, and the workers are more motivated.  With the CCC, people considered themselves lucky to be picked--$30 a month was an attractive wage, and three square meals every single day was a significant perk--so discipline was straightforward: do what you're supposed to do or get kicked out, and most people didn't want to get kicked out.  It would probably take stronger incentives to get the same level of buy-in today, but health care and student loan forgiveness would be a good start.\n\nEdit:  A number of people have asked about how you rent the cabins I mentioned.  The ones I'm familiar with are in Pennsylvania and can be reserved at https://pennsylvaniastateparks.reserveamerica.com/.  Not all cabins are CCC-built, but ones listed as \"rustic\" often are--check individual park websites for details.  (There's usually a \"stay the night\" page with information on the cabins, and sometimes a \"history\" page that will talk about CCC's role in the park.)  Rates are based on the number of beds in the cabin and start at $35 a night for cabins that sleep four; weekends and peak times are higher, and there is a surcharge if you're not a Pennsylvania resident.  The system takes reservations up to 11 months in advance--some parks fill up quickly.  Some parks allow dogs in specific designated cabins, and most parks have at least one ADA-accessible unit.   \n\nOther states and some national parks also have CCC-built cabins available for rental, but as far as I know there's no nationwide system to find out where they are.",

There is a backlog of people who are passionate about nature and have education and professional qualifications that can't find work because no one wants to leave their jobs.  If the government were willing to dump a bunch of money into funding more projects, then there would be more room in the budget to hire people who want to be there.  No need to conscript people.",

They could only do work that they wouldn't need a qualification or any special skills for, it would be a massive safety issue (making sure they don't drown cleaning the ocean or get injured planting trees) and it would cost massive amounts of money to pay, house and feed them all. I generally don't think it's effective or fair to govern over people's lifetime like this, whether it's military service or this type of thing. It would be much more effective to have qualified workers do the work effectively and have all other people study and/or learn other skills as quickly as possible so that you can cut back on benefits, give them the ability to earn money and care for themselves, and as a result also have them pay taxes sooner and longer which will make it easier to fund the environmental projects.",

            "I was going to see a friend, was on the highway and suddenly the explosion happened. I was a few kilometers from it, I didnt feel the shockwave cause I was in the car with the windows up, thankfully no broken windows or damage to my car.\n\nSuddenly after the car started shaking and i have seen the huge smoke, I was still in shock. Saw w cars in front of me lose it and hit a wall, pedestrians passing out on the sidewalk. Army everywhere, I was surprised they were there that quick, maybe they were evacuating because of the fire? I seriously have no clue. \n\nAnyway, 30 seconds after the explosion, the friend I was going to calls me panicking and couldn't breath, he told me his brother was really close to the explosion and hes hurt badly. Asked me to go to the nearest hospital. I turn around trying to go there, the roads are chaos, can't actually go anywhere. A few minutes he tells me he was able to talk to him again, and he is a hospital near the explosion, he couldn't get medical attention and to go pick him up and take another hospital.\n\nAfter 10 minutes of illegal driving, climbing over sidewalks (thankfully I have an SUV), i managed to arrive to the hospital.\n\nIt was a warzone, blood literally everywhere on the floor, peopl fully laying down everywhere inside and outside the hospital on the streets. The hospital itself was in ruins, ceiling panels everywhere, windows all shattered, doctors and nurses running around in confusion. I locate my friend, he is in bad shape, arm all fucked up, legs covered in glass, a big chunk of his head missing. I convince a doctor to stitch him up quickly simply to stop the big bleeding, put on something on his head, and quickly take him to another hospital. He was fully covered in blood from head to toe, I swear I am  ot exaggerating.\n\nWe get in the car, turn on my blinkers, and full on towards another hospital. There wad confusion to which hospital I should take him, I decided on a hospital further away hoping that people didnt have time to get to yet so my friend would get medical attention. I drive like a maniac, my hand almost consistently on the horn, blinkers on, and waving to people all along the way. There were no traffic rules for me at the time, people got angry but I couldn't care at the time. \n\nWe arrive and the hospital is packed. I hastly park on the sidewalk and walk to the ER since there were too many cars blocking the road. I get him inside, judging by the looks of him the doctor quickly talks to him and figures out what is hurting and what needs to happen. \n\nHis family members arrive 30 minutes later. We stayed until 12am until he was admitted to the hospital from the ER and we went home. He is fine and stable.",
            "After 12 hours my ear still hurts a little, i'm getting myself checked today, the shockwave was really intense, thank God my lazy ass didn't go for a walk.\n\nEdit: typo",

            "I'm Lebanese and I'm stuck abroad because of Covid. I was on the phone with my grandmother when it happened. You do not want to hear your grandmother yelling like she is about to die. Everyone I know and I spent hours making phone calls, texting people \"are you alive\". Worrying when the other person took more than a split second to answer. \n\nWe had ceiling to floor windows in my house, they're completely destroyed. Mom had to stay home alone all night and we were worried someone would try to break in because we live on the second floor. We were also worried about the fumes.\n\nThis is something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.",
            "My Grandmom sadly passed away, while my brother came out safely with a few burns (Thank you all for the love and kindness you have given to me and my family)",
            "There is only one main road standing between my house and the port. Thankfully, I left the apartment ten minutes before to meet a friend, saw the fire, and thought it was something casual. Walked one street away (so one more layer of building away from the port) and sat and ordered some food outdoors. A few minutes later, we hear very loud rumbling, stand up to see what\u2019s happening from a better angle, and boom. The scariest moment in my life was seeing the blast come my way and not knowing what will happen next. My first impulse was to run away from buildings, my friend\u2019s impulse was to run into them to hide; so we ran in opposite directions. And then, glass and pebbles fell on me, and everything was covered in dust. I got minor wounds, and went with my friend to check on her boyfriend who lives nearby. Apartment was full of blood and we couldn\u2019t find him. Even in those moments I looked at her and said: \"You just got the full Beirut experience!\", to which she responded: \"Yes, I\u2019m definitely ready to leave.\" She went to the nearest hospital to see if her boyfriend was there, and found out that he was transported to another hospital further from Beirut. I called my mom, and the moment she responds she is crying. She lives somewhat far but was worried about me and was glad I\u2019m alive. I went back to check on my house, and the streets were like a war scene. People running everywhere and screaming, blood all over the place, rubble, and people fighting (someone parked to get someone injured, and blocked the way on another car wanting to take someone injured to the hospital). The stairs in my building were full of blood stains and screams. Doors on all floors are out of place. Reached the house and it has literally imploded on itself as all the windows were closed. So, the house is gone. The building next to mine had two floors blown away unto the street, with electricity lines on the street amid the rubble. I also lost my car in the process as rubble fell on it. As I was packing the essentials to leave my house, the neighbor above me told me a lady in the building had her neck broken and needed assistance. We call for an ambulance but no response; so we call my neighbor\u2019s son in law. He says he\u2019s on his way. I take my stuff and leave for my parent\u2019s house. No cars anywhere near to take me. I walk for around a mile, and as I walk I see a beggar I always used to see nearby. He asks how he can reach North Lebanon where his family is, and asks for money to go there. Tells me his brother died as rubble fell on him from the building, and cries. I pass him some money, tell him we have all been horrified, and to take care. I find a taxi and go to my parent\u2019s house. They cry when they see me come in.\n\nI am still processing all what happened, and perhaps this is the reason I wrote this long comment. I can still feel the buzz in my ears, and watching the videos makes me shake on the inside. Lost everything, still processing.. still processing...\n\nEdit: Some pictures I took during the incident https://imgur.com/gallery/3h79mKT",

            "Lived a kilometre away from the explosion, I left  Lebanon two weeks ago to visit family. My house is completely destroyed and unliveabe. My two closest friends were my roommates, one was in the bathroom when it happened, the other was outside walking back from work. They were sending me voice notes of what was going on while it happened, these two men are the strongest people I know and getting messages from both of telling me to tell their families they love them incase anything happens shakes you. If they were in their rooms I can't begin to imagine what would have happened to them. They're both safe now in the mountains, thankfully no one I know is dead just lots of injuries.\n\nEdit: Guys please if you can donate to our Lebanese Red Cross they'll need the help they can get, I got an award but your funds are better used for the volunteers that commit their life for our health and safety.\n\nhttps://www.supportlrc.app/wire-transfers/",
            "I live just 2 miles away from where the explosion occurred. We live on the 10th floor of a high-rise building. My siblings and I were sitting on the balcony before the impact. I remember clearly feeling the earth shake and us calling out that there was an earthquake. We rushed into our living room only to hear the loudest bang I\u2019ve ever experienced. My mother, who had seen the entire thing happen from the kitchen window, was hysterical. The moments after the deafening bang were followed by a gust of wind that shook all our windows, slammed all our doors, and shattered our neighboring buildings\u2019 windows. My family was freaking out and unsure of what had just happened. The idea that this was the first act of war was on everyone\u2019s minds. My younger sibling experienced a panic attack and my mother was inconsolable. I clearly remember feeling nothing, my emotions were empty, but I felt my knees shaking. I was so focused on making sure my family was okay that I didn\u2019t give myself time to process. It wasn\u2019t until after I had gone to bed till I realized how bad it was for me too. I had a nightmare about it that woke me up at 4am and any creak or thump in the night had me flinching. My family and I are physically safe, which is why we\u2019re making a trip to donate blood for those who weren\u2019t so lucky. \n\nI wanted to end with the picture I [took](https://imgur.com/a/lBjnJIe) a few minutes after and also link the [Red Cross](http://www.redcross.org.lb/) for anyone able to donate!\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEdit: I want to thank everyone for their support and amazingly kind words. I truly appreciate the impact that my post has had, but I need everyone to understand that what happened to me was lucky. There are families here who have had it so much worse. As more time passes, we truly realize how many lives have been affected by this incident. Many people have lost their families, friends, and their homes. My story shines a light on the perspective of the Lebanon that wasn\u2019t in direct contact of the blast. However, I hope you use this as a small glimpse into what the true scope of the situation is and help in anyway that you can.",

            "We\u2019re physically fine but we are definitely traumatized. This is unlike anything else and can hardly be described with words. The worst part was the uncertainty of what was happening. I live about 1.75 miles away from the explosion and before the second impact the ground was violently shaking for a solid 10 seconds. Everyone felt like their buildings are falling down. And then the shockwave burst all the windows and doors open. All you could see is blood and all you can hear is screams. The scene really felt like it was from a post-apocalyptic film.\n\nOur people have been hit with so many heavy blows, we\u2019re known for being resilient but this is too much for all of us. Just in a single year we\u2019ve been through protests to overthrow the government, an economy crisis with prices of all products increasing uncontrollably due to our currency collapsing, a full-on pandemic with minimal planning by the government.\n\nAnd now with this explosion of ammonium nitrate that the government knew existed and knew how dangerous it was. We all went out to donate blood not knowing we shouldn\u2019t be inhaling the orange smoke because no one in the state cared to tell us. And to top things, hospitals that were accepting COVID cases and injuries from the explosion were collapsing themselves and all the patients had to be moved to other hospitals. We lack crisis management on the state scale and it showed yesterday.\n\nWe all woke up today and we\u2019re wounded. Hundreds are dead, thousands are injured and so many properties are destroyed. With our current economy crisis, there is no funding to rebuild what\u2019s been destroyed (the port included that the country relied on for most of its imports-based failure of an economy) we\u2019re facing homelessness and shortages in food and fuel. We feel helpless as darker days come.\n\nSorry for the rambling and sorry if I didn\u2019t make any sense.\n\nEDIT: I'm overwhelmed by all the support and kind messages; I suggest you check this [link](https://helplebanon.carrd.co/) for trustworthy donation links. I also suggest you send messages to your local representatives to inform them of this tragedy and ask for their support. We're still very confused about everything most of us couldn't get any food or sleep for the past 24 hours. The long term consequences of this will be much more devastating, inflation rate and unemployment rate are already up the roof, many huge hospitals are destroyed.\n\nEDIT 2: For some background and additional info, 300,000 people were made homeless, losses are estimated to be about $5 bn and the explosion of 2,700 tons of ammonium nitrate is equivalent to a 1,100 ton TNT explosion please take some time to understand the scale of this explosion. The story so far is that there was either welding gone wrong near the nitrates or a fire in a stock of fireworks near the nitrates, either way it was mismanagement and it's sad. Firefighters were initially dispatched to the fire that happened prior to the explosion without being told of the content of the warehouse (government officials were already aware for 6 years at least of how dangerous and explosive this component can be)\n\nEDIT 3: for everyone asking about how to donate for the Lebanese Red Cross: download their app (more stable than the website) and you can choose to donate only once, and you can pick \u2018National\u2019 to donate to all the branches and not just a specific one.

            "well in my case I'm fine, I took all the earthquake procedures my family practises once a month in case of an earthquake then left the building as soon as the shaking stopped. then came the horrifying part the smoke and then BOOM the shockwave, I was deafened for about 30 seconds and got a few minor scratches on my arm but other than that I'm fine (can't speak for at least 4.5k others tho sadly :/)",

My workplace building collapsed from the inside, and people rushed out while the building was falling on top of them. \n\nI can't shake off the feeling that I pretty much just escaped death, and it is surreal. My aunt's house got destroyed, and I had to go pick her up. There was shattered glass everywhere, dust, and debris. But the shit that gets you is how silent AND loud (if that makes any sense?) being in the middle of it actually is. All you hear are sirens, echoing alarms and screams of people looking for each other.\n\nI am outraged because of this government and its incompetence. Not once did it manage to do anything good for the country. I want to go down and hang all of them on the streets, including their puppetmaster Hassan Nasrallah.\n\nEdit: Just so you know, when the explosion happened everyone around the world was making statements and giving their condolences, even Israel. \nOur president? Nothing. Not even 14 hours after the explosion.\n\nPlease do not give me awards, if you're feeling generous [donate instead to the Lebanese Red Cross](http://www.redcross.org.lb/Donate.aspx).

The driver was heavily injured and driving himself to the hospital.\n\n3) So many people walking there literally bleeding the whole way. We had a simple first aid kit along with a couple boxes of tissues in the office which I fully used up to help whoever I could before they reached the hospital.\n\n4) A jeep with its trunk open and the back seats bent down. 2 people were laying down in the trunk with their feet outside bleeding a lot. A third person was knelt next to them keeping pressure on their wounds. \n\nI tried to do whatever I could to help but the best I could do was lead people to the emrgency entrance. It was quite a surreal experience that I will never forget.",

My cousin narrowly escaped serious injury when the shock wave hit him and a large sign came crashing down feet away from him. He got covered in glass but nothing to serious. A lot of my family members also have had a lot of damage to their homes as well. My closest cousin used to work at the port years ago and said the deaths would have been much worse had the explosion happened just two hours earlier when the port would have been busier. My family is understandably shaken up and couldn\u2019t even describe how they felt when happened and said it doesn\u2019t come close to anything they\u2019ve ever experienced.

We live about 5km from the port of Beirut. My mom told me that she was sleeping and woke up after she started feeling the ground shake. She told me that she felt in her heart this wasn't an earthquake and that it reminded her of the bombs that went off outside her building when she was a kid. She quickly ran into the living room and told my older sister who was sitting on the couch next to the window to get up and run. My mother physically grabbed my 20 something year old sister and threw her into the corridor. The second that happened the windows exploded throwing glass all across the living room and the walls. It's sad to think that traumatic experiences helped my mother save my sister's life. I am thankful every second that my family is safe, I sadly can't say that to the thousands of others severely affected. Please spread awareness to this situation and donate if you can!",

My house is complete gone, the glass shattered, doors are broken and dust is every where. I took my necessities and ran away, i kept walking for hours seeing the EVERYONE from my neighborhood bleeding, injured, and the more i walked the more i realized how big the explosion was.

My cousins were sent to my grandparent\u2019s place in Kfarahbab for the night. My other aunt\u2019s home is left in the same state. Gemmayze and Ashrafiyeh. The worst places to be at the moment. My baby cousin got hit but is fine, however their maid needed hospitalization but all the roads were uncrossable and the hospitals full, so they tended to her as best as they could at home. My aunt and her husband slept in their broken home, shattered windows opening the house up for whatever toxins litter the air at the moment. They were worried they might get robbed amid the chaos, their entire livelihoods is strewn across the mess. A friend was taken to a hospital in absolute panic, glass was blown onto his leg, he needs surgery. Another friend\u2019s mother was injured, he himself had to stitch her up with the doctor supervising aside because no nurses were available to help. Overall, I am terribly, terribly stressed. I now know that I must curb my hopes to one day return to my country and live among my people. I have to make peace with the fact that, in my lifetime, my country will not serve me well. Thankfully, all my cousins and I have foreign passports and enough savings to start anew somewhere else. I\u2019m pushing for my cousins to come live with me in Montreal at least for the next year.

I felt powerless i cant do anything to help. I triedbscrwaming at my mother to pack her stuff so we can get out thinking we are getting bombed but she just stood there in compelte shock.

My partner was taking a nap in our bed next to the window and got startled with the first sound wave. She ran outside the room and I ran to meet her while telling \"earthquake\". We met halfway. At the same time the second bang reached us. The whole house shook. We live approximately 4km from the blast area; and the whole house was shaking. Windows exploded. Doors were blasted from their hinges. The ceiling shook. We spent a moment looking at each other to check if we're injured.

Or even the right to die in dignity. \nA lot of us of are full of hatred at the moment. We are not afraid of death. It's here. It's shadow passed over the city. I think some Americans who lived through 9/11 would relate to Beirut at the moment. The city is a wreck. This hatred is aimed at the ruling class. The political establishment that ruled over lebanon for the past 30 years. Westerners have a hard time understanding how we live without electricity, or a working garbage disposable system, etc... Trust me, we do not understand it as well. I've been here for the past 31 years. And i don't understand how we still don't have electricity all the time.

            "its kinda unsettling seeing places you know and would go to everyday just suddenly seem so unsafe and disappear. my phone was blowing up yesterday i can\u2019t stop thinking about it- like i had to call my friends and ask if they were ALIVE. \n\nplaces that i would hang out with people i trust (that i\u2019m really familiar with) and seeing them in this condition is sickening. my school is all shattered. \nmy friend and her sister were home alone and the glass door flew off into the living room and shattered the table into pieces. my great aunts house is broken, the windows AND the metal rods were wiped out, my cousin\u2019s house is also pretty bad rn. \n\nmy mums childhood home is also in pretty bad condition now. as i am typing this she is over there trying to see what she can do. even though no one lives there, it has bullet holes from the civil war, all my grandfathers stuff, and is just filled with stuff, stuff, and good memories. \n\nwhere i am rn (beirut) none of our windows broke because there was no power so all of them were open (thank goodness) but some furniture just flew off and broke, and tons of close by neighbours\u2019 homes are wrecked. \n\ni was actually in the south, but my dad, sister, and pet cockatiel of 8 years were at home. my sister was putting her shoes on in order to leave to go to raouche (thank gosh she didn\u2019t; raouche is really close to the sea and to where it happened) and she described that the house shook a bit at first, and she just assumed she was experiencing a mini earthquake. then all of a sudden it hit and the house felt like it was going to tilt over and collapse. she was screaming my dad\u2019s name and couldn\u2019t hear herself from the pressure. my dad sprinted out of the shower- his head still filled with shampoo lol- and screamed for her. he assumed it was a burst in the generator, and NOT an explosion happening not so close to us. i was in the south with my mum, toddler cousins, and their mum. my uncle called their mum on the phone right after it happened because he was surrounded by all the first wave of ambulances. we could hear the terror in his voice through the phone. we were terrified. my 5 year old cousin understood what was going on and just turned red. we told everyone around us that there was a huge explosion in beirut and everyone started to panic. a few minutes later, we felt a slight thudder. my cousin bursted out crying and was screaming \u201ci don\u2019t want baba to go.\u201d \n\nwhen i arrived to beirut yesterday- about 2 hours after the incident- there was glass everywhere, ambulances moving everywhere- you\u2019d just constantly hear sirens all the time. \n\ni was speaking to this guy who lives in the same building downstairs and he said that he and his mum watched this man fall off of his balcony and onto the street due to the impact. \n\nhere is a story my friend told me. \nher father goes for a run at the port everyday around 6am and 6pm. that day, she gave her younger brother. bad haircut at home. he was furious which led to having her father take him to a proper hairdresser. as they were there, the explosion happened and the impact broke the hair salon down- glass everywhere. her father just got a minor injury on his leg, but the hair dresser was hovering over her little brother in order to protect him. the child was safe- except the hair dresser had to go to the hospital for minor injuries. and that\u2019s about it. if she had not given her brother a terrible haircut, then her father would\u2019ve been on his daily run and much worse would\u2019ve happened to him. \n\ni haven\u2019t eaten since yesterday afternoon and stayed up until 5am. everyone i know is physically okay, but it\u2019s just traumatising. \n\nyou know how you see countries suffer in the media and just feel bad for them and would never acknowledge that this could happen to you? well here we are. \nit\u2019s horrible and feels so unreal.",

My mom\u2019s place of work in the city is completely destroyed, and my dad wasn\u2019t working due to the economic crisis. So our only source of income is gone. \nStill, there are a lot of people with more damage than us, we\u2019re praying for them, you do too. \nAnd please if you want to send any donations, do NOT send them to the government.

            "I don't remember the details because everything happened so quickly. But me and my brother were in my room and my dad was in the living room, my mom had gone for a doctor's appointment. I couldn't hear anything because i was wearing headphones, but i could feel the ground below shake after the initial blast. I thought to myself \"i must be imagining things\" but when i saw the look on my brother's face i knew i wasn't. By the time i realised something is going on the second blast literally shook the entire building. I heard my dad scream for us from across the apartment and we left following earthquake procedure since that's what we thought was going on. Once on the street, i could see a massive mushroom cloud in the sky. We were met by everyone in the neighborhood on the street and the one thing that popped into everyone's mind is that this was the start if war. Our neighbors husband worked near the area and she started crying, thinking her husband is dead. All the kids started crying, the others are still trying to understand what exactly just happened. No injuries in our neighborhood, just property damage thankfully. Meanwhile, i was trying to reach my mom... I didn't know where her dentist's office was and i didn't know where exactly the explosion happened. My hands were shaking and all i can think of is \"this is the day i lose my mother\". Cellular networks were down for a while and she wouldn't answer my calls after that, which made me even more terrified. She answered eventually and she's ok. My cousin works in the port. Thankfully he had a day off yesterday and was home. We are still processing what happened and breaks me mentally and emotionally to see the destruction in the city and all the lives lost. I don't think anything will be more terrifying than this experience and I hope no one else gets to experience what we went through.

There's a really big fundraiser happening right now to help the people affected. Thank you for asking",
            "I'm late but screw it.  \nI was studying when the apartment started shaking like never before for about 30 seconds. I thought this was an earthquake and started having a panic attack, I live on the sixth floor and was scared it would escalate before I could get out of the building. Then it stopped and I barely had the time to calm down before I heard the sound of the explosion, we turned on the news and within seconds or phones were blowing up with videos of the incident. I was in a state of shock. I don't think I registered what happened before hours. That people had died, that Beirut was in ruins, it just seems so unreal, everything seems otherworldly, the house that I've lived in for years doesn't feel like mine anymore, my neighbourhood was lucky, and overall, nothing has changed, not even broken glass but everything feels different and unfamiliar. My heart hurts for Beirut, I don't know how we'll recover from this, we can't. We lost so many people. And we don't even have the money to replace everything that blew up in the explosion, not even a quarter of it. I just feel numb at this point. But I hope it will get better.",

When the explosion happened, almost everyone panicked and tried running down the stairs, since its pretty small gym with windows and glass surroundings there were a lot of blood, but I think(hope) they were minor injuries.\n\nSome of the older ones had panic attacks and they wouldn\u2019t move a muscle, they were either sitting down crying sporadically or just standing still with a blood hand, or that\u2019s what I remember.\n\nThe others that had already lived through a first war, took cover expecting another bomb to fall down, or were running to their families, even my parents told me that they were looking for another airplane to strike another \u201cmissile\u201d.\n\nFor some reason the cellphones didn\u2019t work the few seconds after the explosion, I think from the amount of traffic the lines had. That got me more panicked, and I tried rushing to my family.\n\nI\u2019m not joking when I say it felt as if we were in an actual movie scene, their wasn\u2019t an overwhelming bad situation, but the high tension was enough to stress everyone.\n\n\nThe whole country is shook, specially the closer parts, I think some saw this as a sign to finally leave the country. We\u2019ve been beaten down too many times, with piles of trash, the revolution, the economic crisis, water problems, electricity problems, the virus, potential war or civil war, racial(sectarian) rivalry...\n\nOthers just can\u2019t handle the pressure of constant fear of change, without any actual change.\n\nI spent 6 hours cleaning the mess this explosion created yesterday, and still slept with all my windows broken with  a few of my doors. \n\n\nJust a few moments ago I went out to buy plastic wraps for my windows, since the companies said that it would take them almost 5 days to replace the ones we have. And it feels as if nothing has actually changed, which is a weird feeling. Every shop owner is out rebuilding their gates and throwing out their glass, people are out shopping for supplies. Helping each other out for better or for worse. Most will probably forget and joke about this in a few days.\n\nI really do hope this people will have a better life.

By that time i was yellow i thought it was an attack i started calling everyone i know to check if they were ok everything was just pure chaos.\n\nBrothers and sisters freaking out relatives calling us we didn't know exactly what to do until someone called us and told us not to be scared it is not war.

Alot of people lost there home, stores , companies it's an experience I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.\n\nI don't want to repeat or relive this day of asking everyone in my contacts if they are alive. \n\nWhen I got home I had a mental breakdown I couldn't control my feelings and just started crying. \n\nWe as lebanese deserve better.",
            "We\u2019re okay thank god. My dad was in Beirut and all the glasses in our home got shattered but thankfully he didnt get hurt. \nHowever, its traumatizing and surreal. Lebanon was already going through a series of issues such as corrupt government, intense economical crisis, hyperinflation, constant power cuts throughout the day, besides the corona that has been steadily rising. People were committing suicide because living in this country now is really overwhelming. So the last thing we wanted is for Beirut to get destroyed and hundreds of people to tragically lose their lives at the hands of the government\u2019s negligence. My heart is broken. We\u2019re all devastated and shocked.",

As soon as i saw the xplosion i screamed and ordered my family to go inside the laundry room (safest room to be in during an explosion). We didnt make it intime though. I protected my family from the blast, a wooden wall fell on my sister and almost crushed her, a door fell on my u cles wife as she was carrying her 3 months old daughter.

            "I was at the end of a 2 hour journey about 10 mins from home, pretty rural and I was probably complacent because I took that road everyday. I took a bend at 40MPH (legal limit was 60MPH so wasn\u2019t breaking any speeding rules) which I\u2019ve done many times before, probably faster which looking back was really reckless. \n\nDidn\u2019t see until it was too late that a car had spun out on the other side of the corner and another car had pulled up to help. I slammed on but I wasn\u2019t going to stop in time before hitting the cars pulled up/crashed. I was hurtling straight towards the other cars and people who where stood in the road from the other crash. It was like time slowed down and I was at a cross roads; in my mind I had three choices. Continue on my path and hit the other cars and people, veer to the right and go into a field but there was oncoming traffic and there was a chance I\u2019d hit them or veer to the left and fly into a wooded area. I chose the last option, and in that moment I knew the chances of me surviving or not being seriously injured after a 40MPH head on collision to a tree in a 10 year old Ford KA was pretty slim. I just felt a complete peace come over me, turned the wheel and woke up slumped over the steering wheel to some poor man shouting \u2018OMG I THINK SHES DEAD\u2019 \n\nTurned out I passed out from shock or something before the impact so when I hit the tree I was completely floppy and this contributed to me having no serious injuries. The front of my car was completely disintegrated, after coming to I tried to put my clutch down to take the car out of gear out of habit and my foot hit the tree trunk. The tree was absolutely fine. I drove past that tree everyday for years after and you could see the chunk my car took out of it.",

Pinched a nerve in my shoulder, so my right arm was useless. I thought I was certain to slip off the rock to my doom, but we managed to get me unstuck. That was the beginning of the end for that friendship.",
            "Wife was pregnant and we went away for the weekend to house we rented in the mountains. Second day she went to bed early and I stayed up drawing. At 3am she comes downstairs and says she\u2019s in a world of pain and is worried about baby (2 months before due date).\n\nWe head out and there is no cell reception. By the time we can call her doctor we realize the time needed to get to a hospital that has the right level NICU we might as well head back to our hospital. Two hours later we are there and due to Covid restrictions I can\u2019t come in. \n\nIt was freezing outside and they wouldn\u2019t let me be anywhere in the hospital where I could lay down so I talked my way into some room in the lobby and tried to sleep while sitting. Got kicked out of there and just bummed around waiting for an update. Around noon they say they\u2019ll be keeping her for observation but I still need to clear out from the rental. \n\nDriving back two hours and it starts snowing pretty hard. It\u2019s a semi rural area and if they do plow the snow they haven\u2019t gotten there yet. I\u2019m being careful and fighting off sleep. The roads are super winding and high in the mountains. At some point car starts drifting across the double lines. \n\nI did my best to even out but it completely got away from me. Slide through the opposite lane and continue to the shoulder. I see the ledge and realize if the car doesn\u2019t stop I\u2019ll plummet to my death. Have a brief moment where I think about my daughter and the kid in my wife\u2019s belly I haven\u2019t met yet. Felt like a stab in my heart and that second go off the road completely. \n\nFortunately there was enough snow in the space between the ledge to trap my car. I passed out in the crash but luckily a couple was a minute or two behind me and their honking snapped me out of it. They pulled me out of the car and went to get help (no service on the mountain). A couple of other people stopped including a guy who had a big pickup. We dug the car out some and rigged the rope so he was able to pull me out. \n\nDespite Covid I had to be physically removed from both these guys because I was hugging them so tight. I was able to make it back to the hospital without anyone knowing. Told them after the kid was born. Sent my guardian angels pictures and $100 gift cards as if that\u2019s adequate.",
            "I was a senior in high school, and the student club I was in organized an unofficial beach trip towards the end of the year; no teachers or official permission, leaving me and a few other seniors in charge of supervising everything. After a couple hour\u2019s worth of fun, one of the other students came running up to me and said that three of the younger members of the club had been swept out by a riptide and couldn\u2019t get back towards the shore. Me and two other of the older students, all experienced swimmers, immediately went to go help them; my friends got two of the three kids in trouble and started guiding them parallel to the shore to get them out of the current, but the guy I went for was panicking, barely staying above the water, and started dragging me down with him almost immediately. I yelled for people to get a lifeguard and tried to keep both of us afloat, but after a few minutes (maybe five, maybe ten, it felt like forever) I was getting exhausted, having trouble keeping both of us above the water, and I couldn\u2019t see anyone coming to the rescue. I started getting big mouthfuls of water and my leg muscles were starting to cramp up, and I remember thinking \u201cHoly shit I might actually die right here, right now\u201d as the current started pulling us further and further away from where everyone was. \n\nThankfully for everyone involved, one of the students on the beach had flagged down a couple of surfers, who made their way out to where we were as quickly as they could and hauled first the younger student and then me onto the front of their boards and took us back to shore. I\u2019ll always be thankful and appreciative for those strangers who put themselves in the dangerous position of rescuing two drowning swimmers\n\nEdit: As several people have pointed out, it\u2019s not uncommon for people to die doing what I did, i.e swimming into the water to rescue a drowning swimmer without training or equipment; there are a few techniques for rescuing someone drowning in the comments that everyone should learn if they\u2019re ever in the unfortunate situation of having to use them. I should\u2019ve used them, but I was 17 and not thinking straight at the time and almost paid the price because of it.",

            "I went out for a surf on a stormy day and thought to myself, \u201cno one else is out, those idiots.\u201d Before being held down by 2 waves after eating it on the first wave of the set. First wave of the session. Was thrown down and held under and while being tossed around my leg rope wrapped around both my legs and one of my arms so I was probably being held at around 5ft under with only one arm free while my board tombstoned (board tip is barely visible at the surface but floats vertical like...a tombstone.) finally managed to catch a breath between sets before taking another 3 or 4 on the head and for sure just thought...well this is it. No ones out, fishermen will find my body or my board. Managed to get my other arm free and got to shore very quickly and then avoided the ocean for a few days even though the waves were absolutely perfect. There\u2019s a reason no one was out, everyone else was 10 minutes down the road at another beach where the waves were smaller and cleaner.",

            "Tire popped going over a two lane road with steep drops on both sides. My car jerked to the side hard, and my car went sideways.

I climbed into the back seat and jumped out the back door.\n\nSome dude in a truck pulled me out and I drove on a flat to the other side and swapped my tire out.",
            "When I was a kid I was playing hide and seek with my siblings and I got the brilliant idea to hide in the trunk of the car. I meant to leave the trunk barely open so that it didn't latch but accidentally closed it too far and it latched. Mind you this was before they put handles in cars to open trunks from the inside so I was legitimately stuck.\n\nIt was almost completely dark so I started seriously freaking out and I thought I was going to die, so I started yelling for help as loud as I could and was kicking at the back seat thinking maybe I could break the latch that keeps the seat from folding. I was probably only in there for about 5 minutes before someone heard me and let me out but it felt like an eternity.\n\nTo this day I firmly believe it was because of this incident that I developed some minor claustrophobia. I still have serious fears about being in small, cramped and dark areas.",
            "Boyfriend finally woke me up shortly after we had fallen asleep in a small upstairs bedroom that had a smouldering fire. After we collapsed on the floor and couldn't find the door that was not even five feet away, we kept hitting walls and corners and started to not comprehend anything. After feeling like I was baking in an oven I laid my head down on the floor thinking I'd never see my son again and how sad it was to die. It felt like eternity and felt very lonely. My boyfriend somehow found his phone on the floor, called 911. Fire department showed up in what felt like two seconds but couldn't break down the front door. They shined the flashlight up to window so he could kick out the AC unit, which he did. They finally came upstairs and we crawled to them and they took us straight to the burn unit since they didn't know what shape we were in. I'm pretty sure the entire hospital toured through our room since they've never seen anyone make it out and [look the way we did](https://i.imgur.com/kybC6NE.jpg)\n\nEdit: Holy smokes I appreciate the love from everyone.

            "One of my most surreal experiences of my life (I had a lot of weird ones around this time) was riding my bike on the sidewalk next to an extremely busy road at night.  I hit something on the sidewalk - I don't know what - and tumbled sideways into the street.\n\nAs I fell, I saw the road light up from headlights from a car behind me, and when I hit the asphalt, I just laid there because I knew I couldn't get out of the way in time.  After a second or so I wasn't dead, so I looked around and the street was empty.  It wasn't empty when I fell. There were cars going in both directions.\n\nThat was 20+ years ago and I'm still not entirely convinced that I didn't die.  It's possible that I imagined the headlights, but that road is NEVER empty like it was.  It's a major street in a major city.  It always has cars on it, even at 3 AM.  \n\nIt was the first of many experiences that lead me down a path of questioning the nature of reality.",

            "Edit: So since some people want to make assumptions about the things that happened and that happened before hand I guess I have to clarify a few things. They spilt up a few month prior, not me knowing her for a few months. I had known for a few years before she had the kids and I have been in their life since they were born. I was not a stranger to anyone in that house, in fact they knew me better than their actual father. The youngest had a nightmare and ask his mother if he could sleep with her, I am not going to tell a child no just because some of you are uncomfortable showing love and that you care to children. They were asleep next to her, not me. They were not his kids, he was just obsessive and controlling of her. I really didn't think I needed to add a whole ass origin story to this thread asking about a time I thought I would die. \n\nTwo years ago I was sleeping in my then girlfriends bed with her and her two kids. Around 3 or 4 in the morning I hear someone walking around in the room and open my eyes to see her ex-boyfriend (who she had left months ago but wouldn't leave her alone and \"let her\" leave him) walking to turn the light on. As he turns the light on I see him grab a gun from behind his back.\n\nAt this point I'm thinking that he is going to just turn and shot me and I am worried about the kids getting hit. I go to roll onto my back to get up and as I roll I get hit in the throat by his fist. I can't swallow for a few seconds and I think to myself I need to calm down and try to breathe before I panic. Once I realize my windpipe isn't crushed I sit up in the bed and tell the kids to go hide in the closest. \n\nAt this point he is screaming at me and I am barely awake, I get hit in the side of the head with the gun, try my best to move with it and sit back up. Screaming continues, girlfriend is now screaming at him to leave and he hits me in the other side of the head. Once I sit back up again he points the gun in my face while screaming. He finally decides that it's not worth it or something and leaves through the door he broke in from, shoots off his clip into a field across the street and him and his friend drive off. \n\nCops get called and they get him not even an hour later, he is now in prison for 12 more years and I walked away with just a bad headache the next morning. I thought I was dead the moment I saw the gun and lucky no one was seriously hurt. \n\nThe worse part of it all is the kids having to go through it and how many people tell me they would have beat his ass. Dude had at least 150 pounds on me and a gun.\n\nTl;Dr girlfriends ex broke in with gun, hit me in the throat and pistol wiped me 2 times.",

            "My friend and I just spent a few days at a beach shack. My friend just got her P plates, she was super excited so she wanted to drive us home, this was one of her first times driving alone. Being 17 we didn\u2019t really see an issue. I rang my dad beforehand and told him I was getting a lift. He said \u201cI don\u2019t think you should do that. I can come pick you up. I can drive some of the girls home too. I think you guys should wait until she\u2019s had more experience\u201d. Of course being 17, thinking I knew everything, I said it was fine and I was hopping in her car. \n\nWe were on our way home, playing music and chatting, there were 5, 17 year olds in this car. I was sitting behind the driver seat. My friend pulls out onto a two one expressway, from a country road (like an intersection) \n\nWe notice she\u2019s turned the wrong way and tell her to make a u turn. She pulls to the side and decides to go for it (through 2 lanes) She didn\u2019t check her mirrors properly and a large truck was coming up behind us. My friend got frightened and put her foot on the break in the middle of both lanes. We were all screaming at her to keep driving. But she was frozen. \n\nI remember, it was like slow motion. I looked at every single one of my friends, we all kind of shared a moment of fear, like \u2018this is it I guess..\u2019 the exchanged looks haunt me tbh. We could hear the truck horn blaring at us. I looked out my window to the truck driving toward us, I locked eyes with the truck driver. Luckily the truck stopped about 5 metres away from us. \n\nShe pulled away and was really upset. The car was silent the entire way back. \n\nIt was honestly the scariest moment. I am from a really small town and I think losing 5 people at once would really rock it. Seeing my friends faces in that moment... it was actually horrific. \nI did have a moment of \u2018okay, here comes the truck..\u2019 it was oddly peaceful. \n\nAfter that day I have a real understanding that I\u2019m mortal and can go at any minute, oh and to trust my dad...\n\nEdit: I never told my dad! I was too scared... also my friends and I never spoke of the incident again..\n\nEdit 2: we were coming off a country road and turning onto a two-lane expressway, she turned left when we were meant to turn right. She pulled over and tried to make a u-turn so we could go in the right direction, but she didn\u2019t look behind her before turning, she then braked and stopped in the middle of the road, so we were sideways on the expressway!",

I kicked and thrashed as much as I could, but I was so stuck. And you can\u2019t hear someone screaming under water. So many thoughts ran through my head\u2026mostly how sad I was that my parents were about to find me dead in a matter of minutes and how they\u2019d never forgive themselves for allowing me to silently drown as they talked with friends. \n\nI tried one more time to kick with all of my might.

            "Oh I actually have a story that fits!\n\nI was coming home from a party at 2am in 2016, and made a conscious choice to drive through town rather than take the big highway that skirts the city limits. It would add like 10 min to the trip but hey, it was the first time I'd been back in ages.\n\nThat decision literally almost killed me. Not even 5 minutes after that, the 3 lane \"highway\" (really just a wide road) passed in front of a mall, and there was a signal light there. Well some drunk idiot decided to turn right into the mall from the far left lane, and I was in the middle lane. I had absolutely no time to stop so I slammed into the side of his car at 65 mph. I remembered yelling \"SHITTT\" and trying to keep control of the wheels to get the car off the road onto the grass before I blacked out for a few min.\n\nThe airbag and the seatbelt combined had fractured my sternum which took the air out of my lungs and made me faint I guess? But it didn't feel like I \"woke up\" more so like my vision came back into focus and I was aware. But those few moments I was still kind of conscious and in IMMENSE pain. Worst I've ever EVER felt in my life. I hurt from the skin on the soles of my feet to my scalp. Every single inch was in pain and I was like, \"So I'm dead, this is my body telling me I'm dead.\" \n\nSo when I came to, heat hit me cause my car was fucked and the engine was as hot as standing IN a fire. So I was convinced my car was about to go up (it didn't), so I tried to get out but the door was wedged shut from the crash and I started to panic. I put my back against the passenger seat and kicked the door over and over until it opened and climbed out.\n\nEvery single police officer, EMT, and even the tow truck guy, took one look at my car and told me \"You shouldn't have walked away from that crash AT ALL. The fact that all you have is a fracture and some lacerations is a literal miracle\". \n\nSo yeah, that's how I almost died and thought for sure I was dead but got lucky",

            "I was running down a hill after rain when I was a kid, about 8, and slipped and fell. I jarred my spine pretty bad and couldn't move my arms or legs. I couldn't speak. All I could do was suck in air, whilst making some pretty horrific noises in the process. The teacher sat with me and shooed away all the gawking kids while she rubbed my back and said nice things. No idea why nobody called an ambulance. Honestly one of the most terrifying hours of my life, though I cannot explain how happy I was when my limbs started working again.\n\nAlso, when I was about 23. There's an ocean pool near where I live. Man made, and during big seas it basically turns into a vortex of hell. Some friends and I went down there and arrived when it looked fairly placid. We jumped straight in and paddled around, as you do. Then the next set of waves started coming in. On the ocean side of the pool, the waves were trying to suck us back out to sea. On the cliff side, it was trying to turn us into mincemeat. I got halfway across the pool when I realised a friend of mine with no experience with ocean swimming was struggling, so went over to help. I made him swim to the middle of the pool with me to wait for the set to pass, and we managed to get out once it calmed down again. There were some bruises and cuts, but way better than the alternative.\n\nEdit: To those asking, an ocean pool is a pool next to the ocean and filled with sea water. Think rock pool, but bigger and less natural. [This](https://media.timeout.com/images/105649256/750/422/image.jpg) is kind of similar to the pool in question, but not maintained like this one. Think no ladder/stairs to get in, a lot more seaweed and sharp barnacles. In theory, it's a great way to swim in the ocean without actually swimming in the ocean, to avoid sharks and other fun things trying to kill you. In practice, after big seas, sharks get washed in fairly often. You don't know. That's the fun part.",

            "I was pregnant and got meningitis. At work I fell ill and they sent me home because apparently I looked grey. That night my head felt like it was going to explode to the point. I started slamming my head against the wall to relieve it. My husband was absolutely terrified and wanted to call an ambulance but I refused thinking it was a bad headache. Fast forward to things getting worse and to being taken to the hospital and them saying it's probably a migraine. I have migraines and this was no migraine. A quick witted nurse saw how confused I was (couldn't remember my birthday or our sons bday or even how to sign my name) and she took my temp and did a urine test. As she's taking my temp she goes whoa whoa have you taken your temp before? Your temp is 104!  Suddenly all these alarms go off and I can't move. My body felt like I was locked up in a giant cramp-I was having a fever induced seizure but was conscious for the 1st bit. I saw just a storm of drs and nurses and equipment rushing in the assessment room, I thought omg my husband is going to get a call that im gone or a vegetable and my son won't have his mother and this kid in me won't know life. Then nothingness. Lucky for me they just covered me in ice to bring down my temp that stopped the seizure. They took me to ICU and sent me for an MRI and all I remember is them telling me they may have have put me in a coma and do I want my life to take priority over the life of the baby. Sitting in that icu room in total isolation (they didn't know if it was bacterial or viral for a day or two so no one could visit) I had alot to think about and really had to come to terms that I may not make it out of this and my baby may not either. You have to make your peace and stop fearing death and kinda get to work. I wrote letters to loved ones thanks to a very brave and kind nurses help. Happy to report it ended up being viral meningitis. I fought hard and both myself and now my perfectly healthy 3 yo son are doing great. Still have the letters in my safe and hope I never  need them handed out. It was a long road to recovery but I've never taken my health or life for granted again.\n\nEdit: thank you all for the kind words and awards.

I once took it up a large mountain with a group of friends, the roads weren\u2019t steep or especially dangerous but there was danger present because of how high it was. We made it up the mountain with no issues and stopped at bar at the top where my friends got plastered, I didn\u2019t drink because I was the designated driver. Before I continue I need to clarify that the brakes on a STOCK classic mustang from the 60\u2019s era need to be primed before use. Basically you have to hit the brakes twice before they work. On the trip down the brakes cut out and stopped working, I primed the brakes over and over but they didn\u2019t engage. The parking brake hadn\u2019t been working the past month and was going to be replaced that Monday. I soon lost control of the car and we started to barrel down the road, we turned a shallow right corner and saw a long road that ended with a sharp turn. At that moment I thought I was going to die and take my friends with me (they had no clue they were plastered in the back).

            "I almost died 2 years ago. It was the middle of February in the UK and had a late night date next to the canals with my SO. We had a favourite place that didn't have any street lights next to the path that led to a small foresty patch. We went out there so often we didn't really need any lights anyway. As we were on a lock (canal locks are spots where they raise the sides of the canal, make the water very deep to help barges through) I was lighting a cigarette and accidentally fell in the 7+m deep lock full of icy water. I immediately sank as my muscles and lungs reacted to the icy water by tensing up. I couldn't move any muscles, Ive just heard the air bubbles passing by my ears. Mybeyes were open, it was pitch black and it took me a few seconds to even realise what happened. As I was sinking I though well this is a f*cking stupid way to die. It felt like someone has put dosens of belts around my body and kept tightening them.\nI thought of my mom, I really didn't want to make her sad. I thought of my dog.\nI had zero air in my lungs. It's not like when you're watching a movie and try to keep your breath for as long as a character does whilst drowning. You have no air at all to hold on to. I was just trying to keep myself calm and not inhale water. It felt very long, I had so many images in my head but no narrative really. \nAt the very last second, I'm guessing due to adrenaline I felt very warm and strong, got the control of my limbs back. Started kicking with my feet and pushing upwards with my arms. I didn't get to the top when I inhaled water. But I was close enough to the top that my SO could reach down for me and pull me. He couldn't see anything either. He pulled me out and Ionce I was back, I had a massive fit of laughter with uncontrollable shaking. He was super worried and wanted to rush us back home but I said I just want to sit for a little and laugh. There was nothing funny. I was just happy to not die I guess.",

            "One time I was driving back to my apartment after work. I took a turn too hard and ended up flipping my car. I really thought I was a goner. I had hit the curb and I knew there was a hill on the other side going down to an apartment building. I was mid flip and all I could get out was a \"fuck\" before I landed upside down. The next thing I remember was that I climbed out of the car through a window, and had glass sticking out of my arm but I was otherwise perfectly fine. The car didn't end up rolling down the hill but I could see it teetering on the edge. Any faster and the damage would have been much, MUCH worse. When the police and EMTs arrived they asked me how I climbed out of the vehicle, I said I'd climbed through the window but the officer looked confused. He walked me to the driver's side door and the entire driver's side had caved in, the window was completely smashed so I must've climbed out a different window but couldn't remember. The cop asked me how I managed to survive that, since the entire driver's side had collapsed after landing on the edge of a hill. I didn't have an answer for him, it was like I blacked out and woke up crawling out of the car. To tell you the truth sometimes I wonder if I actually died that day, and I'm living the life of some split timeline Donny Darko style. It makes me sad to think my family and friends might have suffered my death in some alternate reality. That's mostly just the anxiety/PTSD/whatever talking though, what really got me is I would have recurring nightmares where I crash a vehicle for YEARS and I still get them. Its one thing to have to experience it once but imagining and living out different crash scenarios is so exhausting I started using weed mostly as a dream suppressant.

I was sitting in the car when I had a sharp stabbing pain in my lower right back. I got out to try and walk it off, then I felt dizzy, so I went outside to get some air and sort of faded out. My mum came out to find me curled up on the concrete dry heaving. I got home, felt a bit better, then started shivering. I insisted I\u2019d be fine by the next morning, but she said \u201cNo, I\u2019m taking you to the hospital\u201d because I couldn\u2019t eat anything. On the drive to the hospital, I was wavering in and out of consciousness and eventually blacked out as we made it to downtown; I got woken up in the car park by my mum having to shove me in my seat. We got through emergency quickly to be seen and I was convinced I was going to die, and told my mum what to do with my belongings and messages to pass onto people. The doctors gave me some painkillers and asked for a urine sample, and it was completely brown, so a blood test was done and it came back as a kidney stone.\n\nI don\u2019t remember much of the days after that because I ended up with a bad cold, and I was in a bad mental state because the day of the kidney stone was the same day a close relative died abruptly and the girl I had feelings for told me she didn\u2019t reciprocate (it was first time I told anyone how I felt about them, so I felt bad for a week or so). I think I passed the stone, I don\u2019t remember much.\n\nA lot of people think kidney stones can\u2019t be that bad because it\u2019s impossible to describe how it feels. I\u2019d say imagine the worst nausea, vertigo, chills, and the feeling of a giant blade in your lower back all the way in and twisting.

There were walking trails near us with a great scenic view of the park below. I was flying a small cheap kite and it got stuck partway down the cliff past all the safety railing. No adults were watching me and so I thought I could climb down a little and unstuck the kite. I was on the side and a foothold gave way, then my handholds also broke away and my foot slipped off the last. I thought I was dead. I fell about what felt like forever, but in reality was like two feet. My feet hit something that was a good foothold. I was able to get my wits about me and climb back up.

            "Three and a half months ago, I loaded some camping gear onto the back of my bicycle and left my home in Wisconsin with the vague goal of getting to Seattle and heading down the Pacific coast. 104 days and 4,000 miles later, I have seen some absolutely beautiful parts of the country. I've learned a ton about myself and grown as a person, and most importantly, I have seen time and time again the overwhelming kindness of the world we live in.\n\nI don't know what it is about it, but for some reason, traveling by bicycle just brings out the absolute best in everyone I meet. From the unending generosity of the people who have opened their homes to me, providing my a shower and bed, food and their wonderful company over dinner, to the drivers who saw me stopped on the side of the desolate Wyoming roads and pulled up to offer an extra water bottle when I was a million miles from a gas station's soda dispenser, everybody wants to be a positive part of my story.\n\nIn this day and age, we seem to focus way too much on the hate in the world. But thankfully, the hateful among us are nothing more than a vocal minority. I deeply believe that this world we share is a kind one, and that we all want the best for each other.

            "My brother did, last June. And he missed out on Kingdom Hearts III, the next entry in his favorite video game franchise that he waited for since 2006. I bought it and I played it on his behalf but I suck at it.\n\nMy brother was also a massive Toronto Raptors and basketball fan, and my mother and I watched the finals and had no idea what to feel when they won. That's the stuff that really gets you. The stuff you knew your loved one would have shit their pants with excitement on.\n\nMy advice for anyone going through depression. You can always die later.   You are going to die some day, the   world will make sure of it, so you don't need to take on the anxiety and   burden of ending your own life. But you can only live right now. So, why not stick around for a few decides   and see what happens? Procrastinating death is the best use of the   skill, honestly. Nobody can tell you procrastination is a negative   quality if it's what keeps you alive. It gives me comfort to know that I   don't have to be here or do this forever. It gives me comfort to know   that I don't have to take my death into my own hands. I've suffered  from  depression and crippling anxiety for about 12 years myself. And  what  keeps me going? It's the little things. I always pick something -   anything - to look forward to. A new show or movie. A new game. I follow   tennis and enjoy that. Vacations or visits from family members. Family   is everything and the little things that you like make up who you are   and no one can tell you your interests are small or worthless. Because   you like them and they make you happy and that's good enough! So just keep looking for the next   thing to look forward to, and hold on tight no matter how strong the   winds of depression become. Don't let go. You can weather the storm as long as you maintain hope that tomorrow can be better than today.",

I was in a bad place around this time last year, and for the first time put real thought into ending my own life. After some therapy I obviously never went through with it, and man am I glad. The main reasoning for the depression I felt last year was how I just didn\u2019t fit in. I had friends in school, but that\u2019s it. I never did anything outside of school for the most part. Lots of Friday nights and weekends sitting at home, watching tv or playing video games with tears in my eyes. I was so frustrated with my lack of social skills, and I was intensely jealous of others. On one particularly bad day I told myself that things would improve, or I would kill myself. Those were the only two options in my mind. \n\nFast forward one year later. Yesterday was my birthday as well as one of my best friends\u2019 \u201cFriendsgiving\u201d celebration. Me and almost 40 of my closest friends got together for a fantastic time.

            "During WW2, the Japanese built a human testing facility in China, which has come to be known as [Unit 731](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731). This was worse than a lot of concentration camps, but the people involved were never punished because the US granted them immunity and attempted to cover it up in exchange for access to their research. The Soviet Union attempted to try the people involved, and the US called it communist propaganda.\n\nThe test subjects involved prisoners, but also the homeless, the mentally disabled, and random Chinese civilians kidnapped from nearby towns, including pregnant women and infants. \n\nVivisections (cutting a person open with a T-shaped cut) were regularly performed, usually without anesthesia. Patients' limbs were randomly removed and improperly reattached to see what would happen, and internal organs were also randomly taken. All without anesthesia, of course.\n\nPrisoners were also injected with STDs (mainly syphilis) and then forced at gunpoint to rape other prisoners to spread the disease. Some of these prisoners included pregnant women, in which case they would either be vivisected live and have their fetuses removed, or the syphilis riddled babies would be born and eventually killed.\n\nThey also participated in biological warfare in several cities, usually by infecting fleas with paratyphoid and releasing them.\n\nThey tested any and all sorts of weapons on the prisoners, notably grenades and chemical bombs.\n\nThey also stuck people in pressure chambers until their eyeballs popped, spun people in centrifuges until they died, burned them alive, stuck people in gas chambers, injected them with random substances, and froze their limbs before breaking them off. \n\nMost of the experiments had no practical application, and were done purely out of sadism. The Japanese government didn't officially admit to this until 2003, and the US still actively denies it.\n\nSo yeah, have fun thinking about this. For more horrific war crimes committed by the Japanese, consider reading about The Rape of Nanking.\n\nEdit: When I got a notification that one of my comments was given the wholesome award, I gotta say I really didn't expect it to be this one.",

            "There is a mysterious illness called the 'sweating sickness' that hit in multiple small epidemics in the early modern era. It was incredibly contagious and massively deadly, with about a 50% average death rate, but it could be higher. It began with an ominous sense of apprehension, followed by severe pains in the neck and giddiness. They then abruptly stopped and switched to heavy sweating, headaches and delirium. Finally, the person was hit with an extreme urge to sleep, and it was thought to be fatal if you fell to it.\n\nWe know almost nothing about it, nothing about how it spread, how it was caused, only that if you got it you were either surviving or dead within 24hrs. There are horror stories of people leaving town on hunting trips and returning the same day to find almost everybody in the village dead, with only a few scattered survivors. \n\nThe worst thing was, you did not gain immunity. You could live through the sweating sickness once, and then get it a few days later and die. Or live through it two or three times, and then get it and die. It was horrific, and we don't know why it disappeared and we don't know if it will ever return.\n\nEdit: I seemed to be posting the wiki link a lot, so here it is:\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweating_sickness",

            "I think this is one of those things that sounds great when you only have a vague concept of it, but is actually a pretty terrible idea when you have a better idea of what specifically it'd mean. \n\nI have an aquintence thats a registered pedophile. That's what comes up everytime a prospective employeer does a background check, when they go to the hospital (and after a point the nurses are suddenly way more rude, wonder what they found out) every time they move and have to basically block out blocks and blocks around any school or public service. Their infant was almost removed from their custody at birth. And this is in Canada.\n\nWhen we were 16 they sent a tit pic to their also 16yo boyfriend. Charged with production, holding, and distribution of child phonograpy, and now they're a registerd pedophile. Its ruined their life, but they even admit its 'easier' on them being female, people are more confused and willing to hear them out. They've said had they been born male and this happened they probably would have killed themselves. (Edit) They're working to get their record cleared, or it may have been before their child was born, but we're not super close and I know its a really tender subject so I try not to pry. \n\n It sounds ridiculous to say you feel sorry for a \"\"pedophile\"\" but I think it just goes to show how buzzwords are used to manipulate public opinion.",
            "It's so weird how peoples faith in a police officers competence changes depending on what kind of crimes are being talked about.  No confidence in police in most circumstances but sex offenders and domestic violence? Oh yeah police never make a bad call in those scenarios cut and dry on to the next.\n\nIf you think I'm just being contrarian, I am highlighting my own experiences, I was arrested for \"domestic assault & battery\" because the fucking cop didn't know how to do his job.  I eventually got it expunged because I never hit anyone, but you all should probably start talking about police reform a little more often than new and inventive ways to fuck over people even more.",
            "Arrested doesn't mean convicted. Surely you meant convicted, right?",
            "It's not fixing the root cause. The root causes are [well established](https://www.thehotline.org/support-others/why-people-stay/). People stay out of fear, dependence on the abuser, inability to recognize abuse, disability, lack of resources, low self esteem...\n\nBasically you could end domestic abuse entirely if you empowered abusees financially and with mental healthcare.\n\nBut mental healthcare is bananas expensive and having to work 60 hours per week if you don't already to try and get back on your feet, or being homeless, is a huge disincentive. We live in a society that puts those people in the situation where they cannot seek help or get out because they lack the resources to do so, and until you fix that, everything else is a bandaid.",
            "I totally disagree with it. As a defense attorney, I\u2019ve seen a lot of the registration system. It is already so flawed. There are so many people on it that absolutely should not have to register. Fun fact, you do not have to be convicted of a registrable offense to be required to register(at least in my state, which is a fairly liberal state.) if you are charged with a crime that requires registration, and are found guilty of anything coming from that set of circumstances, you register. Even if found not guilty by a jury for that offense. And it is much, much, MUCH easier Han you would think to be charged with a registrable offense than you would think. The predatory offender lists are very watered down with non-predators. Once you register, it\u2019s incredibly difficult to turn your life around. No one will hire you, you can\u2019t go to college, and registration is complex, especially for poor, uneducated people, that violation incredibly likely, even if you\u2019re not actively avoiding registration.",
            "I'm immediately suspicious of any initiative that has *no other purpose* besides publicizing bad things someone has done (or even just *allegedly* done) to make them a pariah. Because God knows if there's anything we needed *more* of, it's witch hunts.\n\nThe law exists to *curb* mankind's shittier nature, not *indulge* it.",
            "The sex offender registry has been a civil rights disaster. It's time for it to go, not to expand it. So I'd be totally opposed.\n\nAny time you think you've got a group of people that is so bad you can do whatever you want to them, take a step back.",
            "We actually have this in the UK. I can\u2019t remember what it\u2019s called - Laura\u2019s Law or something similar. Women can call the police and quote the law and the police will answer whether the person in question has anything in their record relating to domestic violence with a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d and no further information. It was brought in after the death of a woman through domestic violence to a man who was known to be a serial abuser but his background was protected so she could not be warned\n\n\nEDIT - Clare\u2019s Law. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare%27s_Law\n\n\nEDIT2  - I should clarify that Clare\u2019s Law can be invoked by men who are concerned about their welfare in this regard as well, rather than just women",
            "What's with everyone's obsession with making lists and putting people on them?\n\nMy opinion is no, not with the current system. Not even sure what this list is supposed to tell me? This man/woman hits people? Every day I commute on Houston freeways I feel like everyone is already on this list. I am not sure why one would need this.\n\nHow is this list supposed to help the victims? You can look up convictions on people you are about to date...",
            "I'm for the abolition of the SORNA and this as well. Those lists don't prevent crime. A rehabilitative approach to crime does. This has been shown in statistics from the criminal justice system and the Pew foundation. Google recidivism rates for specific crimes. Ex felons are a large legally discriminated against group of people in the country.   All these lists do is contribute to reoffense, and further stigmatize people with undiagnosed mental health issues, poverty issues, and addiction issues. There's also a lot of research that suggest that a rehabilitative approach is cheaper for taxpayers, and would improves the productivity base of the economy, but that doesn't put federal money in contractors that build prisons, companies that exploit incarcerated people and their families, or law enforcement agencies.",

            "I was arrested at 17 with domestic battery and charged as an adult.\n\nThe small town I\u2019m from is very tight knit, and most major problems are swept under the rug. One night, my mother snapped and started beating the ever living shit out of me. I screamed multiple times \u2018stop hitting me!\u2019 but no one was around to hear but my step father. So, in defense of myself, I pushed her off of me and onto a couch. My step father then called his friend on the force who came and arrested me without questioning.\n\nShould I be put on a registry?",
            "Like it's a shit idea.  The sex offender list is also a fucking stupid idea that's broken as hell.  Half the people on it were minors fucking other minors who had pissed off parents and similar stupid shit that nobody should rightly care about but the people involved.",
            "Shitty idea. If you served your time, you should at least have an opportunity to turn your life around. Our country is obsessed with punishing people. It's gross. Too many people here would rather get a cheap revenge boner over stupid shit like this than work on things that would improve the quality of life here and reduce crime/violence across the board.",
            "In some states and municipalities you can get a domestic violence charge for breaking your own property while in an argument.",
            "Against.  You've done your time, why should you be on a list that is going to further stymie your life?  If you are so dangerous that you need to be on a list and prevented from owning a firearm, not being allowed to live near a park or a school, not being allowed to have certain jobs, then why are you not still in prison?\n\nYou do your crime, you get out of prison and that should be the end of it.  No lists, no \"Felony\" status, none of it.  If there is a real fear that you are going to re-offend, then you shouldn't be released from prison.  What your past crime was should only matter when it comes to sentencing you if you have re-offended.  \n\nMy sister was beaten badly by her husband after he did some hard drugs and was already drunk.  He served his time, but he's a felon.  So he's not going to get much better than a job washing dishes (he's also a high school drop out and my sister allowed him to not work for the bulk of their marriage) at minimum wage.  How the hell is he supposed to stand on his own two feet when he's got that felony status, he has to pay his P.O. every time he see him, and is required to meet with him once a month, pay for his own drug testing, pay for his own alcohol testing, pay restitution for his crime, pay child support for two children (though one is now 19, so I guess it's one child now), and then pay for things like rent, food, utilities and such?  Creating a Domestic Violence Registry doesn't do any good in this case but to FURTHER keep him down.  So where does someone like my sister's husband go?  In our current system, his only option is going to re-offend and go back to prison.  Prison sucks, but at least there he will have a job to do, he will have a roof over his head, three meals.  The system is designed to get people like him to fail.  \n\nI don't like my sister's husband, never did, and I don't like having to advocate for that son of a bitch.  But we need to allow people to rise above their mistakes and live a positive life.  This system of people being felons for life, of registries that only hurt offenders, doesn't have any positive benefits for society, just continue to punish those who have served their time.",
            "I think registering for anything after serving your sentence is bullshit. \n\nIf someone is so much a threat they can't be within a certain area or has a high chance of repeating, don't let them out of prison in the first place. \n\nOnce you've done the time, having a scarlett letter that follows you around the rest of your life should be unconstitutional.",
            "That's a horrible idea.",
            "Sounds like bullshit to me. Domestic violence is something I got arrested for before. Let a guy sleep on my couch for a while and he stayed up all night on a bender of drugs and alcohol, he wakes me up. He cheap shots me on my chin and I get wobbled but beat the shit out of him. I even help this guy to the couch afterwards and sit some water by him, he calls police and I get arrested. Spent a night in jail over it, the guy had 60 pounds on me I'm lucky he was so messed up because he would have knocked me out with that sucker punch otherwise. The charges were dismissed and I paid court fees but still.",
            "We have that in the UK, it\u2019s called Clare\u2019s Law and you can request information about a man you know/are seeing and the police have to tell you if he\u2019s ever been convicted of DV before",
            "I once had a crazy af gf. This 1 time she got so worked up because I brought her the wrong burger and actually threw herself out my living room window then called the cops and said I beat her. This was before cell phone camera and in my state the women is always the victim no matter what. I would\u2019ve been screwed if her dad didn\u2019t show up and defend me. Apparently this wasn\u2019t her 1st time. He had proof of the other guys with similar police problems with her. God knows how many men would be on this BS registery you talk of. The 1st guys she did this to spent 5 years in prison. Twist to the story is the dad was my boss",
            "In the UK, we have something called Clare's law requests.  If you are concerned about your current partner you can get in touch with the police for them to disclose any DV incidents in the past. It won't go into detail but it's all there.\n\nCriminal records don't get wiped until the person reach there 100th birthday, with the exception of some of the most serious of crimes.",
            "It\u2019s too bad that you only seem to be getting Americans complaining about how bad their system is, assuming it\u2019s the only one in the world. \n\nIn the UK, we have both of these. Sex Offenders must register, similar to parolees, and will have rules they must follow. If the police see a person convicted of child sexual offences getting close to a child (becoming a step-parent etc), they will have a word with the family and alert social services if necessary. \n\nAn individual cannot search the Sex Offenders register without good reason, and there is no requirement to go door-to-door. A person does not get put on the register for peeing in public or for having sex with someone a week younger than them on their 18th birthday. Police can make a public disclosure about someone being on the list if it is in the public interest (eg dangerous paedo moves 101m from a primary school). Registering is not for life unless that is in the sentence for the most severe of crimes and on job applications etc you would only need to disclose the crime (if unspent) as you would any other crime. The period for needing to declare depends on the crime but is not elongated for sexual offences. \n\n[Clare\u2019s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare%27s_Law) gives us a similar system for people convicted of domestic violence. People have the right to enquire about a partner and be told if they have previous convictions, and if the police/social services think it\u2019s in the public interest, they can inform a person of their partner\u2019s history. \n\nI\u2019m not sure in terms of numbers how effective we can say these measures are, as obviously we can\u2019t count \u2018crimes prevented\u2019, we can only look at cases where these measures weren\u2019t enough or people slipped through the cracks. However, they seem to offer a balance of respecting the rights of all parties and common sense says these measures are better than nothing. \n\nSo that\u2019s how it works in other countries, in case anyone actually wondered and didn\u2019t just want to complain about the USA.",

            "In the UK there is a way to know if someone has previously been domestically violent. Its called Clare's Law check. \n\n\nThis is so when someone has a concerns that a partner may be abusive, they can provide their local police with information such as name, DOB, address etc and the police will disclose if that person has any incidents on their criminal record that relate to domestic abuse. \n\n\nThis way people can keep themselves safe, the whole world doesn't know someone was charged/convicted for a domestic incident, and those who complete a Clare's Law request are obviously only given relevant and limited information.",
            "Unpopular opinion, but if our justice system actually went through some major reforms, I'd be all for it. Especially if there was a way to also list repeat offenders. Think of how many people who get out of abusive relationships end up in another one. Think of how many of them could potentially be able to steer clear. \n\nI think there would have to be some nuance to it, but I'd be all for it. Plenty of people in positions of authority (including cops) have been repeatedly charged for domestic violence. I can't help but think they might not be in those positions if there was a registry like that.",
            "Preferably they would be convicted first before registering, but I'm all for it. Please note that I have no experience with domestic abuse and cannot speak for those who have.",
            "In the UK we have Clare's Law where you can request a search for a partner's name (if you feel there is a risk of violence) and see if they have any previous record of domestic violence.",
            "I don't think I like this. Domestic violence *can be subjective. \n\nFor an example. My husband was physically and emotionally abused by his ex wife. And I mean like she used to beat the shit out of him and also have her friends jump him and beat him to a pulp. He has a flat nose and scars all over his lips and face from her. After 7-8 years of him silently taking the abuse because a man should never hit a female? He finally had enough and swung back at her and then she went on facebook and publicly shamed his name online for being a woman beater. If she had called the cops, despite the years and years of abuse and his ONE HIT being self defense, the cops 100% would have taken his ex's side.",
            "Sure, lets take a piece of already crap legislation and expand it.",
            "I dunno man. My buddy is on the sex offenders list because be was peeing in a park at 2am. People immediately think he's some kind of rapist/child molester.",
            "Sex offenders registry are bad and don't work. It is supposed to be a prevention tool but in reality is just an additional punishment for crime.\n\nCrime doesn't get solved with punishment, it get solved with education and  rehabilitation. \n\nPunishment is just the lazy way of dealing with it so politicians can say: \"See we did something, now they are punished more!\"\n\nSolving the root causes is much harder and doesn't show results in an election cycle.",
            "In the UK we have Clare's law which allows you to speak to the police regarding a specific individual to see their history of domestic violence. It isn't a list where you can just search names, but if your sister is with a new guy and things seem off, you can ask the police about him specifically. I fully support this.\n\nAlso, can we stop with the \"women lie\" attitude. Yes, it does happen, but when that's your first thought you are undermining the experiences of women who have suffered domestic abuse even if that isn't your intention.",
            "What could possibly go wrong?",
            "I was convicted for a crime tagged with domestic violence. I egged a girlfriends (now ex) house and sent her some rude texts after she cheated on me. I got arrested after her parents called the cops and she showed them the texts between us after she deleted her own texts. I have been charged with telephone harassment with a domestic violence tag. \n\nI assure you it is hard enough as it is to get gainful employment and live an ordinary life after being charged with a crime with a domestic violence tag.",
            "Fuck no. Fuck these lists. These lists are all bullshit anyway, they're just a product of an obsession with punishment instead of justice or rehabilitation. If you've served your time, your case should be closed and can't be seen by anyone unless you're on trial for a related crime.",
            "In the UK they have a thing called Claire's Law, where you can apply to the police for them to background check someone for domestic violence history. \n\nYou call or write to them and say 'I'm worried about this guy/girl I've started seeing for X reason. Can I request a check on them for anything relevant'. Then the police check the person out and if they've got a domestic related conviction they can tell you. \n\nThey don't tell you about any other crimes or history, only domestic things that might be relevant to your situation. But I think it's quite a good idea.\n\nI think it came about after a girl got killed by her boyfriend, afterwards her family found out he had a history of domestic abuse that she knew nothing about, so the family campaigned for it to be possible for people to check this out if they're concerned. \n\nSomeone actually from the UK or with better knowledge than me might be able to give more details on it, but this is the rough explanation from what I remember being told about it.",
            "I don't think there should be sex offenders registers.   \n\n\nHear me out.  \n\n\nBut I do think there should be serious and repeat offender registers. A list of people who have committed serious crimes that the police can prove are likely to reoffend. And that would include intimate family violence.   \n\n\nBut someone taking a piss in a park getting done for public indecency shouldn't have their name on a list for life.",
            "I can't fully support that idea, I found there are some pretty stupid reasons you can be put on the sex offenders list and it's nearly impossible to get off. \n\nThere have been several stories about guys using apps like tinder to hook up with girls and finding out after the fact they're underage. They usually find out when officer shows up at the door to arrest them. While using the apps it's general expected that the girls are not lying about their age.\n\nIn my State of Michigan if you urinate or defecate in public you can put on the sex offenders list, and there's a fine.\n\nThere was also story a while back about a boy I think he was 17 or 18 and had a relationship with a girl of a similar age. even though their relationship was completely consensual and ongoing for several years, somehow the police were made aware of it and arrested him and he was charged with statutory rape and put on the sex offenders list. even with the mother and the daughter in the courtroom saying there was no wrongdoing.\n\nI see a lot of laws being more like a shotgun with fine birdshot, that a precision rifle they should be. It would ultimately depend on the long-term restrictions and up front punishments that would come along with it.",

You have to pay for years of experience, acclaimed expertise, plus hundreds of thousands of dollars in equipment and software tools, not to mention the hundreds of thousands of dollars that went into the acoustic engineering of the physical recording space alone. People walk into great studios balk at $1000+ a song but don\u2019t realize they\u2019re getting access to close to a million dollars in tools, PLUS an engineer who\u2019s going to make them sound better than life.\n\n- On the flip side of that coin, be ware of eye candy! Don\u2019t be fooled by big mixing consoles. Sometimes they\u2019re not even used for your music. Hell, sometimes they don\u2019t even function. I\u2019ve seen studios where the sole purpose of a large board is to dupe unsuspecting musicians into parting with their money. \n\n- In larger studios, bands with smaller budgets are often stuck with an intern who may not even be getting paid.\n\n- If your music is shit, no amount of production is going to make it a hit. \n\n- As a small studio owner, I only share work that I think will bring me more business. Wondering why I haven\u2019t shared your music? It\u2019s because it\u2019s garbage. \n\n- Billie Eilish recorded on budget equipment at home with her brother. Those recordings were then worked on by some of the best engineers in the world to make it sound like it wasn\u2019t. \n\n- Be wary of a record label. They may offer to front the costs of your recording and touring, but you have no creative control over your sound, where you record, your tour schedule, and usually the label will own your music. Oh, and you have to pay all of that money back to the label.\n\n- Be cautious of studios that claim \u201cso and so recorded here!\u201d There\u2019s a studio in Iowa that claims \u201cSlipknot recorded here!\u201d And while it\u2019s true, Slipknot did record in that building, it was a different owner, different engineers, and some different equipment.

Homemaker.\n\nIf your grandparent or parent gets in-home care, please know that your family member could live in a cockroach infested house and not have to move if they didn't want to. It's not up to the company to give your loved ones environmentally safe places to live, it's up to the family. They can certainly try to persuade, but they can't force.\n\nWhy do I know this? Because I've been to the cockroach infested house where an 80 year old woman lives. I have a mentally ill client that put bleach in his dog's water to help with it's breath. I have a client who **never** cleans his cat box. I have a client who has a caved in ceiling. I've called it in, but there is no help from the company. All they say is, \"There's nothing we can do. It's up to the family members.\"\n\nIt's a sad sad thing because there are sooooo many family members and friends who really don't give a shit how some people are living. Sure, they'll visit. But do they clean the litter box? Do they make sure there are no cockroaches, do they make sure the house is stable and not falling apart? Nope. They say they care and that they love the person, but they don't care enough to make sure they live in a healthy environment.\n\nIt really worries me, because if I imagine my own mother having such a deteriorated mind and there were no other family members to help her, she could live in a run down, cockroach infested house if she was stubborn enough. It frustrates me, because whereas the client does have rights, should they really have the right to live somewhere where their health could be at risk? Where their caregivers could be at risk as well?\n\nEdit: I've never been actually told by my company that I'm obligated to report to adult protective services. They only told me to call them and \"we'll work it out.\" They never informed me of ever taking it a step further on my own terms. I've never been given phone numbers for APS or animal abuse numbers. I'm only 20 years old and I'm barely a year into this job, so everything is new and I'm still learning about how this whole healthcare system works. \n\nI'd also like to add, that I understand that there are different perspectives. I am well aware that many elderly/mentally ill are severely stubborn and won't let you help. I know, because I care for these types of people and hear about them often. I am not disregarding your struggles, I simply wrote this post when I was overwhelmed and stressed from work. I've met many families who care for their families and bless you all who do!

They're called lube techs because were supposed to literally lube multiple locations on older vehicles with grease. And do much more detailed inspections than we do. BUT, the amount of cars that the managers allow to come in and the time frame they give us to complete a car is unrealistic. This means, for customers to be satisfied and for the cars to get done on time, we have to skip certain things. We would do everything we could but would get a stern talking to if we were taking too long. We often would not rotate the tires. We would check for marks because some customers were smart enough to mark their wheels to make sure they were rotated. On low mileage cars (5k-20k miles) we would pretty much only change the oil. But sometimes, very rarely, if it was super busy, we wouldn't even do that. In my 2 years of working there, i only ever \"lubed\" one or 2 cars at their grease points. \n\nSo, i recommend to anyone reading this, to get a dash cam that records when the car is off, mark your wheels, and check your oil before and after each service to ensure everything is being done.

The whole point of stretching is to do the opposite motion of what the muscle does whenever it's in use and the whole point of stretching is also to alleviate pain and bring circulation to the area and regulate the muscles basic systems. So here's the basic rule if you hurt somewhere do not stretch that place find the opposite muscle in the opposite movement and stretch THAT ONE. The way the body works is kind of like a giant game of tug-of-war muscle actually controls the movement of bone and helps with your posture , no one has perfect posture though. so stretching make sure that nobody wins the tug of war and that your bones remain in place is close to perfect posture as possible, which means that your bones and ligaments don't take any damage from gravity or any other force that affects your body during your daily life. I will not lie however if you do have injuries like if you broken or torn or dislocated or separated something that pain will never go away it will dissipate and it will get to a lower level in which your body will be able to tolerate on a daily basis but it will never go away The body can never correct something that's been broken. this should help you be able to search your own stretches online but apparently I need to make a YouTube channel. just thinking opposites if you're back hurts look for stretches for your front like in your chest in your core if the front of your legs hurts you need to stretch the back of your legs if the front of your arms hurt stretch the back of your arms just do the complete opposite of wherever you hurt and start stretching that area and you should notice pretty quickly that it's tighter when you stretch the side that does not hurt then versus when you stretch the side that does.. if I make a YouTube channel I'll make the post here somewhere in the comments so people can find it good luck!\n\nEdit: additional context.",

            "APPLYING FOR A MORTGAGE 101 FROM AN UNDERWRITER\n\nIf you're applying for a mortgage (especially through a broker who should be coaching you on this; make sure they're smart), DO NOT GIVE MORE DOCUMENTATION THAN YOU NEED. Sooooooo many loans I tried underwriting but had to inevitably deny them because they disclosed new debts to be \"transparent.\" I thank you for the honesty, but now you're making me make you hate me. Typically, once it's seen, it can't be unseen.\n\nAlso, do not for whatever reason \"payoff\" a car lease. A car loan is different, we can exclude that as an obligation in your debt to income ratio. We cannot however exclude auto leases because the very nature of them is for you to enter a new lease. So many times borrowers will try to jump the gun and pay off a bunch of monthly obligations, and will pay off a 6,000+ auto lease only to realize we can't exclude it, and now you just paid it off months in advance for no benefit.\n\nAnother thing, if you are applying for a home loan and will be also taking out a credit card from a furniture, appliance, or tool store (IKEA, Home Depot, etc.) DO IT AFTER you have your hard credit report is pulled. Once a credit line is open, it's monthly payment has to be factored into your DTI. However, if it's not on the credit report, and say shows up on your asset statements, in certain cases underwriters can have it disregarded as \"not important new debt\" unlike an auto loan or something. So long as it can't be proven to be a fixed loan of some kind, it can generally be left off your DTI because it's \"not risky enough.\"\n\nOne more thing, don't shift money around in the last two months before applying for a loan. Keep it in one account for two months before applying and don't touch it, or at least don't make deposits into the account that are over 50% of your monthly income. Fannie needs two months bank history, and Freddie needs one but loans can flip between the two. What this means is, if you deposit say $20k in June, but then shift it around to another account in July, not only do I need the second account that holds the $20k, but I also need to see two months of statements for the first account. And if there are any other large deposits into that one, then I might need to see two months of those as well. Anything over 50% of your monthly income often has to be tracked to make sure it's not bad money. Also seeing 20k go in, and then 20k go out does not mean it's the same money. I need proof like wire transfers, etc. The analogy I use is: if I pour a bucket of water into a pool, I get down and scoop a bucket of water out, I can't be certain that the exact same water I poured in is the same I scooped out. I need to confirm the money coming out is the same \"good\" money going in.\n\nEdit: this is the very first time I have been \"awarded\" on Reddit! Thank you so so much kind person of Reddit!

            "Commercial real estate lender here. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government-backed (therefore taxpayer-backed) entities that provide liquidity to the real estate lending market. Most of their activity is for homes and that makes sense - the government wants to incentivize home ownership. That part everyone knows, but they also do about $100B /year in apartment loans. These are given to wealthy investors (I personally have worked on these for one of the largest landlords in the country with over 30,000 units and this individual is easily worth $60B and earns about $1.25B a year in free cash flow), as well as major institutional investors.\n\nThe rates these investors receive on multifamily loans are atrociously low - in fact much lower than market rates as no other lenders besides the two agencies can compete. But we\u2019re talking as much as 0.50% lower than competitive lenders.\n\nSo, essentially, tax payers are backing loans to extremely wealthy individuals at extremely low rates, which enables them to earn a lot more money than they otherwise would earn if it were truly a market system.\n\nThe US is already living in a socialist state- it\u2019s just that the benefits go to the wealthy.",

            "Don't work in this industry anymore but: negotiate the price of your new car before you tell the dealer you have a trade in. If they ask if you want to trade in whatever car you came in with, say no. If you don't, the sales manager is already on the phone with a connect in used car sales and negotiating how much he can get for your old car with them. That way he knows how much more play he has to work with on top of the profit margin when negotiating the price of your new car. Negotiate your new car first, and then when you're satisfied, tell them you are thinking of trading in your old vehicle. \n\nMost people are so focused on getting a higher price for their old car (because its been well taken care of, low km, blah blah). Dealers just cut into the profit of the new car. Ask for the \"on the road\" price (what the total price of the car is when youre driving it off the lot). Never pay a \"documentation fee\" or \"sticker fee\" (offset this by asking for extra $ off your car) Never buy a car your first visit to the dealership. Walk away with all the information and sleep on it to make an informed decision. The salesman will call you the next day, and 3 days after, and a week after, if he's doing his job. Near the end of the month you'll be able to negotiate a better price because salesman are trying to hit quotas to get bonuses, and taking a car out of inventory makes room for new product.\n\nEdited to clarify a bit better.",

My mum made the conscious decision that she would never be like her family and is right there with my dad.\n\nThey are both so supportive of me and my brother, and by extension all of our friends because they see anyone who is part of their life a family.

            "I try to embody this mindset so much.\n\nBeing a dwarf, I get a *lot* of shit from people: shouting on the street, pointing, people filming me and taking photos of me, asking me invasive questions, generally making rude statements about me or expressing weird assumptions. \n\nIt gets tiring and sometimes downright upsetting, for sure, but I *never* want to let that feed into how I interact with people in general. As soon as I am a dick to someone preemptively, without cause, I have just ruined an opportunity to have a positive new connection in my life. People can and will often surprise you, and even people who may seem ignorant or rude at first can change dramatically if I don't just shut them down from the offset.\n\nThere is a line, of course. If someone is a complete unapologetic ass - fuck them. I'm not against standing up for myself and I have had to cut ties with people before, but in milder situations, people have the capacity to change and it's kind of wasted potential to not encourage that, whether it is through empathy or kindness.\n\nI used to let all of this get to me. I would be so angry and miserable, every day. I hated everyone. But eventually, I realised that empathising with people is a win for both parties: understanding where a person is coming from (not excusing it, but understanding it) made me less angry, and in turn allowed for them to not get defensive or aggressive like they would if they were just pegged as a monster.

If the boredom didn\u2019t get to you the isolation would a little. \n\nI was working a morning shift that day and I had gotten little sleep the night before so it put me in a rather bad mood. Coffee can only substitute sleep so well. \n\nNow I had been serving customers their drinks that morning and Ive always disliked the people that asked for really complicated elaborate things. A lady comes up asking for one such thing. And it was a situation where she wanted more of something that would result in less drink in her cup. According to my bosses, we were not supposed to humor those people and legit fill the cup near halfway as a result of the customers request. (This is actually kind of absurd, because anyone who works behind the counter knows their is enough product left over in the mixing cup to fill the guests cup, but we are supposed to dump it).\n\nSo I did as I was supposed to, being in the mood I was and knowing it\u2019s what my bosses would have wanted I thought \u201cnah fuck this lady\u201d and just filled her cup up halfway. \n\nWhen she received it and asked why it was half full I told her that\u2019s what we\u2019re supposed to do. She responded pleasantly and thanked me for the drink. And handed over an origami elephant that she had been making while waiting for her drink. \n\nI think I had not felt so bad as I did in that moment in a long time. She was so nice to me when I had actually been rather mean spirited towards her. \n\nI kept the origami elephant on my counter for the rest of the two years I worked there as a reminder to give my best to people. Even if it\u2019s not much, just remember to give that little bit extra.\n\nI have heard the saying before \u2018you can choose to either be the light, or the mirror that reflects it\u2019. And I think that was one of those moments for me.\n\n\n\nI still have the elephant to this day, in a box of special little gifts I have received in my life. \ud83d\udc18",

Or you could attach them to a Helium balloon and wave goodbye to ever seeing them again as they floated off into the sky. \n\nSo, my hiding place is a 2 part thing.\n\nFirst part is to make copies of the key, these will be placed in obvious, but not so obvious hiding places, hole in the ground, under floorboards in the house, safety deposit box, locker, PO box, posted to me, etc. So if one is found I can pretend it's the real one and wait out the seven days then inform them it's not.\n\nI figure I'd be followed to any location to hide it, it is the FBI and a million dollars where talking about, so the hiding place would have to be pretty good and not an obvious one, somewhere along the way of places your supposed to be, not out of the ordinary. So you couldn't just fly to another country, because this would be totally obvious that you have gone there to hide it.\n\nI would glue some magnets to the keys (or put them in a small metal box with magnet if they have some kind of keyless entry signal). Whilst out shopping find a shelf that is metal, lower down so it's out of eye view, and whilst browsing for my weekly shopping, stick it to the underside of a shelf. \n\nNo one would suspect because I would have already thrown them off by hiding the decoy keys by making it obvious I'm going to locations to hide them.",

Then, as stars formed and gave birth to planets, and as complex molecules came together, the beginnings of life emerged.\n\nAt first, this life was incredibly simple; barely capable of surviving to reproduce, let alone contemplating its own existence. As the ages passed, though, it gave rise to more and more complexity, eventually resulting in beings who could look up at the stars that had birthed them and wonder: \"Why?\" These creatures, driven by something they could scarcely comprehend, set about trying to define their place in world and explain how they came to inhabit it.\n\nThey began to believe.\n\nLike the organisms that had spawned them, these beliefs and suppositions grew and evolved. They incited terrible tragedies and sparked incredible developments, until the day that they finally fell away and were replaced by an ever-increasing awareness of the cosmos. However, the original drive \u2013 the desire to know and understand \u2013 remained, and it prompted the thinking creatures to combine their efforts in pursuit of an answer.\n\nThe inquisitive explorers reached toward the stars once more... and when they did, they encountered other beings, not terribly unlike themselves. There were rough patches in these meetings, of course, but as each species learned to understand and cherish one another, they all compounded their perspectives in pursuit of their goal. A single, interlinked mind rose from the trillions of individual beings, just as their individuals brains had risen from tiny connected cells.\n\nIt took millenia, but the entity \u2013 having come to include every creature in the universe \u2013 finally found the answer that it sought... and yet, it was not wholly content. Through its expansive consciousness and unfathomable technology, it was able to know everything that ever was, wasn't, or would be. It could control the whole of existence with little more than a passing thought... and as it contemplated, it realized what it actually wanted.\n\nSpace began to shrink in upon itself. Stars and planets were swept up in an invisible wake, being pulled inward at impossible speeds and across countless lightyears. It took eons more, but finally, all of the possibilities and all of the many celestial bodies were brought together in a single point, both infinitely dense and incalculably massive, yet persisting at a size seemingly too small to exist. Tiny adjustments were made and minute (but important) rules were put into place... but ultimately, the end result of the entity's influences would remain unknown.\n\nThen, there was a colossal flash of light.\n\nPlanets formed. Life arose. Creatures scurried through the world. Battles were fought, love was found, and an entire history was written across an infinite number of unique minds.\n\nSome of those minds delighted in sharing their stories, while others wanted nothing more than to hear them.\n\nRemember to listen.\n\n**TL;DR: We are the universe entertaining itself.**",

            "It's size compared to it's speed limit.\n\nEdit: The visible universe is 98 billion light years across and only 13.8 billion years old. Nothing travels faster than the speed of light. It would take you longer than the universe has existed to reach most points in the visible universe even if you could travel at near light speed. That's if the universe was static, it's not, the universe isn't only expanding the rate of expansion is accelerating. The size of the greater universe is estimated to be 250 times larger than the visible universe and 7 trillion light years across. The overwhelming majority of the universe can never be seen because it's growing faster than light can travel across it. Eventually all of the visible universe will be so far away that it's light will never reach us and the visible universe will be limited to our local cluster of galaxies.\n\n\nEdit 2: To all the grammar nazis I triggered, eat a bag of dick's.\n\n\nEdit 3: A lot of comments on how the expansion of the universe can be greater than the speed of light. The galaxies aren't speeding away from each other, the space between them is growing. Picture a balloon, draw some dots on it, now blow it up. The dots are farther apart but but the dots haven't moved, the space between them has expanded. Nothing has moved faster than the speed of light, space has stretched. There is no center to the universe, space is expanding outward from every point in the universe. \n\n\nEdit 4: How can the observable universe be bigger than twice it's age? Expansion. We can look into the past and see the light from galaxies that have now expanded so far away that the light they a currently emitting will never reach us.\n\n\nEdit 5: How do we estimate the size of the greater universe? Age and rate of expansion. \n\n\nEdit 6: How do we know light is the speed limit? Math. The faster you go the heavier you get. Accelerating a single electron faster than the speed of light would require an infinite amount of energy. Some people have mentioned spooky action at a distance or quantum entanglement as information travelling faster than light, there are theories that address the problem but that's way above my pay grade.\n\n\nEdit 7: What is the universe expanding into? Nothing, the universe all that we know is just getting bigger. Alternatively, we live in a multiverse, a cosmic soup with infinite big bangs occurring creating infinite varying universes.

            "Hydrogen atoms in the sun don't have sufficient energy for fusion to occur.

            "Several amazing things:\n\n \u2022 The universe is metastable because of the value of the Higgs mass. This means it's stable enough for now with a lifetime at least as long as the current universe (duh, we haven't died yet), but is destined to essentially be destroyed and replaced by another universe. This is because the vacuum of spacetime is not in its lowest energy state and will eventually quantum tunnel into its lowest energy state. After tunneling, various interactions will be very different, some things will have different masses, and generally the emergent structure in our current universe will be replaced.\n\n \u2022 There is a nonzero (small, but nonzero) chance for you to diffract through a doorway.\n\n \u2022 The energy delivered via sound waves in highly nonlinear, nonisotropic materials doesn't always travel in the same direction the wave travels.\n\n \u2022 Particles only actually exist in the absence of interactions (or can be approximately defined in the case of weak interactions). Consequently, the notion of a \"quark\" or \"gluon\" particle (the things conventionally said to comprise protons and neutrons) ceases to exist in a proton or neutron. (Note: the fields are still perfectly well defined, their excitations just aren't recognizable as \"particles\".)\n\n \u2022 There is an energy density permeating all of space. If you bring two conducting plates very close to each other, there is an energy deficit between the plates, which generates an attractive force between the plates. This is called the Casimir force.\n\n \u2022 70% of our mass comes from quark-gluon field interactions inside the protons and neutrons in our body. The rest comes from the quark, gluon, and electron masses. Consequently, the Higgs doesn't do much for us in the way of mass. However, if it didn't exist, the nucleons in our body to decay into masses of neutrons and we would die. Thanks, Higgs boson.\n\n \u2022 Spacetime can only support electric fields up to a certain magnitude. Beyond that, the energy density is so high that the photons produce electron-positron pairs and space is filled with a conducting plasma. Plasmas have a screening distance beyond which electric fields can't extend.\n\n \u2022 We can create atom lasers with a Bose-Einstein condensate of atoms. This is literally a laser beam made out of atoms.\n\n \u2022 Gravity couples to energy, not just mass. This affects the trajectory of light. There's a region just outside of a black hole in which a photon trajectory bends into an orbit around the black hole. This results in gravitational lensing.\n\n \u2022 Tachyons are pathological, hypothetical particles with imaginary mass that can travel faster than the speed of light. Due to quantum corrections, if any such particles could interact with anything else in the universe, everything would acquire a complex mass and become tachyonic. (We can thus conclude tachyons don't interact with anything.) These particles are actually permissible in anti de sitter space though.\n\n\n\n \u2022 Everything in the universe is expanding away from everything else at an increasing rate. Another comment here does a good job explaining how we can't see all of the universe because it is expanding faster than the speed of light.\n\n \u2022 The Meisner effect freezes the magnetic fields in superconductors. This causes magnets in the vicinity of a superconductor to be frozen in place (well, its distance from the superconductor is held in place, it can still move parallel to the superconductor).\n\n \u2022 If we attempted to compactify the universe and make its dimensions as small as possible, quantum degenerate pressure would force it to have a radius of a few microns.\n\n \u2022 The Mpemba effect is an unusual effect in which, under certain circumstances, boiling water can freeze faster than room temperature water.\n\n \u2022 General relativity predicts gravitational time dilation. It is necessary to account for it in GPS systems.\n\n \u2022 An observer far away from a black hole, we will never see anything fall past the event horizon (takes infinite time). However, the one falling in will see themselves pass the horizon in finite time.\n\n \u2022 If you fall into a black hole with mass greater than 3 solar masses, you'll survive the tidal forces trying to rip you apart as you pass into it. Anything smaller has too great tidal forces and you'll die before seeing the inside.\n\n \u2022 If you aim a laser pointer at the moon, and flick your wrist, the dot can move faster than the speed of light. No information is being transmitted faster than light though, so this doesn't violate special relativity.\n\n",

            "My conspiracy theory:\n\nFacebook purposely attempts to ruin peoples' relationships because the drama gets more views and more views sell more ads. Several years ago they introduced a feature so that your comments on other pages would show up in your friends' feeds. So if you're secretly an atheist and you comment on some atheist page, it shows up in your devout Southern Baptist Grandma Muriel's timeline, even though it's a conversation that has nothing to do with her and there's no reason for it to be. As a result, Facebook \"outs\" you to your family, and Grandma is typing away at all the evil Satanists trying to corrupt her grandson. And if you comment on a public post, it's unavoidable. You used to be able to control who could see your comments even on public posts by other pages, but at the same time Facebook introduced their \"tattletale\" feature, they took that ability away. Now if they were to stumble across the same page they'd be able to see your comment, but after that change, Facebook started pointing everybody you know directly to it. Not to mention, the privacy settings are difficult to find, difficult to understand, and with each passing year gives you less and less control over who sees what.\n\nBy forcibly combining everybody's social circles, Facebook is trying to generate conflict. They want to generate conflict because the conflict happens *on Facebook*, which means people logging on to Facebook more often and seeing more ads. They're essentially an internet tabloid except instead of showcasing the personal drama of celebrities for clicks and sales, they're doing it to *you* instead. Ever notice how the vast majority of family drama, relationship fights, etc. these days happens on Facebook? That's by design. Facebook is literally destroying the social fabric to make a buck.

            "That William Shakespeare never wrote any of the works that have been attributed to him.  I don't think I believe the theory 100%, but the lack of evidence to support him as a writer is amusing.  \n\n- William Shakespeare was born, lived, and died in a small town, that consisted of not much more than sheep farmers.  His father made sheep skin gloves. \n Certainly not the life that would have contributed to the knowledge of the many royal topics of Shakespeare's works.  Surely the true author of Shakespeare's works would have had the means to travel, and learn of all the worldly topics that his works were based on.\n\n- We do know that he did own the Globe theatre, and that he did work there as an actor.\n\n- There is no record of his attendance at any schools.\n\n- He was raised in an illiterate household, both of his parents signed all legal documents with a mark (a sign of illiteracy).\n\n- There are 6 surviving signatures of Shakespeare, all of them look as if a 4 year old wrote them.  They were all most assuredly written by an illiterate person.  All of the signatures were found on documents such as a mortgage contract, and his will.  \n\n- There are no surviving original written literary works written by Shakespeare.  There are no surviving personal letters written by him.  Surely a letter written from Shakespeare would be coveted as prized possession, surely destined to survive to the present day.  ([Mozart's handwritten letters professing his desire to poop on his cousin's face](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozart_and_scatology#Letters) have survived to this present day, but not a single letter written by William Shakespeare).\n\n- The only surviving written documents, written in his hand, were his Will, and few other small pieces.  All pieces of his writing that have been found were all written in 'secretary hand', a very basic form of writing, typically used by poorly educated people.\n\n- There are no surviving official documents that recall him as being a writer in any way.  All official documents state that he was a businessman, and a real estate owner.\n\n- Shakespeare's will made no mention of any assets related to writings, books, or anything of that nature.  \n\nAll these facts paint a picture of a scenario where someone paid William Shakespeare to use him as a pseudonym for their own writings, and perhaps used his position as the owner of a theatre as their own personal venue.  \n\nThe best theory about the true authorship was Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford.  He was well known to be a gifted poet, and playwright.  He was also known to sponsor companies of actors, and he was a patron of some of the most well known theatres.  Oxford would not have been at liberty to write about the topics found in Shakespeare's works.  \n\nThe only compelling evidence that I've heard from Shakespeare supporters are anecdotes written years after his death, by people who knew Shakespeare, and referring to him as a writer.  I don't find this compelling at all.  If Shakespeare made an arrangement to act as the author of someone else's works, surely such an arrangement would require Shakespeare lie to everyone.  I'm certain that all his friends \"thought\" he was a writer.\n\n",

So the theory is that the \"free love, lots of drugs\" movement they inspired was done intentionally to distract the youth from a full scale revolution. The thought was if the angry youth of the mid-to-late 60's were too high and getting laid all the time they would stop caring as much about societal ills and then basically sleepwalk through the 70's, which they did.\n\nI stumbled upon this when I was reading up on Jim Morrison and how his father was the one who called in the fake strike at the Gulf of Tonkin that kicked off the Vietnam War, and which was shown later to have been a false flag. Turns out, a lot of his contemporaries were also children of highly placed military people with ties to intelligence. Strange that they all wound up in Laurel Canyon as part of the same movement.",

            "What \u2018the authorities\u2019 say: Mick Jagger is simply an iconic rock and roll star and nothing more.\n\n**Theory from /u/RamsesThePigeon:**\n\nThe song \"Tik Tok,\" as performed by Ke$ha, was written by a guy named Benny Blanco. Its lyrics include the line \"We kick them to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger.\"\n\nThat's a little bit strange, right? Mick Jagger wasn't exactly at the height of his attractiveness when the piece in question came out. Stranger still, it wasn't the only popular song to paint the man in a pleasant light: \"Moves Like Jagger,\" performed by Maroon 5, was released at around the same time, and Benny Blanco also had a hand in writing that one.\nThis is where things start to get creepy.\n\nThe song \"The Time (Dirty Bit),\" as performed by the Black Eyed Peas, features the following phrase: \"All these girls, they like my swagger, they calling me Mick Jagger, I be rolling like a Stone.\" It was written by John DeNicola, who used to produce the music for a band called Kara's Flowers... although you might know them better by their current name of Maroon 5.\nThe song \"Heart and Soul,\" as performed by The Jonas Brothers, contains a verse that ends with \"Making mistakes, but that won\u2019t matter, if you can swag like old Mick Jagger.\" Antonina Armato wrote the piece, and she is managed by Downtown Music Publishing. Care to guess who else they manage? (Here's a hint: It rhymes with \"balloon hive.\")\n\nThis web of connections extends all throughout the recording industry, but one thing remains unclear: What's the link back to Mick Jagger himself? There must be something, because if you have a look at Google Trends, you'll see that his popularity spiked with the release of each song. The only time in recent memory when it has been higher is during a period in March of 2014, when his girlfriend died. Some people have suggested that the man's name is just easy to rhyme with \"swagger,\" but popular usage of the word (in reference to something other than a walking gait) came about after the aforementioned songs had hit the airwaves.\n\nIn other words, \"Jagger\" prompted \"swagger,\" not the other way around.\n\nWhy does there seem to be a cabal of artists trying to artificially inflate the performer's appeal and popularity? What benefit is there in promoting an aging rock star? Who is actually behind this odd trend?\n\nIn order to answer those questions, we need to turn to Vivendi. This is a company which owns a lot of stuff. Their subsidiaries include DailyMotion, UbiSoft, GameLoft... and the Universal Music Group. The Rolling Stones signed to Universal Music in 2008. In 2010, all of the songs listed above were released.\nLook at those Google trends again. 2008 marked Mick Jagger's lowest ever dip in popularity, and the slump continued until February of 2010 (right after \"Tik Tok\" became the most popular song on the radio). In September of that same year, The Rolling Stones re-released their rare concert movie, securing the number one spot on four different countries' charts - the US and the UK being two of them - second place on four more, and a Double Platinum certification in Canada.\n\nStrangely enough, though, the only other place (besides the United States) where Platinum status was achieved was in France... which is where Vivendi is located.\n\nWhat if all of this was carefully planned and executed?\n\nWhat if there's a shadowy organization that's intent on promoting Mick Jagger for their own profit?\nWhat if I made all of this up on a whim, and just found whatever tenuous evidence I could to support it?\n\nTL;DR: Mick Jagger is a puppet of the recording industry.",

            "Credit to /u/BreizhMac for this outstanding post on the Titanic/Olypmic Conspiracy. [/u/BreizhMac post in other Conspiracy thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5f74iu/level_headed_people_of_reddit_what_is_a/)\n\n**The Titanic/Olympic conspiracy**. \n\nIt has credibility because there is photographic evidence. It's really one of the only conspiracy theories I put much belief in.\n\nThe sister ships (and their third counterpart, the Britannic) were owned by White Star Line. The Olympic was put into service in June, 1911. She collided with another ship, the HMS Hawke, in September of 1911 and both ships were badly damaged. The accident was a financial disaster for White Star Line, as they were found to be liable for the accident and had to pay for the damages to both ships and legal fees for court cases associated with the accident. Repairs on the Olympic took nearly two months and parts intended for the Titanic, which was still being built during this time, had to be given to the Olympic instead. Only a few weeks after being returned to service, the Olympic suffered another minor incident where one of the propellers broke off and pieces intended for the Titanic were once again cannibalized.\n\nAt this point, the Olympic was looking like more and more of a money-drain for the White Star Line, though its achievement in not actually sinking despite a major accident that should have sunk it cemented the Olympic-class liner's reputation as \"unsinkable\", but I'll get back to that in a moment.\n\nThe Titanic was finally finished and ready to leave port on her maiden voyage on April 10, 1912, having been delayed while new parts were made and delivered to replace the ones needed for the Olympic, and from there we all know the story. She went first to France, and then to Ireland, and then began her trek across the Atlantic to New York, during which she struck an iceberg and after nearly two hours, sank, taking 1,500 souls with her to a cold, watery grave that would not be seen again by human eyes for nearly a hundred years.\n\nThe Olympic went on to have a 24-year career as a successful ocean liner. She served during World War 1 where she earned the nickname Old Reliable for her impenetrable hull, and then in 1919 she was re-outfitted to be a civilian passenger ship and served as an ocean liner until 1935, when she was retired from the fleet. Her ownership changed hands several times and she was eventually dismantled and sold for scrap metal.\n\nBut what if it wasn't the Titanic that sank? What if it was actually the Olympic? What if it was a ploy to remove a faulty ship that was costing them more money than she was bringing in for White Star Line and cash in on her million-pound insurance policy?\n\nSo here is the conspiracy theory. At some point after the Titanic was completed, they switched the identities of the ships. The new \"Titanic\" was actually the Olympic and the \"Olympic\" was actually the brand-spanking-new Titanic, fresh from the construction yard with zero problems and zero history. They intended for the \"Titanic\" to suffer some sort of failure that would result in the destruction of the problem ship so they could collect the insurance money. I doubt they intended to also cause the deaths of 1,500 people; the events that transpired which led to the sinking of the \"Titanic\" possibly happened purely by chance and the iceberg wasn't part of their plan (i.e., they didn't hire the captain to specifically ram the iceberg to sink the ship or anything like that). They probably had another plan involving the repairs that had already been made on the ship when it collided with the HMS Hawke.\n\nIn any case, it wasn't really the Titanic that left port on April 10, 1912 -- it was the Olympic.\n\nAfter the sinking of the \"Titanic,\" White Star Line received a tidy sum of \u00a31,000,000 in insurance money (or \u00a389,289,575 in today's money). This, of course, ruined the insurer, Lloyd's of London. There's an additional conspiracy theory that American financier and banker J. P. Morgan was in on this whole scheme; his company, J. P. Morgan & Co., financed the International Mercantile Marine Company in the hopes of becoming rich off of sea travel, but this turned out to be a bad investment because of the unpredictable nature of sea travel and travelers themselves. J. P. Morgan or one of his associates may have schemed with White Star Line, who was a subsidiary of this IMMC, in order to bankrupt the IMMC and allow J. P. Morgan & Co. to withdraw from the IMMC without breaking a contract. I cannot provide evidence for this beyond speculation.\n\nHowever, I can provide evidence that backs up my claim that the two ships were switched and it was the Olympic who sank, not the Titanic.\n\nThis is an image of the RMS Olympic in drydock (I am currently unable to locate a picture of the Olympic while under construction with the name clear so you can be sure it definitely is the Olympic -- I can only assume such a photo doesn't exist):\n\nhttp://www.greatships.net/scans/PC-OL35.jpg\n\nCheck out the very top row of portholes in the white railing. Count them. Look closely at the grouping of the last five portholes and how they are clustered with two close together, one set apart, and two more close together.\n\nThis is an image of the RMS Titanic being built:\n\nhttp://cdn.history.com/sites/2/2014/01/titanic-bow-construction.jpg\n\nLook at the top-most portholes in the railing on the Titanic. Count them too. Look at the last five portholes and see that they are evenly spaced apart.\n\nThis is a picture of the \"Titanic\" before leaving on its maiden voyage. Check out the portholes in question:\n\nhttps://timmyatt.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/titanic-harbour.jpg\n\nHere is the \"Olympic\" in New York after the sinking of the \"Titanic\":\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Olympic_in_New_York_cropped.jpg/1280px-Olympic_in_New_York_cropped.jpg\n\nThere is no reason why the ship builders would have changed the portholes on the Titanic when they were nearly done building it. That piece was not one of the pieces cannibalized from the Titanic to repair the Olympic that would have needed to be replaced by a different piece. The only answer is that the ship in the final picture, which is the ship that left port on April 10, 1912, and was met with a terrible fate near Newfoundland, was not the Titanic, but actually the Olympic. You can find pictures from newspapers further supporting this, as they clearly show the name of the ship and the wrong number/orientation of portholes.\n\nI doubt we'll ever know one way or another, since the wreck at the bottom of the Atlantic is quickly being covered with sediment and will be completely buried and inaccessible soon and pieces of the ship that was retired in 1935 and dismantled in 1937 are both difficult to find and difficult to authenticate, and anybody who might be able to either confirm or deny this theory are all dead.",

Using a private investigator they revealed evidence in the crime scene that made it clear it was a double homicide.

            "I don't watch the \"historical\" shows that purport that Hitler escaped to Argentina instead of killing himself in his  Fuhrerbuker. However, there is A LOT of circumstantial evidence that can line up one after the other to possibly link him, or someone else escaping to Argentina. \n\nNow of course I believe the historical record. Hitler was very sick, crazy etc... and ordered Germany to burn, as it was clearly not meant to win the war. He wanted to be the captain to go down the ship. He wanted his body burned so the Soviets couldn't parade it throw Berlin and then cart it off to Moscow. Hitler knew what happened to Mussolini and his body, and didn't want the same fate. \n\nBUT there is some interesting evidence to suggest he escaped. A lot of theorists overlook this chain of events for some reason and go for more extreme and less plausible escape methods. But here is mine, based off actual FACT.  \n\n*  April 26, 1945 Hanna Ritsch a female test pilot somehow manages to land her small plane on a highway outside of the Fuhrer bunker, as Soviet Red Army soldiers are shooting at the plane, and as the Soviet Air Force has a ring around the city. During the later part of the Battle of Berlin. Some how she makes it in. What was her mission? \n\n* Her mission was to bring the new head of the Luftwaffe Robert Ritter von Greim to Berlin to be officially given his orders and appointment as head of the Air Force after Hermann Goering had been sacked by Hitler for what Hitler believed was an attempted coup to take over as the new Fuhrer and run Germany from his Alpine retreat. \n\nTo me this seems an extreme measure to appoint someone as the head of an Air Force that practically only existed in name. \n\nVon Greim was slightly wounded on landing. Greim and Ritsch spend a day in a half in the bunker.\n\n* April 28, 1945. The pair are given cyanide capsules and a new aircraft. Room is made for them to take off of one of the main axis highways. They fly north. Before they depart a third person supposidly joined them in their aircraft. A man in a German Army (Heer) officers uniform with a trench coat pulled up and collar practically covering his face, and his officers slouch hat pulled down as low as possible. No one got a good look as to who it was. All military officials were accounted for in the bunker. \n\n* Greim is said to have been dropped off in Flensburg, the soon to be new head of the Nazi Government in the far North of Germany. But Hanna did not stay long and flew for Denmark and or Norway (no official records but eyewitness reports). Denmark and Norway were completely still under Nazi Occupation and had U-Boat bases still in operation. A few days later Hanna Ritsch flies back to Flensburg and that's where she surrenders with the rest of the Nazi Government a few weeks after the war had officially ended. \n\n* Around this time in early May, a few days later, and a few days before the end of the war two U-Boats left for Argentina: U-530 and U-977. Both U-Boats surrendered not far off the Argentine coast on July 10, 1945 two months after the war in Europe had ended.\n\n* One of the U-Boats was fitted for passengers and cargo. Some of the official documents and log books were destroyed and never recovered. The crew of the boats plead ignorant of the end of the war, but had differing stories of why they were going to Argentina. \n\n* So this shows an escape route to Argentina for Hitler, had he chose it. \n\n* Now we must not forget Martin Bormann (The head of the Nazi Chancellery / party Secretary and confidant to Hitler) had been funneling Nazi funds to Argentina for years, even before the war. Argentina was only neutral in name, but financially and politically allied with the Nazis.  \n\nFor many years people thought it was Bormann who escaped Berlin and not Hitler. However, Bormann was purported to have been witnessed dying in the attempted breakout of the bunker / chanery area, along with the head of the Hitler Youth Artur Axmann. The bodies were dumped in a shallow grave. The myth continued, but many years ago DNA evidence confirmed that Bormann did die in the Battle of Berlin. \n\n* Soviet blunders. There was a corpse of one of Hitler's body doubles shot in between the eyes lying in the street. The Red Army thought it was Hitler at first, but upon further analysis by SMERSH / NKVD the body was not Hitler but his double... the bullet hole was from a German rifle. Interesting? Hitler's remains were burned, and charred, but not enough gasoline was found to immolate the remains, so some bits remained like the jaw and bits of skull. These remains were shipped around over years. Recently an American team was allowed to exam a piece of the skull and the couch where Hitler shot himself in Moscow. The skull fragment with an exit wound was that of a female in her late 20s / early 30s. So possibly Hitler's brief wife / long time mistress, Eva Hitler (nee' Braun) but she supposedly bit a cyanide capsule and did not die of a gun shot wound according to the historical record. The blood on the couch also proved to be female, without a trace of male blood. Rewind, in the 1970s the rest of Hitler's remains were further cremated and either dumped in the Elba or Oder River (even the Soviets weren't sure which) so as he could not be mad a martyr and so he didn't have a final resting place. Sounds a little suspicious. \n\n* The vast majority of the survivors of the bunker who were interrogated were loyal to Hitler and were close subjects. They were mostly SS personnel or loyal maids and secretaries. And all had slightly different stories. Their stories are by far biased. Of course they could lie for Hitler! The only really credible witness to suggest Hitler was in the bunker around the time he died was Siegfried Knappe who I believe was a Major in the Army at the time and was briefly at a command meeting in the Fuhrer bunker because he was aiding the commander of the Berlin military defenses General Weidling. I have read his book and he seems a credible source, and he talks of how outraged and unhinged Hitler was. This was just an Army soldier doing his duty, and was not a political person who was associated with the party. But that's 1, out of dozens of reports that is possibly unbiased. \n\n\nSo as you can see there is something there. Some very coincidental evidence to suggest Hitler could have escaped to Argentina. But in reality he probably did kill himself in the bunker, although Eva Hitler may have killed herself differently. ",

            "I was in a large multi-floor bookstore, walking down a flight of stairs, when I heard a phone ring. A salesclerk answered it:\n\n\"Self-help, may I help you?\"\n\nThat seemed like the funniest thing in the world to me, and I burst out laughing - not just one chuckle, but sustained laughter that made people start to look at me. *That* seemed even more absurd, so I rushed to a new section, but still laughing and attracting more attention, so I sped up more, laughing harder, attracting new attention in every new location, until eventually I ran a half circuit of the floor and took refuge under the stairs I had come down, so that I could compose myself.",
            "I was in an SAT class and we were going over practice questions.  The instructor read out \u201ca group of spoon collectors...\u201d and I began laughing so hard and for so long that I had to leave the classroom.  I\u2019m over it now but it was troubling.",
            "Sometime in the mid-to-late aughts, my husband was on the phone with iRobot customer support regarding our Roomba. \n\nI was in another room, but I could hear his side of the conversation clearly, and I could tell he wasn\u2019t getting the results he\u2019d hoped for. As he got more frustrated, he blurted out, \u201cI\u2019ve had problems with this robot since the day I brought it home.\u201d\n\nSomething about that particular phrase just hit me hard. I immediately started laughing, and couldn\u2019t stop. I was still laughing when he got off the phone. Understandably, he wanted to know what was wrong with me. Through maniacal laughter, I parroted the phrase back to him, which had something of a feedback loop effect on my laughter. \n\nIt\u2019s been over a decade, but thinking of that phrase still makes me giggle.",
            "A few weeks back I was taking a shower and I looked at my foot and it just looked so stupid that I started laughing and couldn't stop.

            "Misheard an episode of Octonauts about the coconut crab. \nThe phrase \"astronaut crabs\" conjured simultaneous images of crabs in spacesuits and also giant crabs cracking open astronauts with their claws, and I absolutely lost it.

We still talk about it, but it will never be quite as funny as when my brain caught me by surprise.",
            "I legit almost died I'm pretty sure playing a video game.\n\nOne of my wife's favorite games is Shenmue. Originally released on the Dreamcast in 1999 it plays like an early prototype for games like Yakuza or Sleeping Dogs, but it was very crude by any modern standard. It's quite bad I would say in fact, but in a \"so bad it's good\" sorta way, which is very rare for video games.\n\nThey put out a remaster a couple years ago and she had me play through it while she watched. She wanted to see what I thought of it.\n\nThe plot revolves around the main character investigating his father's murder. He does this mostly by wandering around town and just asking random people on the street questions hoping it will somehow help. At one point he gets a lead that something might be going on at the docks. The main character, who isn't too bright, thinks \"Hey, sailors work at the docks, I should talk to some sailors.\" So do you go to the docks? No, that would make too much sense. Instead, as you wander around town aimlessly, you can ask people \"Do you know where I could find some sailors?\" Over and over again. It started to get pretty funny. Just asking random people for sailors constantly.\n\nWell, at one point my wife went to the bathroom and I stopped to look at the in-game journal. It's where the game keeps all your notes of things you've learned, but they're all written in faux handwriting as if the main character wrote himself a note. I flip it open and the only thing on the current page in big letters is \"MUST FIND SAILORS!!!\"\n\nI completely lost it. We'd already kinda been laughing about this search for sailors for like an hour and when that popped up it was like the last straw and something in my head broke. I was completely hysterical with laughter. I couldn't stop. I couldn't breathe. It started to hurt. That only made me laugh harder and I was starting to worry I was going to pass out. My wife walked back in from the bathroom and was very confused. She was just in time to see my cat who had been curled up on the couch next to me start to yowl and swat at me. Apparently my lunatic laughter had unnerved him. \"What's so funny?\" she asked. I gestured weakly toward the screen with the still open journal and managed to wheeze out \"Must find sailors!\" as I fell into another fit of laughter. It was a good 5-10 min before I was coherent.\n\n\"Must find sailors\" is still a nice little private joke between us.",
            "I didn't question my sanity, but I got stuck in a laughing loop with my then one year old son. He was laughing at my laugh and I was laughing at his. It was the better part of an hour and we were both exhausted afterward. It was over 30 years ago and it still makes me some when I think about it.",

            "I was in the grocery store about two weeks ago and went to grab some eggs. As I opened the box to check them, I was reminded of a post on Reddit about a guy that went a great deal of his life not knowing why people open egg boxes but was nervous if he didn't do it people would stare at him so he would open them just to look the part. Started laughing out loud while looking at eggs. People were staring at me. I never got out of there so fast. Lol",

We ended up staying in a hotel and playing Cards Against Humanity. I think the prompt had something to do with \"the worst line on a first date\" or something like that. One of us answered \"YEAST.\" We laughed for 10 full minutes and my sides hurt for the rest of the night.",

            "This actually happened to me and a friend of mine.  We were high and typing random phrases into google translate.  He suggested I type in dingleberries and translate it to Spanish.  It translated to \u201cbayas del dingle.\u201d\n\nFor some reason we lost our shit at that.  I don\u2019t think we stopped laughing for half an hour.

            "It was actually something in an AskReddit thread! The question was something along the lines of 'what is an unsolved mystery or paranormal activity that cannot be explained?' \n\nSomeone's reply was that one time when they were younger they farted and the TV turned off. I have no idea why, but something about how it was sandwiched between much more serious replies just made me LOSE IT. I was laughing so much my wife came to ask what was so funny. Her reaction (basically calling me an idiot) made me laugh even more. Even as I type this comment I'm grinning like an idiot thinking about it!\n\nEdit: whoa this blew up! Wife is still sleeping beside me and I'm giggling reading all these replies! Thanks for all the awards and all the laughs. This is what makes reddit awesome",
            "Many years ago, I went through about a week-long phase where I simply COULD NOT read my credit-card number over the phone without laughing hysterically. No reason, it just started one day. Then I think I got all up in my head and it just snowballed from there. Every time I tried to order food, confirm some travel reservation, whatever, I would start laughing and it would take me forever to get through the number. The surprising thing was how infectious the laughter was. I thought the people on the other end of the phone would be annoyed, but probably nine times out of ten they\u2019d start laughing too. It was like some virulent mindworm of contagious hysteria.\n\nAnd then just as suddenly as it started, it was over. Hasn\u2019t happened since (though I still brace myself every time, just in case...)",

That was enough to send us into hysterics but what made it even better was her reaction of shaking her head, slowly sitting up and telling my brother, \u201cOkay time for bed..\u201d in her tiredest voice.

What if somebody made medical marijuana that gave you super powers?\" My girlfriend nearly died laughing, she tried to stay somewhat quiet to not be rude but she failed. The stoners continued to talk about this and what kind of powers they would want for the whole bus ride(*imitates taking a hit* \"I have Munchy Vision!\"), which only made her laughing fits worse. Her laughing fit eventually caused me to laugh uncontrollably, and it's just like a self-sustaining fusion reaction at that point.",
            "Really high, doing a puzzle with my husband and we were eating the *shittiest* frozen pizza we had ever eaten. Like, just the WORST, it was supposed to be garlic cheese and it tasted like absolute nothing and cardboard, so we started pulling everything out of the fridge to put on it and make it better. Finally, my husband decided he was going to cook a bunch of hot dogs and roll them up in the pizza. \n\nSomehow, the concept of \u201chot dog pizza\u201d was so incredibly funny, we both started laughing and couldn\u2019t stop. I laughed so hard, for so long it became physically painful and I couldn\u2019t breathe, but I couldn\u2019t stop laughing so I was just barking out this weird honking cough. By the time we stopped laughing, I was pretty sure I had laughed myself sober. (We marked the date on our calendar, so we never forgot Hot Dog Pizza day. And a month after that night? Pizza Hut came out with Hot Dog Crust Pizza and I swear they were spying on us.)\n\nEdit: For anyone who wanted to know, Hot Dog Pizza Day is October 13th.",

She paused to say something about it to the bear, and I asked what's his name. She looked at me, completely dead faced, and said \"Farmer Brown\" as though I were a complete idiot.

We. Almost. Died. We laughed so hard and for so long that we woke up everyone in the house. I love my mom. Even though she's older and sick, she's never lost that spark.

            "One night, I had cut a roast on our kitchen table. Some of the grease/juices from the roast overflowed from the cutting board, fell onto the table, and from there spilled onto the floor. I didn\u2019t feel like getting it up, so I put it off until the morning. Cue the next morning, I had forgotten about the spill, and went to the fridge, which is right next to the kitchen table. Not seeing anything in the upper shelves of the fridge, I bent down to look at the lower levels. Part of that was adjusting my foot so my stance was wider.\n\nSome context. I am a 6\u20192, 450 pound black man. I am by no definition small, and by many definitions very large. I, that very large man, widened my stance just enough for my foot to land in the grease. The grease immediately felt like my feet were still entirely too close together, and made the decision to let my foot slide the rest of the way over. I am now in a full Chinese Split. Having not stretched this far since adolescence, my body was not prepared. I tilted myself backwards so I could get out of this painful position, but as I did, I imagined seeing myself fall. And it KILLED ME. I laughed harder at that than anything I can remember. I spent a solid 15 minutes on the floor in the fetal position crying laughing, to the point that my sister was concerned I needed to be admitted to a mental hospital. I eventually calmed down, but even now thinking about that makes me chuckle.",

During a (quiet) wind down stretching session, he farted loudly (the bubbly/cheeks flappy kind) and it took all the strength in me to not laugh out loud because shaming is frowned upon in class. The worst part was when the instructor stopped talking for a while and I imagine it\u2019s because she had to also regain her composure and not fart shame as well. Those 2 minutes were so brutal as I silently shook trying to contain my \u201cinner peace\u201d. Couldn\u2019t even look at my bf\u2019s face until we left the building.",

I started wandering away from her gabbing with her friend. I  looked at the case I was closest to, and I absolutely lost my goddamned mind.

The meat in the case were little brown sausage links called \"Lil Sizzlers\".\n\nI was laughing so hard, wheezing and snorting so hard I couldn't even take a breath to explain to my mom and her very worried friend why I'd apparently lost my shit for no reason.",

This is where it got strange. One second I was laughing hysterically and the next I was crying really hard and I didn't notice the change over. I cried for about 3 seconds and then stopped and was like, what the fuck was that all about? One of the strangest things to happen me because I haven't cried in years. Its almost like I was so far on one end of an emotional spectrum that my brain just jumped track into another end. Weird!",

We were so rebellious.\n\nAnyway, we obviously had the cookies with milk and after I finished my little cookie pile, I still had a little milk left, so I decided to grab another cookie so I could have the proper milk-cookie ratio; you know, one bite of cookie, one sip of milk and so on. But before the cookie was finished, the milk was gone, so I obviously had to fill up my glass again. And so the cycle continued until I finally ran out of milk and cookies at the same time.\n\nThis would be a cute story to tell about my 11 year old self making excuses to eat more cookies, but what makes it so memorable to me was actually that my sister and I found it so funny that we started laughing uncontrollably and couldn't stop for over an hour, no exaggeration. It was pretty infectious so when I would finally calm down a little, my sister would start laughing harder and vice versa. And by the end of it, we were both a bit sore from laughing so much.",

He said his nipples got *so pointy* and he demonstrated with his hands (this sounds inappropriate, but I promise it was not). What made this particular story so funny wasn\u2019t really the story itself, but how my professor told it in his deadpanned, expressionless way. I laughed so hard. I started crying and tumbled from my seat to the floor, all the while my professor and friend continue the conversation.

            "When I was eight, my parents were going through a divorce. In an attempt to be Good Parents, they signed me up for some sort of group session with a guidance counselor once a week where we'd talk about Our Feelings and how It's Not Our Fault and Our Parents Still Love Us, along with three or four other kids going through this.\n\nHonestly, while the divorce thing obviously sucked, I was coping with it fine. What was giving me more trouble was the sessions themselves, as A) they were totally unhelpful cliche information, B) I had to leave actual class to attend them, meaning I was falling behind, and C) doing so meant that everyone in my class knew my parents were getting divorced, so I was getting a lot of unwelcome sympathy.\n\nWasn't the only one who thought so, one of the other kids in the group got downright surly. I mostly just kept quiet and nodded my way through the crap, but this kid was super frustrated that he had to do this. The counselor (who I basically remember as [Stuart Smalley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVA-Bx4rNc0)), gave him some completely trite speech about how he was only acting this way because he was lashing out in frustration over his family situation, and didn't really mean to cop an attitude. The kid raised his index finger as if making a pointed declarative statement, and responded with one word: \"Bull\".\n\nJust that, just \"bull\", not even \"bullshit\" or anything. But I was eight and I don't think I had ever heard a kid talk back to an adult like that outside of maybe Bart Simpson, and it fucking slayed me. Probably helps that he had summed up my feelings on several weeks of these sessions in a single concise syllable. I think I laughed so hard I needed to wait out in the hall for the rest of the session.",

We stopped at light, and the helicopter flew directly overhead on the way to the hospital, at that moment I looked in my rearview mirror and my former finance was in the car behind me with her new boyfriend.

            "My uncle is a retired massage therapist--he only gives massages to friends and family now.\n\nOne time, before the massage, I had a couple of very mild THC mints. It's one of the few times I've ever been stoned though, and I'm a lightweight, so it was plenty enough to get my wimpy ass high. \n\nSo I get on the massage table, uncle has his Alexa play meditation music, massage is underway.\n\nHe does my back first, and about halfway through I start to have the giggles. There's nothing funny, amd I'm still just sober enough to realize that, but I want to laugh just because. I hold it in, though, because I know laughing would totally interrupt the massage.\n\nI turn over, and now the mints have REALLY kicked in. Like, total stoned thoughts. \"Have You ever thought about how there's a skull in your head?\" level stoned. \n\nUncle tells Alexa to skip one song, and then I have a new stoned thought, which I voice:\n\n\"Hey, have you ever asked Alexa to play something, but like, give it a random word? Like \"Play cucumber,\" and see what comes up?\"\n\n\". . . no.\" He pauses, remembers I am not used to being stoned, and decides to indulge me. \"Alexa: cucumber!\"\n\nAlexa starts giving us tue definition of a cucumber. I say, \"No no, ask it to PLAY cucumber.\"\n\n\"Alexa: Play 'cucumber'.\"\n\nAnd Alexa replies: \"Playing Dance of the Cucumber by Veggie Tales on Amazon Music\", whereupon we are treated to the dulcet, squeaky tones of Larry the Cucumber.\n\nNow this would be at least kind of funny normally, but remember i'd been fighting off the urge to giggle at absolutely nothing for half an hour at this point. Now that I have a real reason to laugh, the floodgates are open. I'm on my back on the massage table absolutely cackling, my uncle is yelling at Alexa to shut up because he very much does not appreciate Larry the Cucumber as a source of massage music, and the two dogs he has have left the scene for the yard because if we're making noise SOMETHING must be going on and it must be barked at.\n\nUncle goes to shut the dogs up, comes back inside, I'm still laughing. In fact, by this point I'm laughing at the fact that I'm laughing. He says, \"Yup, you're stoned\", and sits on the couch to wait for me to stop.\n\nEventually I have to make myself stop, because it turns out laying flat on your back is not an ideal position for laughing. It's really hard to stop though, amd even once the massage gets back underway, an errant giggle occasionally slips out. \n\nHonestly, I'm reluctant to get stoned again because it's hard to fathom what could top Larry the Cucumber during a massage. (The other reason is that the very next time I got stoned it was with a different edible that was WAY too strong and I almost felt sick. Don't wanna repeat that.)",

It was the craziest thing I've ever experienced trying to sob and laugh at the same time. And after that big emotional release my life got a lot easier.\n\nJust a side note bottled up emotions are an  obstacle and apparently Tai Chi is great for releasing them.\nEdits spelling and clarity",

            "One time my Grandad got a sausage roll at a football match during half time, when he got back to his seat he found it was overdone, the pastry was quite burned. The man was irate. He didn't take it back straight away as the second half was about to start, but he spent much of the second half angrily lamenting his savoury snack letdown. So he takes it home, calls the customer service number on the back (I assume he had a few choice words for the poor soul on the other end but I wasn't present for this), and keeps the remainder of the sausage roll in the freezer for the next couple of weeks.\n\nSkip ahead to the next match day, my Grandad tells me we're heading out early so he can have his sausage roll replaced. The customer service line told him to go to Kiosk 3 at the front of the ground *next to* the ticket office. When we arrive, however, the shutters are down at the food place. The old man looks around growling and turning red in the face, stamps right over to window number 3 of the ticket office and slams his frozen burned sausage roll down like a fucking flaky gauntlet. At this point I'm trying to convince him the ticket office was a completely different department to the catering concession but my Grandad was having none of it. The lady working the ticket window continually attempted in vein to convince him the same, they sell match tickets not hot snacks, but this just got him angrier and angrier. Across comes a colleague behind the glass, now there's just two people to rage at. Then a head steward comes to attempt to diffuse the situation and my Grandad begins to wave the burnt sausage roll in this man's face, I was actually surprised he didn't whack him with it. At this point I'm mortified by the whole affair, wishing I'd have stayed back at the house until nearer kick off.\n\nEventually, after an hour or so, the shutters come up on the food concession. Fella at the counter goes 'You must be Mr. Alaginge' and calmly resolves the situation, dispatching a freshly baked sausage roll with the steady hands of a surgeon. My Grandad is completely satisfied with the result of his hour of insolent rage. As we're walking away he turns to me and says 'that's how you get these things sorted.'\n\n\n\n",

No big deal, right? We have paper towels and napkins in the house, also me and my brother are pretty good with not making any messes while we eat.\n\nNope. Grandmother got us in the car, drove back to McDonald's, demanded a manager, and screeched about how upset she was that we didn't get any napkins. I wanted to just melt into the floor and disappear. It's just napkins, Nanny....\n\nEDIT: Changed wording a lil bit.",
            "When I was a young child on a long distance flight my mother let me and my brother sleep on the floor. For safety reasons the flight attendants told my mother that we were not allowed to sleep on the floor. She started to argue with the flight attendants who then turned to the pilots. The pilots threatened to turn the plane around unless we get up from the floor but she continued to argue. The pilots anounced they were about to turn around because of my mother, so all the passangers got pissed. Eventually she caved in when she had all passengers and flight crew on a boeing 747 against her..",

The manager wasn't very helpful, probably because she was rude.\n\nSo my mom, went to all the other customers in line and told them that the hotel was a scam and they were ripping us off with fake charges.

It has to be well done or he claims to have lost his appetite. \n\nOne time we went to Burger King when I was younger and we sat down to eat. He took one bite of his burger, spit it out and immediately started bitching about it being under cooked.

            "I grew up in a smaller town right on the cusps of its big growth boom. We knew our town had finally made it when we got an Olive Garden. We used to eat there 2-3 times a month. My mom and I would always split an entree and my dad would get his own. We knew the rule if you\u2019re splitting and entree and you get more than one of the family style bowls of salad than you\u2019ll get charged an extra $4 for the extra person. Which is fair, 2 entrees come with 2 unlimited salads. Welllll one day my dad decides he wanted more salad. Only he wants the additional salad, but the waitress said if she refills the bowl, that we will be charged the extra $4. Wellll low and behold my parents threw the biggest tantrum because only HE wanted the additional salad. The demanded to speak to a manager and the manager explained the rule (which we knew) but offered to comp the extra salad just to get my parents to stop yelling....and they did. When our bill came the manager comped my dads entree and the additional salad fee. Well my mom got up. Interrupted the manager while he was talking to other guests and threw the check in his face and asked \u201cwhat\u2019s this?!?!\u201d She was furious that he comped my dads meal. He ate the meal therefore we would like to pay for it. She wouldn\u2019t stop raising her voice until she was allowed to pay for the meal (but not the salad). The manager was confused but obliged...when they brought the change the manager slipped a few free appetizer coupons. My mom ripped them up and threw them on the ground as she left. Safe to say I didn\u2019t eat out with them for at least a month and I still refuse to go to Olive Garden with them. ",

            "My dad just loved to argue, and he loved a deal.\n\nWe were shopping in a department store, and I found a pair of pants I was mildly interested in.  The pants were tagged at (let's say) $40, and the sign on the rack was \"All pants $25\".\n\nI was mildly interested, I asked the salesclerk if they had them in my size, the clerk said \"those aren't supposed to be on that rack\".\n\nMy dad lost his shit and insisted on getting the pants for $25, and started asking for a courtesy discount on top of that.  Escalated to the floor manager and the store manager.\n\nMeanwhile, I didn't want the pants.  They were ok pants I guess, nothing awesome, I just didn't care very much about them.  I was more than happy to move on.  I told my dad I didn't want the pants, by then he didn't care about what I wanted, he wanted the pants at the better price.\n\nEventually after like an hour of arguing the store manager said \"we're not giving you the pants at that price.  Take them or leave them at $40\".  So we left them.  Which suited me just fine, because I didn't want the pants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

So the step dad walks up to the host and says \"Yes, we have a reservation\".\n\nThe problem is, Red Lobster (or at least that one) doesnt take reservations. The host explains this and says it is going to be 20 min wait for seating. Her step dad FLIPPED out and started screaming that he had called 3 hours before hand and made a reservation. The host politely told him this was not possible as they do not take reservations (again).\n\nHe continues to scream at the guy, and says he wants to talk to a manager. So the manager comes out and she tells him the same thing. They dont take reservations, so its not possible that he had made one. He continues to cause a scene and people started leaving just to get away from this toxic guy. Finally, the manager says, \"Fine, we will put you ahead of everyone else that has been patiently waiting their turn\". He says \"Thank you\".

            "Grocery store had this sign up that said if an item rang up higher than an advertised price it was free. It was the 80s and stores did stupid shit like this that I never see in stores today.\n\nMom was buying a box of Little Debbie cakes and they rang up for $2.85 instead of the advertised $2.50. So now mom wants her free cakes. Cashier doesn't know what to do, summons a manager.

I'm the new manager and I just haven't had the sign removed yet\" (it was a printed plastic sign that was screwed into the wall). \n\nMom insists they honor their sign, he says nah. Now, up to this point, I as an adult looking back am totally on board with mom's actions. \n\nMom gathers her things, decides against taking the Little Debbies on principle, and we get in the car. Mom wordlessly drives downtown to the main store of this 3-5 store chain, knowing the office is next door. We walk into this perfectly 80's wood paneled office where my mother asks the secretary to speak to the owner of the store and is permitted to do so since this is a family owned business and their \"corporate office\" is smaller than the row of cubicles my staff occupy at work. \n\nHere my mother unleashes a tirade about how she has lost faith in his brand and how his word is meaningless since they will not honor the sign etc. This guy stands up, profusely apologizes, validates her anger and then pulls out his wallet and hands her a $5 bill along with a promise that he will speak to the manager and the sign will either be honored or removed. \n\nWe get home and find that the ice cream we bought melted in the trunk because summer and ruined the cereal and the bread.

Her orders have 14 special requests, but she's not at all kind about it, she is defensive from the get go like you're an idiot who's already screwed the order up. \"Nooo dressing. Not on the side. Nothing. Completely dry. Do you understand? I will send it back!\"\n\n\nThe one I will never forget though was dinner at Joe's Crab shack. In case you've never been it's one of those places that every so often plays a song that the entire staff is required to drop everything & do a little synchronized dance to. It's quick, everyone gets a little kick out of it, it's part of the fun. Now my MIL Karen knew this, it's not like she'd never been here. But apparently she was not willing to wait 2 extra minutes for her dry salad, so she starts going off as soon as the dancing starts. She gets a manager, who clearly knows Karen well & offers a quick apology (for doing their job), a discount & her dry ass salad. But Karen's not completely satisfied. She tells us that even though dinner for our party of 8 is on her, she's not tipping the waitress 1 penny. She proceeds to bitch.....loudly...the rest of the meal & antagonize our waitress over petty shit.\n\nI worked too many years in customer service & ya know, I'm a decent human being. I made sure to get my bill separate so I could tip for the entire table. I wrote a quick note on the receipt, something along the lines of \"Way to stay positive even when the customer's a jerk\". I was a little afraid of the wrath of Karen, it was one of my first interactions with her too, but when the waitress came & hugged me, Karen & I locked eyes. She knew. I didn't care.

(No duh, dad, you're being an asshole, no one appreciates that.)\n\nIf you've worked for DirecTV customer service any time since 1996, I apologize on behalf of my dad\n\n*edit* Another story for y'all: I also remembered one time McD's was having some kind of 2-for-1 breakfast sandwich deal going on where the total was about $3. He gets his breakfast, drives \\~25 mins to work, realizes he's missing one of the sandwiches...and proceeds to call McD's customer support every evening after work for a week to complain about his wasted $1.50.

            "Not exactly the question, but my Dad was great with those customers.  We had a small family business selling and installing fireplaces (for context).  He, on more than one occasion, when getting the customer call or come in, after the installers had finished up and left the job site, to bitch about one of the men being rude or something, he could get this look of grave concern on his face.  He would then go into a backstory, saying things like \"oh no, not again\" or do the open mouth, closed teeth inhale thing and just 'tsk tsk tsk' and then start on with some nonsense about having told the guy before that it was his last warning and go on about how he was going to 'have to let them go'.  The blood draining from people's faces or the dead silence on the other end of the phone line was magical - followed by the customer frantically explaining that 'maybe it wasn't that bad' or blaming themselves...  He was never going to fire anyone, but he'd find out real quick who was just complaining for fun.  Many of those customers have no qualms about getting the employee in trouble, but in general folks don't want to jeopardize people's livelihoods.\n\n",

Jokes on you mom, I always find our server after seated, give them a $20.00 and apologize in advanced for your poor behavior.\n\nEdit: Yes, she knows what I think of it. She doesn't care. She believes she's sticking to her principles, and that tipping poor service (read: never had \"good service\", something will always be wrong), will encourage thier laziness. It's not going to stop. If you wait on her, I am very sorry.\n\nEdit 2: She waited tables at a pizza hut when she was 20.

I've blocked out all the context behind it other than I took her to buy yarn and *something* went wrong.  I think maybe they shorted her a couple bucks or wouldn't honor a coupon or something.  Whatever it was ended in a \"let me talk to your manager\" followed by a tirade to the manager about how they shouldn't be hiring Mexicans.  I just remember having to talk over her and say, \"Oh my god you *can't* talk to her like that.  Nothing you just said is ok\" followed by me trying to push her wheelchair out of the store as fast as possible with her digging her feet into the ground trying to get me to stop so she could go back to trying to ruin someone's day and me wondering if I'd go to jail for elder abuse if her ankles snapped in the process because **nothing** was going to stop me getting her out of that store.   I got her into the car and then went back in and apologized till I was blue in the face.  I wish I could say it was an isolated incident but it definitely wasn't.      \nIf by any cosmic chance any sales clerks or phone reps that had to deal with my grandmother read this thread I am so so incredibly sorry, I apologize on behalf of my whole family and I'd give you a hug if I could.     \n\nAs an interesting side effect of caring for her, I have a tendency to wander off and pretend to look at things when we get to the register if I'm with someone and I'm not the one paying.  I think she gave me an honest to god phobia.    \n\n**EDIT:** Thanks for the helpful suggestions about pulling the wheelchair backward next time.  She passed away two years ago so it's thankfully something I won't have to deal with for awhile.  I'd never experienced someone digging their heels in before and I was sort of panicking trying to get her out of the store before she tried anything else.  I think under any kind of better circumstances I would've worked it out.     \n\n**EDIT 2 Bonus story edition:**  This one thankfully happened at home but is nevertheless I guess equal parts amusing and equally awful as the other story in hindsight.  It was some kind of special occasion, probably one of our birthdays because we were all sitting at the kitchen table eating cake.  The nightly routine was we all sit down to eat dinner and she'd put the tv on the evening news which we'd halfway listen to.  They were talking about something political and said \"Blah blah blah...and the House Judicial Committee approved this.\"  My grandmother caught that one line and said, \"The Judicial Committee?  Those damn Jews.  What are they doing with all these committees?\"  I got caught somewhere between wanting to laugh at her misunderstanding and wanting to make some kind of noise of horror and instead I just inhaled sharply and aspirated a gigantic mouthful of chocolate cake and coughed so hard and so long that my mom wound up having to take me to urgent care because it set off my asthma.

My mom was acting like she was Gordon Ramsey analyzing the business, critiquing everything down to the amount of bubbles in her seltzer (\u201clooks like it\u2019s time to change the CO2\u201d) My step dad was getting more and more heated over stupid things like the amount of ice in his drink and how the waitress didn\u2019t top off his water, that he was barely sipping on, fast enough. \n\nIt came to a head when my step father ordered a steak medium well, it came back medium well, and for some reason he changed his mind that he wanted it medium rare while it was cooking and they didn\u2019t read his mind, so he gave attitude, as did my mom. They jumped really quickly to demanding free stuff.\n\nI\u2019m an adult and this may be the first time they realized this. I interrupted in front of the server and said something like \u201creally? This is what you\u2019re doing. That\u2019s what you ordered...\u201d I turned to the server and said \u201cWe do not need anything comped.\u201d I then pulled out my wallet and handed her my card and said \u201cthis is for the bill. We\u2019ll happily wrap up with what we have here. I\u2019m very sorry for their behavior, you\u2019re doing great.\u201d Then the line that stung them so deep they still bring it up years later ...\u201dI was taught to treat people nicely, a lesson that seems to be forgotten. Thank you.\u201d \n\nThey turned red, the server walked away, I looked down and cut my steak, and didn\u2019t say a word. They were so flabbergasted that the meal was virtually silent except me asking my step father how his steak was a few minutes later. I signed the check, gave a big tip, and we walked out and said goodbyes.\n\nThey\u2019ve been nicer to servers each time that we\u2019ve gone out since. \n\nEdit: Wow. First gold. Thanks! ",

            "My mom needed to return some shirts at the mall because they didn't fit right. It was past the allotted time that she had to return them, so the employee said that there wasn't anything she could do. My mom started SCREAMING at this girl who was probably about 16 or 17 calling her names and demanding to speak to the manager. When the manager told my mom that they couldn't do anything and that the return policy was on the receipt, my mom threw a fit and knocked over a display that was next to the register and stormed out of the store. I was probably 6 or 7 at the time and I was mortified. I apologized for her behavior and picked up what I could before she started calling for me to follow her. The manager was super sweet to me though and told me that I was a good kid and to stick up to my mom when I could get away with it",
            "I think every memory I have of my mom is her yelling at a customer service employee either on the phone or in their face. I always felt bad for the employees. I remember at least one instance in which I felt really embarrassed. I did an online program that was geared towards new drivers. It was all about driving safety and took forever to do. At the end of the course, the young driver had the opportunity to get lower insurance rates. So I had to call a customer service representative and confirm personal information as well as answer some things from the course in order to get the rates. My mom kept insisting I put the phone on speaker. Every time I did, the rep would tell me to take it off of speaker. My mom would then try to follow me around the house trying to listen in and the rep could hear her and said she needed to stop. My mom got mad at the rep and I ended up not getting the lower rates on my insurance because the rep was fed up. ",
            "I was out to breakfast with my mom, and our waitress straight up disappeared. We sat for a good 30 minutes, after having ordered nothing but eggs. It was an off time, so the diner was pretty quiet. It was as if our waitress had just evaporated. Naturally, my mom asked someone if we could speak with the manager. She stops by, my mom lets her know what's happened, and asks if she can check on our waitress, our food, etc. Ten minutes later the manager shows up with our food, and the waitress in tow. She put our food down, then proceeded to *rip* in to the waitress. This poor woman broke down in tears, apologizing profusely. We felt awful, didn't even bother finishing our food. Once the manager was out of sight, my mom found the waitress, gave her a hug, and a larger tip than usual. It was rough, leaving us both sufficiently embarrassed.",
            "This is my favorite example of my mom being an absolute whacko. We are from NY and I met her in LA where she was vacationing for a few days. There is a restaurant we had been to before and really wanted to visit again, I guess you could say its a \"hot spot\". This is lunch time, no reservation.\n\nWe arrive at the restaurant and there are a bunch of open tables, its early, probably before noon. My mom asks for a table and they say \"we're so sorry but if you dont have a reservation, we unfortunately do not have any tables for you. If you'd like, you can leave your phone number and we can call you if we have any cancellations.\" My mom starts huffing and puffing, pointing at all the tables, which are of course reserved for 12:00 and 12:30 reservations but are currently empty. She's making a whole scene and just storms out of the restaurant.\n\nI try to explain to her the way restaurants work, that there are empty tables because other people are going to be coming in later with reservations. She is storming down the block just ranting \"NO! You dont get it! I've worked in restaurants my whole life. This is what they do. It's LA. It's like a nightclub. They dont like the way we look. This is ridiculous.\" While she's ranting, the hostess comes running down the block. They had a cancellation and they could seat us immediately. I was humiliated, I didnt even want to eat there anymore.\n\nLong story short, I never take my mom to any restaurant I like.",
            "Okay, so we were going to a theme park in the capitol of the country. I must have been around 19, which makes my one sister 16, and the youngest around 9. My dad had been planning this for a year, and we were psyched to go.\n\nAfter you go into this place, you see a huge lake, and on each side there are several shops. A restaurant there, a souvenir shop there. And also, there is a Build-A-Bear shop. This shop is NOT a part of the park itself, but it does have an entrance from the park.\n\nAnyway, my dad didn't have custody of my sister at the time, and only saw her very sporadically. This was by his own choice, since his anxiety meant he couldn't care for her properly. She lived with a foster family. This was one of maybe three times a year he got to actually take her somewhere, so this trip was a BIG deal.\n\nHe told her she could have ONE thing from the park, whatever she wanted he would pay for it. And, being a 9-year old girl, she said she wanted a Build-A-Bear.\n\nMy dad was unfamiliar with the concept of Build-A-Bear, so he didn't know that the price of the bear isn't the total price. On top of it comes the clothes, the shoes etc. So the shop person takes my sister through the whole thing. You know, stuffing, putting the heart in etc, and rings up the total.\n\nMy dad totally lost it. Like, red in the head, screaming at this poor girl in the shop lost it. And I felt SO embarassed. Firstly, this girl didn't make the prices. Secondly, this was THE trip of the year, it was all four of us for the first time in forever. And thirdly, you don't yell at people like that.\n\nI get that he was angry, since he didn't know the process, and felt cheated. And also, he felt backed into a corner, since he had promised my sister that she could have anything. But you don't do that. Ever.\n\nLuckily, the rest of the trip went by without a hitch, and my youngest sister doesn't remember this happening. She has two Build-A-Bears now, and she named each of them after one of her sisters.",
            "My mom has been this person regularly throughout my life but I do have one positive story with it. \n\nShe and I went to eat at portillo's when I was a teenager and we sat in the back of the restaurant where it was more private so we can eat in peace. About 10 minutes into our meal two people come into the empty area and sit down two tables away from us. Turns out it was a manager and an employee that was getting written up. the manager was being a complete asshat towards the employee criticizing and belittling them. My mom put down her food and walked over and started yelling at the manager for being such an asshole. she went on a rant about how rude and wrong it was of him to do this in front of the public two tables away from customers and really let him have it. She demanded the phone number of the manager above him and we left after she received it. I was pretty embarrassed at the time but as I got older I realized that she was standing up for that employee and how wrong that manager really was. I'm not a hundred percent sure what she did with that phone number because I lived with my dad and I had to go home after that meal. ",
            "Not my parents, but I was once out to dinner with my brother in law and his family. Our meals all came out at almost random times instead of all together. My brother in law demanded to talk to the manager because it was \"unacceptable\" that food come out at different times and he said something about how he hopes they don't expect us to pay for the meal. He gave a big speech about how we came out so we could eat together, and he knows this is unacceptable because he used to be a waiter, etc. I was mortified because I didn't think it was that big of a deal.",
            "My mom constantly does this, but one time really sticks out.\n\nWe went to a local Mexican restaurant and as we were paying for the food she tried to use a coupon. The cashier said they wouldn't accept the coupon and my mom was furious. She demanded that the manager come out and accept the coupon. She caused a massive scene in the restaurant and it lasted at least five minutes. As the cashier was getting the manager, I decided to look at the coupon...it was for a totally different Mexican restaurant in the area and my mom wasn't wearing her glasses. The cashier and manager both came back, my mom apologized, and they ended up accepting the coupon.",
            "This is a weird story that had a huge impact on me, and about a parent talking to the manager...but is a little different.\n\nGrowing up, my dad was sheriff of a small town.  I must have been around 8-9.  He was brought in after the previous sheriff was booted out for political reasons/stealing city funds.  That was a really unpopular movie, since he was super popular and spread his money all over town and let people get away with murder. \n\nThat sheriff was out and my dad was brought in.  Everybody hated him, in part because they loved the old sheriff and also because my dad was an \"outsider\" even though he came from about two towns over...he wasn't of their world, so he could never be fit to see over the village. (It didn't help that my dad was a raging asshole with a stick up his butt for the rules).\n\nOne day, my dad was dressed in his full uniform and took me alone to the local corner diner.  Like, one of those places straight out of Roadhouse.  We sat down and ate the full dinner, and my dad lectured me something about \"respect\" and \"the rules are all we have.\"\n\nThen the waitress came in and dropped the check.  My dad looked at it, and it said the meal was free.  My dad then excused himself and went up to the waitress.  I kept to myself, and doodled on the napkin and the next time I looked up, my dad was full on SCREAMING at the woman.  He was straight-up shaking. \n\nShe tried to explain that free meals is how all cops are treated in this town, and my dad was FURIOUS that he would get special treatment, that police are put above the normal laws.  That the police have rules they must follow, and not accepting kickbacks is one of those rules.  And that it especially happened in front of his kid, who he's trying to teach right.\n\nEveryone in the diner was quiet and just staring at him.\n\nIt was a weird situation because it was a moment where my dad showed a lot of integrity, but also a story of a 6'7\" man with a gun on his belt screaming at a tiny little waitress.  It stuck in my head as a clear picture of the contradictions that our parents are.  Like, a lot of the good comes from them but at the same time a lot of the bad.\n\n**EDIT:**  This kind of blew up more than I was expecting, so I would like to promote...not being an asshole cop who beats your kids!\n\n**EDIT EDIT:** Quit sending messages telling me how shitty my dad was.  He's not a hero and did some really shitty things in his life, but I'm still his son and it's not fun to hear from a bunch of strangers tell me how my dad sucks.  You didn't know him, you don't know his full story, you just know a slice of life told by one person.  The point of this story is that people are complicated and that we're full of contradictions, it's not to give yourself another excuse to feel good about yourself on the internet. \n\nHe was a guy who beat me and my brother, had anger issues, was painfully insecure and closed off...but also was a noteworthy cop.  He rose through the ranks and as a white man, brought progressive racial policies to his department in the 1980's that to this day are still radical.  He was an innovator as a police administrator.  I'll put it like this; he did heartbreaking things to me, and yet I found room to forgive him.  Through a long and painful process, I found room to forgive him as an adult.  Not excuse his behavior, but put peace in my heart towards my feelings towards him.  Whatever opinion you have of him, keep in mind that from your computer, it is one that is really easy for you to have, and for me it is and will always be a really difficult one for me to have. ",
            "My mom once called Domino's regional corporate office or some shit because a pizza I ordered for her, THAT I PAID FOR, was \"too expensive\". \n\nShe did get 4 free pizza vouchers out of it but I'm so glad I was not around for the embarrassment of it all (I ordered it online from my job in the next state. Why? Because she wanted pizza \ud83d\ude02)",
            "My dad would sometimes do this at restaurants if the server was too slow or the food was wrong (especially multiple times in the same meal). He was totally right in being frustrated, because sometimes this was extreme, but we all hated it.\n\nThe worst time was when we were in our favorite restaurant. My mom literally said, \"I'm not doing this.\" And gathered up us 3 kids and we went to the car.\n\nEDIT: You guys seem to have gotten the wrong impression. My dad was NOT a dick to anyone and he did this a few times a year at worst. \n\nThe incidents I remember warranted him speaking with the manager and he was never rude or insulting. The rest of us just didn't care enough about bad service to say anything to anyone.",
            "We travelled alot when we were younger and would skip lines at the airport since we were kids.\n\nBut now we were all in our early teens and my mom faked having a heart condition to skip the long line to get on the airplane. \n\nFlight attendant would have none of it and told us to go back to the end of the line. I still remember the smiles and looks of everyone there.",
            "About the only thing my dad and I have in common is we like to go thrifting. Garage sales, estate sales, antique stores, and charity thrift shops.\n\nThing is, we do it for different reasons. I do it for the fun of finding something unusual and offbeat. Dad does it because he likes to find bargains, to be one-up on the suckers who didn't know what they had.\n\nSo I was mortified when dad went to the charity shop checkout and bitched for 10 minutes about being overcharged 50 cents. Left him in the store alone. When he finally came out, I went in and dropped 5 bucks in the donation jar and apologized for my asshole father.",
            "Not long ago my mom asked to treat my wife and I to lunch at outback steakhouse. We get there and order. My mom orders iced tea with extra lemon. Tea shows up with one lemon. Usually no big deal, right? Just ask for more. Well, instead of doing that my mom turns to the waiter and says \"What? No extra lemon? You fail as a waiter. No brownie points for you\". The dude sits there for a moment and then says rather flatly \"I'll be right back with more lemon\". I turn to my mom and am like - \"That's how you get your food spit in. You've just sent the message that this will be a shitty tipping table and he's going to totally focus elsewhere\". She argues that \"Well it should have inspired him to work harder to impress us!\". I think from that point I just mentioned that from his end, his odds of making money are now higher at some other table. It's just how people work. Well, she goes to the bathroom and cries. She comes back and makes some super complicated order. I texted my wife who was sitting right next to me and say \"This dude is going to butcher that order on purpose\". Food comes out. Ours is correct in perfect. Hers is ALL fucked up. Basically a totally wrong order. She asks for it to be fixed - a bit more subdued this time. It comes out technically correct but obviously carelessly prepared/cooked. I chuckle inside. \n\nHere's the insane part: after all of this she turns to us and says \"I was right about that waiter! He sucks at his job!\"\n\nIt's like no, dude - your behavior made him not give a fuck about you. \n\nAfter being a total asshole and paying the price she walked away feeling validated and haughty. I slipped in a nice tip with a \"Sorry for my mom\" note. ",
            "It was at a TGI Fridays in Katy, TX. This waiter was amazing. He was working 8 tables that I could count and was managing all of them flawlessly. Drinks never got below 1/3rd full at any table, he was always attentive and prompt, friendly, just a textbook example of the perfect waiter. He impressed my dad so much that my dad asked if he could speak to a manager. Of course, the waiter immediately asks if anything is wrong, since that's the only time someone asks. My dad tells him no, it's to make sure that management knows what excellent service he's providing. The waiter thanks us and says he'll get a manager over as quickly as he can.  \n\n\nWe wait for about 10 minutes before this middle-aged grease ball of a manager saunters over and starts asking my dad how the waiter screwed up. My dad is not the most patient of people, and we were kinda in a hurry to get home, so the 10 minute wait was rubbing him wrong. But when the manager immediately acted like the guy was a screw up, my dad lost it. He told the manager that the waiter had done everything perfectly, and that's why he tipped the guy $15 on a $35 ticket. He also went on to say that the manager needed to be more respectful of his staff and gave the guy an ass chewing for presuming that the employee had screwed up. Before that moment, I thought that my sister and I were the only ones he would scream at when he was upset. It was somewhat embarrassing to see my dad yell at this guy, but he did it for a good reason.",

No one in my school would give her that information because they didn't have to. She got to my principal and said, \"I want to speak to your manager\" in front of me. He refused and they argued for a while. The principal knew I was an okay guy and the score I told my mother was legit. It was really embarrassing though. ",

I don\u2019t remember much but I remember when we were in the car about to go home my mom was looking at the receipt and she noticed that the cashier gave them $1 less in change than they were supposed to. My mom was furious and made us all go back inside. She started yelling at the teenage girl cashier about how they\u2019re bad people and this is wrong etc etc. Then the girl said something like \u201cok geeze\u201d and then rolled her eyes while giving back the correct change. This made my mom *flip*. She started screaming at the top of her longs about how they\u2019re evil and how she needs to fix her attitude and stuff like that. \n\nAnother one was when we recently had a fire in our house. A bunch of ash and fire extinguisher stuff got all over the house and we got a cleaning company to clean the house. It was like two dudes and two girls. Idk what exactly triggered my mom but apparently she didn\u2019t like the way they were cleaning. She started yelling at them and lecturing them that they should know how to clean, especially the girls because they\u2019re female.  She then showed them how to do it whole continuing to yell at them. \n\nA lot of the bad outbursts were the same way she treated us when she got mad. She\u2019s got a lot calmer since then tho ",

            "We got screwed once in a Taco Bell drive thru (not the usual way), which sent my mom into a complete meltdown. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe people running the place had - I shit you not - run out of lettuce.  And I've never dealt with dumber people.  Instead of just... telling people they were out and letting it go, they were being idiots and saying \"There'll be a small delay...\" \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt was a super hot day, the AC was broke, we're exhausted, all we *really* want is some water, but we're stuck in the drive thru line waiting and waiting as ... they try to figure out how to make lettuce out of thin air? You'd think there'd be another bag somewhere or something but... maybe that was too complicated for them. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo - twenty minutes into sitting cooking in the car trapped between other cars in the drive through and unable to go forward or back or even sideways ( speaker and signs, even if we wanted to jump the curb) and my mother is just cursing up a blue streak about the stupidity of the people involved, screaming her damn head off about 'just fucking make some lettuce free tacos you dumb shits, what do you use for brains, the fettid remains of your blasted out assholes' - I remember much of this very vividly as I was about 12 or 13 at the time, and I was learning all sorts of new words and phrases.  My little brother took notes. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThat's when we see some taco bell teenage idiot employee boy make a break from the building and go sprinting across the parking lot over towards the grocery store across the way.  *They sent out a fuckhead to go buy some lettuce...* \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe cursing rises a few notches.  NOBODY CARES ABOUT THE FUCKING LETTUCE.  JESUS FUCKING CHRIST JUST LET US OUT OF HERE YOU LITTLE ... etc etc etc.  Volume. Variety. Viciousness.

Wtf?) finally gets handed something ... and they don't leave immediately they have to fucking talk for a while before they drive off.  \n\nMy mom is a volcano past it's sell by date and just frothing at the mouth now, but *eventually* ... they pull off and leave and we can pull up to the window. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat I've left out of this story is... my family, for a few years, would participate in parades as clowns, handing out candy to the kids at the side of the road and dancing our way through the parade route to the rocking tune of \"Cel-e-brate good time To-Night!\" on repeat.\n\nAnd this day was one of those days - we were all in full costume.  Makeup, super baggy rainbow pants, rainbow wig, big flower on the suspenders, big ole ridiculous shoes... the whole deal. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo the car finally pulls away ahead of us, and my mom, who for the last hour has been a spitting bulldog of bile and vindictive rage and a constant criticizer of the drive thru window people's ancestry and breeding... realizes she has to pull up and face them in full Clown Regalia to get our stupid tacos. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI remember that moment when Mom realized it.  The mix of anger, embarrassment, ridiculousness of it - and eventually the humor of the whole situation - went through her and she started laughing so hard she was crying. \n\nAnd when the people behind us started honking for us to just GO (they'd been waiting too) - it just got funnier somehow.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo now mom is not just a crazy angry lady - she's a Crazy Angry Clown Lady, and more than that - she's a crazy clown lady who's been sweating and now crying too.   So she's not even a crazy clown lady with good makeup anymore, she's just a wreck of a crazy clown lady. \n\nWhich makes her laugh even harder. \n\nMy brother and I thought she was going to die.  I mean, she couldn't breathe, and those outfits, the heat, hell - the whole reason we pulled into this place was we needed water...\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo give mom credit, she didn't just squeal out of there flipping everyone the bird - she got herself together, pulled up to the window, looked up at the girl through the car window with her ruined clown make up and big rainbow wig, and handed her the money very calmly, said thank you and took the bag, and we drove off. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI hope to hell they remember us.  I know I'll never forget the look on the drive thru girl's face as we drove up and she started to try to apologize for the delay and... just ... stopped.  Staring at us. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nGood day.",
            "Spent two hours in the lobby of the MGM Grand in Vegas circa Jan '99. We had arrived with family friends to attend a hairstylist convention (friend's mom owned a salon and mine managed it), and we discovered our family suites had a window view of their dumpster area about a minute after walking into the room.\n\nCue my mother storming back down to the lobby and demanded the head manager at the front desk switch our rooms immediately. Watching her make a scene and get even angrier once security was threatened on her was mortifying. I was 10, tired and embarrassed, and just wanted us all to have fun.\n\nLuckily the head manager offered a vacant Presidential Suite for \"all of the trouble\" after getting my mother to calm down. Looking back I realize he did it just to shut her up and restore calm back to the lobby for other guests. To this day, I am overly-nice to retail and food service workers to compensate for her behavior even though she's not even around anymore. I never want to be THAT person.",
            "Brother (13) sister (9), cousin 1 (10), cousin 2(11) and I (11)  went to go eat at the nearby DQ by our house. Brother orderes first and gets ice cream. The rest of us get burgers. Brother regrets his order and asks to trade but non of us wanted ice cream. So he decides to ask the cashier to switch his order. I tell him he can't do since he already ate some of it but he ignores me and asks anyways. They say no because since he ate some. \n\nBrother gets mad and walks home and the rest us eat our food. And then, oh boy.... my mom arrives, pissed off, and asks to speak with the manager. Manager comes up and says they can't switch his order because he already ate some of it. Mom waves the ice cream in managers face demanding to switch his order. Again, she says no. I'm super embarrassed and focus on eating my food. Now I didn't see exactly what happened but cousin 1 did and his jaw drops and says something along the lines of, \"your mom just shoved the ice cream at the ladies face!\" We all look back and poor manager lady had ice cream all over her face and hair! Mom grabs brother by the arm and nearly sprinted out of the store! I almost sank to the floor in embarrassment! \n\nAs the manager was wiping the ice cream off, she points to us and angrily asks us to come over. We booked it! Abandoning our food and ran home! Dad noticing us asking us what happened and we tell him. He gets mad, turns to mom and says, \"that was not necessary\" but mom wasn't having any of it and blamed it all on them. Brother was red in the face. I don't think he expected that to happen. \n\nAbout 10 minutes later (with parents arguing about it) the police show up with little sister. We all forgot about her!  She was mad at us for leaving her behind. The cops basically told us we were banned from entering that DQ. All of us glare at brother, who looked mortified. I don't know if my mom got in trouble (if she did it was well deserved) but it was so embarrassing and unnecessary. \n\n\nTo this day I haven't been back to that DQ. And that was almost 20 years ago! I always cringe a bit whenever I think about it.\n\n\nEdit: forgot a part",
            "My dad was always running late and very frantic and upset when I was growing up. One evening, on our way somewhere, he ordered a bunch of food at a fast food drive thru window asking that his burger not have mayonnaise on it. As he began to roll forward he quickly checked and realized they had put EXTRA mayonnaise on it. This prompted my dad to speed devilishly around the fast food joint pull back through the drive thru and hurl the burger *SPLAT!* at the closed drive thru while cursing their incompetence. As an 8 year old this sort of behavior left a lasting impression with me and to this day it\u2019s very hard to rile me up because I never want to be like the man he was that day.",
            "Once my mum and I were at an awesome Chinese place. They had the best pork buns.\n\nSo I was sitting there eating my pork bun and then the restaurant owner comes up to ask if we would like anything else. Me being about 7, pointed to the kid\u2019s drink menu at a drink called \u201cthe fire truck\u201d that sounded like an absolutely amazing drink. We ordered that and I kept eating my pork bun. When the drink arrived, it was a bright orange Fanta with lemonade and ice cream drink. My mum was shocked, she asked for the manager, (of course she did) and complained that it looked nowhere near a fire truck.\n\n*deep sigh* please end me ",
            "My dad started throwing a huge fit at movie theater snack prices, which, to be fair, were utterly ridiculous. It was $6 for a bottle of water.

            "Mom bought a pair of boots at a large, fancy department store. Wore them every day for approximately 6 months. Wore them in the rain a few times and the soles were eventually starting to come loose due to wear.\n\nWhile *wearing* the boots, she marches into the store, takes them off at the counter, plonks them down on the counter and demands a refund or a new pair, because the quality of the shoes were not up to par, arguing that if it were, the soles wouldn't have started coming loose. Note - she no longer has the receipt at this point, but argues the boots  have the store logo on the bottom so she doesn't need one.\n\nShe proceeds to argue for almost 20 min.  Refuses to budge. Demands to see the manager. A queue has formed at this point and everyone is staring. \n\nThe manager caves. \n\nHe walks to the back, gets a new pair of boots and brings them to my mom. She puts them on right there at the counter and marches back out of the store as if nothing happened. ",
            "I haven't spoken to my mom in years, but she is 100% one of these people.   One of the most cringey things I can think of - right around 9/11 I guess, there was the whole \"anthrax in the mail\" thing going on.  My mom ordered stamps through the mail.  The stamps were delivered, along with a little note that said something about them having a powder coating on them, to absorb moisture and ensure they don't lose their adhesive.  My mom - who probably didn't even notice the powder - calls the USPS and complains about how someone mailed her anthrax with her stamps.  And when that went nowhere, she contacted all the local news outlets and had a press conference in our front yard, where she went on about why the USPS would try and poison her..  ",
            "Ohh lawdy, my mom is one of those.  But shes not the type to push her way through lines and would only talk to a manager if really need be, but due to her stern and scary personality she can really draw attention to herself.\n\nOne incident when I was around 8 or 9 was when we had to pay our immigration fees, this wasnt in the US btw but in the Philippines.  We arent Filipino citizens so we need to go both to the US embassy then the local immigration offices to pay our yearly dues while living there.  The immigration processing line was long...like DMV long & slow.  Not to mention the office was infamous for having really lazy workers who only speed up the paper work when there's a bribe.\n\nMy mom after 2 hours of waiting had enough, she actually knew the Vice Chief at that time...went to school with him. And this is how the conversation goes\n\nMom: I want to speak to the Chief Wiggum (simpson name here).\n\nOfficer: (scoffed at mom) Sorry but you cant just MEEt-\n\nMom: (cuts her off and leans in & in a low drawl) Tell Chief Wiggum, Marge is here. He know who I AM.  (looks at me then the officer). He knows who we are.\n\nOfficer had a look of panic, asks a co worker to watch his booth, and leaves.  About 10 mins later this Jolly fellow, bit of sweat on his brow comes by. Hugs my mom and gave his officers a look.  Mom took me by the hand and we were ushered to his office.  \n\nIn the 15 mins we were there, our papers were personally processed by him.  In the next few years we would just walk into his office to get this done and had this perk till he passed away.\n\nLearned later that day of my memory, Chief Wiggum was in a board meeting when he got called and abruptly left. Due to my mom's actions it was assumed she was his mistress and me the love child.  He got quite the teasing of a lifetime bec of that. \n\nAs a note: My mom was the alumni secretary of her school, is also one of the most beautiful in her class and is a badass.  I never knew Chief Wiggum has been to our house many times during reunions.  Many of my mom's classmates moved to being big bosses in govt offices and she pulled this prank a few times much to the amusement of her friends.  They love her to bits. ",
            "I was sitting in the library in middle school with my mom and my advisor getting my assessment done to transition to highschool. A bunch of other kids were at other tables with their parents and advisors. We were having a decent conversation but as soon as my advisor went over my test results for math my mother blew up.\n\nI scored in the 99th percentile, ahead of kids in the honors classes. My mom was screaming and ranting in front of everyone else there. All the students were looking at us. She wanted to know why they had held me back. Why they never put me in one of the high school math classes. And when the advisor recommended not sending me to summer school to complete algebra, it just made her furious.\n\n I remember seeing my crush's face and when he locked eyes with me I died a little in that chair. \n\nThing was, I wasn't some math genius. She just forced me to learn algebra in my free time. That year. So they couldn't have figured it out because it didn't happen until a few months prior. \n\nAnd she knew it. \n",

            "My parents are terrible tippers. They genuinely believe that excellent service = 10% tip. I have explained to them numerous times how servers tip out, etc. and they still think anything over 10% is generous. ",
            "In this case, I feel it was justified, but one time as a ~14 year old, a store tried to say that I was stealing a lipliner as my mom and I were walking out of the store. It was my chapstick that they didn't even sell at that store. My mom went OFF on them. It felt good to know someone had my back. \n\nTbh as I've gotten older, I've realized my mom just expects a standard and if it's not being met, she communicates it reasonably if a little tersely. I on the other hand am just less confrontational by nature and will likely just brush a lot of stuff off as a customer. ",
            "As the manager in a LOT of these stories, I just want to say that the amount of time I have to encourage people to tell me when things are wrong greatly outnumbers the times people demand to see me without warrant.  Yes, of course, I have had people make a bee line to me and start a conversation with \"are you the manager?  Well...<unleash torrent of BS anger>\".  But I also bartend periodically and usually have to encourage my patrons to send something back if they dont like it.  It's alarming how often someone will get an undercooked burger or a drink they dont like and would rather sit quietly in fear of being \"that person\" than to commit to letting me fix the problem.\n\nSo those of you reading and saying \"I'll never complain\" PLEASE understand, my job is to make you happy with your service and to ensure you want to come back.  If something is wrong, we are not mind readers, tell us.  I'd rather you mention it to me, a server or a bartender than to feel bad and never come back.  Correcting a mistake is not the same as bitching me out because your mid rare burger has some pink or your empty vodka tonic was too \"weak\".",
            "My dad is kind of a drunk. A rich drunk. We were out at an extremely nice restaurant in our small town, a very foodie and chic place that had only been open for a couple of years and had since become my favorite restaurant. I was sitting at a table with my siblings and cousins (all of us college-age), while my dad was sitting with my aunt and uncle and mom at a table nearby. By the time we get our food, the parents are still sitting there chugging their wine with no food. My dad starts getting upset. I hear him call the waitress over. She brings them some bread and leaves them alone. We finish our meals and our parents are still sitting there without food and several empty bottles of wine. My mom is essentially fall asleep at this point. My father, furious, starts banging his fists on the table, shaking all of the silverware. The waitress goes into the kitchen to find the chef, but she is apparently taking too long. My dad storms into the kitchen. I hear him SCREAMING at the top of his lungs like a fucking toddler. The chef calmly, politely walks him back to his table. He sits him down and, in the calmest voice possible, says, \"Fuck you, sir. Now, get the fuck out of my restaurant.\" We have not been back since.",
            "I was 14 and my mom did this shit at BK on my birthday because she didn't think the girl had the right attitude.  I remember being like \"please don't do this\" even though I agreed the girl had a nasty attitude(mom's partially deaf and the girl refused to speak louder or more clearly even after being told that plus rolling her eyes and twice getting the order wrong) because I didn't want a scene.  My mom was determined to speak with the manager though and wouldn't take our food until she did.  Instead of getting the manager the girl decided she wanted to come around the counter and scream in my mom's face for being a \"deaf old bitch\".  She swung on my mom and I jumped on the girl with my brother to keep her off my mom.  She bit me twice.  Police got called.  We were banned from BK after the manager came out and took the employee's side.  Cops did nothing because the girl was 16.\n\nNever been more embarrassed or angry.  Ruined my whole birthday I should have said I wanted McDonald's instead.  Oh well."

It's 99% from the City of Chattanooga (or maybe Lookout Mountain)  municipal water supply.  \n\nOf course, with such a wet area, old electrical wires going back to the Great Depression, and 300 feet underground, it sputters, or shorts out and stops every now and then.  The first rule in the Falls Room is \"make everybody leave immediately if the power goes out\", not for safety, but because the fable agreed-upon will be shown as fake.",

            "It's not an NDA. it's a secrecy agreement with DOD that elapsed after 25 years.\n\nI worked as a programmer for the US Air Force on the global USAF budget in 1979 through early 1981.  There was a period of time after Reagan became a leading candidate, but before he won the election or took office.  Jimmy Carter was a lame-duck president, and many senior officers really, really hated him.\n\nDuring this time, the USAF had flown the B1.  Not the B1A, not the B1B, this was when it was just the B1.  People had spent a significant portion of their careers working on delivering the B1 program.  They really, really believed in the B1 as a strategic long range supersonic bomber.\n\nJimmy Carter *hated* the B1.  He viewed it as a wasteful, unnecessary, bloated program designed to keep the builders afloat at the expense of the taxpayer.  He had cancelled the project in something like 77.  But a couple (?) flying examples were available, but never to see service.\n\nReagan *loved* the B1.  It was everything he loved about our military programs.  Fast, sexy, high-tech, and better than anything the Soviets had.\n\nAll of that being said, here's what happened.\n\nJimmy Carter gave explicit orders that the only two (? not certain ?) B1's currently flying be broken up into parts, the program completely cancelled, the engineering materials be archived at the Pentagon, and all funding ended.  He wanted direct evidence sent to him that this had happened, in the form of pictures of the broken up aircraft.\n\nRonald Reagan was informed of this order by sources in our organization.  Reagan let it be known that Carter's order was absolutely *not* to be followed under any circumstances.\n\nNow, where do I come in?  I was just this guy working on the AF budget.  It was a top secret clearance, mainly because any analyst could correlate money to named projects, both globally and on bases.\n\nSo one day I am going over daily reports and I see this massive new expenditure for (I think?) Wright Patterson.  It's not in the approved project list.  It's not in the unapproved project list.  So clearly, it has not gone up to congress.  Yet, the money is actually *in* the dispersal.\n\nSo I go to my boss and I point it out.  It doesn't belong there, so obviously it's a mistake.  He agrees, and we reverse it.\n\nA couple of days later, all hell breaks loose when a General officer I had never seen before comes rampaging through the office demanding to know who shorted his funding.\n\nNow, at this point we get hauled into a room, sword to secrecy, and told to fund this 'maintenance' project.  What was the project?  Pay a huge team of contractors to very carefully disassemble one of the B1's, drag in parts from other aircraft, show it being crushed, and send pics to Carter.  Meanwhile, reassemble the plane and *hide* both of them inside black hangers.\n\nAnd that was why Reagan was able to have the program restarted literally within *days* of taking office.  The program was fully back online in 1981.",
            "Technically, I'm still bound by the NDA, but the company didn't know how to write NDAs. It's like they had the following conversation:\n\nLEGAL    \nHey, we need an NDA just like all these other companies have!\n\nPUBLISHER    \nDo you know how to write an NDA?\n\nLEGAL    \nNo.\n\nThe NDA was for a roleplaying game that I signed up to playtest with the group. The NDA itself actually forbade me -- the person running the game and providing feedback to the company -- from talking about it, but had no such restrictions in place for anyone I ran the game for. It only required me to sign it, not any of my players. The way it was written, I was not allowed to play the game with any of the players in the group. How they expected anyone to playtest the game, I don't know.\n\nThe way that RPG playtests are supposed to happen is:\n\n1. the company releases a playtest document,\n2. people play it, and then\n3. they make changes for another round of playtesting.\n\nWhat actually happened is the company changed the core resolution mechanic of the game in the middle of the first round of testing (in the middle of a long message forum thread), based on the feedback of people who were *openly admitting they only read the rules and hadn't actually played the game*.\n\nOne of the people who stated they hadn't played the game also said **he didn't have a group of players** they were going to play it with.\n\nSo they changed the game based on nothing but feedback from people who hadn't tested anything.\n\nTo top it off, after my group actually played the game and submitted feedback we weren't invited back to the second round of playtesting.\n\nAlso we were left off the playtest credits.",

            "That married grocery store manager in his late 40's was , indeed, having sex with that 17 year old courtesy clerk in the compressor room.\n\nThis was 15 plus years ago when I was a Person In Charge, and not yet a full Assistant Store Manager.  Our store in the backroom had a couple of rooms upstairs: a large room that housed all of our electrical breakers and back up generators, and a room that housed all of our compressors that kept our freezers and coolers running.  Both were locked at all times for security reasons. They were accessible only through the backroom.\n\nThe 17 year old courtesy clerk (bagger), had worked there for a while. She was, uh, not the best worker.  She had a habit of disappearing for a half hour or hour at a time.  I, and the other PIC's complained and tried discipline, but the store manager blocked it.  So, we just dealt with it.  Yes, she was an attractive blonde.\n\nI was in charge one night and we got an alarm that one of the compressors was low.  It was my job to check the level, record the compressor number, and turn it in.  When I went up to the room, the door was propped open with a bucket.  I assumed whoever worked in the room last left it open.  If you have never been in a compressor room before, I have to tell you that it is LOUD!  Our store had several diesel engines that powered the compressors.  \n\nI proceed in to the back of the room, come around a corner to see the girl, not quite naked, but not fully clothed, being...serviced by our store manager (who had left for the day hours ago).  Neither saw me and I hightailed it out of there.  \n\nI wrestled with what to do.  I was worried about my career at the time, so I called the security hotline and made an anonymous call and told them in vague terms what happened and that they should contact me about details.  I'm 100% certain that they knew it was me that called.  \n\nA couple of days later, the store manager is suspended, and I'm interviewed, the Assistant Store Manager is interviewed, and the PIC's.  They tell us not to discuss it, so of course we did.  I was a little late to the party.  Almost everyone knew.  \n\nThe store manager would use his store keys to come into the backroom, meet the courtesy clerk, and then would hook up in the compressor room.  She was not the first teenager he had done this with at this store and others.  \n\nThey fire the store manager, and like an idiot, he sues. Dozens of people are deposed, NDA's are drawn up and signed. He thinks better of it, drops the suit and that's the last I ever heard of him.  \n\nThe girl quit right after the store manager was suspended.",

I can\u2019t tell you the name, but might I suggest that it rhymes with \u201ccase.\u201d  \n\nThey settled because they were worried that if the case went to trial, it would become public.  Then, everyone would know, for certain, that they had lied, cheated and swindled to steal homes from hardworking people.  The bank would lose when no one took out new loans with them.\n\nEdit: I received a posting on my front door.

I'm talking several million dollars of revenue disappearing in the pipeline and no one knowing what happened with it, or even caring really.\n\nThere were multiple times I had to inform clients that we had huge gaps in their costs and we needed to find the missing numbers somewhere in order to make our final reports correct and was met with the (paraphrased) reply: just sprinkle the missing costs over the existing one. We just want the final total to be correct.\n\nAll the companies cared about if the amount of money they have at the end of the year is higher than at the beginning and anything that happens in between is inconsequential.\n\nI objected at first to my bosses, saying that what we were doing was incorrect, but they said to just do as the client said. In the end, I got disillusioned and whenever our clients came with requests that made no mathematical or logical sense, I'd just execute as requested and let their analysts figure out later that the analysis they paid 6 figures for was basically nonsense. I didn't care, because I had documentation of all their requests and my objections which were thoroughly ignored. I had a few cases where clients came back disgruntled several months down the line after some in-house analyst had done a deep dive of their data and came up with objections that I had pointed out months before. I'd usually dig up the relevant emails and clear my name. My choice of action was to tell them to pound sand, but my bosses always bent over backwards for clients, so we'd have to do the cleanup I anticipated.\n\nIn the end I learned most of our economy is held together by ductape and wishful thinking.

I can assure you that in the data I was working on, this was very unlikely. The money streams I was analyzing went to other companies as costs, so if they had literally disappeared, someone would notice. This missing money was really just a case of utter incompetence. People just too lazy or stupid to properly keep track of what goes where. I'm sure that if we got all the data from partnering companies, we would eventually be able to track everything precisely.

Zoo keeper told me this while I was located in a kiosk that was situated right next to both the wolves and polar bears. Yikes. Luckily, they decided to not test the fences that day\n- A few babboons escaped. Zoo keepers had to shoot one and tranquillize the others. Supervisor told me \u201cI would be fired immediately if I called the press\u201d. Thanks.\n- A Swedish car brand called us to ask if we were willing to rent them a moose for a commercial. We told them no, we do not rent out our animals\n- Probably the biggest one: one of our zoo keepers saw that they had too much of a certain rat-like species. He was tasked to shoot them, but didn\u2019t have the heart, so he released them into the wild, without our supervisors knowing. Few years later, we have reports of these animals actually causing destruction to our dikes.

            "I worked at a very beat up zoo/amusement park. I ran the roller coaster. We weren\u2019t fancy enough to actually have a real roller coaster, with one stop button and one go button. Instead it was a shitty 2-story kid-coaster and the breaks were manual. I was one of the two supervisors/trainer for this ride because it was very difficult to learn and you could hurt someone if you weren\u2019t careful. There were people who could run the ride, but only 2 people who could actually certify and train others to run it.\n\nSo we have this hotshot, been working there for 3months. He tells our boss that he should be a trainer, he know how all the rides work yada yada and our idiot boss gives him the go-ahead. So Hotshot puts this girl, we\u2019ll call her Courtney, on the rollercoaster and trains her. It takes a good week to learn the controls and probably another few days to get comfortable enough to do it by yourself.\n\nSo I come in for my shift, hotshot waltzes up time me with a shit eating grin, \u2018guess who trained Courtney on *kiddie coaster*?\u2019. I couldn\u2019t have ran faster, by the time I had gotten to the ride, the poor girl was losing her mind. Hotshot loaded up the carts full of people and just left her after a couple hours of training. Courtney has been trained just enough to keep the coaster going slow enough it wouldn\u2019t fly off the tracks but she couldn\u2019t stop the coaster itself. \n\n\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 those people were stuck on that coaster for probably 20-30 laps when we usually just do 2. I had to sign an NDA after a whole bunch of customers threatened to sue the park. \n\nEnding of the story for those concerned: I jumped the tracks, spider monkey climbed into the control box and stopped the ride for Courtney and let her take the day for herself. So traumatizing to be poorly trained and risk severely injuring people bc some asshat took acid the bight before work and asked for a promotion to be a trainer. And my boss let him!!!",
            "Popular dog kennel I worked for would have people leave their dogs for long periods of time. Dogs would stop eating. They wouldn\u2019t tell the owners this. \n\nPeople would leave beds and special toys and treats for their pet thinking they\u2019d get these items, a little slice of home. These items would go in a trash bag and it would be set aside, treats would be thrown out. They used the excuse that it created too much laundry and that having personal items in a dogs kennel made them aggressive and protective over their stuff towards both humans and other dogs... ok but no, these are people\u2019s pets they\u2019re not fucking wolves. \n\nShort of making a Facebook post that no one would see I had no real way of telling the public and risking some bullshit lawsuit because I signed an NDA like a dummy, but I told everyone I knew with a dog to tell other dog owners not to send their dog there. Your dog can\u2019t tell you what happens when you\u2019re not around. Dogs would run into us with their tail wagging because they liked the yard workers but the conditions overall weren\u2019t great. Dogs are so good and loyal. Small spaces and loose regulations on how many dogs you can have at once. It still boils my blood when I drive by. Hopefully things there are better now.\n\n\nEdit: wow I hate that this experience was not unique.

            "This wasn't specifically under an NDA, but I kept it secret for a very long time so I wouldn't lose my job,\n\nFor nearly ten years, I worked for a major online retailer. They had some outlet stores where they would sell returned items and extra inventory at a discount. I worked in one of these outlets for my first few years at the company, and became an assistant store manager there.\n\nOne day, my boss and I were by the dumpsters behind the store, going through our damage/destroy pile (merchandise that was damaged or expired, and had to be thrown out). The stuff had to be rendered unusable, so we'd take out some frustration smashing this stuff up before in went in the bin. One of the items was this retro-style record player that had come in on a pallet of merchandise samples, but it wouldn't even turn on.\n\nSo we're going through all this stuff, and finally got to the record player. I picked it up and smashed this thing on the ground. It didn't hurt the record player much, but the front of it cracked slightly. I picked it up, and there was a little piece of plastic sticking out of the front, like from a bag. I said to my boss, \"Hey, there's a bag of something inside this.\"\n\nWe ended up breaking the record player all the way open. Someone had disassembled it, taken all the electronic parts out of the inside, and replaced them with about 10 vacuum-sealed bags full of marijuana (this was in like 2008 or 2009, quite a while before states started legalizing recreational weed). There was at least a full pound of weed, probably more. I asked my boss WTF we should do. Should we write up a report? Call the police?\n\nMy boss told me not to say a word to anyone. He said that if anyone else at our company found out, we'd be under a microscope, people could get fired, and we'd probably end up having to deal with a bunch of new rules. He called his friend who was a police officer and explained the situation, and arranged a meeting to surrender the weed. I emptied out a cookware box, put a price sticker on it, and loaded the weed inside. My boss met me at the front register and I rang him up for the price on the box so he could get it out of the store without anyone being suspicious. He told me that he handed the weed over to his cop friend, who thought the situation was hilarious. In retrospect, there's a good chance that my boss just kept/sold it all, and the whole \"surrender it to the cops\" thing was a ruse. But I like to trust that people are honest with me.\n\nNever did find out where the weed came from, who was supposed to get it, or how it ended up at our store.\n\nTL;DR - My boss and I found a shit-ton of marijuana hidden inside a record player, smuggled it out of the store rather than telling our higher-ups and triggering an investigation.\n\nEdit: Lots of folks saying he obviously kept the weed. While I do believe that there's a chance he did, I have many reasons to believe that he didn't. First, he was a drinker, but not a pot smoker, so he wouldn't have kept it for himself. Second, he was former military (the police officer he allegedly turned the weed over to was an old army buddy) and didn't mess around with illegal activities on the level of selling large amounts of drugs. Third, he'd been comfortable at his job for a while and understandably didn't want a shakeup. Fourth, we worked together for years and became pretty close friends outside of work--there was a time when we knew every detail of each other's personal lives. I asked him like a year ago about the weed we found, long after we'd both left the company. He still maintains that he surrendered it, and I think it's unlikely that he'd still lie about it after so long (especially since I'm an avid pot smoker these days, and wouldn't care).",

            "Worked as an accountant. Basically 4 of us having 100+ clients.\n\nIdk how it is in other countries, but here for a wage company has to pay certain taxes, for health insurance, pension fund and whatever else. The tax is a set percentage, so higher the pay, higher the taxes. \n\nMost people here are on minimum wage and median is maybe a bit higher. \n\nBear in mind your pension depends on these taxes, not only if you\u2019ll get it, but also the amount you get. \n\nSo as we did wages for these companies, we were ordered through a certain loophole in the law to make those taxes lower. The employee would still get his money (usually minimum wage) but taxes for that money were far lower. So if minimum wage is $300 pension would be $200 or so. With this method pension would be $120. \n\nGiven the weird nature of taxes and how they are calculated it\u2019s very hard for someone who has no idea how they work to figure it out, and would have no idea until they receive less money.\n\nThen we fixed numbers for profit and revenue to make other taxes lesser.\n\nWe also were forced to give legal advice based on our limited knowledge of relevant laws (and as I had a law class in management studied I took I was best fitted for that but basically knew jackshit).\n\nAnd not mention selling client data to rival clients if the money was good.\n\nYeah I booked out of there (my 3 coworkers a month later) after few months cause fuck going to jail cause some people are so greedy they avoid paying the minimum to live the luxury life as business owners",

Another team sealed the rocks up using the top and bottom of the 'core' and some color-matched grout.  Bigger rocks had Long Ranged RFID readers inserted in them with gps and that was connected to a long range military transmitter.  Battery life was 4-5 years more or less.\n\nThe premise was the big rock was dropped somewhere and all the little rocks were dropped randomly in a large circumference around the big rock.   If a vehicle drove nearby or even a person on foot were to walk by, the little rocks would send notice to the big rock on how strong the vibrations were, and the system would send this back to a receiver many many miles away which could triangulate  the source of the vibration.\n\nThis was in 2004-2006 so you take a guess of where those rocks were from.",

There's a bigger issue with this in the States, because of loans, but they're trying to get to the same status in Canada where they can get insane amounts for tuition and deliver the poorest possible product that students need to take out massive loans to pay for.\n\nThey're all one company, they're all for-profit, and they're all owned and operated by the same people who are connected with DeVry, the former Education Management Corporation, and a few other terrible for-profits like the Art Institute that have been sued, shut down, and are involved in massive class-action lawsuits.\n\nThey can and will cancel programs mid-program and the students will have very little recourse for finishing their program, especially on the Toronto Film School side of things, because those online programs are not externally accredited or evaluated in any way. I saw it happen three times in eight months that they just shut programs down in the middle of things. They also won't run required courses if the enrollment is too low, making students wait however long before they can graduate. The fees are also exorbitant.\n\nThe online art schools were launched and permitted to operate under very shaky rules - because the Yorkville was granted degree-granting status for their masters level programs, they launched the Toronto Film School online programs under the idea that they could technically say they're allowed to call them diplomas since they're allowed to grant master's degrees. They also made up an \"associate\" diploma, which isn't a recognized certification in Canada, and argued that since all that really mattered were skills and portfolios, it was important that the diploma was a technically real thing or not.\n\nThey're slippery about who's teaching and developing the courses, using big names and productions that aren't technically true or connected. \n\nThey target and prey on people who can't understand what they're signing up for, and rely on emotional pressure and interviewing to get people to sign up. They're looking to find and create pain points when they do the interview, so watch out for that. If they make it sound like they're exclusive, they're not - if you have a credit card that can process that application fee and meet the barest minimum requirements, you'll be let in. \n\nThere were rampant issues with plagiarism and academic dishonesty that I heard of, too. There are some great students and instructors, of course, but you'll find those anywhere. \n If you're considering a degree there, I would strongly urge you to apply to a more honest and reputable institution!",

            "I came up with a helpful way of thinking about it. Motivation is like the push at the top of a hill to get something rolling, but it's not much useful aside from maybe keeping things going once they're started. The concepts of inertia, momentum, and crash and burn are very useful here, because I think what people get wrong is the balance between all of the variables. The less friction there is to slow down the ball, the more it will accelerate, but too much acceleration is unsustainable and will lead to instability and a high probability of crashing and burning. \n\nLet's use an example. Say you're wanting to learn a language on the side. If this is the case start by clearing the path. Clearly identify the path you want your ball to roll, maybe with learning the language you do research on the best methods of learning, and start with learning the most common words. You choose to watch your TV shows in the language to give more immersion, and find someone willing to talk with you who already speaks it. Write out a decent plan, map out the route, and identify the obstacles that get in the way. As far as the analogy goes, this is like walking down the hill and removing sticks and bushes and clearing away the frictions that are going to impede progress. \n\nSome friction is necessary though, there are limitations to your ability to do something. No one will be able to avoid the memory limitations of language learning. It is best to make small and consistent steps in a positive direction than to stop altogether or attempt to push through.\n\nMotivation is like giving it a kick. It works at first really well but constantly chasing the ball down the hill and absolutely yeeting it, like spending ten hours a day for a week drilling a language endlessly, might seem to be giving you the progress you want, but anyone will tell you how unstable that condition is. It will likely lead to crash and burn, and there might not be a ball left to roll after that. So many people will suddenly have motivation to start something and will dive in with a ferocity, neglecting all the other parts of their lives, and then find themselves discouraged completely when they can't do it. \n\nHere's the key: commit yourself to 5 minutes a day of whatever it is. Review the language for 5 minutes, do a 5 minute yoga session, study for 5 minutes the most important school item. The part that will surprise you is how easily the ball will roll on its own after you kick it. If you can't bring yourself to work on the project directly, start by making your bed or taking out the trash. I can't tell how many ruts I've gotten out of just by getting up and doing anything positive at all, and ended up doing a project for hours as a result. \n\nThe motivated state is just momentum in action, pulling you forward without effort. \n\nHope that helps",

For me it turns out the missing ingredient was actually self-belief more than anything else. A good friend ended up making me believe I was capable of things.

            "Try to set a goal that is possible, something that you know you can do and want to do, generally people do things that they believe in and they want to do. \nAlso if your goal is really big try to break it down to steps, let's take for example lifting weights, you want to lift 10kg but now you can only lift 2kg, from my experience with things like this you'd try that for about 2 weeks than you'd give it up because you don't feel like you are improving enough, but if you split it to steps of adding 1kg every 3-2 weeks of working out everyday, you will feel like you are improving and you are able to reach your goals which will ultimately make you more motivated.\nAlso try to give yourself a reason to do what you do, like being healthier or looking better, those reasons can be whatever you want as long as they make you believe in what you are doing and keep you motivated to do it. \n\nAnd if you feel like this doesn't work, well there is another thing that might work but it is not something that will work for a lot of people, sometimes if you are really unmotivated and have to do things try giving yourself punishments for not doing those things, like for example if you didn't study for the test punish yourself by not playing video game tomorrow, or, if you didn't work out yesterday don't go and hang out with your friends today. \nThis can work really well if you are willing to actually give yourself good punishments.\nAnother alternative way is to give yourself treats for doing the things you need to do, this might not work as well because you might be willing to give it up because you wouldn't have gotten the treats if you didn't make this rule in the first place, so you are practically losing nothing for not doing what you need to do.",

            "You have to do things that make you uncomfortable. If you force your self into uncomfortable situations it builds your mental resilience and helps you push forward and do things that you never thought you could do. For example I wake up at 5am everyday and take an ice cold shower after doing those 2 extremely uncomfortable task\u2019s (I\u2019m not a morning person) I have the motivation to get everything  I want to get done completed. I used to be an extremely lazy coach potato who had no motivation to do anything in life, didn\u2019t want to go to school, didn\u2019t wanna work, I absolutely hated physical activity, just wanted to smoke weed with my friends and chill that\u2019s it. But now i workout daily, study daily, and work towards my goal of trading for a living every single day. I attribute all of this to me doing a bunch of uncomfortable activities that forced my brain to change its way of thinking. Getting disciplined is the key to success.

Start with the menial shit, wake up, brush your teeth or whatever you routine is, minus any fun stuff(television, phone surfing, etc.), and take care of business. Whether it be work, chores, whatever. Then, gradually introduce the things you like to do, a hobby or similar. Then, when you've finally done all of that and you feel satisfied with your day, preferably toward the last 2-4 hours of your day, then you can finally sit your ass down and binge some TV, or scroll social media and reddit, or whatever it is you do to mindblank and relax.

            "I think the most important thing is to stop buying into your own bullshit. When I procrastinate I lie to myself and I believe those lies. I lose track of what is truly important. 95% of the stuff that you know you have to do but that you don't feel like doing isn't hard at all. You are probably just lazy. I am, I know that much. But all it takes me to get back on track is 5 minutes. I sit down, no TV, internet, no stimulation, alone with my thoughts. And I plan out my day. I reflect what I want to do and why I have to do it. And in the end I ask myself \"What if tomorrow I were diagnosed and a doctor told me I only got 6 months to live? Would I be happy? What would I change, what would I regret?\". Looking at your life from this point of view helps you realize what is truly important. And you will understand that comfort isn't. It is part of our nature to seek easy comfort. Thats how we survived for 100.000 years as a species. But our society has changed and we need to realize that.   \nYes, rest is important. You don't wanna burn out. But most lazy people aren't even close to a burn-out. Make yourself suffer for a period of time. Try fasting for 3 days. Exercise. Don't use the internet for a week. Look at people who join the military. They are exposed to this artificial suffering to realize how little the human body actually needs and that most of our needs are just wants.",
            "Every person is different. For me, it's facing tasks slowly, but steadily. I have been living with depression for 8 years now, so here are a few tips that helped me get my a-levels, apprenticeship, job and university despite feeling constantly drained and regularly wanting to die. Maybe this helps someone.\n\n1. Breaking up tasks into the smallest parts possible. And when I say smallest parts, I MEAN SMALLEST. Let's say the overall goal is to exercise. Then I make it the goal to just get up and put my gym clothes on and that's it. Nothing more. If I accomplish that goal, great! Then the next goal is to put the workout video on, and so on. If I need a break between these tasks, I take a break. I also let myself have the option to quit everytime in between these tasks. Usually I quickly get into that mindset of \"well I've already come this far, seems dumb to waste that.\" If I fail or quit, I accept that and try again in a few hours. And again, and again, and again.\n\n2. Do it NOW, or schedule it to a precise date. I also schedule my breakdowns as much as possible and start tasks as early as possible to have the least time pressure, because I know that depression is coming for me and I need enough time to be slow and get the breaks that I need.\n\n3. Combining tasks I don't want to do with something pleasurable. E.g. Listening to music, doing it in bed while cuddling, if that's possible. I am a huge Harry Potter fan, and my favorite strategy for when I have to study is to put on one of those common room/great hall/hogwarts library ambience videos on YouTube, so I can pretend to study at Hogwarts. Just don't choose eating or snacking, because that will become unhealthy real fast.",

One day, I realized in one of my \u201cclasses\u201d (I use quotes because they were so loose that you could barely call them that with a straight face), that the entire continuation school was just a big baby day care for stupid fuck ups or lazy \u201csmart\u201d kids, like me, who thought they were too good for school because everyone went through life in their childhood years telling them how smart and gifted they are.\n\nSo anyway, I realized that our classes were essentially just big kid arts and crafts and tougher classes like economics boiled down into babytime concepts and expectations.

So I set 3 days a week that I would go out and run in the dark. Then I would continually repeat that day (or week) until I got it done without stopping more than allowed. I think the 12 weeks took about 5 months... but now I can continually run 10km non-stop and run approx 40 km a week. I'm not skinny by any means, but I'm just working on improving my overall health and wellbeing.\n\nWhat motivated me was seeing the mental changes in myself, finally sticking to something which caused a significant life change. I created a habit, and now I can't stop. All throughout COVID, and throughout the bushfires prior to that, I had HEAPS of people commenting on how I'm still out there running. At this point, I can't stop, because if I do I'm only setting myself back. So my motivation is losing all I've lost, and even the idea of that scares me. Lol.\n\nEdit: To be clear, I was unable to even complete week 1 day 1 which is 30 seconds of running intervals. But I had read on a Reddit thread that it takes 3 weeks to create a habit, so I knew I needed to just STICK to something 100% for 3 weeks, and then it will get easier.

I.e I never wanted to have to worry about money / bills etc nor did I want my wife or kids to have to worry about education and other costs so I focused all my free energy on overachieving and building skills that would allow me to do jobs that were very competitive and not easily replaced. \n\nThat mindset takes over starting with little things like food choices and good habits.. sure I could have some pizza and lay in bed on a Saturday morning .. but I think about the types of people that do that vs the types of people who don\u2019t and ask myself what group do I want to be in.\n\nOnce again - not trying to be offensive, just speaking from the heart.",

            "Here is a list of things me and wife did do. You'll see why. \n\nWe got married in a backyard airbnb with our moms. It was what we wanted from the beginning. But in the whole wedding process it had blown up to become a dream wedding complete with prime rib. Something I could've never have afforded had it not been presented to me in such a lovely fashion. Long story short 30k wedding for under 12k because of a surprise win at the venue which was a ploy to get the rental for free but only if you use their vendors. \n\n\nI quit my job of 10yrs to take a chance on a new job. I put in notice on Mar 2nd. I left Mar 19th. My state lockdown happens the next day.  Mar 23rd I'm informed my new position is on hold till crisis is over. So... I've become a bonsai and raised bed garden enthusiast. In the middle of summer. In Phoenix.  Yeah i went to college. So?\n\n\nMy wife has worked from home since covid. She loves working from home. But hates that I'm home all day. So I should get a job right?  But I shouldn't. \n\nAmong all of this. I know the day I left my work because it was Mar 17th when my fiance at the time told me she was pregnant. I'm having a baby and I just quit my job. Great. \n\nI can't get a job because I'm here taking care of her. And the house. And the dogs. And tortoises. What job should I get now?  Majority of easy jobs to get are Frontline.  Not risking my health or my families.... work from home? 900sqft 2bdrm apartment. 2 people can't work from home in the same space we have right now. So we need a new place. \n\nTime to house hunt during a pandemic! \nSo we bought a house.  My wife has never set foot in her future home and I've only been in it once for about 2min. Yes I did enough research it is good. Killer deal. We move in 3 weeks. \n\nUgh not to mention all the lost money from buying the suits. The dresses. The flowers. They were all practically fully paid for since the wedding was April 5th. Less than 2 weeks away. We were able to get about 40% refunded. Most wouldn't budge because it was us choosing to change our date so they would apply it to the new date but no refund.... no ty. Don't need to have a $12k 1st birthday for our new baby. They really suggested that. I'm not mad truthfully. Impressed as a human.  But as a customer was not something I wanted to hear the day after the canceled wedding.\n\nSo let's recap.\n\nDuring this pandemic I have\n\nPlanned and canceled a wedding.\n\nLeft a job for a new job that has been put on hold. \n\nBought a house my wife has never seen in person.\n\nListened to my sons heartbeat for the first time on Facebook messenger.\n\n\n\nThat last one I'll never be able to replace.\n\nEdit: wow!

You must change yourself, because whether you like it or not, change occurs, and you can't control the majority of those changes. So change the ones you *can*.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#4. Friends come and go.\n\nThe reason you have friends *right now* is because of geographic (and, to a not-to-be-dismissed degree, socioeconomic) reasons. Once you stop going to the same schools, and movie theaters, and book stores, and restaurants, etc. the friendships will begin to diminish. You will more likely grow apart over time, not together. It's possible, sure. But don't make any heavy bets, because you'll lose money on those bets more often than not.\n\nYou'll need to find new ways of making friends. College is yet another school-related location that can help. Clubs help. Hobby-related activities help. \n\nRight before COVID lockdowns here in LA, I made a friend with my tattoo artist, barely knew him otherwise. He mentioned he and his friends were gonna start watching crappy 80's horror movies on the weekend. I was down. Then the lockdowns hit, and we couldn't do it. And I'm bad at making friends with new people I've barely met, so I've made no attempts to reconnect. Maybe when I get back to the tattoo shop. Goes back to point #1.\n\nMaking friends will be hard. But if you're lucky, and make enough connections, it won't be *as hard*.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#5. \"Expect the best, prepare for the worst.\"\n\nHaving a positive outlook is healthy. If you're perpetually despondent, hopeless, and listless, you probably have depression, and that needs tending to. But ONLY having a positive outlook will lead you to trouble. You must prepare for the times when life throws a wrench into your car tire. Saving money is necessary. Blowing it all and wondering how you're gonna eat next week is pointless drama you've placed upon yourself. Get a checking account, a savings account, and a retirement account. Even if you only put $10 / week into the thing, AND LEAVE IT THE HELL ALONE, you'll likely have a nice rainy day fund when the shit hits the fan. \n\nLiving in a fire-prone region? make sure you have proper equipment in case wildfires become too dangerous. Earthquake kits, first aid kits, bottled water, blankets, etc. \n\nIf you don't live in a place with reliable mass transit, best make sure you have a car that's in good working order. In that car, ensure you have a fresh spare tire (replace tires every 5 years, unless otherwise indicated by professionals). Know how to change a tire: loosen those lugnuts FIRST, then jack up the car, remove tire, replace tire, tighten lug nuts with wrench, lower the car SLOWLY AND SAFELY, finish tightening lugnuts, etc. Know how to bleed brakes (get a friend to help). Replace wipers and fluid before the rainy season as needed. SO much car care is necessary, going back to point #1.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#6. Kissing ass and networking are IMPORTANT.\n\nIf you think you're going to have a *remotely* successful life, you're going to be kissing a LOT of ass. It doesn't mean completely shoving your nose up someone's ass, but sometimes it might. If you are regularly on someone's radar in a good way, especially someone with an inkling of power, you're going to be one of the first people they think of for a promotion or raise or relocation to an exotic land. You're going to have to wear a lot of \"masks\" when you're around various people. Or you could just become like me and avoid that, keep your \"self respect\", and be poor and ignored. \n\nI was \"discovered\" last year. Like, legit. I was on a podcast with a coworker (I was the interviewee), and **an executive producer of one of the nation's largest morning shows** heard the podcast. He found me a month later, talked to me, and helped me get started. He gave me a lot of advice that I never used (regarding kissing ass, etc.), because I'm a fuck up. After a month, he dropped me, told me I needed to \"be my own cheerleader\". Coulda been a host on the radio in Los Angeles, but I'm not.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#7. Hard Work & Luck.\n\nLuck starts your journey, hard work continues it. Anyone successful who doesn't say they are lucky (or outright refuses to acknowledge it) are not people to look up to. [Survivorship Bias](https://xkcd.com/1827/) is a huge factor. If you look at all the people who've worked hard and were successful, and then found everyone else who did similar, but aren't successful, you can factor in luck for the successful. Every. Single. Time. This [Veritasium video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LopI4YeC4I&vl) better explains everything.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#8. \"No man is an island.\"\n\nYou can't do this alone. Everyone who gets anywhere in life is doing it with the help of others. They could be supportive parents. Friends who love them for who they are. Teachers that see the possibilities. Employers who see growth. Coworkers that empower their workday. Baristas at the coffee shop with a smile. Strangers on the train who hold the door for 1 extra second (don't go nuts on this one, people, there's a threshold). If you are surrounded by supportive and loving people, life, in all its difficulties and flaws and foibles, will become much less work. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n#9. Life is a game.\n\nIf you don't play, you lose. If you don't play by the rules, you lose. If you don't play well with others, you lose. No matter how much you want it or not, you're in the game. You have no choice. And your only opponent is you. Goes back to #6, and ties in with #8. And despite how shitty the game is, again, if you choose not to play, you will reap zero rewards. You might get a ball to the face, too.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#10.

            "A few years ago, I was at my lowest point in life. Several people close to me had passed away unexpectedly, I was being bullied every day at my job, my life was falling apart. I was past being depressed - I just couldn't imagine waking up another day. So I'd planned my suicide - bought a one-way plane ticket, got sleeping pills, and wrote a series of suicide notes.  \n\n\nOn the day I was to fly out to fulfill my 'plan', there was a terrible accident on the freeway to the airport. It was shut down both ways. So I drove into a nearby pub to have a beer and wait out the traffic. The second I sat on the patio with my drink, a gentleman asked if he could sit with me. Whatever, I thought, sure, who cares. He told me that whatever I was doing next was a terrible idea and I would regret it. I thought, who is this random fucker?  But I listened.\n\nHe said that he sensed I was in pain, but that I had an incredible life ahead of me, and that this was not the way my story was supposed to end. Again, I'd never met this guy in my life, and hadn't mentioned a word to him about my 'plan'. He asked me to hand him my keys and my wallet, and he'd give them back to me after I talked and he listened.  \n\n\nI poured my heart out to this random guy.  Told him all my traumas and pains in life and why I was heading to the airport on a one-way ticket to kill myself in a cemetery across the country where my family was buried. He just listened. And then he pulled out a lighter,  asked me to pull out my suicide letters and helped me burn them. He told me I was worth so much to the world and that after I finished my drink, I needed to head home and get some sleep. He told me I was going to be okay tomorrow, and I believed him. He then gave me my keys and wallet back.  \n\n\nI left that afternoon and went home, hugged my family. Got some sleep - and the next day, I started working on myself - finding a therapist, a new job. Years later, I'm in a fantastic place in life, so, so far from where I was that day. To this day, no one in my life knows how close I came to killing myself. But this random stranger just somehow understood me. And saved my life.\n\nI never saw him again, I don't even know his name. It's the most unexplained thing that has ever happened to me. And I think about that guy every day - so, thank you, kind stranger, for saving my life that random September day on a pub patio.",
            "To this day, there was a kid in my class that no one else remembers. I distinctly remember playing with this kid in kindergarten, and we were pretty much inseparable. About a month past Christmas break he disappeared. No one remembered him. Not the teachers, or the others in my class. No one. I even asked the school counselor if he was okay, and she humored me by going through records to see if he\u2019d transferred. She couldn\u2019t find a thing. I think about it at least once a month.",
            "When I was 13 I moved into my brother's bedroom, as it is an extension to the original house with an en suite and is far larger than my old room. Originally it was a tiny boxroom with the entrance to the attic but was extended outwards. The attic entrance is always open, with a permanent set of metal ladders angled up into it. There's a picture of it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/leyfdl/the_attic_entrance_context_in_comments/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), the grey arch is where the original room ended.\n\nWithin a few weeks of moving in I'd wake up in the middle of the night to see a figure staring down me, with a white head like a skull and formless black body. It would slowly move down to the foot of my bed and stare me until I moved, at which point it would sink into the floor.\n\nJust sleep paralysis, right? And I'd begged to move into the room and had just got it set up so I wasn't going to leave. I didn't really talk about it to anyone, it gradually became less frequent over time.\n\nEight years after this my brother mentioned at a get together that he used to have a sleep paralysis demon when he lived in that room a half joking, half freaked out way to other people when the topic of them came up. \n\nHe described the exact same fucking thing.\n\nNeither of us mentioned it to anybody else at the time it was happening so we have no explanation for us both experiencing the same thing. \n\n~~I am currently back from uni myself due to corona with that dark void in the ceiling in the corner of my room.~~",
            "Was delivering newspapers on my paper route when a longtime customer pulled his car next to me and asked me to just give him his daily newspaper now because he was going on a long trip.  I handed him his newspaper then skipped his house as I continued my route.\n\nThe next day I was collecting the weekly fees (you used to have to go collect the money back then, no internet payment yet) and I went to his house to collect my fee.  His wife answers and promptly complains that I missed her house on my deliveries the day before.\n\nI explained to her that her husband pulled up next to me, I told her what he said and that I gave him the paper.  She started crying, told me that he had died a couple weeks ago and it was obviously not possible that I spoke with her husband the day before. \n\nI know what I saw and nearly 30 years later I still think about that situation.  I have no way to logically explain what happened and it still give me the creeps.",
            "I don\u2019t think I have ever talked about this to anyone coz it still hurts to think about it, but yeah I really wanted to share this here.\nAlso, this is quite a long one.\n\nI had this neighbour who was around 30 and he was such a sweet guy (lets say his name was Adam). I felt like he was the kind of older brother i\u2019ve always wished for. He was an all rounder; gym freak, good at singing and playing every possible instrument, dance, sports, cooking etc. He used to take me and my younger brother to the beach wherever possible.\nSo this incident took place a 3 days before my 14th birthday. I was on my way to school in the morning when this absurd scene of flashed in front of my eyes; it was him getting into an accident and dying. it felt soo real i almost wanted to cry but then i told myself maybe its because i had watched a movie with a character dying the previous night. \nI continued with the day and it was almost 8pm when my parents got a call from someone. I could see their face change expressions. Once the call ended, they said they needed to go somewhere and would be back in a while. I wasn\u2019t sure what was happening but i felt that something wasn\u2019t right. \nNext morning i woke up to the worst news of my life; Adam was no more. Apparently he met with a major accident the previous night and died on the spot. I didn\u2019t know how to react because a few hours before he died, i did have a bad feeling. For days I couldn\u2019t even sleep and I blamed myself because i felt like maybe i could have warned him about it and maybe he would still gonna be alive. \nIt\u2019s been almost 7 years since this incident took place but every time i think about it, my heart aches and i still wished he was alive. :( \nI still can\u2019t figure out why i had that sort of a feeling hours before it actually happened and it scares me.",
            "Driving home from work late one night I was followed and it was weird. I left the hospital and turned off the main road to a bunch of side streets I would take. At one point I noticed a car behind me that made the same left turn as me. They sped up to get behind me. I thought nothing of it. Then I briefly thought about running to 7-11 to grab some food and turned on my right signal. But I realized I had food at home, so I turned my signal off. The car behind me turned on their right signal and turned it off as well exactly as I had. At that point I got a bit spooked. So I turned my right signal on and they did as well. Instead at the next intersection I turned left even though my right signal was on. They did as well. They proceeded to follow me through a series of odd turns. Eventually I turned onto a cul-de-sac I knew about and figured I could turn around there and look at the driver to see who was following me. As I approached the end of the road they figured out what I was doing. They stopped and did a fast k-turn and sped off. It was weird. Still don\u2019t know who it was.",
            "I used to work in a nursing home where I cared for dementia patients. Every patient on the hall I worked on would steal spoons from dinner to give to \u201cthe kids\u201d because \u201cthey like shiny things.\u201d It got to the point where once a week I\u2019d have to go through everyone\u2019s room to take back the spoons. I asked the patients about the kids many times but never got a good answer. I\u2019d hear things like \u201cthey just live here\u201d or \u201cthey stand outside in the snow and look in the windows\u201d or \u201cthey\u2019re my friends who visit.\u201d Wouldn\u2019t be so weird if they all didn\u2019t do it, but it was everyone, the ones who were still capable of speaking anyways.

            "I was about 7 or 8 and I was at a housewarming party at my aunt and uncle's new house. It wasn't extravagant, it was a lower- to middle-class mobile home in South Carolina. Wasn't really a big party, just the family, some barbeque out back, red solo cups, all boxes in the garage and not even distributed to their proper rooms. The only things that were \"unpacked\" and where they should be was the furniture. So anyway, two of my cousins were there and one of them had a friend over and we were all playing together, some made-up fantasy game where we were pretending to be princesses or something. All of the adults were out back drinking, and I emphasize, there were only four people inside the house: me, my two cousins, and the friend. The house was set up in such a way that the kitchen was the first room you walked into from the front door, then there was the living room, then past that was the hallway with the bathroom and bedrooms. I was in the living room on the couch because that was the \"princesses' bedroom\" and I was kinda just sitting there idle while the others got snacks. With no warnings or no other sounds, every single one of us hears a female voice let out an ear-piercing, gut-wrenching, overall horrifying *scream* in the bathroom. It was clear as day and it was so loud and sudden that it made me jump, as the living room was right next to the hallway. My cousins and their friend run out from the kitchen and look at me sitting there, and then we all run from the living room into the bathroom. Not a single person is in there, and nothing is displaced because there wasn't anything unpacked anyway except the toilet paper. We turned back around to see about 3 adults coming in from the back door because they had heard it too, coming from inside, so it wasn't any of them. \n\nWhat gets me about it is this: we have all since entertained the idea that it was a prank no one has fessed up to yet, but in order for it to have been a corporeal being, they would have had to somehow get into the bathroom without me seeing them from the couch, screamed, ran out of the bathroom to either the backdoor (without any of the four kids in the living room seeing) or out a window in one of the bedrooms. All of the bedroom windows were locked from the inside, so if they escaped that way, someone would have had to lock it and go out the back door, which again, we would have seen. One of the creepiest things that's happened to me. And before you cry \"speaker hidden somewhere,\" that was one of the first things that my uncle checked for when he ran inside and was told by us that none of us had done it. Me and my cousins think it's either something supernatural or something that the adults did, and all of the adults that were there think that one of us screamed and lied about it because we were all in the bathroom when they came in. Either way, the mood at the party was killed really fast after that. Everyone was confused and a little on edge and there wasn't any of that self-satisfied undertone that someone who just played a really good practical joke would have been showing. It was a pretty blood-curdling sound.",
            "My last year at uni, I lived in a four bedroom house, with a ground floor, then two floors with two bedrooms each. My friends had the first floor bedrooms, I was on the second floor, and the bedroom next to me was empty because the guy who had rented it was staying with his girlfriend. I don't think he ever slept there. My bedroom and his had small crawl-space cupboards in the corners.\n\nI come home from uni one day to find my friends discussing noises sounding like footsteps that they've heard from my floor at night, when I was asleep. I laugh, because apparently these noises are loud and I have heard nothing. \n\nBecause I don't believe them, I offer to go look at the crawl spaces. We go upstairs, I open the door of the empty room, and right as I open the door, the door to the crawl space in the other corner of the room slams shut.\n\nWe freak out. There's no reason for that door to have been open in the first place. So we grab kitchen knives, hole up in one of their rooms, and wait for a friend to come and check the cupboards and attic.\n\nWe never found out what those noises were, but it was the scariest thing that happened the whole year we were there.",

Some guy immediately came up and offered to tow me to the next off-ramp with a tow strap. He dropped me off, and I tried giving him some money.\n\nHe declined, telling me to instead do something nice for something else.\n\nA week later, there was a rare downpour as I got in my car (same one, fixed) after work. Two scruffy-looking guys came running up to me and one said, \u201cHey brother, we missed our bus.\u201d He wanted to know if I could give the two of them a ride. This was not the best part of town, and I wouldn\u2019t have been inclined to let them in, but I remembered what that Good Samaritan had told me. Pay it forward. OK, I said, hop in.\n\nWe drove onto the freeway and I made all my usual turns heading home. It was the same way my two passengers wanted to go. After a while we got to an exit where they asked to be let off.\n\nIt was the same exact spot, in a city of millions of people, where that other guy had unhitched my car from his truck and told me to do something nice for someone else.",
            "A Ghost saved my life in a haunted OLD Shakespearean Theater by telling me that a plank that edged along a wall, which was the only way to get to the furthest corner of the building,  60 ft above the stage, was missing a section. and warned me that I would die. \n\n1985.   \n\nI had worked there all summer when I was 17, and had never seen this guy before. \n\nI had landed a cool job as a stage operations crew the summer after high school and worked the \"upper theater\" high above the stage, on the catwalks. \n\nI was working in a far corner of a theater's rafters through my lunch break so I could leave early that day, and was asked to walk off the catwalk, cross a wooden plank, and drop a rope down, and pull up a larger rope to tie off on the rafters.  We were getting ready for the season, and slowly stringing lights and scenery to the \"drops\" that were bars on pulleys and counterweights. \n\nAs  I left the decentlly made catwalk, I stepped onto a plank and couldn't see in the middle of the building, but could see a plank rising upward on the other side of the darkness.  'Ok, it must hit a platform there at the bottom and go up again'. I thought. \n\nI walked 4-5 steps down into a very dimly lit part of the rafters on the plank when a man stopped me. \n\n\"Turn around slowly. The plank is missing. No light.  Get light\".\n\n\"F i i i i n nnnnneee.\" I said in a sarcastic teenage voice. \n\nI turned around and got back on the catwalk,  walked to the ladder and climbed down to the stage to get a flashlight. \n\nMy boss asked \"Why are you down here?\" \n\n\"I need a light,  and your guy said a plank was missing and to get a light\" \n\n\"What guy? You were the only one up there\". \n\n\"The old guy with the beard and wool cap\". \n\nMy boss, who headed the technical/carpenter/electrical part of the theater was in his late 60s and had worked in that theater for nearly 40 years.  He looked amused at first. Laughing,  at me asking \"how'd you know about that? \n\n\"Know about what?\"  I came down for a flashlight so I could see. \n\n\"You're serious?  you saw him?. It must have been 1954, and a rigger fell from the rafters and died. He fell all the way to the stage.  I think his name was John. In the '74 my assistant made up a story about talking to him, but back then we were all smoking something. what are you on?\" \n\n\"Nothing. come with me let's see if it's missing \" \n\nSo he did. \n\nSure enough the plank was missing.  There was the plank I was on.  A platform, NOTHING,  and a platform with a plank from that platform to the upper corner of the building.  From my vantage point, it looked like plank, platform, plank, platform, plank. \n\nIn the dust along the plank were my footprints leading right to the edge. One more step and I would have fallen to the stage.  below us was a thick fabric curtain that separated the stage from the rafters, blocking light from below. \n\nIn the horizontal folds of the curtain. A wool cap. \n\nTo this day I've not stepped back into that theater.",

She made a great tent companion while on backpacking trips.  Bears, racoons and skunks would all get fair warning if they came within range of out campsite.   One morning we woke up from a night without interruptions in the back country of SW Colorado and I found my tents central guyline was no longer staked down by the aluminum stake that I had used but instead by a  piece of aspen branch that had been carved into what looked like a tiki statue.  Nothing too ornate but a snarling face with teeth had been carved from the bark and it had obviously been heated in a fire to give it a brown color.  My dog didn't make a sound and i apparently slept harder than I thought.  I scrambled out of the tent and looked around the small alpine lake and saw no other campers nor any sign that people had been around.  Cut my trip short and hauled ass the 8 miles back to my car.

            "We had a rescue dog years back, terrier mix.  We lived in the countryside on a wooded hillside and owned about five acres of woodland and rough fields mostly wild.  This dog loved to be up there chasing rabbits but loved her home too so would never be gone for very long.  One day she went missing.  We took our other dogs up there and searched thoroughly but nothing.  We had another friend bring his dogs, nothing.  We advertised, put up posters, we did little but search high and low for six days but nothing.  On the sixth day we had pretty much given up hope but I decided to go up one last time because I had a hunch, a tickle in my belly, about one particular area which had already been thoroughly searched.  I took a sickle and a pair of gardening gloves and hacked my way towards the centre of a huge bramble patch.  It was summer and all I could hear was birdsong and insects, but suddenly I heard a muffled yip.  I called her name and then heard her again getting excited.  She was deep underground in a rabbit warren.  I stayed calling to her until help arrived, the local fire brigade were kind enough to come and help and advise and we got her out eventually.  She ran around like a demented muddy pup and amazingly the vet said she was basically ok, had probably been getting enough moisture from eating mud to keep her alive.  I am not generally a fanciful person, but I just knew in my \u2018knower\u2019 she was there.  No explanation for it.",
            "When I was in 3rd grade I moved to a new town and into a new house. We lived in a camper in the back yard of the house while we renovated it. It was a pretty old house. Anyway during renovation we found all sorts of stuff in the walls, old bottles, old pair of glasses, letters, old newspapers, old pictures of children in school clothes.\n\nIt was a two story house and the stairs were kind of a focal point for all sorts of creepy stuff. So once you got to the top of the stairs there was a little landing before it went into two bedrooms. At night we would always leave the light on in the landing in case we had to get up to use the bathroom. Me and one brother shared a room and the other room was for our older brother. I refused to sleep upstairs due to how creeped out I was, so I always slept downstairs on the couch.\n\nOne weekend my sister, who is older than both my brothers, came to visit and was in my oldest brothers bedroom alone, as we were all at school and my mum was at work. As she was sitting up there watching tv she heard foot steps coming up the stairs and called out as she had thought my mum was home early from work. No response other than the footsteps turning around and heading back down the stairs. When she got up the look there was no one home and all doors locked.\n\nIt doesn't stop there. My oldest brother was left home alone for a week while me and my other brother and mom and dad went on a week long vacation. Naturally he had his girlfriend over for a couple nights to keep him company. One night she got up to pee around 3am and went downstairs to the bathroom where she said she heard children whispering. A couple nights later around 3-4am the gf woke my brother saying someone was in the house. They heard footsteps coming up the stairs. Since the light was on in the landing, they could see a shadow underneath the door like someone was standing there. And the door knob began to shake, luckily it was locked. They both started to freak out, and my brother jumped up out of bed. We had some of those dumb display samarai type swords that aren't even sharp and he grabbed one of those and went towards the door. They heard more footsteps running down the stairs and he bravely or stupidly followed down the stairs where he was met with an empty house. All windows and doors closed and locked. He called the police but nothing came of it.",

            "I've shared this before, but I still think it's an interesting story.\n\nI was exploring the area behind my house shortly after we moved in.  The area back there had once been a small quarry that had since filled with water. It was a pit of pond that supposedly went straight down sixty feet if you stepped into it. I was walking along the edge and I came across a backpack filled with old video game cartridges and a set of clothing just laying on the ground. They were for the N64 and we found this around 2004 so they were outdated. Next to it was a set of clothing. The clothes were laying on the ground, spread out, pants and shirt, so it looked like someone laying down. They looked like they'd been there a long time. Same with the backpack. I told my parents and they called the cops. There had been no reports of missing children or anything in the area. We never got an explanation but it was weird.\n\nEdit: just to answer some questions. I don't think it was a prank. While we were new to the neighborhood, we were renters. Also most of our neighbors were elderly. This happened in a rural Virginia town and I can't imagine anyone wasting cartridges like that since most kids were lucky to have an N64. No people adult or child had been reported by families or the neighborhood as missing for years. They never searched the quarry because they never had any reason to think there was something wrong. My sister and I went out there every day for a year or so and just.... Avoided that spot because I. Was creepy. As far as I know, they're still out there.",

I sat in the car while mom took my younger sisters to the restroom at a gas station. I was riddled with anxiety about our situation and looking down. The car door opened and I looked up. A lady that looked like a brown haired Brady mom sat in the seat and faced me. She said \u201cIt seems like you\u2019re down on your luck. Take this and give it to your mom. Tell her to pay it forward some day to someone who needs it.\u201d I looked down into my hand and there was a $100 bill. I looked up and she had disappeared. Nowhere in the parking lot, just vanished. I cried. When mom came back I told her what happened and she cried. We got gas. There was a guy selling oranges on the side of the road and we bought a bag and went to a local park that had a part of the river with a little spillway dam and went swimming and ate oranges for a couple of hours before getting back on the road.

Upon further inspection he notices there was a straight up white face almost like a mask looking over his shoulder from the attic hatch above his room. He always heard things from the attic but never saw anything. A few weeks later we went on a wrestling trip and stayed in a hotel. He showed the pic around to everyone in our room, and then some spooky things started happening. In our room we began hearing knocks on our door when nobody was there. We also saw flashes or glimpses of a figure in the mirror in our room. Everyone was a little freaked out about it and thought it could be the demon from the picture, and my friend who took it became so paranoid he played bible verses to ward any demons off all night.

            "I would cut weight/train for wrestling in high school, which meant a lot of dark-night runs at the middle school track. It was an old gravel one close to the woods with no lights. I didn't like running at the high school track for some reason so I'd just go there. I'd hold my phone to time my laps and one night while I was looking down at it, someone tackled me out of nowhere. We rolled around on the ground and he never said a word. Just grunted. Luckily, I got up and ran towards the middle school. I ran into some people and they called the cops. I left all of my stuff behind and he didn't take any of it. It was pretty strange.",
            "I was driving home from work on a long somewhat dark road. I'll admit I was tired and cold and just wanted to get home. Speed limit was 60 MPH and I was doing closer to 70. Suddenly, a girl with long blonde hair, a black coat with brown fur on the hood and jeans just showed up in front of my car. I knew there was another car to my left up ahead but it was black and all I saw was that it was stopped before I saw her. I managed to maneuver around her. I was freaked out, I turned to a side street and stopped to figure out what was happening. Then a tall guy with a black coat and short hair gets out of the driver side of the stopped car. Grabbed her, dragged her to the car while she was fighting him, and put her back in the car. I called the police and gave them the description of the car and the direction it took off in. I never heard anything about it, and I have not stopped thinking about her since. It's been 2 years.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: just in case anyone is curious or could even know something, the location was Lincoln, RI, US next to the high school. Jan/Feb 2019. The car was a new black sports (maybe) car with the tail light going all the way across the back of the car. George Washington highway.",
            "Was camping alone in a small 1-person tent. All snug and secure in the tent, I went to sleep. Was woken by a clap of thunder at 3am, to discover both the inner and outer tent door was wide open. That was freaky.",
            "In college I was roommates with my childhood best friend for about two years. We are very trusting with each other, we would go into each others rooms freely and grab whatever we needed. To borrow clothes, hairbrush, perfume, etc. No questions asked, just a knock if we were in the room to let each other know we were going in. Our rooms are across the hall from each other, with the hall facing the kitchen. So from the kitchen you could see down the hall where our rooms were. At the time my friend had very long black hair and she\u2019s very fair skinned. \n\nOne day, I get home from work, with my headphones in my ear talking to my mom about my day. I go in the kitchen and grab a snack. I see her walk out of her room and go into mine, leave my room and go back into hers. She looked like she just got out the shower, her hair was soaking wet and she was wrapped in a white towel. Her long black wet hair is what I distinctly remember. Also, she made no eye contact with me but I didn\u2019t think it was weird. I didn\u2019t say anything to her since borrowing each other\u2019s stuff was normal. I\u2019m still on the phone with my mom so I don\u2019t think much of it. I grab my snack, hang up with my mom and go into my room to watch TV. I figured she\u2019s getting ready to go somewhere and we\u2019ll talk later. About an hour passes and I go to the kitchen to clean the plate I ate on. I see her in the kitchen making something to eat and I tell her, \u201chey, what did you grab from my room earlier? Did you find what you needed?\u201d She looks at me like if I was crazy and says, \u201cwhat are you talking about?\u201d So I say, \u201cyeah earlier when I got home I saw you go into my room and grab something. Did you get what you needed? Sorry I didn\u2019t say hi I was on the phone with my mom.\u201d She asks me if I\u2019m sure I saw her. I said yes 100%. She tells me to grab my phone and go to her car ASAP, that she needs to show me something. I had my phone on me and she grabbed my keys from the kitchen counter along with her purse and she drags me out the front door and into her car. She then tells me she got home maybe 5 minutes before we started talking. She had spent the night at her boyfriends and hadn\u2019t been home all day. So she has no idea who I saw. I\u2019ll never forget the look on her face when she told me this. Complete fear and panic. She called the cops and they came along with the apartment manager. They checked the whole apartment and found no one. Nothing amiss. And they were in there a while checking every nook and cranny. The manager got maintenance to change our locks and gave us new keys that day. My friend then tells me that for a week she\u2019d been hearing noises from her bathroom like bottles moving, and when she went to check she found nothing. I have no idea who I saw going in and out of our rooms, but it looked exactly like my friend. I don\u2019t drink or do drugs. Not on meds. This was in 2014 and I still freak out when I think about it.",
            "~~This will get buried but oh well.~~ lol, jk.\n\nBack in \\~2008, I lived near my college in an apartment. My apartment was set back from the main road quite a bit and was in a wooded and hilly area.\n\nOne night, I was out running near sundown. I'm at the bottom of a hill that's behind my apartment so it was near the end of my run. I look up ahead at the top of the hill and notice three guys on bikes just sitting there. Being a 20 year old female, my spidey senses start tingling. I tell myself I'm psyching myself out and it'll be fine so I keep running.\n\nI'm about halfway up the hill. The three guys are still just sitting there, facing my direction. I don't have a phone or anything and nowhere else to go so I tell myself I'll just run as hard as I can and scream if I need to.\n\nSuddenly, I hear something coming up beside me. I look to my right and see a German Shepherd. He's running alongside me. I've never seen this dog before in my life. I can't explain it, but I just KNEW I'd be okay now. I continued running up the hill with this random dog beside me. When we're approaching the guys, this dog gets slightly ahead of me and runs directly in front of me instead of to my right. He gets to the guys and stops dead in his tracks. I continue running and pass the guys without even making eye contact.\n\nOnce I'm past the guys, the dog catches back up to me and continues running alongside me. He stays with me until I take the turn into my apartment's \\[very well lit\\] parking lot. He disappears into the trees as quickly as he appeared.\n\nI took that route at the same exact time every single day after that for WEEKS and would drive down that road often, hoping to come across him again. No luck. I never saw him again.\n\nMy friends are all convinced he was a guardian angel making sure I stayed safe. I'm not really a believer so IDK but it's the most creepy, bizarre, and awesome thing to ever happen to me.",
            "When I was 16/17 I was taking a warm bath in a stormy night. At a certain moment, when I looked to the windows, a thunder fell and the light exposed a silhouette of a tall and very skinny creature with long arms and a head that I can only describe as similar to the Martian from that 2000's justice league cartoon. I think about this moment every now and then and it gives me the creeps.",
            "Once I was hired to load firewood into my aunts basement. She lives alone and left the basement door open for me while she went out. I usually swing the interior basement door as wide as I can when I walk in and the door almost never closes completely but once I heard it close and when I was about to grab another load I saw that the deadbolt locked. When I walk in my arms are filled with firewood so I wouldn\u2019t be able to lock it myself. Looked out the window and checked the garage to see if she came home but she wasn\u2019t there. The door itself was enclosed so no wind to shut it. I tried various ways of slamming the door so it would lock by itself but nothing worked. It\u2019s an isolated house so I would have heard someone drive up and it\u2019s highly unlikely someone walked over just to lock the door and leave and time it while I was piling up firewood and there\u2019s wooden steps so I would have heard someone walking down them. It\u2019s the only time I\u2019ve seen a deadbolt lock itself in my life",
            "I was probably about 16-17 and had just gotten home from high school. My brother was in the kitchen making a ruckus so I started that way. As I passed by his bedroom I saw my mom in there, sitting on his bed with the lights off, facing away from me and towards the wall. I stopped and stood in the door way and asked if she was okay, and what she was doing. She said really slowly, \u201cJust sitting. Come here, I need to talk to you.\u201d I took about a half step into the room when I heard my mom yelling for me in the kitchen and then saw her setting the table. I looked back to the bedroom and there was nothing there. \n\nI don\u2019t think I ever went back into that room by myself again, even 10 years later.\n\nEdit: Another story from the same house, since people seem to find this one interesting.\n\nOne day my mom and I were out doing yard work in the front of the house. At the time we had a trampoline that sat in front of my bedroom window, which faced the driveway/road. My two little brothers were bouncing on it, they were probably 7 and 9 at the time, and my mom and i had sat down in a pair of lawn chairs to take break. We were watching my little brothers play when suddenly they both stopped jumping and walked to the edge of the trampoline closest to my bedroom window and sat down, facing the window. They both started talking, but they were speaking as if they were having a conversation that we were only privy to half of. \n\nThe older one, S, said something like \u201c...yes...yeah, they\u2019re good...no...ok...\u201d as if he was replying to someone asking him questions. My mom and I looked at eachother like \u201care you hearing this right now?\u201d And she asked them \u201cWho are you guys talking to?\u201d Without looking away from the window S said \u201cShe says it\u2019s great gramma. She says she misses you.\u201d \n\nMy great grandmother had died before my little brothers had been born, they had no idea what she looked like. My mom replied \u201cGreat gramma is in heaven baby.\u201d To which he looked over at us and said \u201cNot anymore.\u201d \n\nThey stared at the wall for a little longer and then started playing again as if nothing had ever happened. This was, again, one of many incidents that happened at that house. I left Florida in 2017, and while I\u2019ve visited the family home many times since leaving, I\u2019ll never stay there at night by myself. And I try very hard not to leave the room I stay in.",
            "A random cat on the street once protected me from a man who I didn't realize was following me. \n\nI was (stupidly) talking on my phone while walking home at night. I saw a man who was talking to himself near a park and I deliberately chose to walk down another street to avoid him. In the middle of my phone conversation, this orange cat comes up beside me and starts walking next to me. We walk in tandem for about three blocks, me telling the person I was talking to how funny this was. \n\nSuddenly, the cat starts to turn around and head back the other way. I look and see that same man I'd seen earlier, who had changed his original direction and had been following me for a few blocks. The cat got in between us and howled at him until he turned around and went the other way. \n\nThen the cat and I walked another block together, at which point he peeled off into a yard. I double-checked and the man was had disappeared. I can't be sure that the man wished me harm, but I know I wouldn't have noticed him if it weren't for that cat. I never believed in guardian angels or anything of that sort until I had that experience.",
            "I had a short lucid dream. And the scene happened a few days later. \n\nI am 200% sure about that because I keep a diary of my dreams, and it matched perfectly",
            "I used to get deja vu a lot as a child.  Most times it was just a weird feeling of living in a memory, but there are two times where I actually felt like I could predict (or did predict) the future.\n\n-One time I had a dream of driving on a country road I'd never been on before.  A few days later I drove down that EXACT same road as the one in my dream.\n\n-Another time I was having a conversation with my brother and felt like I had that exact conversation before.  I could also \"remember\" 5-10 seconds ahead of time so I was completing sentences for my brother and he was freaking out lol\n\nOne other thing kind of unrelated: One time I had this dream where I got up to use the bathroom.  When I got out, there was a demon standing in the doorway with bright, golden eyes.  I told my brother about this dream but when I got to the part about the demon he finished my thought for me and said \"...with golden eyes?\".  Turns out he had the exact same dream as me.\n\nEdit: One other weird dream I thought of - I remember \"waking up\" and my carotid artery in my neck felt a little weird.  Then it started thumping and beating more and more violently until it felt it it was about to burst.  I remember being so sure I would die and trying to call out to my parents but couldn't.  As soon as I \"died\" I woke up for real.  What's weird is that this is by far the most realistic dream I've ever had.  Like all the fight or flight hormones' or whatever they're called was rushing through my body as if it was real and I felt what it was like to truly panic.  But none of it was real.  It was probably just sleep paralysis but I've had that many times since and I've never experienced anything like that again.",
            "I woke up in the bath at a very specific time, like 5.45. Twice. Ten years in between. Water was getting cold, i was naked. No memory of getting  there, some fragments of like seeing my own hand turning on the tap. No drugs or alcohol or even medication involved. The worst thing was the fear. When i woke up i felt an inexplicable , almost primordial, dread. Lasted for hours, I was shaking, couldn't function. Still freaks me out thinking about it.  Might have been three times i can't remember properly, i still get the shakes from the memory.\nEdit to add: oh gosh you guys, thank you so much for the awards! My first!",
            " A couple of things happened to me and my housemate when we moved into the top apartment in an old building in Europe, right next to a forest known for witchcraft. The locals even have a witches' parade every year. It's a harmless bit of fun.\n\nThe apartment was huge \u2013 three bathrooms, two bedrooms, a study, two living rooms, a living space, a kitchen, two balconies. The bigger one was upstairs, across from a door to the attic, that ran across the entire house. It was dark and full of a lot of old stuff (like from a century ago, we found porcelain, really old wooden furniture, and a doll neither of us wanted to touch). There were also some children\u2019s slippers and black and white pictures of a child from when the town still had carts pulled by oxen.\n\nIt was a wonderful place to live, and the cheap rent made it wonderfuller, but both of us were mildly creeped out in the beginning. We used to hear stuff while in our rooms, like banging or footsteps, or like something had fallen on the carpets. My housemate would text me \u201cdid you hear that too?\u201d, but she soon stopped. She never wanted to talk about it either. I guess she didn\u2019t want to give it any power by acknowledging it.\n\nI clearly remember the first time she was out. It was winter, so it got dark by 4pm. I needed to grab groceries, so I left all the lights on to make myself feel better. I tried to look for my earphones for some music along the way, but I couldn\u2019t find them and I left without them. When I returned every single light in the house was switched off, except the one in my room, and I went to my room, my earphones were lying neatly rolled on the top of my bed.\n\nA few other incidents took place while we lived there too, like the bulbs in the corridor (and only the corridor) dying with loud pops one by one; my housemate hearing something like a dog scratching at her door and texting me to let her sleep one evening while I was over at a friend\u2019s place; me hearing a door loudly banging somewhere in the house while I was on the toilet, and the banging stopping immediately as soon as I flushed \u2013 it was like it didn\u2019t realise there was someone home. The house was weirdly cold too, but we lived there for a year without anything major happening.",
            "My nana (great-grandma) and Mum were very close but lived overseas from one another my whole life. They talked on the phone every Sunday, but because it was an international call, it was extremely expensive, so they took turns calling every Sunday at 8:00AM to make the cost equal. However due to a four-minute difference in clocks, Nana always ended up calling at 8:04. Also, the caller ID never showed up.\n\nMum called on a Sunday, Nana died on a Tuesday. The following week, we\u2019re sitting at the table eating breakfast, and Mum notices it\u2019s 7:50AM; Nana would have been calling any minute! She gets emotional, I comfort her. Then at 8:04AM *the mother fucking phone rings.* The called ID reads \u201cUnknown Caller\u201d.\n\nWe look at each other like, what is this some sort of sick joke? She answers \u2014 there\u2019s nothing but static at the other line, and some garbled voice recording. \n\nThe only decipherable words in it are, *\u201dWe hope you enjoy your trip to paradise!\u201d (click)* Phone cuts off.\n\nAbsolutely no explanation for that one. Still baffles me to this day.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve been wanting to tell this story for years now but every time I find a \u201ccreepy/inexplicable\u201d thread it gets buried. So glad people are finally hearing this one lol. Some have said maybe someone was playing an elaborate prank, but I\u2019d prefer to see it as Nana sending us one last hoo-rah; she really loved my Mum and I a lot, as we did her, too. She was a really kooky lady and this ending was extremely fitting of her.",

            "i was walking my dog once around the pond in my grandmother\u2019s condominium gated community. it was suppose to storm that night so it was windy all day. like tree branches violently flailing around and small items being blown away.\n\ni got to the front of my grandmother building, there wasn\u2019t a soul in sight and suddenly it got really quiet. which was weird because it was literally windy ALL DAY but the wind suddenly stopped. i sort of looked around and felt off, it was the kind of quiet you could hear.\n\nsuddenly a big gust of wind comes in and my dog starts freaking out. i tug him to come towards the building so i could put the code in to get us inside when suddenly i hear a voice go \u201chey\u201d right behind me. it felt like it was right next to my ear. i turned around and there still wasn\u2019t anyone there. and my dog was still freaking out. so i dragged him inside, ran up the flight of stairs to my grandma\u2019s condo and locked the door. \n\ni still have no idea what happened to this day\n\nedit: i should mention the gated community has a lot of buildings with geriatric folks living in it beyond my grandmothers condo. the area was used during the tuberculosis out break to bring patience to basically die and they would cremate their bodies in a now abandoned building at the center of the gated community. i\u2019ve also seen shadows in the window of the tower whenever i went to the park nearby.",
            "I was deployed to Iraq and we stayed in a former prison in Baghdad. During the night we would see and hear strange things. The base at this time only had soldiers but we would hear children playing from inside the prison. One day we decided to dig deeper to see where the kids were. When we finally found where the noise was coming from we found a room with the ceiling caved in. We didn't find any kids but found kids books, toys and kids clothes. Everything looked like it wasn't moved in weeks. We continued to hear the kids in the year we spent there.",
            "My girlfriend and I are in a long distance relationship. We typically take turns travelling between each other\u2019s countries (Australia and Canada). \n\nAbout two years ago, it was my turn to travel over to Australia to stay with her and her mom. For a bit of background, my gf\u2019s room was built as an extension/add-on to their garage. So to get to it, you had to walk through their garage to get to her room. \n\nAbout a couple weeks into my trip over there, I wake up at around 1:00 am and the room is just glowing red. I look up at the ceiling and I see this black figure crawling through the ceiling. It moved in such an inhuman way, almost like it was breaking every one of its bones to move. I start screaming which wakes my gf up and she looks up at the ceiling and starts to scream as well. Instinctively, I grab my pillow and whip it at the figure. The next thing I know everything went black and I\u2019m waking up a few hours later. My gf is fast asleep so I think it was just some weird dream.\n\nAt that point, I have to go to the washroom. So, I walk through the garage and try to quietly open the garage door to get into the main house.\n\nPreviously, her mom had mentioned that she was getting annoyed with us staying up late at night and going through the garage door to use the washroom. Since her mom\u2019s room was down the garage door hallway, each time we would open it, the door would click loudly and wake her up.\n\nSo, I\u2019m standing there at the garage door and I try to open it as quietly as possible. As I turn the handle and the door clicks as I push it open, her mom just starts screaming at the top of her lungs. I thought it was out of rage for waking her up, so I immediately close the door and speed walk back to my gf\u2019s room. I climb into bed and gently nudge her awake to tell her that her mom is screaming. She gets up and goes to see whether her mom was still angry and try to deescalate the situation. \n\nAbout 20 minutes goes by and my gf comes back into the room completely silent. She asks me if I saw the room glowing red earlier as well as a figure in the ceiling. I say yes and she goes wide-eyed and says that she thought it was just a dream too. She then says that her mom wasn\u2019t screaming at me. Apparently, when I opened the door, it did wake her up \u2014 but when she woke up, there was a black figure standing at the foot of her bed and it was slowly moving towards her. She then experienced a blackout as well and was woken up by my gf checking in on her. \n\n\nYeah... the entire house slept with the lights on for a month after that.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the awards kind strangers as well as the emotional support \ud83d\ude05",

            "I am a skeptic about ghosts and other worldly beings.  This event that happened causes me some consternation because it doesn\u2019t make any sense and I can not explain what was happening:\nWhen I was in middle school, my family went camping in New Mexico.  We were at a camp site near a lovely stream.  My parents had one tent and my brother and I had another.  As I was settling down to sleep for the night, I was listening to my headphones.  I decided it was time to go to sleep so I took my head phones off and was dozing off when I became hyper aware of a sound.  It was a slight swishing/scratching sound on the side of the tent.  I had just assumed there was a breeze and a stalk of grass was brushing on the side of the tent.  With a sudden jolt, I realized there was no wind whatsoever.  I asked my brother, \u201cJ, what is that?\u201d He asked what I was referring to.  I pointed out the scratching noise.  He took his hand and hit the side of the tent.  In response, whatever it was, hit the side of the tent from outside of the tent.  We both immediately began screaming hysterically.  My parents came running and all the while the scratching continued.  My parents said it was surely just a bug, a tent string or some vegetation and got a flash light to look at the exterior of the tent.  There was nothing.  They brushed down the exterior, shook the tent, took everything out of the tent and shook it.  The noise continued.  I was completely in pieces so I went and slept in my parents tent and my father slept in the \u201ckid tent\u201d.  My brother and father reported that the scratching continued all night long.  \nStill puzzled and freaked out by this experience.",
            "\nI went to UVA at the same time that Morgan Harrington disappeared, which was my second year there (aka\u00a0sophmore year). Sadly to say, because she wasn't a student (she was in town for a Metallica concert) her death was salacious but didn't really strike\u00a0fear into the student body like it did when Hannah Graham would go missing 5 years later, but I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nAnyway, about a week or so after Morgan's death in 2009 me and my (guy) friend were at a grocery store right outside of campus getting snacks around 10pm. Bus service had ended, so we decided to use a cab service UVA had set up to make sure students had access to rides in case they were drunk or just needed transpo. UVA pays the bill upfront and charges you later.\n\nSo we get into this guys cab and he immediately starts bringing up Morgan's disappearance. This wasn't so strange because everyone was talking about it. It was national news. But I'm an introvert with a good memory, so I remember just about every conversation over 3 minutes long I've ever had, especially with strangers. He starts talking about police theories about the case, and my friend- who went on to get a masters in Gothic Horror--starts talking about how some people thought\u00a0a cult was involved. Basic speculative BS. In addition to that, I remember the guy looking at me through the rearview mirror. I won't say I never forget a face, but this conversation was so macabre that\u00a0his stuck with me,\u00a0even years later.\u00a0\n\nAnyway, he dropped us off and we made it home safe. Fast forward 5 years, I'm in grad school 1000 miles away and Hannah Graham's disappearance\u00a0is national news. Fortunately in this case, they have video surveillance. You can see her walking away with a big, African American guy with dreadlocks. They get an ID and his face is on the news everywhere. I don't recognize him. They eventually catch this guy in TX (just an hour or so away from where I was in school at the time).\n\nAs days go by, they're profiling this guy, and his DNA matches samples found on Morgan's remains (found 3 months after her disappearance in 2009). A picture comes up on the screen of what he looked like 5 years before and my heart stops. There are no dreadlocks. His hair is clean cut, he's about\u00a040 pounds lighter, and his beard is short. He is, I'm 97% certain, the same\u00a0man who drove us home that night.\n\nHe lured both Morgan and Hannah with his cab.\n\nEvery now and then, I think of what would have happened if I hadn't been with my male friend that night. (I'm pretty sure it was his idea to go out so late, but still...) Or what if he had been a girl? Would I have made it home ok?\n\nP.S. I think this guy likely killed more people. In particular, there was a trans teenager (\"a townie\") that went missing before Morgan who, to my knowledge, was never found. It got almost no news coverage, even locally.",
            "Well, not the scariest thing ever but when I was 11 my family and I moved to another town because of my dad's job.

I go there with my dog and utter out loud \"I wish there was something to do\" and not a moment later I hear some young voice say very clearly \"then let's play\"\n\nI turn around to see my normally hyperactive Golden sitting looking at me like nothing has happened, I freak out immediately and ran upstairs to my parent's bedroom, I turn on the TV and hide under the covers until my family arrived, they saw me sweating, scared and paranoid at this point. They never figured out what happened but tried to make me feel better.\n\nNow the part that freaks me is that each of the houses in the community was surrounded by 3-meter tall cinderblock walls, the place where my socks were was next to a wall separating from another house, one that had no children, the other house to the left was over 20 meters away and behind another wall, and the wall behind my house separated us from nothing but a steep hill.\n\nThere was no one who could have said that, and to this day it freaks me out every time I think of it.",
            "When I was 17 I had just gotten off my shift at Wendy\u2019s and was sitting in the parlor for my ride and a middle aged man approached me about a job offer, he asked me questions about my job and Wendy\u2019s then he told me about the job he was offering. He said there were other girls and they all lived in like a dorm and the job came with benefits, it was in a office setting and other things I don\u2019t remember but the entire time every danger bell in my body was going off full blast it felt like my body became a vibrator. I don\u2019t remember if after the multiple rejections from me he left or if my ride had come and I zoomed outta there. The only thing I can think to this day is \u201cDid I almost get sex trafficked?\u201d edit: ..",
            "I was about 10 when this took place. I\u2019m in my early 30\u2019s now. I remember it was well into late night hours when I saw my grandmother was standing at the front screen door looking outside. She was talking to someone. I saw she was talking to my dad. I couldn\u2019t see my dads face cause he was facing away from her. He was shirtless. He had a very large distinct mole in the middle of his back, so I knew it was him. He was mumbling something I couldn\u2019t understand. My grandmother was telling him something along the lines of \u201cif you love them so much why did you go and do this\u201d? \n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t there with us to see this. She had left moments before after she got a call letting us know my dad had been driving drunk and hit a mule on the highway. My dad was in the hospital hanging on to life.\n\nEdit: added age and approximate time",
            "Well, this will be my very first Reddit post, but I found this thread and it feels like my stories would fit in perfectly. \n\nAbout 10 years ago, I was dating my ex who had very strict and extremely religious parents. The only way we could meet up or have some private time was by her sneaking out of her window in the middle of the night. I usually met her half way, bcs she was scared. So this one night she called me and told me she is on her way, which was weird since we never agreed on meeting that night. Tbh, I did not really think of it as being weird or anything. Also it was the beginning of our relationship, so I was pretty excited to see her. \nNow to the creepy part. \nThe first thing that happened is that my cat at the time was blocking my door, like really trying not to let me pass. I ignored it and went downstairs to put on my shoes. My cat was meowing and following me the whole way. I put my keys on the shoe shelf and put my shoes on, just to see that my keys had vanished. I started searching for them literally everywhere. All while my cat was really going on my nerves with that excessive meowing. 5min go by and I get another call from here telling me that she already arrived and waiting outside. I was kind of surprised how she made it to my place that fast. I told her I lost my keys and that we can just keep chatting until I find them. She got impatient really quick and at some point started screaming at me, telling me to \u201copen that fucking door\u201d. All while my cat is still just going crazy. In the last few seconds I could swear her voice changed a little and she just screamed before hanging up the phone. I was really stressing bcs I had no idea wtf was happening. My keys vanished, my cat went crazy and my girlfriend was screaming at me on the phone. After she hung up the phone, I turned around just to see that my keys were exactly where I left them. I opened the door, went outside searching for her. She was nowhere to be found. I went back inside thinking she got pissed and just left. I picked up my phone and called her again. She picked up the phone and I asked her where she went and that I found the keys. She told me she did not call me that night and never left the house. \n\nTo this day this whole scene just fucks with my head. Never figured out what had happened. \n\nGood night yall :)",
            "One of my cats had been missing for a few weeks. I had given her up as gone. While on the phone with a friend 100 miles away (who has never seen my house), he interrupts himself from talking about work and says with a strange urgency, \"Doug. Open your front door. Your cat is sitting on the porch waiting to come in.\" And of course upon opening the door, I find her just casually sitting there. We were both beyond blown away. Between sobs of joy I asked \"how did you know?\" and he said, \"I don't know man. That was really weird.\"",
            "I once caught my neighbour staring at me outside my bedroom window while I was straightening my hair with no trousers on, and I immediately ducked under my window pane as soon as I saw him. he was legit stood in this alley-way that connects the street\u2019s back gardens, arms crossed and there for at least 15 more minutes just staring through my window.

            "A friend and I from high school used to go out to this old county road and smoke a joint on a big hill facing a large, old brick house across the street that sat in a large field. The face of the house had 2 rows of 6 windows each, facing the road. One night we were chilling on said hill and looking out at the house as the sun was going down and all of a sudden a light turned on in one of the windows and then shut off. Then another random window lit up, then shut off. It kept going. Faster, faster.. a window would light up and shut off and then go to another. It did it for about a minute and eventually was doing it so quickly it couldn't have possibly been a person going room to room or even a person with access to multiple switches at one time. After about a minute after speeding up to random flashes it stopped.\n\nIt simply didn't make sense.  We both saw it. We talked about it many times afterward. The only thing we can figure is if the homeowner had some kind of automated lighting system hooked up to all the rooms and was messing with us. Other than that, I have no idea.\n\nSketchy AF though.\n\nEdit: some of you chalking up the experience to cannabis, i dont think you understand how weed works. I've never hallucinated from being high in my life and it would make zero sense for me and my friend to have the same hallucination at the same time.",
            "When I was about 10 years old, I had a pretty scary dream. In this dream, my mom drowned in quick sand and my little brother (7 or 8 at the time) jumped in to save her. In the process, he broke his arm. The next day, my little brother broke his arm. No quick sand involved and my mom was never in danger irl, but still, I was super freaked out by the fact that I had dreamt about my little brothers injury literally the night before. \nTo this day, when I think about it, it gives me chills\n\nEdit: spelling mistake",
            "I once woke up in a tent in the middle of the night while camping in the Upper Peninsula with my friends. I heard this dude shouting and screaming about a bear, telling it to f*ck off and stuff. Naturally I woke my  buddy up and told him what was up and he said he could hear it too. We got out of our tent and searched for almost an hour around the campsite and found nothing, then proceeded to find a redwings hat that was neither of ours. We took watch turns the rest of the night. And I\u2019m pretty sure he still has the hat to this day.\n\nNote: UP is a term used by people familiar with Michigan as the Upper Peninsula (the arrow lookin thing above the mitten)",
            "It was around 3am and I was on my computer in my moms basement when I was 17. There was a fruit cellar door next to my desk. All of a sudden I hear 3 knocks coming from inside of the fruit cellar door. There was no other entrance to the fruit cellar. I freaked out and ran up the stairs and ran outside, thinking maybe some of my friends were playing a joke on my but it was the middle of winter and snow was falling and there were no footprints around my house and my mother was fast asleep. I got in my car and drove to my friends house and moved to my own place shortly thereafter. 20 years later and I still won\u2019t go in that basement at night.",

I'm not talking about some slight nibble or something, no I RIPPED my the tip with my front teeth. On top of this, I couldn't find my glasses. I always leave them on the nightstand next to my bed before I sleep, but this one morning, they just vanished. I tore my room asunder looking for them, but no luck. Whatever happened that night while I was asleep, or maybe even unconsciously active, it's really been inconveniencing me for the last few days.",
            "When I was about 5 I was going down the stairs of my house when suddenly there was some sort of mist in front of me.

            "I once woke up while staying in an old cabin in a mostly abandoned mining town to find the black silhouette of a little girl standing beside my bed staring at me. I was just like \"oh fuck a ghost\" so I stared at it until it faded away, waving my arm through where it was before I got up and walked to the kitchen to check the time. 3:03 AM. NOPE.\n\nAlso, after my grandpa died I had a dream once where he visited me and hugged me and told me he loved me and everyone he left behind, specifically to tell my grandma that he loved her and was with her everyday. I woke up and went to school thinking \"ill tell gran when I get home from school!\", so I get home and rush downstairs to talk to my grandma and she starts telling me about how her day was awful because her church was doing a \"remember the dead\" thing and no one had warned her but she didn't want to leave and she was all alone, and she told me all this and ended her sentence with \"and the worst part is I haven't even had a dream with grandpa in it! I haven't been able to see him...\" so that was pretty crazy considering the first thing out of my mouth after that was telling her about my dream. \n\nGrandpa knew <3",
            "**Not my story, but I stumbled upon it several years ago and it's really stuck with me ever since.** [**Here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/2lzo4p/i_guess_we_wont_be_having_cake/) **is the original post, but I'll copy it here:**\n\nHowdy, Reddit! My husband stumbled onto this sub and thought it would be a great place to share our story. I'm using a throwaway because we don't know what people close to us would think. This is the first time we've talked about this with anyone other than each other. I've read through some of the stories here, and I ~~think~~ hope ours fits here too.\n\nI'd like to preface this by saying that neither my husband nor I do any sort of drugs, suffer from mental illness, or abuse alcohol. We drink occasion, but had not been drinking this night. It happened about 8 months ago. We lived in a small apartment with our two young children and our dog while we saved up for a down payment on a home.\n\nIt was a typical Monday night around 7:00 pm. We had just cleaned up after dinner, my husband was surfing the web, and I was relaxing on the couch. I was reading the back of a cake mix trying to decide if I had time to bake it, let it cool, frost it, and eat it before I needed to be in bed. My husband was watching a video on the internet, he said something funny about it, we both laughed...\n\nThen BAM! I woke up, face-down in bed. My clock read 8:00 exactly. My alarm hadn't been turned on. I was very confused and could smell the strong scent of coconut. I sat up and looked at my husband who was also just waking up. He looked at me with a really confused look, and we both jumped out of bed and ran to our kids' room. They were in bed asleep. We went into the living room and the second our dog saw us, she started whimpering and sort of army-crawling toward us. It was such unusual behavior for her. I had never seen her act that way before, and have never since.\n\nNothing looked out of order in our apartment aside from one small detail. The cake mix I had been looking at that night was gone. I searched everywhere for that cake mix and never found it. Another odd detail from that day is that we were all dressed in our pajamas when we woke up except my youngest. He was in the jeans and t-shirt he had been wearing the night before. Neither my husband nor I would have ever put him to bed like that. Neither of us have any memory of getting into our pajamas or anything else after laughing at the comment he made on the video.\n\nWe (already late for work) both called in sick that day. We spent the day talking about it and trying to make sense of it. At some point that day, he asked me if I had smelled coconut when I woke up. We never found the source of the smell.\n\nTo this day, I can't look at a cake mix or smell coconut without feeling a little anxious and sick.\n\nTL;DR: Just bake the cake.",
            "Just  a normal Saturday night, I was watching TV home alone with my 2 dogs,  when I heard a banging sound coming from the basement. Legit sounded  like somebody was just banging something on the appliances we had down  there.\n\nNow there is no access into  the basement from down there, only through the upstairs rooms that I  was in and knew nobody could have come in and got past me.\n\nSo with this knowledge I was not as scared as you may think, more curious as to what the heck the noise was.\n\nOne  of the two dogs who is a meathead and wants to fight everybody also  heard the noise and was now bolting down into the basement to  investigate.\n\nI get down and see  that it is my other dog, banging his head into our dryer and chest  freezer which are next to each other. My meathead dog is just stood  there watching confused. So I approach my other dog and calm him down  and we all go back upstairs. Now this freaked the heck out of me and  upset me as it seems such very strange behaviour for my dog to do.\n\nFast-forward  only 30mins or so, the banging starts again. I instantly look over to  my dog, but he is lay down, but now also aware of the noise downstairs.  We run down into the basement and it is meathead now banging his head in  between the appliances. Again, I now calm meathead down and we all go  back upstairs .\n\nNothing has ever  happened again since that night, 3 years now - so that ruled out brain  tumors which is what I read on line about why maybe dogs bang their  heads ( but 2 dogs, suddenly on the same night,and it only effecting 1 of them at any given time)\n\n3 years and the 3 of us never talk about that night lol.\n\n**Edit:** Wow thanks for all the awards and updoots. To answer a few questions, yes I have posted this story before - I have a very normal life and this story is just wayyyy out there but legit truthful to my otherwise mundane life.\n\nA few folk say it may have been a rodent/treat /toy they were after - No, they were frenzied and hyperventilating, when they get things stuck under anything they just cry and get me to get their stuff.\n\nI guess it boils down to just knowing your dogs,I know instantly from their body language,just what the deal is - but that night,I have never seen them so frenzied and upset.\n\nAlso,it is otherwise a very nice basement ( as basements go ),I have never had a pest problem down there or in any other part of the house.\n\nSomebody mentioned that if it only happened 3 years ago,why did I not make a video of it ? - My first instinct was to help my dogs to stop them harming themselves - at no point was my first thought to go and grab my phone to capture the moments on film.Really surprised I have to mention that one..........but people/keyboards/warriors.",
            "I was somewhere around 17 yrs old & a guy started jerking off next to me on the highway and just kept following me and slowing down next to me and continuing to do it. I was just thinking about it the other day for some reason. It was by definition creepy.",

            "When I was in high-school, I would always be the first to arrive home out of my family, having the entire house to myself.  I've never been superstitious or someone who scared easily, and the hour I had alone was my favorite time of the entire day.\n\nMy bedroom is upstairs, and one day when I got home from school I placed my bag away and started up the stairs.  About halfway I stopped because I thought I heard something coming from upstairs so I stayed at listened.\n\nI heard a very slow rendition of the melody from ring around the rosie, crystal clear; coming from my bedroom.  I was 100% sure I was the only one home, and I had absolutely no 'device' that could be playing music unprompted, especially ring around the rosie.\n\nI froze in fear and listened for about 15 seconds to make sure I was really hearing it, which I was.  I just turned back down the steps and waited around in the living room for my family to get home before I went back upstairs.  I went in my room a few hours later and there was nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nI know it's not a very climatic story, but it's something I think about every now and then.  I never told anyone about it because, why would I, but that was the first time something truly strange happened to me.",
            "I apologise for grammar of spelling mistakes\n\nThere was a kid in another class at my school in 6th grade that was genius. I don't mean like, oh he's really smart cause doesn't need to do the homework and still gets a 100s. Like he's was doing advanced calculus with a local college professor after school. This kid was smarter than everyone.\n\nSo one day our computer system for the entire school goes down. (I was in a poorer area at the time so this was normal). This was occured many times so normally it would effect us cause we barely used laptops and such. The only class that was affected was the computer class.\nThis kid was in the computer class.\n\n3 or so hours later when I'm class with him during social studies. 3 guys with FBI jackets on and our local chief escorted him out of the building. We were told nothing, the parents were told nothing. It never hit the news. To this day we have no clue what he did. Except every single teacher I've asked about this says they were also told nothing.\n\nI haven't seen the kid since and I can't find a trace of him going to anyother school or ending up in trouble. He just fell of the face of the earth with his parents. (Yeah I forgot to mention that parents also disappeared and no one really looked for then after a month or so)\n\nI still think about that kid.",
            "In high school, AOL was new and chat rooms were super popular. I was 16 when we finally got the first PC and AOL and the whole works. Creepy old men would lurk in generally teenaged-run chat rooms because...creepy old men.\n\nSome guy started messaging me, he was in his late 30's (but it was the internet, who knows if he really was. He could have been 78 for all anyone knew). I was a teenage girl, why would I be interested? So I told him to not talk to me.\n\nHe then made a fake account claiming he was a teenage boy but then he started talking like he did before and I caught on. Why so much effort to talk to a plain 16 year old?\n\nI filed complaints but only so much can happen when he hasn't really done anything illegal. Whatever. So one day, my parents are out and my brother is gone. The home phone rings and it's him. He tells me he knows I'm alone, my parents are out, he knows what my house looks like (he describes it over the phone). He tells me he could easily come to me if I asked him.\n\nI told him I'm not amused and to just stop. He disappeared after. No idea. It was just....WEIRD. Still no clue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: well, crap, I had no idea this would gain any type of attention let alone this many comments. I sincerely have no idea what happened. Maybe he was an expert mind fucker and he was experimenting with how to really mess with someone. It worked, though. I have really no idea who he was or where he lived since the internet was new and the accessibility to find information wasn't what it is today. He could have been a teacher, a 67 year old man, a strung out whackjob down the street, a truck driver, who knows. I just find it unbelievable that he DISAPPEARED and that he tried so hard to creep on a teenage girl. EW.",
            "About 10 years ago, my Dad was in the hospital and my Mom asked me one night if I could go and stay with him for awhile the next morning because she had a medical appointment of her own. It was a cold November morning and when I went out to leave, there were starlings swirling everywhere, a murmoring I think it's called. They were all around me, like a bird tornado. I headed to the hospital and made my way up to his room. When I got there, he was laying in bed facing the door. He was suffering from dementia and not all in the moment. He saw me and and said \"Hey son, what are you doing here?\" I said that I thought I would come and keep him company for a bit. He stated, 'You didn't have to do that, I sent the birds to tell you.\" I felt chills down my neck and turned toward the window. After a few seconds I asked him how he sent the birds. His response was \"what birds?\" Just strange, and it still gives me chills.",
            "I (F 27) was training to be a nurse. Here in Germany you have to visit and practice at a lot of places. I was working at a hospice, a place where the terminal ill patients can stay until their last day. \nI was there for 8 weeks and was in my last year of studying. I was doing a round, checking on everyone, making sure they are not in pain, nedd any help or just a talk. One patient, a woman who was there for days, had a different breathing and I called her husband who was in the group-room (don't know how to exactly describe it). She had her finals breaths, while her husband was holding her hand. It was peaceful and I know she was gone. At this moment an other patient made a call (we had phones, which would ring if someone requested a nurse). I excused myself and left her room. Deep breath and going to the patient who was calling. I entered and smiled \"how can I help you?\". The man told me his guest would like to know where the exit was. I was a little confused, because he hadn't any visitors that day yet, so I asked: \"who do you mean?\" Maybe I just didn't see anyone, because I was for half an hour with the dying patient. And he answered: \"well this lady here. She wants to know, where she could get out\". I went pale, blood falling into my knees. I was shocked. I stuttered while opening the window: \"ahm. err. here is the way to the balcony and right to left, down the stairs is the door. I'll get you some water.\" Left the room, and was hardly breathing, leaning against the wall. Was standing there for 5min. One of the nurses saw me and asked if I was ok. So I told her what just happened. All she did was to smile and say: \"yes, that kind of stuff happens a lot here.\"\n\nA few hours later I asked the man, if hie guest found the way out. Him: \"Yes, she did and said thank you for everything.\"\n\nHad to process that for days, weeks, months.\nI still can't believe it. \nBut I am sure since then, that we carry a soul.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso some nasty ghostly other things happened to me and my colleagues, while working in an ICU.",

            "Since I was a child, I\u2019d have a nightmare about this haunted house and, specifically, the balcony and upstairs. The upstairs floor plan was such that there was a hallway running horizontally, with each door to the left facing the balcony. I would be so unnerved in my dream, walking down this hallway, the hair on my neck standing up, just feeling the presence of evil. \n\nIn 2019, my wife and I went to an architect to design a house for us to build in the Acadian/Creole style. The upstairs floor plan was exactly like the one in my nightmare. \n\nWe scrapped the plans. And it\u2019s a good thing - we all know how 2020 turned out.

I kept a partial roll on the roller just for her- she'd unroll it, and I would roll it back up again. ( Mine was sitting on top of a cabinet beside the toilet)\nSince she died, I guess she is still around because I keep having to roll that back up on a regular basis- even during the months long time I didn't have a cat. To this day, once or twice a week I still have to re-roll that toilet paper.

            "Okay this turned into a long one, and it's not exactly unexplained...\n\nA few years ago, I was volunteering with some friends in a remote region of Tanzania. We were there to teach English, but it was total volun-tourism - very few people in the region spoke English because it was completely unnecessary. The type of charity work someone thought up in a board room 1,000 miles away. \n\nAnyway, we were staying in this old hotel - up on the top floor (maybe like 6th floor). We chose the top floor for the views, but it also gave us privacy. The hotel was way oversized for the small town it was in, we were more or less the only people staying there. \n\nThere were probably 20 rooms to a floor and it was all very open. On each floor, a central tiled staircase opened straight into a lobby, with the rooms accessed via various hallways. We had two rooms, with two of us in each. The rooms were basic but clean, all tiled. There was also an open window above each door so we could shout to our friends staying in the room next door.\n\nWe'd been there a couple of months and got used to having the place to ourselves. Noone ever came up beyond the ground floor except the maids on occassion. One of the quietest places I've ever slept.\n\nThat was until one night. I woke up to see my friend sat bolt upright. We could hear someone running on the stairs a few floors below. The slapping of their feet on the tiles echoed up the staircase as they ran. Then they started screaming.\n\nIt was a woman's scream and it was guttural, absolutely raw and animalistic. It was a while ago but I can still hear it clearly.\n\nShe eventually reaches our floor and starts banging on doors. Shes still screaming. Shes screaming for help and coming down our corridor. She sounds terrified.\n\nBy this time I was up, had grabbed a knife we'd bought to cut fruit (lord knows what I thought I was going to do with it) and was heading for the door.\n\nJust as I reach it - my friend grabs me and drags me back. He gestures for me to stay quiet. I would trust this guy with my life, so I do as I'm told. We stand there in silence in the dark.\n\nThe woman reaches our thin wooden door. Shes slapping on it and screaming out for help. We can hear her so clearly because of the open window above. Shes also just a couple of feet away. Shes crying out and sobbing, scratching at the door.\n\nMy friend and I stand in silence just the other side. We're frozen. Honest to God, I was terrified. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, we hear her receding down the corridor, no longer crying out so loudly. We hear other peoples voices on the stairs and then nothing, as the place falls silent again.\n\nI turned to my friend, who looks me dead in the eye. Calmly, he explains. \"She was shouting in English, mate. All the way. She knew we were here. She knew what door to come to.\"\n\n\"She also wasn't alone. I heard footsteps on the floor before you woke up. They were trying to get that door open so they could rob us. Had you opened that door, they would have done so.\"\n\nSuddenly I felt a bit ridiculous with my little fruit knife. I just sat in stunned silence. It made sense. \n\nBefore long, my friend went back to sleep and I was left with my thoughts.\n\nTo this day, I have no idea if my friend was right. It still sits with me, whether we could have helped someone that night. My gut tells me my friend was right, he usually is. But man, when I think back to how close I came to opening that door.\n\nWe spoke to the manager and staff the next day, none of them had any idea what we were talking about. They were very apologetic though and even set up a security watch for the rest of our stay.",

            "I've shared this before, but it still confuses the hell out of my family.\n\n**Edit** This happened last year, I copy and pasted it from my original post. The beginning of the story says \"Last night\" but this was almost a year ago.  We moved out of that house about 6 months after this happened.\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\nMy husband recently took an overnights job to help us out during covid. He's only been there about two weeks and works evenings/overnights, 9pm-6am.\n\nLast night was no different, he left home around 8:15pm. Our daughter, age 11, and I decided to make it a movie night. Around 11pm, I heard keys in my backdoor and the usual sounds my husband makes when he comes home. I creep out to the kitchen to make sure it was him, and it was. He told me he needed to grab his knee compression sleeve, walks down the hall, says hi to our daughter as he passes the living room, and goes upstairs. He came back down, gave me a kiss and left again.\n\nWe finished our movie and went to bed. In the morning when he got home I made a joking comment about him forgetting his knee sleeve. He was genuinely confused as I recalled the previous night. Our daughter confirmed everything I said and he still was acting confused. I pulled up our security motion camera on my phone to show him when he popped in quick. But there was no footage from the night before, or any other night, of him coming home after he's left for work.\n\nMy daughter and I both heard him, saw him, and I touched him. But he was never home during that time. Nothing else out of the ordinary happened that night. We seriously have no idea what happened.\n\n**Edit to clarify**\n\nThere is footage of that night, but it doesn't show him coming home at that time.\n\nThe camera was on the back porch, not inside the house.\n\nWe had 2 carbon monoxide detectors, one on each floor of the house.\n\nWe moved out a few months later for unrelated reasons.",
            "When I was in second grade I was getting the mail and when I picked out a letter for me I got a flash of this lady who I had never seen before and I was like okay whatever, turned out it was an image of my second grade teacher before I even met her on the first day of school, wearing the exact clothes I pictured. The letter was a welcome to class letter from her.",
            "So my brother, myself, and our friend were driving through Vermont heading to a cabin to go snowboarding for the week. I was sitting passenger in my brothers car when I noticed a bright red light (it's night) in the sky. It was coming from deep in the woods but was shining in a huge dome shape (the light seemed to be restricted to the dome. The light did not seem to travel far but it was very bright. We were so baffled we pulled over at this small gas station on the road to get a better look. There were about 6 other people who seemed to live there also looking at the light. They were telling us there was no buildings or factories out there whatsoever. As our conversation continued the light seemed to diminish. But then almost emploded on itself and burst out with a huge white light that lit up the sky and surrounding area. Then about 10ish seconds after this change a huge wind gust came at us from the direction of the light. I'd say it was about 15-25mph winds (I hike and am just making comparisons to the wind on mountains). Then the light just began to fade away so we hopped in our cars and kept going. The light didn't fully diminish for about 10 minutes. Craziest shit ever.",
            "A few years ago, I took my dog out for a walk at night. The apartment complex I lived in at the time had enough light outside so I was never scared of going out for a little walk. One night, as I walked down the stairs, I noticed a large brown furry thing under the stairs. I know for a fact there was 3 thin bushes under those stairs, but that night, whatever that thing is, was in between those bushes. I was too afraid to inspect it so I walked the dog around the neighborhood for 5 minutes. When I got back, the large brown thing was gone. I stood there for a second before gathering up the courage to go up the stairs. My dog, however, refused to go up. I scooped him up and ran up the stairs into the comfort of my own home.\nA few days later I sat in the living room minding my own business. From the corner of my eye, I saw something brown and furry crawl from the ceiling into my room. \nThat night, I had a dream I was being attacked by an unknown creature. I covered myself in my blanket and it scratched and tore at it, yelling obscenities at me. I got angry and launched myself at it, punching and scratching at a large brown furry creature. When I woke up my dog was there watching me and whining. \nIdk what to even think this was.\n\nEDIT: wow I honestly expected this comment to get buried! Thanks to all of your input!\n\nI actually spoke to my mom about this. And what she said scares me even more.\n\nShe has seen it crawl into rooms. But like me, chalked it up to her hair in her eye or something.\nHowever, she told me she also dreamt of it. In her dream, she was paralyzed, it was running around her and taunting her. She tried so hard to start praying but the words wouldn't come out. It got close to her face, she stared deeply into its demonic red eyes. She felt its fur touch her skin. When she broke out of her dream, my dog was staring at her, very close to her face. My dog almost got punched Lmao (my moms defense when she gets scared).\n\nSo yeah. I guess we did see something in that apartment. Whatever it is, im glad we moved out and it didn't follow us.",
            "Long post so bare with me:\n\nBack in high school, I want to say it was my sophomore year (10th grade), my friends and I used to sneak out of our parents house late at night and we used to meet up at the campus and vandalize, smoke, fuck around... just stupid troubled teen things. \n\nWell, one night we met up at the school to smoke and hangout. During our smoke session, we noticed a very random and bizarre looking light appear in the baseball dugout next to us (we were smoking in the baseball field dugout). \n\nAt first we thought that maybe it was a school janitor or guard working late. But we weren\u2019t too worried by that thought. \n\nWe kept our eyes on it as it started moving out of the dugout and towards ours. Then it finally appeared in the center of the field in the center of all the plates(where even at night it was fully visible due to the lights), but we saw nothing. Just the light we first noticed, which happened to become brighter as it got closer. We saw no body or silhouette of any kind holding this light. It appeared to be floating. \n\nOnce I realized that it was just a floating light, I turned to my friends, only to realize that they ran off without me. That\u2019s when I decided to grab all of the stuff they left behind, throw it in my backpack, and run. As I got a bit of distance from it, I looked back only to see that it had \u201cran\u201d THROUGH the two fences we had to CLIMB over. That\u2019s when I really started shitting my pants, so I started sprinting towards my friends and we ended up running for about half of a mile before we lost it in a neighborhood that one of my friends in our friend group had lived in. We hopped his backyard gate to lose whatever was chasing us in the middle of the night. \n\nTo this day we don\u2019t know what the light was. I\u2019ve only seen it one other time at the same school while I was taking a run on the track it had. It was definitely the creepiest thing any of my friends and I have experienced. And we\u2019re the type who have played with Ouija boards, amateur ghost hunting, and things of that sort. Nothing ever scared us as bad as this thing.",
            "Creepy, not unexplained. Watched a kid jump out of a hotel window. He hit the ground so hard. Everyone kind of froze. There were kids around, and lots of businesses, so it was a very shocking moment. I rushed to the scene and he was moaning while a pool of blood was oozing out of his head. This little old lady was brushing his hair out of his face and whispering encouraging words to him while we waited for the ambulance. \n\nHe survived. The impact was so hard that it shattered both his legs and they had to be amputated. Allegedly he was on psychedelics and fell out the window, but I ended up becoming friends with people who used to know him and *they* said that he tried to commit suicide because his family wouldn't allow him to date his boyfriend because it was against their religion. No one knows what the real reason was. \n\nHe committed suicide last year and died from an overdose.",
            "For the first year and a half of college, I worked the evening shift (3-11) in a small town hotel (that was ran by my best friend's mom). The laundry room was connected to the main office, and since it came out into the middle of the hallway, we usually used it as a shortcut if we were going to check on a guests room.\n\nEverybody would leave by 8pm, and the evening shift would work the last few hours alone (we primarily served weeklong business stays, so it was pretty quiet).  My first day working alone, a housekeeper was teasing me about a ghost that haunted the hotel. I laughed it off. \n\nThe night, when I was alone, I used the laundry room as a shortcut. I was halfway through the laundry room when ALL of the washing machines and dryers kicked on at the same time. I flew out of the room. I never really mentioned it to anybody, and in the back of my mind, I told myself that maybe everything had been set on a timer or something.\n\nI never had any more issues, until a year and a half later, on my last day of working there. Earlier in the week, I had an unsettling experience with a guest (He was \"embarrassed\" to borrow a plunger. He returned it by coming in through the unsecured laundry room, came all the way into the back office, and left the plunger in the middle of the room. He intentionally came in very quietly and never announced he was in the office or anything. I just turned the corner from the front desk and found the plunger in the middle of the room.). Due to that, I had shut the door between the laundry room and the office. \n\nIt was my last hour of work, and I suddenly heard what sounded like three drunk men arguing in the laundry room on the other side of the door. It was so loud and I kept hearing the clink of beer bottles, but I couldn't understand what they were saying. I called my best friend, who worked the night shift and was the manager's son. He could hear the voices arguing through the phone, too. The situation felt so surreal and even though I objectively knew it was a dumb idea, I opened the door to tell the guys to go to bed. \n\nAs soon as I opened the door, the voices stopped and the room was completely empty.\n\nI blew it off - but it was so weird that my first and last day involved such strange experiences.",
            "I fell asleep on the couch and got up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. Once I got there I realized I didn\u2019t have to go. I headed towards the bedroom but decided to turn around and go back downstairs to the couch. When I got there I saw my body still asleep curled up on the sofa. I don\u2019t remember what happened after, and I know it had to have just been a dream. But, it still freaks me out to this day to think about it.",
            "When I was eight years old I went to a haunted house on my school grounds. I was in a group of children and adults and we were moving through the house and somehow I got separated from everyone else and wandered into a room by myself.Someone grabbed my head and banged it repeatedly against the wall. After about 5 bangs they let me go and left. I just sat on the floor, stunned. To this day I still don\u2019t know what happened or why.",

We didn\u2019t say anything about it at the time, I just said \u201coh ok\u201d because I thought maybe I somehow zoned out. But this was like 6 years ago and I still think about it regularly. Like there\u2019s no way I zoned out while this man was talking to me. I had such a huge crush on him that I clung to every damn word that came out of his gorgeous mouth. If I had zoned out, I would have had to zone out for at least the rest of that sentence AND the start of a whole new topic. No way. Like how did I miss multiple minutes?? And this was like 3 weeks after this guy\u2019s eye went randomly blind so I was (and still am) legitimately worried about him having a brain tumor.

One of them hung themselves in the basement, you know the scariest part of the house. While living there doors would slam shut by themselves and other creepy things would happen but this one time my mother was going down stairs to do laundry. She always had a creepy feeling being in the basement like someone was watching her so she always wanted my dad to go down too, but he was at work, me and my siblings were at school, and she was home alone. Laundry needed done badly so she just went down by herself. But on her venture down the steps she saw a man with a goat head running at her. She refused to go  down there alone for a long time til my dad gutted the basement and sorta kinda demanded the ghost/demon to leave the house. She still hates being in basements alone even after we moved.",

It was around 5am and my dad walked out of his bedroom and passed us to head to work. He stopped and chatted for a couple minutes but he seemed different, I couldn't quite tell how but he just seemed a little off so I chalked it up to him being extra tired. He leaves the house. Not even 10 minutes later and he comes out of his room to leave for work. \n\nYou know those scenes in movies where the protagonist witnesses some catastrophic event and the shot focuses on their bewildered face while they gasp and mouth \"oh my god\"? That was me in that moment. My entire body went numb and I started panicking. I don't know why but it really messed my head up. I asked if he just left and came back but he said he just woke up and he didn't seem off this time, he was normal. \n\nStill can't explain what it was, wasn't lack of sleep since I've don't the all nighter thing several times before and after with nothing similar ever happening. I don't expect to know and I honestly will not search for answers. I chalk it up to a glitch in the system or a divergence from one timeline/reality/strand. Who knows. I sure as hell don't.",
            "I moved into a new house (UK) after a separation, so I was living alone. A few strange things happened (like knocking on my bedroom door in the middle of the night waking me up!). I ended up moving to the bedroom at the front of the house, the knocking stopped.\n\n My bedroom was at the end of a short corridor with the light switch for the upstairs lights outside my bedroom door. So i turn them off, go into my bedroom, now I had blackout blinds, I distinctly remember turning off my bedroom light and using the light of the screen on my phone to locate my bed because it is pitch black.\n\nSo I get into bed and get cosy, lying on my side trying to drift off, now I'm talking maybe ten minutes after I'm in bed I hear a loud click, a click from right outside my bedroom door, I thought that sounded like the lightswitch, I sit up and there's the light from the hallway shining through the bottom of my bedroom door. \n\nThe fear I felt then I've never had before or since. So I'm thinking, that can't happen on its own but I would have heard someone, I searched the house but I knew there was no way anyone was there. I do the same again, lights out and back to bed, thinking if this happens again I'm away, thankfully it didn't, and I decided to move house, but I still think about that click and wonder what was going on in that house",

            "long one, And it\u2019ll sound like bullshit.\n\nI went to a boarding school, as my dad was in the military and for a few years he was moved around way more than the normal every three years.\n\nIt was full of other kids in that sort of situation so was a bit rougher than what people usually think of when they here Boarding School. There was a lot of bullying and fighting.\n\nAnyway we would also make up stupid ghost stories to scare our dorm mates. One of them was about this former pupil called Peter who went crazy and killed the other kids in his dorm and a teacher before running away. There were woods near by and a few caves. It was said that he lived in one of them and would sneak back into the school to steal food and clothes from dorms.\n\nThere used to be a challenge to go to the caves near dark and run into the largest one and touch a stone outcropping that was just before the cave took a turn off to the side. Hardly anyone had the balls to do it.\n\nOne day me and some of my friends were messing about near the caves. I was playing with one of my toys that I\u2019d brought to the school. It was a slightly repainted GIJoe Salvo figure with a new head I\u2019d swapped in because I didn\u2019t like him bald. Some of the kids who used to give us a hard time sort of snuck up on us and gave us the usual beating. Then one of them threw my toy into the cave. Laughing at how \u201cSneaky Pete\u201d would have fun with it. After they left I tried to go in and find it but couldn\u2019t and I ended up getting freaked out.\n\nThis ate away at me for weeks. So I planned my revenge. The bullies would usually alway go too the cave after dinner to challenge a few kids to go in to prove they were cool. \n\nI snuck away from dinner early and got changed into all black clothing and a ski mask. I waited till I could hear the kids coming then snuck into the cave. Right to the back behind the stone and waited. They stood outside for a while but eventually one of the bullies tried to prove how tough he was by going to touch the stone. I waited till he got real close then jumped out and yelled. Everyone started screaming and running in all directions. I felt pretty good. Strangely my revenge had overcame any fear I had. I didn\u2019t really think that I was there in the cave, alone in the dark.\n\nAnyway the scary bit is on the way back I put my hand in my pocket and found my GIJoe. It chilled me to the core.\n\nNow I know that I probably just found it in there and subconsciously put it away while I was focused on the scare, but I have no memory of it, and my clothes were different. It still gives me the creeps.",

There was a badminton net set up on the property, and since Donna and I had recently had a \"badminton unit\" in gym class we went into the storage unit/pole barn to search out the racquets and shuttlecocks. At one point while she was digging through stacks of stuff she commented something like \"I think (cousin) Karen's husband is kinda creepy.\" The thing was, I looked directly at Donna and spoke that line completely in unison with her.  I'd had a very sudden \"flash\", as if I'd been in this exact place and this situation before, and I knew what she was going to say as soon as she paused and looked up at me.\n\nDonna, of course, was stunned and asked me how I knew she was going to say that. \"Deja vu\", I replied, still trying to understand it myself.

            "Seven years old, we've moved to a new state with any family members being 8+ hours away. During the summer of that year I was sent to stay with a group of strangers for about a week. Little kid me didn't really question it, because life at the point was already a stream of constant strangers.\n\nIt's only years later, as an adult looking back on my life, I realize how weird it was for me to be shipped off to people I don't know, and also could only very loosely be known by my Ma as we'd only been in state for less than a year. I ask her what the deal was with that, and she acts confused, and upon my explanation states that, that never happened.\n\nThing is, I have very clear memories of several things that happened during that time. I remember when I first arrived being scared about the roosters/chickens they let free roam. I remember there were several other kids. I remember stepping in a field of mud so thick it tore off my shoe. I remember going to a beach and being chased around by an older kid who had a crab in a bucket. And most specifically of all, I remember playing [Blades of Steel](https://images.lukiegames.com/t_300e2/assets/images/NES/Cartscans/bladessteelcart.jpg) for the NES, a game I've never personally owned.\n\nI know that people can reinvent and distort memories as they get older, but that all seems rather specific for it not to have happened. My assumption would be that my mother was just looking for some alone time with the guy she was shacking up with, but I don't know why she'd lie about shipping me out. I mean, it's also likely that what for me was a strange memory, for her was an inconsequential week decades ago.\n\nSo it's just one of those weird unsolvable mysteries of my life.",
            "We used to have a night out every Christmas with the lads from high school. We went back to one of the lads houses and were all drunk having a good time when one of the lads pointed into the kitchen and said \u2018who\u2019s that\u2019 - the kitchen was like a box room you could see the whole room from the doorway!\n\nI had my back to the wall where it was and turned to look in, the lights were off and there was no one there. We all looked and said what are you looking at. He was adamant and just stayed sat pointing and just said \u2018no who are those two there\u2019 \n\nThe lad who\u2019s house it was was looking in and turned on the light and again there was no one there, and we all said are you ok, what are you on about? \n\nHe said \u2018look that fella is leaning on the worktop and the other is leaning and pointing and laughing at me\u2019 - we all kept saying there was no one there. After a back and forth for about 10 minutes, he was describing what they were wearing etc and then the lad who could see these people realised we couldn\u2019t and started freaking out, tearing up and shaking uncontrollably saying he had to get out of the house. He was shaking that much we had to put his shoes on.\n\nOnce he had gone and being drunk (no drugs, that we knew of!) we just laughed it off as him being off on one but the lad who\u2019s house it was said he described his uncle and grandad who had long since died EXACTLY how they used of stand and what clothes they were wearing.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t of believed it if I wasent there, and honestly I still think he just had a mad episode. We have all met his grandad and uncle before they died so it could of been some mental moment he had. To this day anytime we mention it he refuses to talk about it, and doesn\u2019t even entertain any notion of it. Like I said, it sounds far fetched but that is 100% true, I don\u2019t believe in ghosts etc and still think he had a \u2018moment\u2019 but it was genuinely weird and unsettling!\n\nEdit: thanks for the awards kind strangers so soon after posting! Didn\u2019t think this tale from my past would explode!\n\nEdit: added more detail it seemed a bit vague!\n\nEdit: a few people have asked so to tidy it up, this guy has no history of any mental illness or anything else. To this day he has a stable, solid career and home life. I know that isn\u2019t always a solid indication everything is ok but after 15 or so years he\u2019s never shown anything of the sort!",

Back in those days, Disney was working the ticket system. You paid to get in the Park and at the same window, you bought tickets to be used within the Park. The tickets were designated A through E, with an E ticket being for the best rides in the Park. As I recall, \u201cIts a Small World\u201d was an A Ticket ride \\[?\\], \u201cMr. Toad\u2019s Wild Ride\u201d was a C Ticket ride \u2013 and much later, Space Mountain would be an E ticket ride.\n\nIn our group was Dad, Mom, my sister Kim and I.\n\nWe had a great day, and documented the trip with our Polaroid SX70. \n\nA word about how our family worked: Dad was the photographer. Period. No one ever used the camera except for him.\n\nHowever, I \\[age 13\\] took the undeveloped photos and fanned them until they developed. I was the MAN!

Riiight, Dad.\u201d\n\n\u201cSon, when it comes to machines, it\u2019s an imperfect world. Things break all the time. What if the mechanic for that ride had a bad day yesterday? We are NOT going underwater on that thing.\u201d And that was that.\n\nI was a bit crestfallen, and Dad tried to throw me a bone. He offered to take a picture of a Nautilus as it cruised by, so I was mollified. After all, it was a chance to fan an undeveloped photo!\n\nMom and Kim dropped back, and Dad went to the rail. We watched as he bent over the rail facing the lagoon and snapped a shot of a submarine as it traveled by on its underwater rail. \n\nOut popped the white photo with a whir and a click, and he handed it to me to fan. I did so, and we walked on, me contentedly fanning another photo.\n\nIn a moment, I looked at the developed photo, and for a moment I did not understand what I was looking at.\n\nI called Dad over and showed him.\n\nIn the photo was the lagoon, the Nautilus, a black area on the right\u2026**and the back of my father\u2019s head.** \n\nWait, what? The back of my dad's head was in the picture? Impossible. He leaned over the rail and snapped the shot. We watched him do it. There should have only been the sub and the lagoon in the frame.\n\nIt was if I had held the camera over my head behind him and snapped a picture, but that had not happened. Remember, only Dad was the photographer. NO Exceptions. I watched Dad take the photo while leaning over the rail. So did Mom. It was genuinely an image which could not exist.\n\nDad looked at the photo, and said: \u201cWell shit, Kidosky. Told you we weren\u2019t going on that ride.\u201d \\[Kidosky was his nickname for me at times\\]\n\nDad was a product of his era \\[early adulthood in the 1940s\\]: show NO weakness. He appeared to shrug it off. But years later, Mom would tell me that he later broke down and cried in front of her and asked what it could have possibly meant. Was it a message about his mortality? \n\nHe would die 6 years later of mesothelioma, but I never connected the two incidents in my heart. After all, we all have a shelf life.\n\nWe kept the photo, and I have scanned it.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/FhVKtDj\n\nI give you an impossible photo that Mom, Kim and I watched be taken. What appeared on the print should not exist.\n\nTo this day, 46 years later, it remains one of the true mysteries in my life, and now all you know about it.",
            "When I was a kid, I lived in this tiny 2 bedroom apartment with my mom and sister. For whatever reason, I used to sleep on the couch in the living room, wake up at 3 am and watch anime while I get ready for school and then sleep for a few more hours. I honestly don't remember why I used to do this. Anyways, one night I'm awake (it was probably around 2 or 3 am) and all of a sudden someone starts BANGING on the window and screaming. I mean like,  HYSTERICALLY. It scared the absolute shit out of me. This went on for a good couple of minutes before it just stopped. The weirdest part was it didn't wake up my mom, my sister or even the neighbors. And when I asked if they heard anything they told me no. Honestly maybe it was just my imagination or some crazy old person but I'll never know. \n\n\nAnother incident that happened to me was when I was in middle school living in a house in the middle of nowhere with my family. It was a weekend and of course I was sleeping in. My parents always hated that and would wake me up all the time. So when I heard this voice in my ear say \"Wake up.\" naturally, I wake up thinking it's my mom or something. But when I opened my eyes, no one was there or in my room. So i thought, \"Maybe they came in a few minutes ago and I'm just now waking up.\" Curious, I asked them if they tried to wake me up this morning. They both said no. To this day, I'm not sure if I was just hearing things or what but still freaks me out.",

            "My wife and I were heading home from the cottage on a Sunday night. It was dusk on a regional 2 lane highway and we see a tall lanky bearded man wearing only running shorts crossing the road in front of us. He appeared out of nowhere and was all of a sudden a few feet in front of the passenger front corner of the car heading to the side of the road. We missed him by a foot at most and he didn't even seem to notice us as his stride didn't break or speed up. This all happened in about a half second.  I check the missors and I don't see anything. As I'm trying to process what happened I'm questioning if what I saw was real. Then my wife says \"Did you see that guy?\"",
            "We were staying in an old cottage one summer. Around 4 days into the trip in the morning my mother asks us why someone was standing outside her bedroom door for about an hour in the dead of night. We were confused because we had all been asleep. My mother asks if we're sure because she could hear someone walk up to the door and then just stand there for a while. We just told her that none of us were awake and she just said,  \"ok\" and moved on.\n\nI really would like to know what it was.",

            "I worked a summer camp in the middle of the Colorado Rockies. No internet, no cell phone service. Each night another cabin leader and I would wake up at 2am to go to the fire pit to smoke a couple of cigarettes. It was the only opportunity we had with how full our days were. One night, we\u2019re casually smoking and look into the woods, really just appreciating the mountains, and I see in the trees a giant hulking figure. It moved out from behind a tree, dark, and in my estimation 12ft tall. I mean to my bro, and sputtering told him to look, and of course it was gone. After my terror subsided I attributed it to being a weird dream state. I can still vividly see it in my head to this day.",
            "Ok so I\u2019ve posted this on Sleep paralysis subreddit but haven\u2019t had much response. It\u2019s my only explanation which makes remote sense of it all;\n\nHappened a long time ago but I just now remembered it.\n\nI\u2019ve shared this story to a friend only once and never spoke of it again, because logic tells me my mind was hallucinating and it was probably just sleep paralysis. Even though it still freaks me out. \n\nStory:\n\nI was 12 or 13? My family goes to Vietnam every year or other year since I was young and we would stay at a random family members house to save money from hotel costs. My family is huge. Anyway, location this time is at my uncles / aunts place in District 2. I\u2019m just a kid so I share a bedroom with my cousins, aunt and uncle, while my mom, dad, and brother share another room next door. These bedrooms are upstairs. I randomly wake up in the middle of the night and this never happens, I\u2019m usually pretty good about not drinking too much water to need to pee, but just enough to sleep and not be thirsty. But when I woke up, I hear a very weird vibrating humming noise outside, and at first I figured it was just someone coming home late from work / partying and is on their moped and won\u2019t turn off their engine. However, the sound seems to be coming from above and not below? And the next thing I see is a giant flash of light going across the balcony right outside our bedroom. Everyone is dead asleep, my uncle is still snoring super loud and everything. I kind of freak out and close my eyes to just try and fall back asleep. But of course, my heart is pumping with what feels like adrenaline. \n\nNext, I feel/sense two entities standing next to me, to my right and the next moment, my body lifts up off the bed, I can feel my sheets kind of just flop over and hanging off my feet due to gravity. I can now also hear a new humming noise, and it\u2019s like I\u2019m on a scanner. It goes up and down my body like an MRI machine. There\u2019s definitely a light and warm feeling going up and down as well.  I\u2019m of course, still freaking out. I want to open my eyes but I\u2019m too scared to. \n\nNext, I feel one of them pressing down on my belly. The first time it felt like a squish, just straight down into my belly. About equivalent of something weighing 5 pounds, super light, could\u2019ve been a finger? Or a stick?  I\u2019m thinking wtf wtf wtf at this point and still freaking out, my heart is racing like crazy. \n\nThen the 2nd time they poked me there, it went super hard, definitely felt like a sharp stick/pipe pushing down on me with a force of intending to pierce through. I\u2019m now trying to scream and open my eyes, but my eyes are now locked shut, I can\u2019t open them, and my screams sounded muffled, like I\u2019m screaming into a pillow, and the pillow has a vacuum abyss that returns no echo. \n\nI try again and again to move any part of my body, to scream and make some kind of noise. But all in vain. This goes on for a solid 15 seconds of excruciating pain, until one of my cousins turn in their sleep (I can hear our bed creak a bit), and I\u2019m returned back to the bed softly with the force on my belly releasing. \n\nAs soon as my back hit the bed again, I open my eyes to see these entities I sensed next to me, but they\u2019re gone, and the next thing I see when I sit up is that same flash of light, but disappearing, along with that mysterious humming sound going off into the distance. \n\nI look around the room for any signs of anyone noticing anything at all. My uncle is still snoring loud as ever, and everyone else is also still sleeping. I\u2019m now in a sweat, heart still racing. I stayed up for the rest of that night. \n\nWriting this story, I\u2019m shaking remembering it very vividly like it just happened. Someone please tell me I just experienced a random case of sleep paralysis please. Lol\n\nEdit 1:  thank you all for the read. Most upvotes I\u2019ve ever gotten!! \nSleep paralysis or definitely aliens are so far the only explanations. It feels good to share about it finally though. Thank you all again for reading!",
            "I was living in Boston. I woke up at 3am or so by my cat jumping up on my bed and curling in between my calf muscles and going to sleep. My cat would do this every night since I was 5 years old. That was his spot. It was something I was very familiar with.\n\nThing is, My cat was living with my parents on the west coast. So I couldn't understand what the hell I just felt. But I knew it was my cat.. I just figured I was dreaming.\n\nGot a call from my parents the following morning that my cat died around midnight the previous night. 3 hours behind since I was on the east coast. Guess that was my cat traveling to Boston to come see me one last time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: After so many replies, I got to say this. Really, I wasn't dreaming. I remember it quite well. I said maybe I was dreaming because I am doubtful myself. But thinking back.. Yeah I was wide awake and realized my experience. Despite being a fun believer in ghosts (Suspension of disbelief) I haven't had any other experiences other than this. This is my own experience and I expect and appreciate the doubt.

            "I was 18 at the time, having just finished high school and went with my friends to the beach on our motorcycles (18 is the legal driving age). A friend had just gotten his bike modified and recommended that I 'take it for a spin'. Stupid 18-year old me said sure, left my helmet behind and got on with shorts and a t-shirt. Note here that it was the second time driving that bike and it had no ABS.\n\nI was driving for like 10 minutes in a straight, country road and eventually decided to head back. On my way there, I was really speeding (stupid 18-year old me) and decided to overtake the car in front. Gear down, revving, and just as I am approaching to overtake, the driver decides to do a U-turn out of the blue.\n\nI do not recall much from my reaction, I slammed the brakes and then I saw a sort of 'flashback' of my family's faces, thinking that I would never see them again. Then, some seconds later, I realized that I stopped, literally a yard or two away from the driver's door and she was eyes-wide, starring frozen at me.\n\nI recall the time of overtaking the car and my speed and honestly, I cannot tell how I did not die there. This changed my life, the way I think and gives me the chills every time.",
            "I live in West Virginia. While I can't claim to have encountered any Flatwoods monsters, I've had my fair share of oddities.  \n\nAround the age of 13-16, I greatly enjoyed hiking. I found some pretty neat stuff on my travels, like super old coins, abandoned woodworking projects, and ragged stuffed toys. I'd throw all my findings into an old bookbag and come home, slinging it under my bed before brushing my teeth and hitting the hay. One day, I found a yellowed old bone, probably from a raccoon or groundhog of some sort, with deep, intricate carvings on it. As per usual I put in in my bag and headed home. That same night, I couldn't sleep at all, and eventually entered a staring contest with a bird perched outside my window before it flew away. The next morning, the carved bone was gone, as if I never took it home with me.  \n\nThat bookbag never had any holes in it, and I kept it zipped up and under my bed every night. I know for a fact I didn't drop it on one of my trails.",

Never attempt to sing any part of your wedding.  It will not go as you visualized it.  \n\nA wedding day is not a good time for surprises.  Don't surprise your bride with an unexpected part of the ceremony.  Don't surprise your mom by the wedding itself (true story... the bride told her mom she was going to an engagement dinner).  The only exception to this rule is if you give the bride a surprise addition to her ring \u2013\u00a0grandma's diamond, a ring made from her parents' rings, etc..  \n\nJokes about sex later are never funny.  They make people uncomfortable, and it makes you look like an adolescent.  There will always be crickets after you make the joke. \n\nIf you are going to be late, communicate that to EVERYONE somehow.  Have your SO, or your parents, or someone tell everyone you will be late.  The staff needs to know, especially. \n\nIf you forget the rings, don't stress it.  It's a funny story.  If you forget your vows, wing it as best you can (just don't sing).  Ask the officiant for help for last-minute vows.  \n\nFinally, don't get drunk and be an ass.  You don't want to be that guy.

This girl was so self centered she kept everyone waiting at her outdoor ceremony for more than an hour while she was pampered in the makeup chair. While she's having them redo this and touch up that, she's sort of making up her wedding vows in a very relaxed, casual manner completely inappropriate for the hundred people sweating under full summer sun waiting on her. Her aunt came in and very gently reminded her people were waiting on her and that it's been more than an hour and she threw a tantrum, screaming, \"I feel like everyone's forgetting this is MY DAY!!!\"\n\nEventually she comes out, \"vows\" are lame and borderline incoherent, and one of the groomsmen, sweltering under coat and vest and shirt and sun, passes out from heat exhaustion. The officiant whispers to ask the couple if they should stop and make sure he's okay and she goes, \"Nah, he's just being dramatic, keep going!\"\n\nAs the couple is headed back up the aisle, an ambulance can be seen arriving to tend to the poor overheated groomsman.",

            "Giving horrible vows and speeches. \n\nA part of my family has the habit to use any family gathering as a moment to remember loved ones who died. That's not a comfortable habit for me but to each his own. However, it becomes very weird when wedding speeches and even vows start to include great uncles who died more than a year ago, and the only people who actually knew him are my grandparents. Yes, the vows. And not even in an interesting way, but just \"if only uncle Barney could have still been alive while we are getting married\".\n\nTo be honest, our entire family is horrible at giving speeches. There's 2 brothers, one of whom is my dad, and 2 sisters. \n\n- My parents can only make joke speeches\n\n- the uncle and his family make dry lists of things they do. For example, his wedding speech for his son was an 10 minute monologue about renovating the couple's kitchen.\n\n- One aunt can only boast about achievements their family members have gained, if there's no achievements, there's no speeches\n\n- the fourth is the one with the death speeches.",

            "I'm sitting here reading along happily and completely forgetting I can actually contribute. \nI have burned this from the far reaches of my memory. It was that bad. But here we go. Apologies for length. It was a weird, long night. \n\nMy wedding-if one may call it that-was an extremely small and quick affair under an *overpass* by a fetid body of water, consisting of my overemotional and violently excited mother, my ex-husband in his dress uniform, and me in a leather jacket trying to reason with the two of them that this is all rather sudden and we're *under an overpass, for God's sake.*\n\nDisclaimer: the Ex was the mastermind behind all this. We'd been together some years, occasionally discussed marriage, I wasn't in a rush, apparently he was. Ah, youth. \n\nHe'd flown my mother down as a surprise, hired a local nondenominational minister, *picked under the overpass for the charming view of the open water beside it.*\n\nNothing good or green lived in that water. It smelled and was stagnant. I remember staring wearily out at it while I listened to cars passing overhead. It was very, very windy. Did I mention it was night? This was less a joyous union and more the beginning of a Law & Order episode. My mother is doing a foxtrot in her joy over our young love. \n\nAnyways. I'm an idiot. I go with it. It's bizarre, but I've a strong tolerance for the bizarre, and I feel bad money was spent and mother was flown and whatnot. In retrospect I should have cast myself into the water before me and cried out for Cthulu to take me into His sweet embrace, but hindsight is always 20/20. I digress. \n\nHere comes the minister! He's late. I can see he is also wondering why the fuck we're all under an overpass in the dark. He comes closer. I get a good glimpse of his face. He is crosseyed. \n\nNow, crosseyed happens, and I mean no disrespect to the crosseyed. But merciful Christ. I am *under an overpass, next to a swamp, mother dancing, ex oblivious to why I seem disturbed, it is night, trucks downshift above me, and now here is the minister looking at all of us at once with ease and if I laugh, I'm never going to stop, I will shame this poor man, my idiot ex, my fucking mother, save me Jesus, don't let me laugh, dead puppies dead puppies dead puppies-*\n\nI keep it together. I do not laugh. And then the minister begins to speak. He is addressing my ex whilst simultaneously looking at both me and the water. He wants his money upfront. That's what the Craigslist ad specified. I proceed to inhale my own face to keep from dying. My mother, God love her, cheerfully volunteers a twenty from her wallet. My ex is muttering and paying the minister. In the back of my mind, I wonder if this man is legally able to marry us (sadly, he was.) \n\nMinister paid, the \"ceremony\" begins! It's quickly apparent he doesn't know my name, despite introducing myself while trying to not make eye contact. He calls me Georgie. My name is Jennie. I correct him politely. He waves his hand in the air as if swatting off flies. I am Georgie for the rest of the event. Fuck it. Why not. \n\nMy ex takes my hand. My mother starts noisily weeping. The wind really kicks up while the cars rattle overhead. I am straining to hear the minister over the din. He swiftly spits out the We Are Gathered and so forth, with the harried air of a man performing a shit wedding ceremony under an overpass at night who just wants to go the fuck back to whatever Craigslist ministers do when not on duty.\n\nIt is time for my vows. I actually laugh briefly at this point, but by now it's panic. What the actual fuck is happening here. Have I lost my mind? *I'm getting married under a fucking overpass with a officiant who can't be bothered to learn my name.* \n\nIt's at this moment both myself and the minister forget how the vows actually go. I remember first. I chant *with this ring.* The minister looks in two directions at once and chants in reply *with this ring.* All of this is confusing. I shove the ring on my exes hand and blurt out the rest furiously. At least what I know from watching wedding movies. I'm not about to do a call-and-response with the minister who doesn't know my name. \n\nIt's done. We're permitted to kiss. The worlds briefest kiss occurs. My mother is good enough to take pictures. In the dark with the flash on, the minister looks absolute nightmare fuel. \n\nThe flash is what does me in. It breaks me from whatever stupor I've been in for the last half hour. I begin to laugh.\u00a0\n\nThis is not the gentle, sweet laughter of a new bride swept up in the rapture of love. This is the deranged howling of a madwoman bereft of her medication. This is senseless, evil cackling in the night. It fills the space under the overpass. It drowns out the cars and the wind. It does not stop. I try, I really do, to gather myself. It doesn't work. I'm too far gone. My mother doesn't look so excited anymore. And the minister pulls his eyes together long enough to give my ex a look of deep and heartfelt pity.\u00a0\n\nWe head to the ministers car and sign the paperwork on its hood. I'm still laughing. Nobody is saying anything. It is uncomfortable. I look (and feel) like a lunatic. I'm laughing out of context.\u00a0\n\nThis is already much longer than I'd anticipated it being, and this is probably going to get buried anyways, so I'm going to wrap it up: minister gets in his car and leaves, I laugh, we climb into our own car and head to a chain restaurant, I laugh, we eat, I laugh, we end up at home, I laugh, mother goes to bed, I laugh, ex tries to get frisky, I laugh. You get the picture. \n\nFound out later he had a drinking problem and liked to paw up other women whilst drunk. He doesn't see an issue with it. Divorce ensues.

It was part of a 20 minute speech explaining how the bride and groom got together. There were plenty of parts in the story where the groom was like \"I wasn't sure she was right for me\" but his son was pressing him because \"he wanted a mom.\" (Sad story actually, biological mom died when the kid was 4 and this was 8 years later.) So it was this long unfocused story that boiled down to \"I'm marrying this woman so my kid can have a mom.\" Not a good sign when that's your main reason to get married.\n\nI focused on the \"little children\" quote because getting advice from children is absolutely not what that quote is about.

Unfortunately, my MiL doesn't like to be one upped, so she impromptu got a distant 2nd cousin from her side of the family who we did not know to immediately sing \"My heart will go on\" from Titanic. He was not a good singer and used a shitty youtube karaoke track and it lead to very awkward slow dancing, followed by fuming from her after we cut it short (terrible feedback from trying to play the track on the mic from phone's speaker). Just completely deflated the beautiful moment from my brother's singing. At least I'm happy to say we're still going strong and have been married for 10 years now. It should go without saying that little poop nugget of singing was NOT included in our wedding video.\n\nEdit: Wow this really blew up, my biggest comment in reddit yet, to those who asked, this is the song:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u-_OUWNUUY",

In the middle he says something along the lines of \"I know what we really need at this reception A BIG...BLACK...BULLET...motorcycle\". \nThe crowd was super weirded out so to ease the tension one of the guest did a belly dance.

            "My aunt and uncle had decided to dedicate their weeding to the brides kids, everything was little mermaid and they had a huge little mermaid bouncy house right in the middle of everything. Their wedding was on a severely crowded beach at 3 in the afternoon. The groom decided it would be a good idea to ride a paddle board into the reception and it would be an awesome idea except everyone could see him get on the board and then go out to the ocean then turn right around and come back. The couple also decided to get incredibly high and couldn\u2019t even remember each other\u2019s names let alone theirs. Oh and one last thing, the grooms vows were literally \u201cI love you more than bacon\u201d that\u2019s it, that\u2019s the only thing she said.\n\nEdit: since some of you wanted a couple more stories, I will tell them. During the ceremony, as I have mentioned before, it was a very crowded beach, there were little kids and dogs everywhere. A couple of dogs got loose and no one really seemed to care, but those dogs ended up going behind them and they started going at it. No one did anything to shoo away the pups having a good time, because obviously no one wanted to ruin the ceremony, but the only thing any one could focus on were the dogs just going at it as the preacher was talking about love and long lasting.\n\nThe couple wanted to do the cake thing where you smash it in each other\u2019s face and honestly it\u2019s a fun and cute idea but they took it a little toooo far. The bride doesn\u2019t even pick up the cake, she grabs her husbands head and just smashes it down. All anyone had for desserts that my poor great grandma spent days making. \n\nThat is all I remember for now but if there is any that I do remember I will definitely post them!

            "When I was fresh out of high school, at the wedding reception of a friend and a guy she'd met only three months prior. When everyone was seated for the meal, they had everyone, individually, stand up and introduce themselves to the room \"so they can get to know each others' friends and family\". Thankfully someone talked them out of \"Never Have I Ever\" or whatever awful icebreaker game they were planning to do next.\n\nWhen it got time for the toasts, once the folks who had toasts prepared were done, they called on other guests by name and would ask if they had anything to share. Like, \"Hey MeesterPepper, I bet you've got great words of encouragement for us, you want to go next?\". Got them an extra four or five awkward, rambling speeches that completely undermined the actually nice toasts the others did.\n\nTheir marriage lasted almost 5 years, which, to their credit, was 5 times longer than anybody bet on.",

Everyone looked super uncomfortable, and our cellist almost passed out. On top of this the bride did not seem to want to be there AT ALL. Wouldn't take the groom's hand, even when he reached for it, and shrugged during all of her answers. Never once smiled. Super cringy.",

Now, I went out and bought a nice dress and got all dolled up just to find out it was a TEXANS TAILGATE THEMED WEDDING. Everything was tailgate themed. So cornhole, Texans merchandise including beer koozies as wedding gifts, and barbecue. The bride had her dress altered so that the top half was a Texans jersey. The groom was dressed in jeans and a dirty white shirt. \n\nThe bride was late to the wedding. After she arrived and had walked down the aisle, the bride\u2019s niece sang a song she had made up for the event. This is going to sound so bad on my end because this kid was probably about 10 years old, but her singing was the cringiest thing I had ever heard. I have no idea how anyone kept a straight face. Maybe it was the alcohol.\n\n\nEveryone was drinking, which was fine and great and all.... until the bride and groom got drunk and started making out and dry humping against the back wall of the venue.

If you do have a reflective surface do not look at it especially if the reflection is somewhere you can\u2019t see or yourself.

If you see a hider in the reflection just ignore it, hiders have no ill intentions but can cause dangerous psychological damage.

After five minutes look back at the mirror if she moves closer or doesn\u2019t move you\u2019re safe, if she disappears do not look under your bed, do not look to your side and do not look at the other bunk. \nDo not under any circumstances look under the bed the risk is too great. \nIf the shadows in the room have gotten darker or larger decrease the light level in your room. \nIt is normal to hear sounds during the night so do not worry about them. \nYou must keep your eyes closed between 4:00 am and 4:50 am. If you get sleep paralysis and see one of the sleep paralysis demons do not freak out and do not move if you can, they are curious creatures and will keep you safe for as long as they are there. \nIf you wake up at 12:50 am, 1:33 am, 2:12 am, 3:33 am, 4:56 am or 5:07 am just stay still and don\u2019t move.

There is not much to do and shops are closed. \n\nYou can hear ambulances all day and night.\n\nMy uncle is in the hospital with a high fever. His wife got it as well but she is home as her symptoms are milder. My cousin is taking care of her and miraculously she is fine.\n\nHowever her grandpa died and she couldn\u2019t even go to visit him. Her grandma is sick as well and she can\u2019t see her either and she can\u2019t see her dad. Hospitals are closed.\n\nThe available hospital beds in intensive care have run out and doctors are making tough choices for who to try to save which is terrifying considering most of my family is old and they might not get a bed. \n\nDoctors are overworked and tired and since I know many people that work in the hospital, they are sharing with me these gruesome pics of people recovered in the intensive care unit. They are intubated and it just is a sad view.\n\n\nHospitals are so full of people on life support because of Coronavirus people are amassed on the corridors because they lack rooms:\n\nMy friend who gets people with the ambulance is working non stop to get people who are in critical\n conditions.\n\n\nPeople keep saying it\u2019s just a flu. Yes sure, but a flu without having had a vaccine can be quite dangerous. The youngest person I know that has it, he is in his forties and has had 40 degrees Celsius temperature for two weeks straight and counting. \n\nDon\u2019t catch it, it\u2019s really not fun even if your immune system is strong, trust me on this, I have seen the repercussion on my family first hand. \n\nNo church is open or public event is held. \n\nSince Italy is primarily populated by old people, we are used to see the streets being empty and everything being quite. Right now is just quieter.\n\nThey couldn\u2019t even held the funeral for her grandpa.\n\nMy grandma woke up sick and I truly hope she has something else.\n\nSo many people in my city have it and yet they keep going around the city and spreading it. Incredible. \n\nSome people  go to the supermarket and get out of it with tons of food so that they don\u2019t need to go shopping again. Others, like my grandma, go everyday because \u201chow else is she going to get fresh bread?\u201d\nLuckily we have convinced her that she cannot go anymore and she said from tomorrow she won\u2019t leave the house. Just this Sunday she HAD to go to church to confess. The town priest has been taken to the hospital today because he catched Coronavirus and he is in critical conditions.\n\nI wonder how this death count will go up now that the hospitals are overfilled.\n\nRumor has it that my cousin\u2019s grandma got it because she was in the hospital being treated because she broke her back but I can\u2019t be sure about this so this is just our personal speculation based on no real evidence so don\u2019t take my word for it. \n\n\n\nEdit: first cases of people younger than 25 in life support",

I have friends in northern Italy quarantined in their homes, my mum in hospital working with face masks and generally people freaking out.\n\nThey say grocery shopping will be guaranteed, so overall I'm not even worried about it. Maybe is the chance to have some days off and enjoy my home and some games...\n\nUnrequested update: is 6pm, while working we got a document to show to police officers if we get stopped while going from a \"comune\" (something like U.S. municipalities) to another. In this document we declare who we are and why we aren't in our home. You can move by car/bike/whatever if you have to meet your family (older people who need care, children and so on) or go to work. Every other reason is forbidden. Right now you still can go around the comune where you live without almost any problem (you only have to keep distance from people around you).\n\nTraffic is quite low, compared to last week for example, but people still do their things.

We can't move from a town to another, unless we have a specific permission (for example, we can if we have to go to work).\n\nEvery day we use Google meet to make online video-calls with our teachers and classmates, so we keep studying and doing our programs even if we are closed in our houses. \n\nMany people are terrified, while many are chilling way too much, especially in the southern regions, because the virus has just started spreading there, while here in the Northern regions there are already thousands of infected.\n\nSorry for my bad English, I hope this comment answered your questions",

We are advised to not leave our houses unless it's necessary, but you can fill a form on your own to certify that you need to go to work, so basically everyone is running around without a real examination of that form because literally anyone can do that.

She is not allowed to leave her house unless it is an emergency (which I hope never happens). She says there has been quite a bit of panic buying at the Supermarkets. All the restaurants are pretty much empty, however they are allowed to be open between 6am and 6pm (people who are seated should have at least a 1m distance between them at restaurants). Tourist areas (eg Duomo in Milano) are devoid of almost anybody. All school and University's remain close, all sporting or any kind of events have been suspended, ski resorts are closed, the same for cinemas, theaters, discos, all church services have been suspended. Whilst the measures may seem extreme, Italy has been the hardest hit worldwide besides for China, so it's necessary to curb travel and cultural activities to stop the spread of the virus.",

            "Ok, I live in Venice and my father is a doctor at Venice Hospital so I have a **VERY** general idea of what is going on (doubt anybody really know what to do actually). \n\n1) Italy has a large number of positive patients because of the heavy testing approach used in the first days of the outbreak. The more you test, the more you find. This is controversial because no hospital was prepared for this massive number of people to be hospitalized, so they quickly runned out of masks, hand sanitizer and life support equipment.\n\n2) Our media are shit. They have spread panic since day one which resulted in empty supermarkets and people with a lot of pasta and water bottles (no i'm not joking). Few days later everyone is saying that there is no emergency pushing everybody to go out and have fun (ex. San Marco square organized an event with hundreds of people that attended it) spreading the virus even more. Pick a side goddamn.\n\n3) For a good week in the hospitals nobody had any idea of how to behave since there weren't clear indications from the government. Now there are more serious protocols which consists in testing every people with syntomps and only the closest family members (at first we almost run out of testing kits).\n\n4) The reasons of this major \"lockdown\" (which is nowhere near what China did, you can still go out, nobody is stopping you) is that there aren't enough bed in intensive care units. In Lombardia they already started doing triage because they don't have enough mechanical ventilators. Yet people don't understand that this is the problem: we don't have to stay at home because the virus is particularly dangerous, we have to stay at home and avoid contact because **there are not resources for everybody**. However a lot of people, in particular young people are taking this like a holiday and keeps going out (example, beaches were full of people Saturday because was a sunny day).",
            "I live and work in the Milan Area. Since my job can be done remotely, i'm in \"forced smartworking\"... So just do my normal job from home. There are orders from the government to avoid going out of the house for anything that is not essential (like emergencies and groceries). All social gatherings are canced until April the 3rd: so no gyms, no parties, no weddings, no funerals, etc. When going into public buildings like supermarkets we should wear masks, keep 1.5 m distance, and only few people at the time are admitted.  \n\n\nNot every job can be done remotely, so there are still people going to their workplace, but given that most of the people is not, public transportation is almost empty.  \n\n\nAirlines are cancelling flights since many people are not going and for sure they are not buying new tickets.\n\nSince the extension to the whole Lombardia of the Red Zone (in theory is the \"no in, no out zone\") has been leaked last weekend, many (irresponsible, i would say) people escaped by train to their families/parents south. I heard that they will be quarantines, i hope that they are actually doing that.",
            "I live in the Veneto region.\n\nThe situation here is very critical. The number of infections rises hour by hour as well as that of the dead.\n\nHospitals are full. There is no more space. Doctors and nurses make long and exhausting shifts. All hospital wards have been converted to deal with the covid19 emergency. All possible health professionals have been recalled from retirement.\nThere are no more masks. The countries of the European Union, which has very little of \"Union\", have blocked the export of sanitary material to Italy. The only country that came to our rescue was China.\n\nLife is hard. You only go out for issues of necessity such as food, work or medical urgency.\n\nEvery day is a war bulletin. Covid19 is not a simple flu. For the elderly, immunosuppressed people and all those with pre-existing diseases such as cancer, HIV, asthma, etc., can be lethal.\nFor others the symptoms are very high fever, excruciating muscle pain, dry cough and severe sore throat. The duration is several days compared to a normal flu.\n\nPersonally the men in my family are all at risk. My three older brothers suffer from asthma and my younger brother is HIV positive. My father is old and with a poor health. \n\nSchools and universities are closed, such as pubs, restaurants, shops etc. \n\nNobody can go out. We organize flash mobs on the balconies every day.

We started to make videoconferences with our teachers and honestly it's so much better than going to school like usual. The fact is, the teachers prefer, of course, to teach older students (Seniors and the 19-year-old category), so our work is reduced, I guess.\n\nAside school, people are all basically locked up in their houses, waiting for the virus to \"disappear\". Young people tend to meet, but I think that from now on they'll stay in as much as the adults.

The lockdown was made because people started going on vacation or in pubs, cities etc. ignoring many common sense rules.  \n\n\nMany are worried by the economic repercussions of this lockdown: I'll have to close my activity for basically a month, and that's gonna suck. If the government does not help us by stopping taxation for a while we might be in deep trouble, financially speaking.  \n\n\nThe virus itself concerns people because of the strain on the national sanitary system. For people not familiar with Italy's system, we have universal healthcare for everyone, rich or poor, and the intensive care units are almost full. Natural Disaster Triage is taking place in many hospitals.  \n\n\n  \n\n\nHope this will be over soon.",

As someone working, I have a slightly different perspective: I think this limits (but it's right to be limited cause we can't be smart if nobody leads us holding our hand) what we can do and it affects me. I work 8am-7.30ish pm, so I basically just wake up, work, go home. I can't go for a drink with my friends, I can't do sports, I can't do anything. I don't have my family nearby, I don't have a gf, I live in a different town then my friends. And that gets to me already after just few days. I have no way to relieve stress, to distract myself. At work we have to wear the masks. I work at the pc so it's fine, but we have a production site where they have to wear the masks while performing phisical demanding tasks. If breathing is not as easy for me, for them it's pretty bad. All this adds up to some discomfort that I believe if it will continue for 2 3 weeks, it will really become weird...",

Sclerosi Multipla), but the earliest they could deliver it was on the 20th...\n\nThere are some assholes running around who try and trick the elderly by pretending to be sent by the hospitals to test them and then rob their houses. \n\nPeople are still expected to go to work, but the hours have been reduced by a lot to avoid further spreading of the virus and most are required to wear masks, especially people who interact with customers. \n\nAlso the jailbreaks and prisoners' revolts are kinda terrifying\n\nSchool is a little tricky. My school is using Hangouts Meet to hold online classes and we have audio logs from the teachers who cannot hold conferences. Teachers can hand out marks if they write them as unofficial until school starts back up.\nJust for context I'm in one of the most difficult courses one can choose for high-school (because I'm dumb and love torturing myself) and the curriculum involves stuff like Latin (litterature and language), ancient Greek (litterature and language), philosophy... stuff like that which relies on heavy student-teacher interaction.\n\nI also have severe mental health problems (anxiety, PTSD from a sexual assault at age 12, panic attacks, self harm) and was going to start with therapy this month but my appointment was moved to the 6th of April (after the lock down ends) and I'm in a constant stare of panic, not from the virus or anything like that, but from the sheer terror of going back to school after over a month of absence.",

I\u2019m a 3rd year medical student who is fighting to keep my position since they are trying to get everybody to stay home and away from potentially infected patients. That being said, most of us want to continue our clinicals since we need a certain number of hours, and what better time to learn crisis management than now, right? That being said, people are robbing our hospitals of masks, gloves, and sanitizer. It\u2019s disgusting considering we need every bit of supply possible. \n\nThe number of cases being reported isn\u2019t even close to being true. I can\u2019t speak for all 50 states, but in Florida there are known cases that don\u2019t make the news. They sit those patients on the same ICU floors as everybody else.

I\u2019m sure it\u2019s happening across the country, but you only hear so much about it. Patients could be dying, or have died, of pneumonia but weren\u2019t tested because of either point 1 or 2. \n\nI hate the people who were complaining of their classes being moved online. The schools aren\u2019t trying to stop the spread, they\u2019re trying to slow it down so hospitals aren\u2019t flooded at once like Italy. The response rate of the US is that of see no virus, hear no virus, then there is no virus. A lot of younger people are goofing around knowing they aren\u2019t likely to die from it. You\u2019re not, but your parents, grandparents, diabetic friends, and anyone else who has a weak immune system may very well die. \n\nAlso, don\u2019t cough or sneeze into your hands. That\u2019s gross. Face plant into your elbow like you care about infecting other people with whatever disease you have. And why are the shelves bare of soap? Do you guys not wash your hands already?

Bottom line is, we *can* still do what we did before, but with heavy limitations and our Government is (rightfully) imploring us not to do anything that isn't necessary. The only thing we **cannot** do is traveling between provinces and regions unless we have specific reasons as listed in the current decree - health matters not related to coronavirus, work, particular needs, which we have to esplicitate in a self-certification.

            "This is a two-part tech combo: limestone calcium reactors + biomass gasification. This addresses several problems:\n\n* Woody biomass **waste** that poses a wildfire hazard, as well as that which is merely a nuisance\u2014 dead and diseased trees, nut shells, pruned limbs from orchards, vine canes from the wine industry, off-cuts from the lumber industry, stuff like that. (Nobody is talking about chopping down fresh trees for this solution, FYI.)\n* Carbon capture and sequestration\n* Ocean acidification\n* The need for renewable energy\n* loss of soil fertility\n\nThere is the need to draw down carbon from the atmosphere if we hope to have a livable earth, because we're on a trajectory to see catastrophic levels of warming (3-4\u02daC) if we do not. This combination taps into one of the cost effective ways of doing this. Direct industrial /chemical air capture of CO2 is not cost-effective, because the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is still too low for such processes to be efficient. The atmospheric CO2 concentration is about 0.039%.\n\nProf. Greg Rau of UCSC figured out how limestone waste (calcium carbonate) readily reacts with CO2 dissolved in sea water to form calcium bicarbonate, which only exists in liquid form, and [how this can sequester carbon](https://www.llnl.gov/news/speeding-mother-natures-very-own-co2-mitigation-process). As a mineral carbon capture system, it is far faster than other candidates for this kind of process, [such as olivine](https://projectvesta.org/), which is another promising solution, but which takes much longer to do the same. Calcium bicarbonate reactors using limestone are already used by mollusk farmers to increase the saturation state of calcium in water and to counter ocean acidification caused by CO2 (which forms carbonic acid as it dissolves into the water). Using limestone calcium reactors, just the limestone waste from quarry activity could more than remove all the industrial CO2 emissions from the atmosphere and **safely** store it in the ocean. Oceanic diatoms would then use it to form their shells, and the settling of the microscopic shells to the ocean floor would store away the carbon for thousands if not millions of years. The problem is that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is too low to make capturing it in water or sea water cost-effective. To make this cost-effective, a concentrated source of CO2 is needed\u2014specifically, a concentrated source of CO2 whose carbon is extracted from the atmosphere. The CO2 emissions from biomass power generation processes could provide that.\n\nPlants draw down so much carbon from the atmosphere in producing their biomass that their impact on atmospheric CO2 levels is visible as the downward strokes of [the Keeling curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeling_Curve). Every year, as the northern hemisphere enters its growing season, CO2 levels worldwide take a downturn. The problem is that the decay of all of this biomass and the burning of biomass in uncontrolled wildfires results in the release of CO2 back into the atmosphere. Add to that the CO2 emissions from industry, and you end up with a steady upward march of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.\n\nBiomass gasification's role in this is converts biomass into clean burning carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas, which can then be used in an internal combustion engine to generate power. (We're not talking about incineration nor direct combustion, nor mere pyrolysis here; [gasification is a very specific set of processes](http://www.allpowerlabs.com/gasification-explained). The emissions from a biomass gasifier genset of this type are about 18% CO2 (460 times more concentrated than the atmospheric CO2), but all of the carbon content of these emissions came from the atmosphere rather than from fossil sources. Feeding the emissions of a biomass gasifier into a limestone calcium reactor would give it the concentrated CO2 it needs to operate efficiently.\n\nOn top of that, biomass gasification of the type I'm speaking of produces charcoal as a byproduct. It turns out that the carbon in charcoal does not revert to CO2 without combustion, since it is resistant to decomposition. If this charcoal material is used as [biochar](https://medium.com/local-carbon-network/a-perspective-on-terra-preta-and-biochar-765697e27bd5?source=collection_home---4------2-----------------------), which is charcoal used as a soil amendment, with its best use being its use as a compost adjunct prior to use in the soil, the practice amounts to \"reverse coal mining\"\u2014the capture of CO2 in plants and the use of a power generating process to produce solid black carbon which ends up buried in the ground.\n\nWhen biochar is added to compostable materials, the composting process [releases much less methane](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jobm.201200096) due to methanotrophs being favored over methanogens in the compost, and the production of N2O (an extremely potent and long-lived greenhouse gas [300x worse than CO2](https://theconversation.com/meet-n2o-the-greenhouse-gas-300-times-worse-than-co2-35204)) is [significantly abated](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep01732). And when this compost material is added to soil, it triggers biological cascading effects which cause the soil to continue to take up more and more carbon in the form of increased stocking of plant root exudates and increased soil fungi. In particular, arbuscular mycorrhiza are of interest because they produce [glomalin, a glycoprotein responsible for storing nearly a third of soil carbon](https://www.ars.usda.gov/news-events/news/research-news/2008/glomalin-is-key-to-locking-up-soil-carbon/). But the crazy thing about this is that these processes have many additional benefits, such as improved soil resilience, drought resistance, and fertility.\n\nIn my opinion, this combination is the best chance we've got at undoing the damage that we've done to the atmosphere and oceans through our CO2 emissions, because it taps into the power of plants, who are already drawing down CO2 for us. \n\n(If anyone who is well resourced and interested in carbon capture/climate restoration would like to advance this tech, DM me. )",

We've had three instances over the last 4 months of an external moderator being suspended or banned by Reddit admins.\n\n\n***\n\nEDIT: Here's our success stories WIKI entry, which links to some of the highlights over the last few months - https://www.reddit.com/r/ModerationMediation/wiki/success",
