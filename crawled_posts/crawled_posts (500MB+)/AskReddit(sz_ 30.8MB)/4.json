            "Force compliance on specific diets with a diverse sample of people and a well regulated control group. Follow for 10+ years. Is veganism really healthy? How about paleo? Should we never be eating gluten or dairy?\n\nEdit to add:\n\nThis has definitely not been done before because there are several problems with this kind of study\n\n\n You can\u2019t force people to comply to a diet, which is the first hurdle. You could have people voluntarily report what they eat, but this isn\u2019t a randomized trial and has its own issues. Recall issues, compliance, self selection bias, etc. You\u2019re also missing a good control group to compare results to. \n\nThen if there is a population that follows a certain diet, say people from the Mediterranean following the Mediterranean diet, you run into the problem of correlation versus causation, there could be something different about their lifestyle that is explaining the health differences besides diet. Same issue as above, no control group. \n\nThere\u2019s also the huge issue of not having a longitude study. Most short term trials examining diets are just that, short term. It\u2019s hard to ascertain if their are health effects show up 10 or 20 years down the road. \n\nAlso, people claiming that they \u201cknow\u201d what diets are healthy/unhealthy. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s true of some diets/types of foods. And research non experimental data, even with it\u2019s flaws, can point us in the right direction. I\u2019d feel pretty good saying that eating more vegetables is healthier for the vast majority of people, eating Doritos is not healthy for the vast majority of people. But there is so much we don\u2019t know about optimal nutrition and how different populations react to food, I\u2019d love to see an actual high quality experiment.\n\nSecond Edit:\n\nYou can\u2019t experiment on prisoners. This seems to be a common question. Even an experiment you feel is benign is unethical. Prisoners are unable to properly consent because they, rightly, feel their liberty is at stake for consenting. They are therefore not able to consent to an experiment, which means you can\u2019t run it. Most of the laws and norms that were passed stating this were conceived after World War II when researches were quite literally concerned about preventing the crimes of the nazis from taking place again.",

Seriously, DO NOT DO THIS TO ANYONE ON ANY SCALE. This post is based on the concept of setting morals aside, this is a massively horrible thing to do.\n\n\nEdit: A few people have commented that this is the same as learning a second language, and I want to address why that is not the case. When you learn a second language, you as assigning a new word (that has no previous meaning to you) to a concept that you already know. So you know what an apple is, and you stack  \"pomme\" on top of that when you learn it in French. But you aren't learning a *new* word, you're taking a word that already is assigned to another concept and trying to apply it somewhere else, while *forgetting* the original connection. Your brain isn't good at breaking neural connections. So you have to start thinking that you take a bite out of a car (apple) , and you get in your roof (car) to drive to blue (work). This is MUCH more difficult because your brain automatically tries to learn new things, but has no good mechanism for forgetting.\n\n\nBased on comments it seems that some have experienced this with single word swaps and it has been very difficult to overcome. I'm inclined to think that this would actually break someone. Experiment deemed unneccessary.",

            "1904 Olympic Marathon in St. Louis.  \n    The #1 finisher drove most of the race. He started the race, got tired and heat exhausted and wanted to drop out. He got in a car to DQ himself and head back to the stadium but along the way realized he was near the finish line and got out to claim the glory.  \n    The #2 finisher was carried across the finish line by his trainers. On a bogus pseudoscience theory, the trainers had been giving him a mixture of brandy, egg whites, and rat poison instead of water. When it came out that the #1 finisher had driven most of the course, this guy was given the gold despite the help from his trainers to finish.  \n    For some reason, the #3 finisher was just a regular guy who did nothing unusual. In this case, ordinary was extraordinary.  \n    The #4 finisher was a Cuban Mailman, who had raised the money to attend the Olympics by running around his entire country and asking for donations. When he landed in New Orleans, he lost all the money gambling. He managed to scrounge enough to get to St. Louis and attend the Olympics. However, he had no money for athletic gear, so he ran in dress shoes and pants hacked off at the knee by a fellow racer who happened to have a knife. He probably would have come in first had it not been for the hour-long nap he took on the side of the road after eating rotten apples he found at an orchard near the course.  \n    The #9 and #12 finishers were from South Africa, and ran barefoot. South Africa didn't actually send a delegation - these were students who just happened to be in town and thought it sounded fun. #9was chased a mile off course by angry dogs.  \n    Half the participants had never raced competitively before. Some died. St. Louis only had one water stop on the entire run. This, coupled with the dusty road, and exacerbated by the cars kicking up dust, lead to several fatalities.  \n    The Russian delegation arrived a week late because they were still using the Julian calendar until 1918, while effectively the rest of the world had switched to the Gregorian calendar.  \nCredit to [u/Dracon_Pyrothayan](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dracon_Pyrothayan) for this synopsis, which I have shamelessly stolen and tweaked just a little for clarity and brevity.",

            "In 1908, there was a car race around the world that started in NYC. The route would start in NYC to San Francisco to Valdez, Alaska, across the Bering Strait, through Russia and Europe, with the finish line in Paris.\n\nCars were relatively new and road infrastructure was limited to only metropolitan areas and even then, a lot of it was cobbled stone.\n\nBut what you might have thought, is how in the world can a car get across the Pacific? Duh, they would drive across the Bering Strait during the winter when it froze into an ice bridge silly!\n\nThe race began in Feb 1908 and immediately ran into challenges. To list a few; cars breaking down multiple times, lack of usable roads, car-hating people giving wrong directions and oh yeah, SNOW. The first team reached San Francisco in 41 days. But quickly realized that the proposed route from San Francisco to Alaska did not exist. So the organizers allowed teams to ship their cars to Valdez, Alaska then continue on the Ice Bridge.\n\nOnce in Valdez, the teams found out that there is in fact, no ice bridge across the Bering Strait anymore because it melted \\~20,000 YEARS AGO. Small oversight.\n\nOrganizers then allowed teams to ship their cars across the pacific to Japan then Russia to carry on.\n\nDespite all unpredictable and hilariously predictable odds, the winning team arrived in Paris 169 days later.\n\nHighly recommend to listen about it from [The Dollop podcast.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3ogAPkGOVI) There\u2019s more nonsense that happens that I couldn\u2019t fit in/remember.",

Half of the 30,000 Roman troops were either killed in battle or drowned in the lake. 5000 were captured and the other 10,000 staggered back to Rome creating panic that the greatest army in the world had just been handed their ass by a Carthaginian upstart.

            "Battle for Castle Itter was the only time in WW2 where the germans and Americans fought side by side. A SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde (the branch of the SS responsible for guarding and maintaining concentration camps, this specific one a part of the Dachau administration) commander Sebastian Wimmer abandoned his post on May 2nd at a high value prison camp containing people like prime ministers and celebrities as he feared for his life after he sent a Croation handyman Zvonimir \u010cu\u010dkovi\u0107 on an errand into the nearby town (5 miles away) W\u00f6rgl and he didnt come back. The town was occupied by Wehrmacht I believe. \u010cu\u010dkovi\u0107 instead went up the river valley to Innsbruck (40 miles away) and reached the advance group of the 409th IR of the 103rd Infantry Division of the VI Corps. They couldnt really authorize an attack but they could wait for a response from HQ. anyway a but of time passed (a day or two) and my dude Wimmer got scared after he didnt come back and combined with the death of Eduard Weiter (the commander of Dachau) and the death of Hitler a few days prior, he fled, and the entire SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde fled a bit after too leaving the prison unguarded. Anyway HQ gets back with a go ahead for an armored attack of M10 Tank Destrouers but gets called back after they encounter shelling and also get close to the territory of the 36th division on the east. But I think 2 jeeps of auxiliary personnel continued. Anyway the prisoners now have the castle of Itter to themselves and arm themselves. They didnt see any effect of \u010cu\u010dkovi\u0107's message so on May 4th sent Andreas Krobot, a Czech cook who volunteered on a bicycle mission to W\u00f6rgl which had now been occupied by SS instead of Whermacht. When he got there he was sent to Wehrmacht Major Josef Gangl who commanded the remains of a Wehrmacht unit who told the retreat order to fuck off, defected, and became head of the local Austrian Resistance there and had his unit protect the people of W\u00f6rgl from the SS. Gangl's men were fond of him and agreed with his ideas and participated freely. He hoped the Americans would reach W\u00f6rgl and take it from the tight and brutal grip of the SS and surrender to them. However with this news from Krobot, time was of the essence. He went to a nearby town of Kufstein (8 miles north) where a recon unit of 4 Sherman tanks of the 23rd tank battalion of the 12th Armored Division of the XXI Corps. They were under the command of Captain John C. \"Jack\" Lee and were waiting to be relieved by the 36th Infantry Division. Lee accepts the surrender and the Intel and agrees to help out enthusiastically. He gets approval from HQ and heads out with Gangl and his unit. Lee and Gangl personally scout out the castle with Gangl's Kubelwagen (military car). Lee leaves 2 Sherman's behind before going. He does however does take the newly arrived 142nd Infantry Regiment of the 36th scheduled to relieve them. There is a bridge en route that was a little janky for the whole column so he sent the reinforcements back and left 1 Sherman tank at the end to guard it and provide cover for crossing. The column now only consisted of a truck of 14 americans, a truck if 10 German artillery men, Gangl, and Lee. 4 miles from the castle they defeated a group of SS trying to set a roadblock. There was a roaming SS unit that was trying to recapture the prison and execute the prisoners. While they were doing that, back at the prison they elected to have a kinder young SS officer named Kurt-Siegfried Schrader to be in charge of defenses until help arrived. Once the fucky Whermacht-US army arrived they were disappointed at its small size. However they welcomed them and they set up defenses. The Sherman tank \"Besotten Jenny\" was positioned at the main entrance. The VIP prisoners were ordered to stay hidden but decided to fight along side the Whermacht and US Army. During the night the SS sent a recon unit to see how well the defense was by engaging in combat. Before the main attack on May 5th Gangl phoned Alois Mayr who was the Austrian resistance leader in W\u00f6rgl for reinforcements. Two german soldiers and a teenage resistance member were all that could be scraped up and drove to the castle and joined the clusterfuck of Wehrmacht, US Infantry, and famous french people whose task it was to defend a concentration camp. When the main attack began the Besotten Jenny Sherman was laying down MG fire until it got butt raped by an 88. The only occupant was the radio man who escaped fine and dandy. Meanwhile while this shits going on the 142nd Infantrys like \"fuck man we gotta go help them\" and started hauling ass there. Lee's like \"they have ZERO Intel on the enemy position and numbers, etc and they gotta know that and our comms have been cut off.\" Then famous Tennis star Jean Barotra who was one of the VIP prisoners there offered to run a message to the 142nd mid battle. So my mans the tennis star vaults the walls and runs through the SS mid fight and gets to the 142nd to deliver the message and request a uniform and a gun. The request was met and they headed out again. At 16:00 the 142nd arrived just in the nick of time as the defenders were almost out of ammo, beat SS ass, took 100 prisoners and sent the french home. They got to Paris on the 10th. Lee recieved the Distunguished Service Cross. Gangl died from a sniper while dragging former french prime minister Reynoud out of the way of the fight. He was honored as an Austrian National hero though and a street in W\u00f6rgl is named after him. He was the only defender death with 4 others wounded. Hitler committed suicide 5 days prior and Germany surrended 2 days after. It was the only time US and German troops fought side by side.\n\nTL:DR The German Wehrmacht joined up with the US Army and a bunch of prisoners consisting of ex prime ministers and celebs to defend a medieval castle turned concentration camp from Waffen SS troops only to have their ass saved by a crackhead french tennis player who vaulted the wall dashed through crossfire to deliver a message to reinforcements.\n\nEdit: 2 minor details added\n\nEdit 2: sorry if it's a bit confusing I'm not a good writer but I'll try to clear up some things: Gangl's Werhmacht unit were defectors after they realised the war was lost and the SS was wrong to continue. Theres a comment here that explains it pretty well. Commander Wimmer ditched the place after his commander (Weiter) and hitler died and a handyman he sent out didnt come back which most likely meant he went to get help (which he did). Sorry I know its weird to read and my writing isnt the best but I'll be happy to clarify and answer questions\n\nEdit 3: about to write another story on Operation Cottage here for anyone interested",

            "Helping a woman finish is usually more about rhythm than force. If you struggle with rhythm, try putting on music with decent bass.\n\n\nIf she starts breathing hard, twisting around, or especially says \"I'm close\", change nothing! Changing things at this point can be very effective, but it's also complicated, and usually requires a good amount of communication. If you are looking for sex tips, start there: change nothing when she is close.\n\n\nTry to focus on your partner, exclusively. Many people are hyper aware during sex. They can tell if you aren't really paying attention. It's not a good feeling.\n\n\nIf you are self-conscious about finishing fast, find out what you need to get to round 2 (protein shake? Cuddling?) And talk about this with your partner. Many women *like* the idea that they can make their partner finish fast. They also like to finish as well. The simplest solution here is to have sex twice. If you struggle to have sex twice in a short time period, keep in mind that penis-in-vagina sex is often the worst way to help a woman finish. Learn to give good head.\n\n\nStop being self-conscious about your dick. There really are cons to a big dick, and pros to a small one. And the only reason to really care about it's size is because of how it affects your partner. Your pleasure has nothing to do with your size. Even if you have a micro-dick, seriously, stop worrying. Your best bets to helping a woman finish are, in order, your words, your tongue, your hands, then your dick. You can learn to use all four better. You can't make your dick bigger. If none of that can help you stop fussing about it, consider that confidence is itself attractive. Even being self-depricating about your dick (which is still healthier than most people's relationship with their dick) is not confident behavior.\n\n\nA lot of this read as \"chase your partners pleasure more than your own\". Keep in mind that they should be doing the same thing! If you feel like your partner doesn't care about your pleasure, talk about it! Guys can also have bad sex.\n\n\nThe single best tip for sex is often the hardest, due to how we tend to treat sex: communicate!",

Unless she explicitly expresses an interest in your dick; then you can go ahead and talk about the D.\n4. Good manners go a LONG way.  I can't tell you how many times women have mistaken my politeness for interest.  Be polite.  Have a conversation that is not about sex or dating. Look them in the eye.  Treat women as people.  Seriously guys, we need to be better in this department.  Be polite and gentlemanly, and not in a knight in armor kind of way.  Don't do it so you get accolades and attention.  Do it because it's the right thing to do. And as a nice side effect, you'll get more chances with the ladies.  But don't let that be the reason you do it.  Let it be the cherry on top.  But first, be a decent man.\n5. Lastly, understand and appreciate that women want sex too.  Sometimes more than we do.",

You don't. So often we're doing things like \"Well I put my hand on her thigh and she didn't take it off or move away, so she must want to go forward, right?\". And sometimes you're in the clear, and other times she didn't react because she didn't know how to say no.\n\nSo don't force anything. She'll let you know when she wants to kiss you. She'll let you know when she wants your hand down her pants. \n\nMaybe this date you won't get laid. And hey, maybe she'll wish you had instigated a little more! But you'll never get regret, or have sex with someone who's not comfortable with you and feel like crap after, if you just change what you're looking for. A no can be misconstrued, but a hell yes? A hell yes is impossible to miss, and if you wait for that, I guarantee you will have much, much better sex.",

            "Some general advice:\n\n- no piece of advice applies to all women. These are just guidelines that should be applicable to most folks, but communication is key (as I'll explain later).\n\n- hygiene: goes without saying. Keep it clean. \n\n- keep your nails short. If you forgot this until the last moment, clip them and run the edges on your jeans to dull them a little. No one wants to get fingered by Scary Terry, bitch.\n\n- orgasms are not always required. Obviously they're great, but if either you or your partner doesn't finish after you've given it the good old college try, don't get down on yourself about it. Sex should be fun even before the orgasm. Put her pleasure above yours and she'll probably take care of you.\n\n- use protection. Yes, it feels better without it, but let me tell you what doesn't feel good: child support payments. Chlamydia. Full-blown AIDS. Or at least I assume they don't, because I've never experienced any of those things. Because I use protection. When used correctly, condoms are 98% effective at preventing pregnancy according to the knockout blurb Google gave me when I searched \"condom effectiveness\". Look up a YouTube video if you're not sure if you're using them 100% correctly. And I don't care how strong you think your pull-out game is, entrusting a horny dude with the task of not ejaculating inside a woman that's saying \"fuck me harder, baby\" (like your partners will be once you're done reading this guide) is dumber than sending a kid to the Jared Fogle Summer Camp (that was a real thing, look it up). And get tested after each new partner, just in case. Can't be too careful.\n\n- don't masturbate with too tight a grip! You'll kill the sensitivity in your dick. Use a loose-but-firm grip and lubricate yourself. If you've already been doing this, switch to the aforementioned technique, no exceptions. If you find that doesn't get you off, well, too bad. You don't get to finish until you can finish like that, because otherwise you'll be in the unenviable position of not being able to finish while fucking. And then she'll get self-conscious, you'll be embarrassed, it'll be awful. Beware the death grip.\n\n- pee after you finish. It's even more important for women, but it goes a long way toward preventing urinary tract infections.\n\n- make some *NOOOOOOISE!* Probably. Most women tend to like it when you're vocal. Don't go overboard - grunting like a warthog (like a lot of porn stars seem to do) is probably too much. But let her know you're enjoying yourself! Tell her how good her hand/mouth/pussy/ass feels, how much you love her tits/ass/legs/pussy, etc. Unless she's not into dirty talk, which is fine too.\n\n- don't be embarrassed. Not getting it up happens. Shooting your load too soon happens. Farts, queefs, armpit-fart-noises-because-your-skin-was-suctioned-to-hers - it happens. Get used to it. Laugh about it. Enjoy yourself.\n\nOkay.\n\n1\\. Communication. \n\nThis is super-important. The most important. It turns out that it's much easier to do stuff she likes when you know what it is because she told you. You can work it into talking dirty, too - if you try a particular rhythm and she reacts positively, ask her if she likes that (as suggestively as you feel comfortable with). If she says \"harder\", go harder. But! If she says \"don't stop\" or \"right there\", keep doing *exactly what you're doing*. Same angle, pace, intensity, whatever. Conversely, if she's doing something that doesn't work for you, gently tell her so. It's better to correct that kind of thing early than reinforce something that doesn't do it for you (this is why faking orgasms is bad). And if they do something you love, make sure to let them know that too. If there's an opportunity to tactfully and respectfully ask some questions beforehand, do that. Is she into dirty talk? Spanking? Hair-pulling? Does she like her breasts/nipples played with? These are all things that a lot of people do like, but some people find distasteful, and you shouldn't spring them on someone without asking first. Communicate before, during, and after sex. Can't stress this enough. \n\n2\\. Foreplay\n\nGuys, by and large, are simple. If a sexual partner touches me on the penis with some lubrication, I'm happy. It feels good. Easy as that. Women are generally more complicated. Even if you've got lube on your dick, you can't just go shoving it in there (unless she specifically asks for that, in which case she's probably got the lubrication covered so go for it!) without a bit of prep. Set the oven preheatin' before you put the meat in. This can start long before the bedroom - sexting, talking dirty, the occasional touch or smack on the ass (depending on what she's comfortable with) throughout the day are things that can start her motor running long before you get in the car (not my finest metaphor but let's move on). Once you're about to get down, put your hands on her, tell her how sexy she is and how much she turns you on, how badly you want her. A lot of kissing is good, on the mouth, neck, breasts, stomach - see the direction I'm moving here?\n\n3\\. Oral Sex\n\nGet good at this. Learn to love it if you don't already. The statistic I last heard was that only 25% of women can orgasm from penetration, so better to get take care of it sooner than later. Not that this should be treated as a box to be checked off - enjoy the journey and it's that much more likely that she'll reach the destination. As for technique:\n\n- don't neglect the clit. That's the little nub at the top of the vagina (it may be shrouded by the clitoral hood, you may want to gently pull it back - but extremely gently if at all! This may not be pleasurable for some women! It has nerves too, be careful), and it's the thing that would've become the penis if she'd have turned out to be a guy in the womb, so keep that in mind. Do you want someone mashing your dick around like they're a professional Smash Bros player and it's Final Destination, Fox only, no items? Hell no. So be gentle with it. Caress it. Massage it. If she tells you to go a little harder, err on the side of caution - genital pain is a turn-off for the majority of people, so just be cool, okay?\n\n- don't neglect not-the-clit. Remember the thing you're trying to get your wang wet with? The hole that's your goal? Give that a little love too. Lick it from top to bottom once in a while. Get a finger in there and curl it toward yourself in a beckoning motion, like you're requesting that her orgasm come hither. If you feel a spot that's rougher in texture than the rest, make that your focus - that's the G-spot, and guys' equivalent is the prostate (which is a major pleasure centre). Again, pay attention to the lady. If she likes something, do it more. If she doesn't, try something else. \n\n- enjoy yourself and enjoy her body. Your free hands - or just hand, if you've boarded the S.S. Fingerbang Ferry - should be roaming around her body, playing with her nipples if she's into that, just exploring her. If your jaw or tongue are getting sore, tag in your fingers and kiss the inside of her thighs, her stomach, etc. \n\n \n\n4\\. Penetration\n\nIt's time for the train to enter the proverbial tunnel. Maybe your partner just had an earth-shattering orgasm from your twisting tongue technique, or maybe she pulls you up off your knees because she needs cock inside her right that second. Or maybe neither of those things happened. Whatever. Point is, she wants your penis in her vagina. If she isn't sufficiently wet, put some lube on your tube. If you're unsure of positioning (which is okay), let her guide you in. It's probably going to feel pretty good. If it feels so good that you finish right away, don't panic. Come clean (no pun intended) and maybe go back to eating her out or fingering, that usually more than makes up for it if you know what you're doing (which by now I've done all in my power to ensure that you do). Do Kegels every day if that's a common problem for you, masturbate an hour or two before sex, whatever it takes. If you have the opposite problem, don't worry too much - it might just be a temporary mental block, and if not they've got little blue pills for that. Anyway. Throughout the fucking, keep kissing her, touching her, etc. Get your hand down to her clit if it's not too sensitive (which you will know by asking her). Try a few different positions. Have some fun! Starting off with long, slow thrusts and then crescendoing isn't a bad idea. But different strokes for different folks, pun intended. The reason you want to get her off first is because if she's among the 75% that doesn't orgasm from penetration, you've at least done your best to see to her first and now you can have your fun. If you're using a condom (which you should be), finish wherever; ask before you finish on her ass/back/breasts/face (contrary to what porn would have you believe, sex does not have to end with a facial). After you've finished:\n\n5\\. Aftercare\n\nCuddles. Most people love them, I find. Spoon that lady. She just let you put your dong all up in her biz, the least you could do is give her a little affection afterward. If it's uncomfortably hot and sweaty, feel free to take a second to cool down a bit before you do this. Maybe take a pee break (UTIs are a drag, or so I hear). If you had fun, tell her so. Maybe don't ask if she finished. It can kind of come off as insecure, or like you're looking for some sort of macho validation. Which I guess is also just insecurity. Just snuggle up, play with her hair, maybe kiss her neck just a bit. Unless this isn't that kind of sex. That might come off a bit clingy if this is just some girl from the club. Did I mention that not all advice applies to all people?\n\nAnyway, I hope that's \u200benough to get you started. If you have questions about anything specific, fire away, I like talking about sex. Good luck and have fun!",

            "One thing I've yet to see is noise. Women like sounds. A lot of them when watching porn get off more on the sounds made than what they see. Let's face it, sex from most women's point of view isn't gorgeous. Don't be silent and creepy. Get into it a bit. I'm not saying scream or take it over the top, but there's got to be more than just heavy breathing. \n\nGet her off first. The clit is sensitive, so getting her off before penetration preps her to keep getting off through sex. It also eases your anxiety, which will help you perform better. Noises still apply, while you're rubbing her down there don't be silent. Give her something to think about while she's got her eyes closed going into ecstacy. \n\nDon't finger her vagina hard. I've not met many chicks that are in to hard core riley reid style fingering. That doesn't mean just rub the clit, the whole area is sensitive, but definitely focus on the clit. Make sure your hands are clean and nails cut before you do anything to her. The last thing you want is to cause discomfort down there, it's 10 times worse than if you hurt her arm. \n\nPussy eating was well covered by the gentleman who mentioned butterflies and bulldogs. \n\nCommunication was also well covered. Don't ask a ton of questions during sex, but make sure you aren't doing things she doesn't like.\n\nBe selfless. You can get off whenever you like. It'll feel so much better if you are patient. And it'll help you build stamina. If you have to stop and calm down, do it. Tell her she's so hot and you don't want to cum yet, then rub her or massage her. Trust me, she will dig it. The anticipation is huge, as they can't just beat one out. \n\nEye contact is good, but don't go over the top. Think about your facial expressions and what she is seeing. If you're bug eyed and locked into her gaze, it's creepy. Same goes for giving her a double chinned gaze. Being manicured and clean definitely helps. \n\nSet the mood. Music can be huge. Think of songs that make you a bit horny. Lofi beats are also good. Drowning out the rest of life so you can focus on each other and be present is huge. Also, clean your damn sheets. Nobody wants to fuck on a dirty ass bed. \n\nHygiene, though covered on this thread, will be repeated. Clean your stinky ass. Smell nice. Remember that there's 5 senses. Stimulate all of them. \n\nTalk before sex. Let her get her worries and frustrations out before you do the deed. She'll have a clear mind. If she's thinking about work or chores or her family, it won't make her in the mood for sexy time. Better yet, do some dishes and clean. Women love men with dishpan hands. It shows you care, which is sexy to her. \n\nSome women like aggressive sex, others like sensual smooth sex. It takes time to figure out what she likes. And that's okay. It's not always about the orgasm. I don't even cum every time anymore, and I'm fine with it because my goal is to be present, connected, close, and relaxed. \n\nRemember, it's more than just sex and orgasm. If you treat it as such, y'all will cum buckets. Massages, smells, touch, taste, sounds, feelings. It all comes into play. Treat it like it's the most amazing ride in life, because it is definitely one of the most amazing things about being alive. Cultivate relationships during sex, even a one night stand, and it leaves the partner longing for more.",

            "Any movie, but only spend $4,000 of the $300 million on it.\n\n(Editing this to add my explanation in later comments of my definition of bomb at the box office:\n\n\"Just to clarify, when I consider a movie a bomb at the box office, it's not just did you make back the money you spent. $4,001 recoups cost, but I wouldn't call that a success. And if word gets around that the move sucks, after that first wave of movie goers, it will die. To me a bomb at the box office is the movie is aesthetically terrible and it doesn't make enough money to impress. Everyone involved has their careers possibly hurt by being a part of the project, and it's an embarrassment. If Warner Bros. gave me $300 million, and I gave them back a $4,000 movie that earned even a $3,000 profit, to me it still sucked at the box office. If the masses walk away saying the movie sucked and warning others not to see it, and it didn't make a substantial profit, to me it bombed.\"\n\n\"That's not the only measurement. Waterworld recouped its costs but is still considered a box office bomb because it's considered a bad movie and audiences didn't like it. Justice League made back it's costs, made a huge profit, and is still considered a box office bomb because many people think it's a terrible disjointed highly disappointing movie. They tried to rescue it with another director, and it's still mediocre. See also Paul Blart 2. Made a profit. Still considered a bomb.\"\n\nIf Holmes and Watson recouped costs and made $3,000 in profit, it would still be a box office bomb. And they only missed their mark by about $3,000,000. ",

            "\\[This Image\\]([https://imgur.com/jxEHwIa](https://imgur.com/jxEHwIa)) from the 1988 Gladbeck hostage crisis in Germany. The guy on the left is a robber, the girl on the right is a hostage who was killed while the police was taking action to stop the crisis.\n\nFirst day, two guys rob a bank and held some people as hostages. They first demanded a getaway car. They were given a white Audi and 300 thousand german marks. They took two hostages with them in the car. Later one of the robbers sister boarded the car with them. News reporters were following them with their cars.\n\nThe next day, the robbers hijacked a bus with 32 passengers in them. A couple of times they allowed a news reporter to come in the bus and interview them, later one of the robbers even came out of the bus to give an interview, \\[It's in german\\]{[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICclYz\\_PL1Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICclYz_PL1Q)}, you can see the hostage bus in the back. He said that he doesn't care what will happen in the end because he will kill himself and that he doesn't give a shit about his life. Later they let some hostages out of the bus and drove the bus away. They stopped the bus at a gas station where the sister of the robber went to the toilet, where police arrested her. When the robber found out about it he said that they have 5 minutes to free her or a hostage will be killed. She was let free but while she was going to the bus an italian teenager was killed by the robbers, the italian teenager was protecting his little sister. He could have survived if there was an ambulance near the gas station.\n\nIn the night, they drove the bus to the Netherlands, where the dutch police demanded them to release the young hostages first, before accepting any offerings from the robbers. After they let some hostages away, the dutch police gave the robbers a BMW car (With remote control). The robbers took two hostages with them and drove back to Germany. Later on they were surrounded by alot of media reporters who took alot of pictures of the scene which can be found in Google.\n\nWhile they were driving on a highway the german police finally took action and rammed the hostage car (The remote controller was forgotten somewhere so it wasn't used). One of the hostages could flee off the highway, while the other hostage was shot and killed. The driver robber later said in an interview that the bullets from the policeman killed the hostage. The german police denies that and said that the robbers bullet hit the hostage.\n\n\\[Here is a link\\]{[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladbeck\\_hostage\\_crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladbeck_hostage_crisis)} to a wikipedia page of it.

            "[This](https://allthatsinteresting.com/john-list) is a photo of John List and his family.\n\nIn 1971, this asshole shot and killed his mother, wife, and children in their New Jersey home. Earlier in the year he lost his job and was unable to provide the abundant lifestyle he and his family were accustomed to. This was an abject failure in his eyes. \n\nHe hid the loss of his job from his family. He attempted to secure employment, but nothing measured up to his previous salary. So, he remained unemployed and continued leaving his home as if he were going to work while skimming his mothers account to cover the finances. Once that started to run dry his only \u2018logical\u2019 next step was to kill them: in his mind going on welfare would have been too humiliating so he instead opted to \u2018send their souls to Heaven\u2019.\n\nHe methodically murdered each family member one by one, moved their bodies to the same room, then cleaned each scene. He cancelled deliveries, notified the children\u2019s teachers they were going on vacation, and cleared out what little was left in the bank. He even went so far as to cut himself out of family photos so as not to leave any account of himself behind.\n\nHe spent one last night in the home and left the next morning, lights on and organ music blaring through the houses intercom system. Due to List\u2019s multiple ruses as well as the family\u2019s reclusive nature, the bodies of the List family weren\u2019t discovered for a month. By then, List was long gone.\n\nHe managed to evade authorities for 18 years. It wasn\u2019t until prosecutors commissioned an excellent forensic artist to produce a physical bust of List with age progression that he was caught. A neighbor of List recognized him and contacted authorities. He was living under an assumed identity in Colorado. He had gained employment as an accountant and was re-married.\n\nList was sentenced to five terms of life imprisonment. When asked why he didn\u2019t kill himself as well he replied suicide was a sin and he wanted to be reunited with his family in Heaven (doesn\u2019t track bud, don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard, but *MURDER IS A SIN*). He died in custody due to complications of pneumonia in 2008. \n\nThe kicker? The List home was a fucking *MANSION*. The room the bodies were placed in was a Ballroom. Directly above the bodies of his family in the Ballroom was a Tiffany skylight *worth $100,000 at the time of the killings* MORE than enough money to have recovered List and his family from financial ruin.

The two had never met before, and when Eklund stepped out of his car to talk to the girl on the day of the murder, she had begun feeling uncomfortable. When Eklund persisted in talking to her, Engla had (allegedly) kicked his leg.

In a few days these kids are going to be running for their lives from a far-right terrorist who will come to the island to kill them all. Not everyone in this photo will survive.\n\n[More photos in this gallery.](https://www.nrk.no/227/artikler/slik-vil-auf-erne-huske-utoya-1.8125355?index=0#album-1-8125435) There are a few of adult politicians who came to visit the camp, which was for members of a political youth organization, but other than those photos they are all of normal young people doing normal summer camp things. They have no idea that their lives are about to be shattered.\n\nEditing to clarify: He came to the island *with the intention of killing everyone.* He didn't succeed. Some swam away and were rescued by people staying at a campground across the water, who brought out all the boats they could to pull kids out of the water. Others hid in various places around the island. Still, he killed about 69 people here, and eight in a bombing in Oslo earlier the same day.",

She was diagnosed with Leukemia at the age of 11  and given no more than a year to live. \n\nSasaki's father, Shigeo, told her the legend of the cranes and she set herself a goal of folding 1,000 of them, which was believed to grant the folder a wish. Although she had plenty of free time during her days in the hospital, Sasaki lacked paper, so she used medicine wrappings and whatever else she could scrounge; including going to other patients' rooms to ask for the paper from their get-well presents. Her best friend, Chizuko Hamamoto, also brought paper from school for Sasaki to use. \n\nA popular version of the story is that Sasaki fell short of her goal of folding 1,000 cranes, having folded only 644 before her death and that her friends completed the 1,000 and buried them all with her.",

            "Alright son you asked for it, Here\u2019s how you rob a bank with bees. First off, Bumblebees ain\u2019t gonna cut it here. Honey loving bumblebees don\u2019t rob banks. They stay home and make honey. \n\n Now we can opt for the adorable [Africanized Killer Bee](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fd%2Fd0%2FApis_mellifera_scutellata.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAfricanized_bee&tbnid=DucoAmJGWQ0crM&vet=12ahUKEwi-2KPjo9jnAhXDBd8KHSU1C_oQMygAegUIARD5AQ..i&docid=BW8_1AiPI6gQnM&w=3072&h=2077&q=african%20killer%20bees&safe=off&ved=2ahUKEwi-2KPjo9jnAhXDBd8KHSU1C_oQMygAegUIARD5AQ), But my recommendation is to go with the Wasps, If you have the budget of course. As bees are limited to 1 sting per bee, The wasps and hornets don\u2019t have such limitations. Honestly, using bees is like trying to rob a bank with a crossbow. It\u2019s not a good idea. \n\n Speaking of wasps, And you really prefer American, The classic Paper Wasps and [Yellowjackets](https://www.google.com/search?q=yellowjacket&tbm=isch&hl=en&safe=off&tbs=isz:l&prmd=ivn&safe=off&hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwi3jPTI_NjnAhUHZ98KHaZ0AK0Q258EegQIARAE&biw=414&bih=896#imgrc=b0T2XkAVBILcjM) can be controlled relatively well with a good and healthy queen. \n\n For small town banks, You have many choices. But if you\u2019re looking for something more *robust*, intimidating, The Japanese Hornet, [Suzumebachi](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2F9%2F97%2FMale_Vespa_mandarinia.DSC_1515.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FJapanese_giant_hornet&tbnid=RDQIgmvcmE--JM&vet=12ahUKEwiu-sOgo9jnAhUFJd8KHVfPBwgQMygBegUIARDbAQ..i&docid=o_qhErBEgCszhM&w=3000&h=1993&q=suzumebachi%20size%20scale&hl=en&safe=off&ved=2ahUKEwiu-sOgo9jnAhUFJd8KHVfPBwgQMygBegUIARDbAQ) will be your best bet. It\u2019s great size, aggressiveness and ferocity will attract and lure gun fire, As any person with a gun will immediately be tempted to shoot it. They also say \"Fuck your tube.\" Which will leave you basically free reign throughout the bank. Make sure to lather wasp essence on yourself so you don\u2019t get stung yourself. And they will hover near you and land on you and *love* you like a dog. Recently in China, There has been a new discovery on a even bigger, badder [Godzilla Hornet](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=auto&tl=destination_language&u=http://www.xinhuanet.com/culture/2019-03/06/c_1124198183.htm) but regretfully I haven't had the pleasure of working with them.\u02b8\u1d49\u1d57\n \n Once the wasps and or hornets  are released, You will have a small window of time to rob the bank. Good luck friend.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the love.

            "I had an ear infection travel up what would have been an otherwise asymptomatic formation of my skull called arachnoid granulation until it finally reached my cranial cavity. It took a literal team of the best doctors (ENT surgeon, neurologist, multiple neuroradiologists) from Northwestern University Hospital and the University of Pennsylvania to first diagnose me and then treat me. I was absurdly lucky to have a friend of the family who is a doctor who was able to call in a favor to get the entire neuroradiology team at upenn studying my numerous CTs and MRIs. The head of neuroradiology at upenn told him I have the most unique looking skull he's ever seen. Talk about damning with faint praise.\n\nWhen they finally had a diagnosis, my ENT pulled my skull CT scan up and said \"Do you see that white spot? That's fluid. That's infection, it shouldn't be there. You're very lucky you haven't contracted meningitis (this had been happening for 10 years, undiagnosed). And do you see this black space here? That's air. That should absolutely not be there. Do you ever fly? (I responded yes, all the time, for work, for concerts, regularly, once a month or more) Well you absolutely can't fly until this is fixed. Every time you've flown in the last ten years and the cabin pressurized, that air could have expanded and shifted your brain off of midline and you'd have been dead immediately, without knowing anything.\"\n\nThey removed an L shaped infected portion of my skull about 2\" x 6\" and replaced it with a titanium mesh plate after sewing the tear in my ear canal shut. It resolved the problem and I haven't had any issues since. I can now fly.\n\nEdit, because people are asking :\n\nThe symptoms were fullness, pressure, and the feeling of fluid in my ears. It lasted years and several ents misdiagnosed me. Finally I asked one to put in a tube and it drained continuously for a month. The ENT I was going to, not the one who diagnosed me, thought it was a cerebrospinal fluid leak, and ordered me to have emergency surgery for a cerebrospinal fluid leak that didn't exist. He had taken a sample of fluid for testing but demanded I have what amounted to exploratory brain surgery for a condition that didn't exist. I was sitting on an operating bed as they were about to place pre-op antibiotics when I got a call from the aforementioned Dr friend of the family who said \"they don't know what the fuck they are talking about. Leave now.\"\n\nI got so many shit looks from the team of surgeons that had been assembled to cut my brain open to fix a problem that didn't exist. Two days later I got a phone call from my ENT saying \"the results of the fluid sample came back. It wasn't CSF.\"\n\nNo apology. No explanation. No nothing.",

            "I was just over 11 pounds at birth, and got stuck mid breach.  Head out, shoulders wouldn't push through.\n\nDoctor(s) decided that cutting me out would take too long at this point and could kill us both, so they pulled me out.  In doing so, they tore all the \"wiring\" as it were down my left side of my neck.  Unbeknownst to them.  What happened was stunded growth of my left arm at an angle pointing almost behind me.\n\nThey had to operate on my shoulder socket, and my hand had gone full on T-rex angled so they broke my wrist and turned it to force it to grow normally.  I was in an almost 3/4 torso cast for months as a small kid.\n\nToday in my mid 30s, I can't fully outstretch my left arm, maybe a 2/3rd stretch at best, I can't lift it higher than my mid chest, my wrist is pretty loose (hey now) so my hand wants to naturally flop forward a lot.  I can still move around mostly, but I can't push with my left arm all that much, struggle lifting heavy things, can't push away to the side of me, can't drive manual cars but can drive autos.  My arm is also thinner than my right.  Due to the muscle development, I had a twitch in a thumb almost like a clock for about 4 years that suddenly stopped.  Also have to use my right hand to get my left in to the position I want it to be in, because the nerves aren't there to send the signal to move it in certain directions.  You normally just move your arms, but I can't and it's like trying to move a part of you through telepathy.\n\nPhysio was the only answer, but it barely changed anything after circa 6 months and I packed that in in my early teens because what's the point etc.\n\nIt's fucked me up pretty badly mentally I'd say, even though I'm overall pretty happy.  Doesn't affect my work, I can still type etc but I get aches on my left shoulder blade and shoulder.\n\nI can't do pushups or pullups so don't go to the gym or do sports as it's an obvious disadvantage, so I'm overweight but not massive.  I naturally got bullied at school a HELL of a lot.  I'm so used to hiding it that its' muscle memory now, even though I'm at the stage of my life where I can say \"eh, yeah, this is me. deal with it\".  But because I don't work out I stopped swimming or doing anything with my shirt off in public.\n\nI'd say yeah, pretty damn rare case.\n\nAnd I don't even know what the condition is called.  I need to see a doctor about it as this was 80s when I was born and medicine has changed so much, I'm just so used to being this way I've never really pushed to get answers.  I've thought about it more since the pandemic but obviously doctors aren't exactly seeing people right now for non-emergency stuff.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n[Edit] Oh wow, my inbox exploded overnight.  Thanks so much everyone for the support, rewards and helping me see that this isn't actually all that uncommon, I just have a case where it wasn't fixed in time or more to the point was a direct result of being pulled out and it didn't develop while I was in the womb like some palsy can do.\n\nYes, I've thought of suing over the years.  My parents thought the same but this is the UK and the NHS - my cousin was a nurse at the time and suggested against anything in court because back then the doctors would band together against us saying it was the right call to be made at the time and circumstances, and that I'm an accident and just had bad luck.  I haven't contacted any lawyers about it, ever, but some days I wonder if I should, given the sheer impact on my life physically and mentally due to a \"bad call\" by a doctor.\n\nI also acknowledge that some of you have pointed out in DMs and reponses that people have lost limbs and still go to the gym and are ripped, what's my excuse.  I've been making excuses and hiding my arm as best I can and 99% of the time it goes unrecognized as I still have everyday control over it and it at least looks SOMEWHAT normal if maybe half or 3/4 the size and width of my right arm.  A lot of keeping my hand in my pockets.  When you've spent 34 years hiding something and having it control you so much, it's hard to mentally just say \"fuck it\" and go to the gym and not care what anyone thinks.\n\nPeople see things differently - if you lost a limb, people will be proud of you for going to the gym and understand.  When you have a limb that isn't normal but looks almost normal, you get ridiculed, bullied as a kid and teenager, and even adults will stare and judge you.  You don't forget that stuff and it messes with your head, and it's just \"easier\" to not show it by going to the gym.  I dunno, maybe that's not the case and everyone in a gym is like \"fuck yeah man, get it\" if they saw me trying. But I can barely do curls normally, and struggle with any bar lifting as my wrist doesn't rotate as much as my right so maintaining a grip can be a bit awkward.  Which confuses people because my hand looks normal.  I can't do bench presses, can't do pullups, can't do pushups.  The strength isn't there, nor are the nerves to actually push my arm away from me.  You know when you lift so much you literally can't move your arm?  Imagine that, but it happens after a certain point of movement.  I can move my arm to X position but past that, it's LITERALLY impossible as the muscle development and nerves to send the signal are, literally, not there. \n\nIt's just that when it's not obvious, you either have to tell people straight up or make an excuse.  Everything from being scanned at an airport, long-sleeve clothing is slightly too long on my left arm but normal length on my right, being asked to grab that thing off the top shelf as I'm 6'3, so I have to reach up and grab the thing with my right arm, lower it with my shoulder and then grab it with my left as it comes down and looks like I'm gonna drop it.  People don't understand. \n\nGetting scanned in a T shape- \"Sir, as I asked, can you put your left arm out please?\"\n\n\"I can't.\"\n\n\"Oh...uhhh...why not?\"\n\n*sigh* and it makes me emotional on the spot.\n\nI dunno, maybe it's all excuses and I need therapy, but seeing a consultant for my options will be a start.  Maybe surgery can help, I don't know.\n\nI've lived so long with it that it feels weird doing something about it for once instead of hiding it every time I head out the door - I literally pick clothing that makes it easier to hide my arm.  Pockets, long sleeves, I love jackets of course.  I hate summer as it's shorts and tshirts and it makes it more \"obvious\" to me.",

We are now a case study and have changed the way that hospital responds to pain in pregnancy.\n\nEdit: thanks so much for all the interest and love, very unexpected and has made my evening \ud83d\ude42 I feel special. \nA bit more info for some who might want extra. Had an Ovary and tube removed 10 years previously because it had wrapped itself around my womb and was like being stabbed every month, remaining tube didn't look good but was in the right place so they left it but told me I would 99% need IVF to have a baby. \nWe had unprotected sex once and boom, baby, she is literally a miracle. \nAfter she had been removed, they had to take my womb out of my body, physically twist it back around and then put it back. I'm going back soon for another scan to check if it's back twisted because I have pain again. \nTried to reply to everyone, sorry if I missed you, I'm on my phone.",

Being a bored teen without a license, I resorted to mobile gaming to pass the time and I found a beta profile for Clash Royale before it even came out in the US, so I was pretty stacked already by the time the game was finally released globally. \n\nIt cost about 5000 coins to make a clan back then, and it would\u2019ve taken either a lot of time (or money!) to get that much the day that clans were launched.

The game instantly blew up across my high school and word was somebody already had a clan here and is giving out invites. Clans were a big deal then because you could just *get* XP and cards (troops) for being in a clan, so everybody wanted that extra jump. Fast forward a month, my clan is now full of my friends and edgy high school teens who have a clear advantage over most opponents - I now have the top clan in the US; for about an hour. I decide, \u201ceh, I bet we could keep a #1 spot if we changed our clans location\u201d, and naturally, I choose Somalia. \n\nI ran the #1 Clash Royale clan in Somalia, usually from a high school band hall, for a little over a year",

            "So a little over two years ago I dropped out of college due to financial issues. I was a shell of myself for a while after that, felt like a complete failure. I had been going to school for automation and robotics technology. I moved back in with my dad and took a job making disk blades for farm equipment. When I went to college part of why I chose what I did was that I didn't want to do heavily manual labor, I left that to move 30 tons of steel by hand each night.\n\n I didn't really hate the job, it was nice to see the product I made in the fields all around, there were actually some blades made in that plant sitting outside my dad's garage though they were probably made 30 years before I worked there. I took pride in my work but I hated my life, my manager would ask me nightly when I was going back to school, he would tell me that I could do a lot better than I was. It really dug into me, I contemplated suicide a lot during that time.\n\nAfter working there for almost a year massive flooding in the Midwest coupled with a trade war with China had us only able to work every other week. That wasn't working for me so I decided to put in an application to work for a major window production company that I had interviewed for an internship with while in college, they hired me on for production. During the interview I had told them about my college experiences and that I had interviewed with the company previously for a position in another plant, I also told them I was interested in working maintenance.\n\nA couple months after starting that job a maintenance position opened up and HR practically harassed me into applying. I ended up getting the job. Its not uncommon for people in the program I was in to end up working maintenance so it was a major success for me. \n\nThings were definitely turning around. I started that job in January of this year. A few months later we had a new machine coming from our main plant which is close to the college I attended. I recognized one of the guys who came to help set it up, he was in college with me. I went and talked to him and it was great to catch up. The best part was seeing that I was in the same position as someone who had completed the program. That was when I realized how far I had came from when I dropped out. I was not a failure, despite everything I was succeeding, the odds were not in my favor and I was pulling through.\n\nFast forward to this last September, two years to the day since I dropped out, one week after my birthday. My job started sending me back to school, paying me to go to class. That was the day it really hit me, I was exactly where I belonged. This is what I have wanted for so long, this is my dream job. I make great money, I love the work I do, the company I work for is great to it's employees. This is it, I can't put to words how lucky I am. So many people search their whole lives and never find a place where they fit in like this.\n\nThis is not the first time I have typed this out but every time it brings tears to my eyes.

At the new school I joined ROTC and thought that\u2019s what I wanted to do. After highschool I applied to university of Hawaii. I got in but it was too expensive so I applied for Colorado. Got in, even more expensive so I applied to an instate school. Missed the deadline so I had to work a food service job for a year.

A lot of people seemed to admire me for it. I'd get a lot of \"Wow, astronomy? I could never do what you do!\" etc.\n\nBut in early 2009, I went through a rough break-up. I had a great relationship with my girlfriend at the time, but she ended up very suddenly deciding to leave me for someone else. I was crushed. I didn't know how to deal with it. But above all, although I was in denial at first, I think deep down I knew I couldn't continue university. Even the train ride into the campus every day reminded me of her. Passing all the places we went on dates, all the locations we'd visited together, etc. It was all too much, and try as I might, I just couldn't deal with it.

            "I always wanted to become an astrophysicist as a teenager. After some difficulty with my parents, school life, and neglect I ran away from home and ended up homeless in Toronto. There were little plans for a homeless kids to go to university. Learn a trade or go to college. No programs for at-risk youth to go to university. I met someone who almost managed to bend a few rules to get me into UofT, but was told to try again next year. Then I used all my money to transit to Vancouver.\n\nWhen I got to Vancouver, I immediately began studying more high school and heading to UBC study halls. I braved up and went to their admissions to ask about applying. I was told as my grades currently stood, I wasn't going to get in.\n\nI remember crying outside the UBC library. For fucks sake, how was I supposed to get good grades while homeless and juggling social workers and benefits meetings? It was my dream university. The one thing I kept thinking about while being homeless for two straight years: fuck you UBC.\n\nSo I went back to UBC and kept studying. A hot lady dropped all her stuff and I had a moment of \"fuck studying\" and I changed my whole life course in a split second. I looked up to the sky wondering if someone had managed to work this miracle. I then proceeded to help her. She was marketing Big Mama Textbook Rentals to the new students on the first day of university in September.\n\nI, for free, helped her market and when she was done, she offered me a part time job. As a homeless kids, I'll happily take that. Fuck being an astrophysicist, I'll be a marketer.\n\nI was to report in on Monday and over the weekend I got strep throat. Saturday and Sunday were like glass shards. The social workers said that I was the first exception they made to eat food in his room instead of in the common area. One social worker cut up ginger and made me tea. I could hardly talk and on Monday, I borrowed her thermos, put her tea in, then went off to work on day three of strep throat.\n\nTo my surprise, the CEO of Big Mama was there. Holy mackerel she was big. Tall, round, and loud. She asked me if I was sick and I remember saying \"Just getting over a small cold.\" \"Oh yeah, there's a little something going around.\" Yeah lady, try some glass shards in your throat... \"Your job today is to hand out these chocolates and coupons to Big Mama.\"\n\nOh fuck, I have to talk. So I made large arm gestures and looked like a weird flag bearer handing people chocolate and coupons. I apparently did so well, she asked if I wanted a full time job... I said yes.\n\nI worked as marketer for 3 months until I moved to programming. You see, when I was younger, I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP to help with my mom's ecommerce site.

            "Sorry for formatting, on mobil\n\nTLDR Like sucks. But sometimes you end up with 5 kids and unlimited happiness.\n\nI grew up in Flint Michigan. I knew I had no prospects, knew my mom would put me out the moment I turned 18. There was no money to move to a safer place, no money for a car, and almost no jobs even if I had been able to find one. I had very limited options. I may have been able to find a multi-roommate situation, but I don't know how that would have worked since I had no friends and was extremely introverted.\n\nI was lucky, my father invited me to move to Florida to live with him. I lived in Florida for 12 years, got married, learned I was infertile, dealt with my husbands cancer, loss of his eye, and subsequent opioid addiction.  I ended up homeless with a felony charge, adjudication withheld,  thank God, for being an accessory after the fact. He had been stealing air conditioning units to break down for scrap metal to fund his habit. He was doing it in my truck and I was in the vehicle when he was pulled over and finally caught. I ended up divorced because he went from a rabid addiction to hillbilly heroin to an equally rabid addiction to God. He cherry picked what he wanted and ignored the rest. I thought the opiods were bad, but being told that he owned me by all rights and gods own words was absolutely my breaking point. \n\nAt that point I just wanted out of Florida, he was never going to leave me alone.  His \"friends\" told him that unless I was dead, any other relationship he could have would be one of sin. Therefore he either HAD to fix things with me, or remain single until I died. I really wanted to avoid both situations, so I took the first opportunity presented to me to leave.\n\nI spoke with a friend I hadn't spoken with in 10 years and was offered the chance to move to Alaska. A big change, but I hoped it would be a good one. It was scary, I was moving so far away and to a place where I had no family and only one friend. There were good jobs though and no exhusband.\n\nI loved it from the start, Alaska is a beautiful state, the mountains can be heartbreakingly beautiful any time of year. I made some absolutely fantastic friends and started to build my own family. I became engaged and I will not go into that drama, but it ended badly and I swore off serious dating for quite a while. I was really blessed however to have such good friends then, even if they thought I was weird for how long I stayed single and how adamant I was that I should stay that way.\n\nLike a lot of things, you find what you are looking for when you aren't looking for it. So of course I found my husband during the time I had sworn off relationships.\n\nIt was a good relationship, even with the usual and unusual bumps. We were both actively trying to build something built off of stronger foundationsthan our previous failed relationships. He wasn't what I expected, but some of the best things are like that. He was newly split from his previous relationship and had two children. I had little to no experience, but was game to learn on the fly once our relationship was established enough for my meeting them to be appropriate. \n\nI had just moved in with him and we were both still learning how we fit with each other when he received an emergency call from his mother in Pennsylvania. His nephew and his girlfriend had just been arrested for child abuse. Their 2yo daughter and 9mo son were being treated for multiple long bone fractures (one needing a pin placed), a fractured skull, broken ribs, as well as sexual trauma. All parental rights were being terminated and they needed someone to take them. No one else in the family had the wherewithal nor the inclination to take them and so they were going into the system.  The question was asked, would he take them? \n\nWe discussed it at length, it was a huge step to take in such a new relationship. He and I both agreed that he had to take them no matter what, but would our relationship survive it? Did I even want to be a mother? I had never wanted kids, but when I found out I was infertile it hurt so much more than I would have thought possible to lose the choice. I had come to terms with it (for the most part) and was ok with being a step parent to his boys if we were to marry. Becoming an instant mother to two traumatized babies was so far out of my wheelhouse that I was not sure I would even be good for them. Who could say if I would be a good mother? My role model was...questionable.\n\nWhile we were trying to get it all talked through he got another call from his mother. The mother, while in jail, had been checked over and was found to be pregnant. She was going to have to sign over rights even on this unborn baby.  So three. Three children at once. I am not going to lie, I freaked the fuck out. How the hell do you do something like this? But then again, what about people that give birth to multiples? They don't have experience with three babies at once when it happens.\n\nThere was a lot of back and forth that I won't bore you with, but in the end we felt that there really wasn't a decision to be made. They needed a home, family, love.\n\nIt is 5 years later and I am sitting on the couch watching   Christmas movies on the couch with my husband and 5 children (we got custody of his 2 earlier this year). It is crazy most of the time and I usually feel like I am going insane. However, I truly have never been so happy or felt so content. My family fulfills me in a way that I try thought was just in books and movies. I have learned so much from my family, they have taught me things about love, forgiveness, acceptance, and trust that I never knew and would likely not have learned elsewhere.\n\nI come from a history of abuse and terrible relationships, but my marriage feels like a dream come true. It is solid and full of trust and humor. I am an infertile woman who now has 5 children that make me insanely happy while also tearing my hair out in exasperation. I come from a broken and dysfunctional home and my home is whole and warm and mostly functional. \n\nThis is definitely not where I set out to be, but there is no way to measure the depths of gratitude that I feel that this is where I ended. It makes everything bad that led me here worth it. I am grateful for the hardships that this should be my reward.\n\nA Merry Christmas Indeed.",

            "First year in highschool, I was swimming at a pretty damn high level. I could not imagine doing another sport since I had never done anything else and all my siblings were also swimming. That morning, my mom drops me at school and tells me about the tryouts for the basketball team. My mom and dad were both basketball players at their university back in the day, and would obviously like if i played, but would never force me to. I didnt want to go at all. I had never played basketball before, was in a new city( I had just moved, forgot to mention that) wich I didnt know the bus ride very well, and wanted to chill that evening. A few minutes before the end of the day, I make up my mind. Im went to the tryouts and did pretty well. At that age, most dont have insane skill so my athletiscism gave me a huge advantage. I made the team (pretty sure they didnt cut many), and that year, I had the time of my life. I was swimming just cuz everyone else in my family was swimming. I was gifted sure, but looking back, I never had fun. That year taught me that. I have a very vivid memory, near the end of the year, when I had a dilemma choosing between swimming and basketball, we had a tournament. After our first game, I was showering with the boys, and I told myself: man this is want I want to do. I dropped swimming, despite having just won a gold, silver and bronze medal at the provincial championship, dedicated myself to basketball and four years later, im playing D1, best player on the team with a possibility of having a scholarship to higher levels. I simply cant imagine what my life would be if I let th lazy side of myself take over that day.",
            "Since sophomore year of high school, I knew deep within my heart that I needed to go to this little West Virginia college. It wasn\u2019t a fancy, big school. It was really quite small, just a step up from community college. Their programs weren\u2019t all that special, but deep deep down in my spirit I knew that I had to go there. Even if I didn\u2019t have a car, friends, or family there... I had to take this leap. So, I started college 5 hours away from home, as a theatre major. I assumed that the theatre program was why I was drawn to this school, that it\u2019s what pulled me in. Turns out, it definitely was not. I was miserable in the program, and quickly realized that I did not want to make a career out of performance arts. I had fully anticipated graduating there, and then moving to Pittsburgh directly after to pursue an acting career. So this threw everything off.. I started to feel so lost and alone. I had no friends, family rarely contacted me, and I struggled. Then, on the first day of my speech class, I laid my eyes on this man. You hear stories about love at first sight.. this was it. It was as though the whole world stopped and nobody else was around me except for this man. I\u2019ve never been immediately attracted to someone like this before, or felt such an immense desire to get to know someone. It felt as though in some weird way, I had knew him in another life. We would exchange little looks, and smiles. Then eventually hellos and school emails regarding class. Finally, we went out.. after several dates I found out that he was from Germany, and a senior... and had no intentions on staying in the USA. We had a very difficult chat one evening. That we couldn\u2019t work, because we could never see one another again. But once again, I listened to my gut. Something told me this was not the case and so I told him that I wanted to continue to be with him, even if in the end my heart would be broken. I had never experienced such love before in my life. Such intense passion between us. To me, it was a once in a lifetime kind of feeling. Even if it hurt and didn\u2019t work out, I didn\u2019t want to rob myself of the experience of that kind of love. \nMarch comes around. Graduation is around the corner and the ache in my heart grows bigger and bigger. Knowing our time is about to end. One day he sits me down, and I am anticipating the worst.. but he tells me that actually... he found a job in TX that would sponsor a visa for him and that he couldn\u2019t stand to part with me. So, little ol me packed my bags, dropped out of school, and moved to Texas to be with him. I found a job as an assistant preschool teacher, and realized I have a HUGE passion for working with children! That\u2019s the career I want to work towards and progress in. But, his visa ran up. He had to go back to Germany... soooo.... I once again packed up my bags and made my first big adventure out into the great big world and went to Germany! I found a home there like nothing I\u2019ve ever experienced. It felt right.. for the first time in my life I felt as though I was in the place that was crafted for me. Turns out, I was literally in my ancestral land. I ended up with the most magical life, something I could have never even dreamed up. I feel like I live in a fairytale every single day. If only my younger self knew all the bliss and joy that was in store. I was drawn to that school to meet my soulmate, and get placed exactly where I was meant to be. Looking back it all makes so much sense. If you are feeling lost.. you may just be getting redirected to your destined path. :)",

Instead I got a degree, moved to Germany for a few years, just moved back, and am figuring out what's next.

My family disowned me, I was financially tapped out, and I dropped out of school and got my first full time job.\n\nI worked in a call center and randomly ended up in a business analyst position after my 1 year of dues in customer service.  And I really loved it.  LOVED it.  I didn't even know such a job existed.  I went back to school to finish an English degree (changing majors would have taken significantly more time at that point).  \n\nSince then, I've gotten my MBA and I'm still loving being an analyst.  If I hadn't had a major episode in college, if my parents hadn't disowned me and refused to sign my financial aid paperwork, if I hadn't taken that job in a customer service call center, none of these being events I hoped would take place in my life, I wouldn't be where I am.\n\nI still think I would be a great teacher and would love it.

One night, my colleague called to me to ask me something. I turned to him to see what he wanted. I slipped backwards and fell into a vat of hot oil.

            "I\u2019ve had a bunch of these little twists in my life and enjoy thinking about the butterfly effect.\n\nIn first grade, I was above my grade level in math, so I was initially sent to second grade classes. I understood that stuff already, so until I was moved up again, I just sat in the back row and turned around to look at a chart of the Presidents of the United States directly behind me, which kindled my lifelong interest in presidential history (#NinaTurner2024 \u2014 or 28, 32, 36... Hello, somebody!)\n\nWhen I was in 11th grade, I took AP US history (taught by the grandson of the 20th President James Garfield, no less) and felt I absolutely nailed the test. I knew all the presidents, of course, and for multiple choice questions, there were a number of political cartoons that threw other kids off, but I recognized every President and figure in them and felt good. Maybe I bombed the essays, who knows (no land mines there that I was aware of), but I ended up being the only person in my entire class to get a 3 on the exam (i.e. no college credit); everyone else got a 4 or 5, and I also got nothing but 4s and 5s in every other AP I took. I was so pissed, I basically slacked the rest of my time in high school.\n\nNow being a slacker, and being a chronic procrastinator anyway, I actually applied to my first choice school, Emory University, a month and a half past the application deadline, but managed to get in anyway (I had decent grades and strong SATs; being a minority probably helped). It was there that I met my amazing (and much smarter and more thoughtful) wife. We lived two floors apart in our freshman dorm.\n\nWe should\u2019ve never known each other long enough to go out and later get married. We were just friends until her senior year. Meanwhile, I actually flunked out due to a previously undiagnosed anxiety disorder. After I got it diagnosed \u2014 which was a huge revelation to me \u2014 I was allowed back in but had to maintain at or above a 2.0 GPA each semester to stay.\n\nMy first semester back, I thought I could manage myself post-diagnosis, but I fell right back into the same destructive patterns that made my fail in the first place. If I overslept a class, the overwhelming (and unreasonable) shame I\u2019d feel would make me stay in my room for days at a time to skip those specific classes. My grades were terrible and I was going to flunk out again.\n\nThe class I enjoyed the most? US History. I would still feel shame if I missed the class, so my attendance was terrible. I missed assignments and tests on the regular, but any time I felt mentally stronger and could bring myself to attend, I was always in the thick of it and loved the discussion with the professor.\n\nI did the final exam there and did very well. Much better than someone who didn\u2019t attend 60-80% of the time.\n\nThe professor asked me to come talk to him during his office hours, and I thought I was in trouble. What ended up happening instead was that we just had a casual conversation about US history for 3 1/2 hours. He was really kind and didn\u2019t bring up or otherwise let me off the hook about my attendance, and he knew nothing about my academic situation.\n\nA couple of weeks later, I\u2019m back home and grades are rolling in.\n\nIt looked EXTRMELY bleak.\n\nMost of my grades were trash and I was well below the 2.0 I needed to stay enrolled in school. Just looking at the GPA being \u201c1.whatever,\u201d I cried wondering how I could let this happen again even after finally learning that I had the anxiety disorder. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to tell my mom that I was going to flunk out (again). I told all my college friends the bad news. As the grades came in, only one class was still blank: US History.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t matter. It was just a formality at that point that I was about to permanently flunk out. The grade for that last class remained blank for longer than I expected and the deadline for posted grades was coming. The dread and the shame I had was real, and eventually it would be official.\n\nEventually, it all came down to the very last day that grades would be posted. I had checked every day up to then just waiting for the nail in the coffin from the US History grade, just waiting for another C or C-.\n\nWhen the last grade was finally posted on that very last day, I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes...\n\n\u201cB+\u201d\n\nThe grade for that class, a 3.33, raised my semester GPA to \u2014 exactly \u2014 2... point... 0. \n\nI was so wide-eyed, I couldn\u2019t fucking believe it. The professor couldn\u2019t have had any way to know just how crucial that grade was. I never told him I was on academic probation or about my mental health problems. He never had to invite me to talk, and he could have taken my seemingly lackadaisical approach to his class as a huge show of disrespect. Instead, he just talked with me about his wheelhouse, was a total bro, and literally changed the course of my life.\n\nWhen I told my future wife \u2014 who was just my friend at the time \u2014 that I was going to flunk out again, she (years later) told me she was sobbing and didn\u2019t even understand why. After she fished around for an answer, she realized that she had a huge crush on me, but held onto it for a couple more years.\n\nIf I didn\u2019t dance on the razor\u2019s edge of flunking out of school again, maybe my wife wouldn\u2019t have realized her feelings for me. But if I had actually failed again, I know I would have never seen her again, not in any meaningful way. I know the entire trajectory of my life I owe to the magnanimity of that professor.\n\nAt Emory, I also took part in the student radio station, and a friend of mine asked me what I was playing. When I told him it was video game music, he told me about a website with free video game music remixes, [OverClocked ReMix](https://ocremix.org). I ended up enjoying the site so much that I now help run the day-to-day of the music that\u2019s posted there. This was only after a few years of being a super fan listener, and a few years after joining their judges panel that reviews all of the submissions. And all despite not being a musician myself. (I run their Tweeter too, [say hi!](https://twitter.com/ocremix))\n\nI\u2019ve met so many great friends and even gotten to travel the world thanks to my involvement in OC ReMix leading to other opportunities in gaming.\n\nI still really fucking hate that I got that 3 in AP US, that was some bullshit. :-) But meeting my wife and finding my avocation as an indirect result of that event is alright with me.\n\nAnd if you need someone to recite the Presidents of the United States in order though, I\u2019m your man!",

I was in a really low place. But I found a good job where I grew to full time, slowly got back on my feet and 1.5 years later I finally moved out of my parents house to move back to the city I lived in before I went overseas. \n\nI\u2019ve been back almost 2 months and I\u2019ve never been happier. I\u2019m back with my friends, I have 2 pets, and the job I had back home paved the way for me to get a job that is paid 25% more hourly that what I was on when I was last here.

            "I was travelling around Europe with a few friends after University. We had the whole trip planned out. We\u2019d arrive in a city, stay in a hostel for a few days, then get on the train to the next planned country/city, and repeat. It was fantastic. \n\nWe arrived in Budapest and found where we were staying\u2014Unity Hostel. This was a great little place, with a roof terrace overlooking the Franz Liszt Academy of Music. You could wake up (hungover), sit out in the sun, and listen to the musicians. \n\nOne day while doing exactly this, a group of girls appeared through the doorway. One of them was the most beautiful girl I\u2019d seen in my life. She was quiet and quickly disappeared up to their room. We started talking to the others and made plans to meet later for drinks. \n\nThat evening we went to the appointed place and sure enough, the girls turned up too. Well, all except the one I wanted to be there, and a few others. It turned out she wasn\u2019t really one for going out to bars, and stayed at the hostel instead. Oh well. We all had a great time that night and met for lunch the following day. \n\nThey were only there for a couple of days. They were all Americans, spending a couple of months in Vienna as part of their University course. They had just come on a weekend trip to see Budapest and were soon going to get on the train back to Vienna again. So we exchanged email addresses, said our goodbyes and they offered \u201cif you\u2019re ever in Vienna, come and say hi\u201d. We expected to never see them again, as is the way with a lot of people you meet while travelling. \n\nWe only had a day or two more in Budapest, then we were due to get on the train down to Croatia. I think we were going to go to the beaches in Split. \n\nBut, we missed our train by seconds. We watched it leave. \n\nYou couldn\u2019t just hop on any train. These were long, sometimes 16 hour train journeys we were taking. I think you may have needed a ticket for a specific train too, I can\u2019t remember. A missed train was a big deal. So we got some food and thought about what to do. \n\nThere were lots of options but the best one seemed to be to get on the next train to Vienna and find a hostel\u2014there looked to be a few decent ones around. Maybe we could find our new friends again too. So we sent a few emails and hopped on the train. \n\nArriving there many hours later we found an Internet cafe (this was before phones with decent email and internet access), looking to confirm our hostel booking. Much to our joy we had an email back from our new friends. We had sent one from Budapest telling them we were coming. They invited us to stay in their University dorms for a few days. Brilliant\u2014free accommodation! \n\nWe arrived and went out for some food and drink. Much to my delight, the most beautiful girl came too. We clicked immediately. We talked non stop. It was wonderful. Best few days of my life. \n\nBut then it was time to go again. So we sadly said our goodbyes again and moved on. \n\nWe kept in touch sporadically over email. Then fast forward a few years and beautiful girl decides she wants to visit England (that\u2019s where I live). Of course I\u2019d be delighted to show her around for a few weeks. \n\nShe visits in January. We have the best time. She visits again in February. I visit her in the states in April. I love her, she is wonderful. We decide to get married and live in England. \n\n11 years later we\u2019ve got two lovely girls of our own. \n\nAll because I missed that train by a few seconds.",

I was generally a pretty shy kid, so being surrounded by the show choir crowd was a bit of an adjustment.  I remained mostly pretty quiet at rehearsals and such and just kind of showed up and did my thing.\n\nDuring one of our competitions, we had just received results from the daytime round and were told we had scored just a few points short of first place.  As our director made his way through the feedback from the judges, one thing that was mentioned was \"great band, but need more guitar\".  One of the singers turned to me and said, \"Dude, you should rip a solo in finals!\".  I politely shook it off, as I figured there was no way this idea would fly with the director.  But before I could get that thought across, there was already more singers chiming in and chattering over it.\n\nI figured what the heck and spoke up to the team, saying I was willing to give it a try.  There was some awkward silence.  In an effort to break it up, I muttered \"The judges said they want more guitar, I think I can provide that\" and the room *erupted*.\n\nEveryone went out fired up and we performed easily our best show of the year.  I played the solo during one of the dance breaks at the end and got a big roar from the crowd to ice the cake.

I was going literally 7 mph in a parking lot and he was entirely at fault. We exchanged insurance info and I had to get a rental car until mine was fixed. He dodged the insurance calls for about two weeks, forcing me to pay out of pocket for the rental, about $600 which I definitely didn\u2019t have. I knew this guy was an asshole snooty lawyer- my dad is a court attorney and while I have never used this flex- I finally had to ask my dad to call him and talk some lawyer at him. 15 minutes later I get a call and insurance will go forward. \n\nFast forward like 8 years, I\u2019m bartending at a swanky lounge where a Chamber of Commerce event is going on.

We got right up to the front during their set (omg they were so bad) so we could be in place for the next band. Right behind the barrier was Lindsay watching the set. I motioned her over and asked her to take a photo. She starts yelling like \u201cOMG I\u2019m just NORMAL person trying to watch my bf leave me alone!!\u201d Exactly the reaction I was hoping for. I put on my best innocent confused face and said I just wanted a pic with my boyfriend since we made it to the front row.

            "Doesn't exactly fit but still love this moment. Driving through a few states (home from college), I came through a small town with a more right-leaning population. There was a protest in town in regards to a religious belief and choices that people should or should not be able to make. I didn't share their belief, but support people's right to have their own opinion. \n\nAn aside: I listen to very loud music that many find scary due to the way it sounds. Also, as a young man with expendable income and being a bit of an audiophile had invested some thousands of dollars into a stereo system that sounded amazing but had enough range to make people jump if not expecting it. \n\nAs I came pulling into this town, i was being respectful and turned my music down and maybe even more than i would normally since my windows were down (i am not offended by vulgarity, but try to be polite to others and small children) I happened to be listening to a song called, \"Immaculate Misconception\" by Motionless In White. I'd play my ipod on shuffle and happened to be on that song. The timing couldn't have been more perfect. I get to the intersection with the protest, light turns yellow and I can't make it through. Ok... people chanting and yelling, whatever do your thing... as I come to a stop a woman runs to my car kind of aggressively, leans down to window height, and I see a big inhale to I'm assuming scream something at me. Generally paranoid, veteran, social anxiety, etc... not happy. My hand was still on my ipod from turning the volume down and i just cranked the volume. Right at the breakdown. Before her mouth made words my vehicle screamed (quite audibly for the genre), OPEN YOUR MIND BEFORE YOUR MOUTH! As I unblinkingly gave my resting bitch face stare. Ms. Aggressive screaming lady recoiled (probably at the volume and it probably hurt her ears, but plenty of service related hearing loss, I was comfortable) then in the background as she starts to back up realizing my vehicle isn't the one, I realize everyone has stopped chanting, moving, holding signs, etc and everyone was staring mouth agape. \nI believe I would have done that move regardless of the song or words, it was a reflex, but the words said, the situation, the timing, everything was so perfect that I still smile. \n\nTL:DR Didn't actually say a word, let my perfectly timed music speak for me when some religious fanatic tried rushing my open vehicle window.",

            "oof this is tough. \n\nI teach all grades. I'm a speech-language pathologist assistant. The school I teach at is a public charter school that is extremely committed to the life script of going to college. There are no career resources for students who, to put it simply, are not a fit for college. There's nothing about trade schools or even jobs right out of high school. \n\nThe most succinct piece of advice I wish I could give to my students is this: it is COMPLETELY ok to not want to go to college right away, or at all! It is COMPLETELY reasonable to not want to be saddled with ungodly amounts of debt for a career you were forced to pick for an amorphous job market. Just make sure you have a plan to do something else. Take it seriously when I'm telling you to not constantly talk about football during a job interview. Know that when a hiring manager asks why you want to work at the company to literally not say \"because I need money.\" \n\nKeep in mind I'm referring to students who have tremendous pragmatic and academic difficulties. I am by no means saying college isn't worth it for anyone, just that it would likely not be the most suitable avenue for some of these students. This is something a LOT of people don't like to admit, so there's such an unnecessary stigma to it. I just wish these students were not funneled so narrowly into trying to get into an expensive college when, in some cases, are barely able to read past a sixth grade level. They should have all options presented and feel empowered to choose their own career. \n\nI'll add a caveat and admit that the path college led me down (both times) has been by and large extremely unfruitful and frustrating, which probably makes me all the more reluctant to encourage higher education.

I feel terrible having to ignore your PMs or texts when you ask me important questions (or, let's be honest, send me really funny memes). \n\nBecause I am a man, I'm terrified of something getting misunderstood and being fired from my job.

Also, when I was at the mall, the guy you pointed to and asked me if he was my boyfriend was just a random tinder date I just met, he was definitely not my boyfriend.\n\nEdit: Since I keep getting asked how I was able to pull off looking almost twice my age, here goes:\n\nFirst of all, I had older teachers and the administration backing up my story because they were afraid that if the student knew how young I was they wouldn't respect me. Second of all, I had a very serious reserved attitude during the job, no smiling, very blunt, no nonsense, only very rarely did I crack the occasional joke! Lastly, I did dress frumpier than I normally would in dark, formless colors and sometimes I even gave myself a bit of dark circles under my eyes with black eye shadow. Of course some students still questioned it, but when you have all your authority figures telling you one thing, it's rather difficult to not believe it.\n\nEdit 2: I taught in Thailand. Meaning the students weren't in close proximity to foreigners all too frequently so they didn't have much perception of what a \"40 year old\" foreigner should look like. I also look very racially ambiguous. My racial ambiguity also helped me out here. White people age very differently than black people who age differently than Asians, etc. ",

The police politely waited outside the changing room while I changed, then I asked them their opinion of the trousers :) before putting them back.\n\nThen I decided to go into a cinema to catch a film, which freaked them out. They spoke to the cinema management, who politely refused to sell me a ticket.\n\nI was a bit annoyed by now so I went into a lawyers at random.  There was a queue of people in the waiting room waiting to see a lawyer, and the receptionist asked me why I was there.\n\n\"The police are following me!\"\n\nShe rolled her eyes - just then several cops burst into the waiting room hot on my heels ...\n\nI left them to explain the situation and went back to rejoin the demo.  Climbing didn't get done that day but that was my fun hour of community disservice.\n\nEDIT\n\nBTW at the end of the day the cops came up to me to make several pointed comments about wasting their time.

She was like \"WHAT!?\" after some very awkward explanation she told me it must just be someone who looks *exactly* like her, like same mole on same cheek alike because they definitely never took any pictures like that. We both breathed a sigh of relief because she thought I was gonna ask her out (a week after she broke up with her fiance!) and wasn't sure how to turn me down gently, and me for all the previously explained reasons... \n\nSo yeah, asking an opposite sex, friend about whether or not their ex might have leaked their nudes as revenge porn has gotta take the cake.",

They end up overwhelmed, mired in drama, and resentful. And then they become the martyr.\n\nThe problem with being friends with this type of person is that you\u2019re not in an equal friendship where you like each other, enjoy spending time with each other; and when there happen to be downs, you support each other through them.

It\u2019s easy to miss initially when you\u2019re getting to know their likes and interests, but once you know them it becomes clear they\u2019re just using you as some kind of emotional/physical accessory. \n\nI had a friend like this for a while, we always did what he wanted and he just wasn\u2019t always that interested in what I liked or enjoyed. Just sort of would rope me into whatever he wanted to do. I progressively got to the point where I felt like I was being used. \n\nAfter a while he pressured me into sleeping over at his place, I obliged as we\u2019d been drinking and I didn\u2019t feel great about driving home.

If it had been one of my other close guy friends who reciprocated my interests and needs I may have been comfortable with that. But I realized he wasn\u2019t interested in me for me, only in what I could provide him (ie emotional or physical attention). To be honest I don\u2019t think it would have progressed beyond cuddling (I was in a relationship though so I didn\u2019t want to ride that line), but it was the way he pressured me into the whole ordeal that made me feel used and uncomfortable.\n\nI peaced out the early next morning and kept my distance from him after that.

            "A quick 7 day trip to Maui in February a couple years ago with one of my teenage daughters, who happened to be free the same week I had off. Work was grinding me down and I needed a break. \n\nMy wife and the rest of the family couldn't go, they were working or in school. The tickets were expensive, $850 each for bare-bones economy narrow rock hard seats, it was a 12 hour flight that was packed to the brim - I was getting bedsores by the time we arrived. \n\nWe rented snorkeling gear and a car, and spent every day from dawn to dusk snorkeling, sitting on the beaches and hiking in the mountains; we did the Hana road, the Seven Sacred Pools and the Haleakal\u0101 volcano national park at sunset, and took tons of photos. We ate spam musubi for breakfast, poke and somen noodles for lunch and loco moko for supper. Slept like babies with the windows open wide in the cool nighttime breezes. \n\nThe best way to blow $5,000 EVER. So much what I needed at that point in my life.",
            "I spent $300 on a mule. An actual living, 4 hooved, long-eared mule. We raise cattle, so a protection mule was a good excuse.  But, really, I just fell in love with him. He's huge and sassy. He'll steal your hat and run away. He's got a Ninja mode where he can sneak up on you, just to breathe down your neck or startle you. He does keep the coyotes away. However, he has proved himself priceless because he eats thistle. When we got the lease on the land for our cattle the pastures had been neglected and were in bad shape. Thistle is a spiky plant that spreads across the pasture, choking out grasses. Cow's won't eat it. It's really hard to get rid of. To our surprise, the mule cleared out nearly all the thistle in a matter of months. He would eat the flowers out of the center. He saved us an enormous amount of money and labor. We were able to avoid using chemical weed killers, which we really didn't want to do. Probably the best investment in our whole cattle raising experience.\n\nEdit:  Loki says thanks for all the sweet comments and awards!

It was his first time, and he\u2019s a pretty introverted person, so while he has fun watching everyone else dress up and act all goofy and old-timey, he doesn\u2019t really participate.  When we went to buy our first beer, the wench tried to sell him on one of those big mugs that looks like it\u2019s carved out of wood but it\u2019s just plastic. It cost $100. Yes, you get free refills, but we were not planning on drinking $100 worth of beer that day.  I could tell by the look on his face that he wanted it- he looked like a little kid at Disney World. Without thinking, I whipped out my credit card and dropped $100 on a shitty plastic mug.\n\nAll day, he walked around proudly with his mug. He even took some big gulps and cheered \u201chuzzah\u201d once or twice. This might not seem like much but for my quiet, gentle giant, it is huge.  I manage the finances in our relationship and I am CONSTANTLY cracking down on wasteful spending, so I think we were both amazed I made such a dumb purchase. Four years later, we still have that mug. He gets a big grin every time he sees it and teases me about my irresponsible impulse. And every time I see it, I just think about how much I love that big galoot...",

            "My Couch. I moved out of my moms house last year (2019 so no covid) and I always wanted a good couch. I tested so much. I went to so many funiture stores. Looked at so many different models. And then choose mine. Its actually from Ikea. Three seats and long enough to let someone sleep on it. In a grey but I saw they were also having a black cover so I am thinking about getting that one. Extremely comftable. I wanted a couch where you could chill out and love how fluffy it is without losing the ability to sit on it. In some couches you are not able to lean on the back and still have a straight back. You can sit on the back board and the armrests. They are flat so you can also put a cup of tea on them. Its also not too low so you dont feel like sitting on the ground (which I do strangely often compared to my love for this couch) but you can let yourself fall onto that damn thing! It also looks easy and simple.\n\nSo I dont want the suggestion of someone who tried a LOT of couches and happens to be me then buy the Vimle couch from Ikea.\n\nEdit: Oh my! My first award!

This was always a source of anxiety at any social event that required dressing up. When I realized I had 4 weddings of close friends all coming up within the year, I decided to bite the bullet and get some decent  \u201cformal\u201d clothes. I spent $800 on a suit jacket, $250 on two pairs of dress pants, a little over $300 for 3 shirts and 3 silk ties that were between $70 and $100 each. I stood for all my measurements and had everything tailored to my exact specifications. Did a fitting and had a second round of alterations on the pants so they actually looked decent, even though I wore them under my gut. People were floored when I showed up to the first wedding. I received so many compliments and actual double takes. Being introduced to new people felt completely different. I felt impressive. Some of those weddings were the best times of my life and it was due, in no small part, to how those clothes looked and made me feel. Some of those friends have big pictures from their weddings hanging on their walls, and I don\u2019t cringe in embarrassment when I see myself in them. Those clothes cost more than I had/have ever spent on clothing in any ten year period, and they were worth every penny.",

            "Back in high school I was about to go on my first ever date and I made extra money to make sure I had enough (around $600 I had) the day before our date she gave me a letter and she basically broke up with me. Being a teenager I had no control over my emotions as being brought up in my family would say guys shouldn\u2019t cry over anything but I had no way to process it. So after school I went to 7 eleven bought 2 large slurpees, 6 hotdogs and got a pre paid card and bought a bunch of NECA action figures. I actually had a good weekend because I honestly splurged on that money and got into action figure collecting as well practiced stop motion which ended up helping me to pursue a animation career and I\u2019m about to finish and ready to apply to stop motion studios\n\n\nEDIT: wow I\u2019ve just got back on after calling it a day from work. Thank you so much for the gold and support. Now let me answer some questions. The reason 600 dollars was the date money is because my brother and best friend recommended me to take extra date cash in case she wanted to do extra stuff or to cover stuff instead of having to wash dishes or say no. I was able to get the cash because I work i do small jobs or help people out with heavy lifting. Me and the ex were doing stuff together like I would walk her home from school, get her coffee before school began, and hangout on campus and she did hide her relationship from her parents but yea after the break up I did see who she was as a person and very toxic. I am in my last classes before I graduate and I decided my senior film will be stop motion which is a daunting task but I have prepared myself and got everything ready. As living in LA I have of lots of studios to intern/ apply and I am working on a portfolio of sorts to show off my skills in stop motion and special effects on Adobe after effects. To finish it off, I was going to courses for 3D animation and 2D as well but kinda sucked on them until I took a course in experimental and one of the assignments was to do a special animation called replacement animation and I decided to use some action figures and in it I did some stop motion which my professor picked up and praised for the poses frame by frame saying it\u2019s impressive that I got the movement down. The only draw right now is that intern positions are halted because of covid and my fellow classmates are also disappointed that the internship spots at some studios the want to work for are halting or limiting internships so it\u2019s hard right now but for me it\u2019s giving me time to do more stop motion work trying to perfect it and trying out new methods or techniques. :D",

            "This is going to get buried, but: paying the adoption fee for the oldest/longest resident cat at shelters, cat rescues. I think I am up to about 8k in adoption fees.\n\nFor a bit of background: My job allows me to travel an insane amount (usually about 200 days a year) and one of my hobbies is going to cat cafes - I've been to 56 around the world. Because I was making stupid amounts of money, on top of getting a per diem, access to catering 3 times a day AND living very frugally I had a lot of extra cash. So I would visit cat cafes which are usually partnered by rescue groups or go to local shelters. I would spend time with the cats and anonymously pay for the adoption fee of the cat who was the oldest or been there the longest. A few times I paid for transportation arrangement for cats from high kill shelters as well.\n\nAlso: sometimes when we would stay in hotels of tiny little towns that were clearly low-income I would leave $100 at whatever small restaurant I ate at. I always made sure to slip out before they noticed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Aww thanks for the gold and silver. You guys rock. However, if I may request: please save your coins and donate to your local shelter and TNR groups in your communities. They need it so much more than me!

Above all: spay and neuter your pets and animals in your community.\n\nEdit 2: as /u/kiskadee65 pointed out: \n>You can also call your local vet and ask if they have a fund you can donate to for owners who can't afford unexpected procedures and the only other option is to put them to sleep.",

            "Okay, let's break this down:\n\nIf I were to choose \"Next level,\" that would basically be me telling the game devs \"I enjoy what I've seen, and want to keep playing.\" That may be true in some cases. In particular, the physics engine and graphics are *phenomenal*. Incredibly lifelike, even if a large percentage of the playerbase require a mod to get the full experience. However, they also wildly vary the difficulty based on where the player spawns, and seem incapable of keeping cheaters out of the game, so that generally doesn't translate to positive reception. Even worse, the devs saw fit to only allow access to the UI after the player's first death. I don't know about you but that strikes me as very poor game design. I'd definitely file a bug report about that if I were a beta tester, but since this is the fully released product, I have no choice but to let it slide. There are many problems with the level we just finished, but not *everything* was bad, and there were definitely some redemptive qualities about it.\n\n\"Spectate\" is a very interesting option. Given these devs' skills with visual presentation but inconsistencies with overall player experience, I'm not sure I'd be able to go back and change any settings once I pick this option. However, it'd be very interesting to see if physical limits still applied, because theoretically I could go out-of-bounds and see if there are any easter eggs I missed in other unexplored areas of the game. Given just how detailed and varied they made the world that a player can explore, there's got to be more they left out of the main story.\n\n\"Restart\" strikes me as the worst option of the bunch. Given that I just completed the first level, pushing \"restart\" would almost certainly wipe my save clean, and start the whole thing over, erasing any memory I might want to save for future use. Especially considering just how much of the game's enjoyability depends on where you spawn, it seems like a bad idea to just start over from the beginning, because a bad spawn could severely limit what you can do.\n\nAll things considered, I think the thing that the devs of this game are best at is crafting a world. I've already experienced the one they put in the first level, and while it did have its ups and downs, I think spectating it wouldn't uncover anything super worthwhile. Restarting seems like a fool's errand, particularly with the RNG involved. In conclusion, I'd push \"Next level,\" and see just what the designers had cooked up next. Could be a new physics system, more vibrant environments, or just giving me a grappling hook. Whatever it is, I think that's my best bet.",

It usually follows some kind of theme where there are instantaneous global sightings and amped up military engagements/reconnaissance to determine the potential threat. I live close to a large airbase btw.  I'll see it pop up on the TV and whenever my family and I go outside we will spot a group of them. It's usually just a blip, like they are turning their cloaking devices on and off. \n\nBut it's one of the most terrifying feelings I've ever experienced. Sheer terror and panic grip us and we all confirm what we saw. Nothing I've experienced in real life has filled me with that type of dread. For some reason I'm always convinced there is nowhere to hide, and not knowing what is the exact threat gives me a feeling of futility/helplessness. There is nothing we can do to stop them from having their way with us. \nSometimes it feels like they just start bombing the whole planet at once or something. Earthquakes and intense weather suddenly appear and the horizon just \"shuts down\" with either black or gray \"walls\" like lights being turned off in a long hallway, til the darkness closes in on me. At the end it always feels like there was something we could have done to prevent it from happening but we procastinted/didn't care and that's why the aliens came. \n\nA few times the sky literally tore open and what felt like angels/demons/interdimensional beings just came spewing through, like projectile vomit through a wet paper bag. Not much I can remember following those instances, just sheer terror. (Credit to N. by Stephen King). \n\nI'm sure reading King's and Lovecraft's works plus watching Hollywood have influenced these dreams/nightmares. But I still can't help but feel like being alone in the universe is worse. It's seems like the aliens come because we fucked up the planet and they use it as an intergalactic sort of pitstop. They got tired of letting us destroy nature or something. It's not like they were evil it was like they had some sort of grand scheme way beyond what some hairless chimps could comprehend.",

We could come across aliens that have cures for all diseases and answers to all our questions about the universe - all given to us in the space of a couple days saving us centuries of scientific research and advancement. This is equally as likely as a predatory alien species that tries to eat us but generally, when a civilisation advances - certainly to the level of space travel, the civilisation become more and more peaceful.",

            "I think the scarier one is that we aren't. Mostly from the scientific viewpoint I once learned about. There was this Natural Filter or something, which was a nearly impossible obstacle to overcome for life.  \nNow, the goal of all life is to grow and evolve so the natural goal of humanity is to spread in the whole universe. That's where this filter comes in. There were four main stages that can be the filter in theory - developing life, developing conscience, developing intelligence and factor x. What that means is, the less life we find in space, the more likely it is we've already overcome the biggest obstacle and we can continue to grow. If we find, let's say, many other civilisations, that will mean the obstacle is ahead of us - the unknown factor x. Theory is that it's probably us destroying ourselves eventually.   \nSo, personally, i hope we can continue with humanity's goal and make our history actually mean something to the universe by the time it ends.",

            "Just like it says in the Fermi paradox. Both are equally as terrifying. If we're alone then it means that life was a mistake and we're just a small error in the cosmos but if they are real then depending on their level of complexity we can't know if the great filter is ahead of us or behind us. If it's behind us then we don't have much if anything at all to worry about but if it's ahead. There may be an extinction event coming.",

            "That we're alone. \n\nIf we're alone then everything we do becomes more meaningfull. If we go extinct that would mean the end of sapient technologically advanced species. If the earth becomes uninhabitable then all hope for life in the entire universe is lost.\n\nIf we're alone then this planet becomes a billion times more precious and the way we've been treating it becomes instantly unacceptable. The pollution we and our ancestors caused would be treasonous crimes, the stakes have become infinitely higher because we're the only chance for life in the galaxy. \n\nIf we're alone then our best is the best that anyone is ever going to do, and if I take a look around I can't help but feel disappointed and ashamed of our accomplishments so far. \n\nWe're progressing to the point where the earth won't satisfy our continued lust for growth and we're risking all life in the universe to achieve it, if we're alone.",

            "I'm late but nobody has said it yet. The self-fulfilling prophecy studies are very important to social psychology and their findings have many real world applications.\n\nBasically they brought together a group of kids and formed a class with a real teacher. They gave the kids a test for overall academic skill at the start of the course, but didnt really use the scores. Instead they told the teachers that a few students, picked at random, were very brilliant and scores very highly. They then observed the class for a long period of time and noticed that the teachers gave the kids they thought were brilliant much more attention. At the end of the study the kids took the test again, and they found that the kids who were randomly named brilliant at the start actually scores higher than the rest of the class. The kids, again, at the start didn't score any different from the rest of the class, but through the self fulfilling prophecy they became the best in their class. \n\nThis obviously has tons of application in the world and especially education.",
            "The monster experiment! Although it is horrible how they left the children with mental health issues at the end, this experiment gave very good insight to how to parent a child.\n\nOn this experiment, they took groups of orphaned children and separated them into 3 groups. One was the control, the second were told they has a lips and were doing bad, and the third was told that their speech was perfect.\n\nAs the experiment went on, group 2 began developing lisps after being berated constantly. They became shy and reserved. They were scared to speak because they didn't want to get in trouble because of their poor speaking skills. Group 3, however, had the opposite happen. They talked better, they were more willing to improve. They were encouraged to keep speaking and told that their speech was amazing and perfect.\n\nBy the end of the experiment, they had one group with no change, one group with now mentally ill children with a speech impediment, and one group with great speaking skills.\n\nIt truly shows that encouraging children is the way to go and that verbal abuse can be just as, if not more, harmful as physical abuse.",

They then assumed their normal personalities but to be released they all had to admit that they were mentally ill.

They identified many possible fakers, but Rosenhan in fact hadn\u2019t sent anyone.",
            "The [Monopoly Study](https://youtu.be/bJ8Kq1wucsk) by Paul Piff. He basically brought two strangers into the lab together and had them play a game of Monopoly together. He randomly assigned one participant to start the game with twice as much money than the other and that participant also got to roll both dice to get around the board (i.e., the other participant started with half the money and could only roll one dice). At the end of the game when he asked the participants who started with more money why he won the game, they would chock it up to their excellent strategy and gamesmanship rather than the fact that they had started the game with way more resources.

The actual surface of the floor, 1 meter or so below, was white with red polka dots. At varying intervalsof age the babies would be brought in and placed on the wood end and encouraged to crawl to their moms who were standing at the glass end of the platform. In early infancy baby crawls over there without giving a shit.

            "I just recently heard of blind-sightedness during one of my cognitive psychology classes. Basically the area of the brain that processes what our eyes see is located at the back of the head, just where your skull starts to get smaller, towards your neck. Because of this, if you hit your head back there quite often everything will go black for a moment before sight returns again. Sometimes though, following severe trauma to this area of the brain (like after falling off a ladder onto a curb or something) a person is never able to see again. \n\nFor a long time it was assumed that the eyes were somehow incapable of seeing following the trauma and that was why people were blind, however it\u2019s been shown that it is just the processing of the images that is damaged-in other words your eyes are still working away, viewing images but your brain is unable to process the images so you can\u2019t \u201csee\u201d them. \n\nSome experiments looking into this have found that people with damage to this area can still navigate around things in front of them, without realising they are doing it. So if you told someone with this damage to walk down a corridor, and you placed obstacles in their way, they wouldn\u2019t be able to see the obstacles but they could avoid bumping into them because their eyes are still able to view them and send signals to other areas of the brain to avoid knocking things. This is known as blind-sightedness. \n\nBlew my little mind tbh \n\n\nEdit: here\u2019s the Wikipedia link about it, it\u2019s a little bit science-y tbh but it explains a bit better what I was trying to say https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindsight \n\nEdit #2: So I\u2019m in the UK and it\u2019s currently 430am.

The thing is, only the last individual is the participant and the others are actors paid to answer in a specific manner. For the first few questions, they choose the correct answer, but later on they start choosing the wrong one. The participants are conflicted as to whether they will say the correct answer or conform to the wrong answer as to not be judged by others or due to self-doubt of their own answers. In the end, most do conform. \n\nIt's really interesting since it shows how powerful conformity is in the face of doubt, up to a point that some even question their own sanity during the test. \n\nAnother variation of the experiment also had interesting results. It had the same set up with 5 individuals with the last person being the participant. However, this time some of the actors say the wrong answer while 1 actor says the correct one. There was an increase in participants who would choose the correct answer and avoid conformity. It shows how much doubt one can have on oneself when alone, but be brought back to self-confidence when they find outside support. \n\nEdit: Conformity in participants might be caused by either being afraid others' judgement or due to self-doubt.",

Mario doesn't provide players with an in game map the way Call of Duty does, so they have to develop an internal cognitive map of the virtual world in order to get around it.   \nNow, it's important to remember that the changes in cognitive functioning were very small (small to the extent that I would argue that they aren't actually meaningful), that the sample size in this experiment were very small which could have skewed the results, and that it was very recent and still needs to be replicated, but the results to me are fascinating in that they suggest that certain video games may provide certain benefits to older people.

Therefore, other reflexes may be just as experience driven as this one.",
            "**The Motivation Problem ~ A Lesson in Cause & Effect on Israeli Fighter Pilots**\n\n\nIn the 1960s, Nobel award winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman gave a lecture to a team of Israeli Air Force flight instructors about the value of positive reinforcement. Having proposed the idea that positive reinforcement almost always produced better results, the instructors scoffed at the idea. Their experience was completely the opposite confirmed by years of experience. \n\nThe instructors had tried being positive and it didn't work. When they used positive reinforcement the results actually got worse. After bad performances, when they used threats and normal military reprimands, the instructors found the pilots almost always improved the next day. Thus Kahneman's suggestion was the opposite of everything these instructors had experienced.\n\n**Illusions of Causality**\n\nYou may be asking, who could even argue with such seemingly conclusive results? Yet Kahneman could, because he was right. \n\nHe showed that the actions of the instructors were not the cause of the expected results, and in fact, these actions weren\u2019t the cause of anything. What the instructors were reporting was merely a case of regression toward the mean.\n\nThe fighter pilots were the very top in their fields, extremely dedicated and motivated, yet they were human like any of us so they were prone to good and bad days. On average, they performed very well. When one would have a bad day that would be below his norm, mere probability suggests that his next day is likely to be better. Conversely, when one performed well above his norm, the regression worked in the opposite direction as the probability would show that he would be expected to perform worse the next day. \n\nThe fact that the instructors yelled in their faces or praised their efforts had little to do with their next performance. The pilots simply had good and bad days from time to time. But positive feedback created considerably less stress than negative feedback, which was a powerful asset in an already stressful environment.\n\nThe beliefs of the instructors were completely fueled by a false assumption about cause and effect. We all want to assume we know the meaning of things, especially when it seems obvious. Yet often in life there is more depth than we notice. \n\nAs famed English writer Aldous Huxley observed...\n\n*\"Man is so intelligent that he feels impelled to invent theories to account for what happens in the world. Unfortunately, he is not quite intelligent enough, in most cases, to find correct explanations.\"*\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nSOURCE: Kahneman, D., & Tversky, A.

            "Hurricanes with female names are deadlier than those with male names. A paper published in PNAS by Jung et al. (2014) used six decades of death rates from US hurricanes and lab experiments and found that feminine-named hurricanes cause significantly more deaths than do masculine-named hurricanes. This is because hurricane names lead to gender-based expectations about intensity and severity which in turn guides people\u2019s intentions to take protective action. A stunning finding on the effects of gender stereotypes.\n\n",
            "In 1925, Anna Freud (daughter of Sigmund Freud) met a woman by the name of Dorothy Burlingham in Vienna. Dorothy was an heiress of the famous Tiffany family in America. She had recently divorced her husband, and moved to Vienna in hopes of getting help from Anna with her children. She believed the children were suffering from depression and other mental illnesses and Anna was a well respected psychologist at the time, specializing in childhood development. Anna agreed to help Dorothy, and proceeded to essentially use this family as a guinea pig for her theories for the next 30 years or so. \n\nAnna Freud believed (as her father did) that many psychological problems stem from the irrational nature of all humans, primarily sexual desire. Her solution was to force conformity until it was habit, after which all the irrational behaviors would fall away. The experiment was a massive success. When the eldest son began to show homosexual tendencies, they simply convinced him to act heterosexual and he suddenly was. If any of the other children acted in a way that was socially frowned upon, they would be told to simply act differently, and they would change to be that way inside. \n\nOver the next 20 or so years, the children grew up to have extensive educations, get great jobs, and even establish families just as \"normal\" people are supposed to do. Anna Freud's work became very respected by psychologists the world over, and people began to adopt her practices as their own to treat patients. Even the US Government began to use Anna Freud's work, both to refine marital law (this was the basis for the now-popular decision to award sole custody to the mother) and to treat soldiers coming back from war with massive success.\n\nOr so they thought.\n\nIt wasn't until another 10-20 years down the road that things started to unravel. People started really questioning things when the eldest son committed suicide at the age of 55, in 1970. Another of the children committed suicide in 1974, in Anna Freud's home. Over time it was uncovered that the children were only perfect on the outside. Once they became adults, their lives were filled with substance and physical abuse, and other signs of severe depression. \n\nThe damage was done, however. Anna Freud's work was already massively popular, and was the basis for many cultural shifts in our society through the 70s-90s. All those terrible parenting strategies you remember growing up having to deal with? Most of those are derived from work by Anna Freud. It's really amazing how much one person can affect the rest of us.",

            "There is an optical variable called tau, expressed as image size divided by image expansion rate, and it has been shown to be used to perceive time to contact of an approaching object. Even diving birds have been shown to use it. The most interesting part is that the tau quantity is perceived as a whole, directly, and not arrived at by any sort of implicit calculations. Also, it\u2019s time derivative, called tau-dot, is used to control deceleration toward an object, e.g. braking in a car. \n\nPhysical activity, in the form of aerobic activity, does a better job of maintaining cognitive ability in aging  than any brain training game or cognitively stimulating activities. \n\nCasual video games can reduce stress.

            "The 5 monkeys experiment.\n\nAn experimenter puts 5 monkeys in a large cage. High up at the top of the cage, well beyond the reach of the monkeys, is a bunch of bananas. Underneath the bananas is a ladder.\nThe monkeys immediately spot the bananas and one begins to climb the ladder. As he does, however, the experimenter sprays him with a stream of cold water. Then, he proceeds to spray each of the other monkeys.\nThe monkey on the ladder scrambles off. And all 5 sit for a time on the floor, wet, cold, and bewildered. Soon, though, the temptation of the bananas is too great, and another monkey begins to climb the ladder. Again, the experimenter sprays the ambitious monkey with cold water and all the other monkeys as well. When a third monkey tries to climb the ladder, the other monkeys, wanting to avoid the cold spray, pull him off the ladder and beat him.\nNow one monkey is removed and a new monkey is introduced to the cage. Spotting the bananas, he naively begins to climb the ladder. The other monkeys pull him off and beat him.\nHere\u2019s where it gets interesting. The experimenter removes a second one of the original monkeys from the cage and replaces him with a new monkey. Again, the new monkey begins to climb the ladder and, again, the other monkeys pull him off and beat him -\u00a0including the monkey who had never been sprayed.\n\nEdit: so a lot of people have pointed out this wasn't actually ever done, but rather extracted as an assumption based on another experiment or other findings. Disappointing. I've heard this example used many times even from famed and respected psychologists. Just goes to show again, a lie gets around the world before the truth even has its pants on. Sorry folks! Thanks for the karma. ",
            "The Pratfall Effect. In essence, if you are considered \"highly competent,\" you become more likable after a small mistake. The classic example (and what happened in the initial experiment) involved people spilling coffee during an interview to be a contestant on a show. If someone demonstrated themselves to be intelligent and competent, they became *more* likeable after spilling coffee on themselves.

            "Finally something in my specialty!\n\nOne of the most interesting theories I've learned in grad school is the Motor Theory of Speech perception. https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03193857\n\nThe idea is that hearing speech is not hearing sound waves, it's hearing vocal gestures (i.e. the movements of your tongue, lips, and throat). The researchers realized the sound waves associated with letters are too variable to be relied on for perception. For example, say the word \"Dad\", if you say it slowly, you'll notice that the frequency and pitch of the two \"d\" sounds are different. What stays the same isn't the sound you make, it's the vocal gesture you made to create the \"d\" Therefore, to hear and perceive a letter or word, you recruit your own motor system to identify what vocal gestures were used to create it.\n\nA fun example of this theory is the Mcgurk effect, if you play a sound that is between a \"b\" and \"g\" with a video of someone saying one of the two letters, the listener will perceive the letter they see on the video because the video is giving them clues of how the letter was created in the vocal tract.\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=G-lN8vWm3m0",
            "In 2005, Yale researchers did an experiment to see if they could teach monkeys to use money. They gave them a certain number of discs that could be exchanged for jello, grapes, and apples. Over time the monkeys learned how to budget and buy food with these tokens. Then they began gambling and trying to steal tokens. The data gathered from the gambling behavior made them \u201cstatistically indistinguishable from most stock market investors\u201d according to one of the head researchers. Late in the experiment, a monkey stole an entire tray of discs and managed to bring it back to the pen where all the monkeys where. The male monkeys then began giving the discs to female monkeys in exchange for sex. Then the female monkeys bought grapes. So I guess they showed that prostitution really is the oldest profession. This story was from the book \u201cfreakinomics\u201d for those interested in more.",

            "This will almost certainly get buried, but I remember reading about an experiment done by Stanford University in (I think) 1984. Researchers sent a bunch of healthy people to check themselves into a mental hospital. Each one was told to give the same complaint upon checking in--hearing voices--but then to stop showing any signs of symptoms immediately. Naturally, over the course of a couple weeks the staff were convinced that all these people really had mental health problems. One of them was writing in a journal to pass the time and the nurse charted her as \"exhibiting writing behavior\" lol.\n\nSo afterwards, the University told the hospital what they had done and the hospital cried foul. So the researchers agreed to run the experiment again; this time, they told the hospital that an unspecified number of \"fake patients\" would check in during a certain time period. So the hospital identified a dozen or so patients that were obvious plants.\n\nExcept that time, the University didn't send anyone.",
            "One of my favourites is the rather prosaicly named \"A not B error\". It works with babies who have recently learned that they can manipulate things around them using their hands (around 6-10 months).\n\nIt goes like this. You sit a baby on your lap, with a small toy and two large clear (see through) glasses on the table in front of you. With the baby's help (ie with them holding the toy and you guiding their hand), you put the toy under one of the two glasses. Then, with the baby watching, you take the toy from under the glass and move it to under the second glass.\n\nThen you wait, for the baby to reach for the toy. And they reach for the first, empty glass! Even though the toy is clearly visible under the second glass!\n\nThe reason is that the baby develops a hugely egocentric view of the world for a while. All she knows for sure is that she can move stuff with her hands, and that's the way that the world works. Sure, she saw you move the toy - but *she* didn't do it, so it didn't happen. The toy must be where she left it.\n\nI tried this on my kids when they were the right age - and it worked!! ",

While this is often observed in drug tests where half of the test subjects receive a new drug, and half receive a sugar pill there has been some research that Dr. Andrew Weil cites that shows the placebo effect can be capitalized on and used to help people heal.  Essentially your brain can do what many drugs do if you believe that it can.",

The opposite actually happened.\n\nMore people started picking up kids late, because they were okay with taking a fine, rather than being put in a socially embarrassing predicament where they would have to apologize to the daycare lady. \n\nJust goes to show that you never really know what the results will be, even if you think you've thought of everything.",
            "The Robber's Cave experiment. Basically, they took 24 boys into the woods and split them up into groups of 12. Each group was told to make a flag and a name. They were put through teambuilding exercises, and went through the predicted storming-norming-conforming phases. When put in competition with the others, rivalries grew, which were demonstrated when the boys were forced to eat together (and not segregate themselves). Later on, the researchers cut off the water supply to the camp and forced the two tribes to work together to fix it. They ended up going through the same storming-norming-conforming process and put aside their rivalries, eventually becoming one homogenous tribe, even going as far as all talking as one group on the bus home.

            "The youngest person to ever give birth was a Peruvian girl, Lina Medina, a Quechua Indian who gave birth to a child in 1939 at age 5. She had precocious puberty and had her first period at age eight months. She may have been raped at a debauched indigenous religious festival where people often brought small children and rapes were known to occur. The man who raped her was never found, and she was silent about how she got pregnant.\n\nThe delivery was by Caesarean as vaginal delivery was deemed impossible. Her son was told that he was her little brother, and she also treated him in this manner. Obviously, she was an incompetent parent, preferring to play with dolls rather than tend to the baby, but that's to be expected. The case is well documented in medical journals, including photos of her pregnant body. It is also in the Guinness book.\n\nShe later married, had another son, went to work for the physician who delivered her, and lived a quite normal life. The son was healthy but died young at age 40. She and her family both refused all requests to speak of the case, including offers of significant sums of money. As of 2008, she was still alive at age 75 and living in a slum in Lima, Peru. If she is still alive, she would be 87 years old.",

            "Touching an AM radio broadcast tower will kill you, and not only will it kill you, but it will hurt the entire time you're dying. Number one, the voltage is so high that your hands would instantly clamp to whatever charged part of the tower you touched, then because it's oscillating at a frequency your cells can't feel you wouldn't be able to feel yourself being electrocuted until it starts to heat your body from the current, and you'd also be able to hear your body acting as a \"speaker\" where you'd literally be able to hear whatever was on that particular station as you die. [Here's an example of the shear power running through one of these things.](https://youtu.be/uo9nGzIzSPw)\n\nEdit: Since people asked, touching an FM broadcast tower won't have nearly the same effect. The tower is hundreds of feet high and unlike AM radio where the tower itself is the antenna, the actual antenna is only about 20-30 feet long at the very top. Also FM radio uses a lot lower power, only usually 100-1000 watts, compared to AM radio where usually 1000-50,000 watts are used. So unless you climb all the way to the top of the tower, there's no danger of any burns.\n\nAlso, in regard to 5G: as stated previously, AM radio uses an incredible amount of power. 5G uses so much less power, on the order of 1-15 watts. Also, radio waves are considered non-ionizing radiation, meaning the only danger with them is a small heating effect at higher frequencies kinda like a microwave, but also keep I mind that your microwave uses 1500 watts. This is because the wavelength of these radio waves is literally too big to interact with your cells in any way. There's no danger whatsoever here. The power depicted in that video comes from the electricity flowing through the tower, not the radio waves themselves.",

During my first 18 years, I spent some time with my parents during at least 90% of my days. But since heading off to college and then later moving out of Boston, I\u2019ve probably seen them an average of only five times a year each, for an average of maybe two days each time. 10 days a year. About 3% of the days I spent with them each year of my childhood.\n\nBeing in their mid-60s, let\u2019s continue to be super optimistic and say I\u2019m one of the incredibly lucky people to have both parents alive into my 60s. That would give us about 30 more years of coexistence. If the ten days a year thing holds, that\u2019s 300 days left to hang with mom and dad. Less time than I spent with them in any one of my 18 childhood years.\n\nWhen you look at that reality, you realize that despite not being at the end of your life, you may very well be nearing the end of your time with some of the most important people in your life. If I lay out the total days I\u2019ll ever spend with each of my parents\u2014assuming I\u2019m as lucky as can be\u2014this becomes starkly clear.\n\nIt turns out that when I graduated from high school, I had already used up 93% of my in-person parent time.

Lots of people experienced flu-like symptoms after coming into contact with it, and peoples' dogs and cats all over the city were dying.\n\nWhen a local hospital ran a lab test on the substance after one of the patients suggested it, it was found that whatever this mysterious \"rain\" was, it had *human white blood cells in it*. Some time after that, a sample was also sent to the Washington State Health Laboratory, where it was being researched by epidemiologist Mike McDowell. After he determined that it was man-made and speculated that it was some sort of matrix for transporting viruses/bacteria, the samples suddenly went missing from the containment facility and his supervisor told him not to ask any questions. There are no known samples of the stuff anywhere today, despite being sent to several different facilities by various Oakville residents.\n\nSo yeah, I'd personally say that this was clearly some sort of bio-weapon test run, but by whom?

Each letter included secret and dark details about their personal lives. \n\nOne resident received a ton of letters, accusing her of various unsavory acts. The author warned the resident that he had been keeping an eye on her home, as well as her comings and goings. The resident was horrified and tried to keep the letters a secret until her husband began receiving them. \n\nThe attacks on the family continued, with large posters appearing around town spreading rumors about their 12 year old child. One day in 1977, the husband left the house after receiving a call from who he thought was writing the letters. A few minutes later, the husband was found dead at the end of the street dead behind the wheel. The sheriff had ruled it a homicide when he realized that a single shot had been fired before the accident, but there was no evidence that the husband was shot at the site. The sheriff found the husband was twice the legal limit and ruled it a drunk driving accident. \n\nThe letters began once again, this time accusing the sheriff of covering up the true nature of the death. The letters also accused the sheriff of mishandling an investigation into the county coroner who had been accused of other grotesque acts. \n\nThe harrassment continued, this time with signs along the road and in 1983, the original resident who had been accused of having an affair pulled over to remove a sign. During the effort to remove the sign, she discovered a box was attached and inside of it was a small pistol. The gun was part of a booby trap designed to fire when the sign was removed. \n\nPaul Freshour was arrested and given 25 years...but one small problem.

            "A strange but not creepy mystery: The disappearance and reappearance of [Lawrence Joseph Bader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Joseph_Bader): he was a cookware salesman from Akron, Ohio who went missing in 1957. He went fishing, a storm hit, and his boat was found the next day with some damage. He was in debt and in trouble with the IRS and his wife was about to have their third child.\n\nFour days later, John \"Fritz\" Johnson appeared in a bar in Omaha, Nebraska (spoiler: it's Larry Bader). \"Fritz\" was known for his wild personality, he attracted local attention for sitting atop a flag pole for 30 days to raise money for polio, he became a radio announcer and a TV sports director. He drove around in a hearse with a bar and became a minor celebrity in Omaha... by no means was avoiding attention. In 1964, a cancerous tumor was found behind his left eye and it had to be removed.\n\nIn 1965, Fritz was in Chicago for a tournament and an acquaintance from Akron recognized him (despite the eyepatch) and confronted him, and then brought Bader's niece to take a look. She agreed it was her uncle and confronted him about it as well. Fritz denied it but found it humorous. Fritz's fingerprints were then matched to Larry Bader's military records and it was confirmed.\n\nFritz Johnson always maintained he had no memory of his former life as Larry Bader. Psychiatrists examined him and believed he was telling the truth even though he had financial reasons to assume a new identity and the concept of someone forgetting their past and entirely constructing a different one with false memories is hard to fathom. It is also considered a possibility that the eye tumor had something to do with it. He ultimately died in 1966 from the eye tumor and it was never determined conclusively whether he was lying or not.\n\nI am fascinated by this case especially because he had an entire change in personality, an entire life backstory as Fritz, and he made no effort to live a low profile to avoid discovery.... I found this case while looking through the Wikipedia category of people who have faked their own deaths (though it's debatable if this guy should even be on there...), all of which are great stories",

The hotel didn't want her, the hospital turned her away, and when she tried to board an earlier flight home, she was not allowed to board because of her behaviour.

We have never worked out what happened. [There\u2019s an episode of the \u201cStuff you should know\u201d podcast that talks about it.](https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/stuff-you-should-know/id278981407?i=1000454589626)\n\n>About 8:15 p.m. on the evening of February 19, 1994, Ramirez, suffering from severe heart palpitations, was brought into the emergency department of Riverside General Hospital by paramedics. She was extremely confused and was suffering from tachycardia and Cheyne\u2013Stokes respiration.\n\n>The medical staff injected her with diazepam, midazolam, and lorazepam to sedate her. When it became clear that Ramirez was responding poorly to treatment, the staff tried to defibrillate her heart; at that point several people saw an oily sheen covering Ramirez's body, and some noticed a fruity, garlic-like odor that they thought was coming from her mouth. A registered nurse named Susan Kane attempted to draw blood from Ramirez's arm and noticed an ammonia-like smell coming from the tube.\n\n>She passed the syringe to Julie Gorchynski, a medical resident, who noticed manila-colored particles floating in the blood. At this point, Kane fainted and was removed from the room. Shortly thereafter, Gorchynski began to feel nauseated. Complaining that she was lightheaded, she left the trauma room and sat at a nurse's desk. A staff member asked her if she was okay, but before she could respond she also fainted. Maureen Welch, a respiratory therapist who was assisting in the trauma room was the third to pass out. The staff was then ordered to evacuate all emergency department patients to the parking lot outside the hospital. **Overall, 23 people became ill and five were hospitalized.** A skeleton crew stayed behind to stabilize Ramirez. At 8:50 p.m., after 45 minutes of CPR and defibrillation, Ramirez was pronounced dead from kidney failure related to her cancer.",

I don't know exactly what to believe since there's so much misinformation out there, but I'll just believe the articles who've done the most research for now. They say it was most likely not hundreds of dogs, because they can't find reports of that many jumping off like the \"legend\" says. It was only around 6. So it's likely that I was misinformed like so many other people were and it's not actually a huge phenomenon lol. But it's still sad and a bit weird that 6 dogs jumped off.",

Their tent was, perhaps significantly, the only one in that group that couldn\u2019t be seen from the counselors\u2019 tent.\n\nThe first evening at camp passed uneventfully, as excited campers gradually settled down and fell asleep looking forward to the next days of friendship and fun. But that night, some of the campers, and the counselors, in the tent group with Farmer, Milner and Guse, reported some Strange Occurrences: some tents being brightly lit hours after bedtime for short periods from an unknown source outside, and weird guttural sounds, not recognizable sounds of animals in an eastern Oklahoma forest but almost but not quite human speech either. In other areas of the camp, some people who got up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom also reported later seeing small dim orange lights floating around in the woods.\n\nThe next morning one of the counselors\u2019 in the three girls\u2019 tent group got up to take a shower. In order to do so she had to walk past their tent. Shortly past it, she found Guse\u2019s body, still in her sleeping bag. She had been beaten and strangled.\n\nThe counselor no doubt literally screamed bloody murder, and other staff quickly found that the other two girls, still in their tent, had also been killed the same way. Forensic investigation would show that the two in the tent had been raped as well.\n\nCamp Scott shut down almost immediately. It never reopened that summer, or since. All the girls were loaded back on their buses and sent home by the end of the day. Their waiting parents were told that three girls had been killed, but not which ones, meaning they had to go to the buses to make sure their daughters were alive (Why the Girl Scout Council wasn\u2019t sued over this negligent infliction of emotional distress, I\u2019ll never know. Perhaps because the families of the victims sued (unsuccessfully) over the killings as well).\n\nNaturally it was huge news and the police investigation was intensely followed by the media. It was not a smooth story either. At first the police said they had tons of evidence and would make an arrest soon. Then they backed off that, but said there were fingerprints everywhere. Then just two, and finally one\u2014at which point the local sheriff got mad at the media for allegedly interfering with the investigation (how, he didn\u2019t explain) and said he wouldn\u2019t be holding press conferences anymore. Why the police account of the case went from so optimistic to so pessimistic is not known yet.\n\nThe police did, however, bring in some specially trained search dogs from Pennsylvania who the media dubbed \u201cthe wonder dogs\u201d; supposedly they had some evidence that the dogs could use to trail suspects with. A local rumor had it, however, that some Cherokee medicine man had put a curse on the dogs. One of the three died of heat exhaustion after a day of searching\u2014understandable, perhaps, in an Oklahoma summer. But another, one day, suddenly and inexplicably walked into traffic in the middle of a busy highway, with predictable results.\n\nOther dogs brought in did not die, but did weird things like, while following trails into clearings in the woods, suddenly look directly up and start indicating that was where the trail went. Even today, some people walking their dogs on the camp site have claimed the animals start acting strangely around the spot where Guse\u2019s body was found.\n\nLater in the summer, a private security guarding the camp, gathered at the dining hall at the time, jumped up and went into the woods when one of them reported seeing what looked like a man in the distance (the whole place was officially off-limits to the public pending the investigation\u2019s outcome). When they returned, they found one of the dead girl\u2019s sneakers in a plastic bag (and not the kind used for evidence, either) along with a newspaper clipping about the case where they had been sitting.\n\nLater in the year the police finally announced they had a suspect: Gene Leroy Hart, a Cherokee originally from the area who had escaped from state prison in the late 1960s, where he was serving time for several rapes in the Oklahoma City area. He was arrested at the home of a local medicine man soon afterwards.\n\nDespite a strong belief by local law enforcement (one of the state investigators, who later got himself elected to the state senate, wrote a book about the case stating his belief that Hart, and only Hart, committed the crimes) that they had their man, he was acquitted. Many of the prosecutors believed that was because the jury was allowed to know that he would be returned to his long prison sentence no matter what the outcome of the trial, in violation of a judge\u2019s pretrial order that that not be mentioned.\n\nBut it might also have been because the jury was local and believed that it was all too easy for white law enforcement to just scapegoat a Cherokee for the crime and be done with it. And the case had some problems. A military-style boot print at the scene, on one of the steps into the tent, was too large to have been left by Hart. Also, evidence at trial established that someone had tried to clean up bloodstains on the tent floor with one of the girls\u2019 bags \u2026 not really consistent with the crime of opportunity the prosecution presented the case as, a theory further confounded by Guse\u2019s body being *outside* the tent and still in her bag when discovered, and also raped less severely than the other two (or not raped at all \u2026 I can\u2019t remember the specifics). Was something more going on? Were more people than Hart involved? I can see a jury getting to reasonable doubt that way.\n\n(And regarding the military boot print, some people have noted that the \u201cdim orange lights\u201d reportedly observed on the night of murders are consistent with a technique taught in the Army of putting duct tape over a flashlight to make it harder to see at a distance).\n\nShortly after being returned to prison, Hart (who by some accounts had been in his youth instructed in some ancient Cherokee technique of \u201cskin-walking\u201d, i.e., shapechanging) died in prison of a heart attack while lifting weights. He was 35.\n\nDNA tests were done on the semen samples from the case 30 years later, but the evidence had so degraded by that time as not to yield anything usable.",

When they asked him for his country of origin, he casually stated that he was from Taured, on the border between France and Spain. The officials told him that Taured didn\u2019t exist, but he presented them with his passport\u2014issued by the nonexistent country of Taured\u2014which also showed visa stamps corroborating his previous business travels to Japan and other countries. Yet when they called the company he said he was having a meeting with, they had never heard of him or his company ever before that moment. The hotel he had reserved a room at had no reservation for such a person, and the bank listed on his checkbook appeared not to exist.\n\n\nThe man was described as a neatly-dressed middle-aged Caucasian man. His primary language was French, yet he spoke Japanese and several other languages. In his wallet was a variety of currencies from various European countries, as if to verify his frequent flyer tendencies.\n\n\nCustoms officials showed him a world map and pointed to the tiny country of Andorra. The man became irate, saying that Andorra didn\u2019t exist but it was right where Taured should be. His country had existed for a thousand years. The man was detained by customs and given a room at a nearby hotel for the night while officials tried to figure out what was going on. The following morning, the man from Taured completely vanished from his hotel room which had been guarded by immigration officials all night long. And to make matters worse, all of his personal documents\u2014including his passport and drivers license issued by the mystery country\u2014vanished from the airport\u2019s security room.\n\n\nUPDATE:\n(for those asking for source)\nIve heard about this story a long time ago thats why i said it stuck with me.

My good friend Karina lives in Taured. And may I ask what Spain and France is? Those are Estalia and Vertosilia.

Also Ralinoa gives random results.\n\nNext i searched Taureb on google maps and i found a road that is called Taureb.

            "A couple unsolved disappearances near my hometown! \n\nBianca Noelle Piper was a teenager in rural Missouri in 2005. She was in therapy for (I believe?) bipolar disorder and anger and depression in general. On the drive home, she and her mother began arguing and it escalated. Her mother let her out of the car about a mile from home and instructed her to walk the rest of the way and cool off. Per the parents, this was following the instructions of the therapist to encourage Bianca to walk off her anger. Only, I doubt the therapist intended for her to walk a mile alone, at night, in the middle of winter, with just a hoodie. \n\nWhen Bianca didn\u2019t come home within about an hour, the parents went to look for her, and then called the police. There was very little to go on and the case is considered cold, but it is still open to new leads. \n\nSomeone knows where that girl went. A lot of people point at the mother, because allowing your kid to walk home alone in the dark is a pretty bad cover story to start with. However, the parents have been cleared by the investigators of any wrongdoing. I feel like, if nothing else, they should be investigated for neglect leading to the situation. \n\nAngie Houseman is another girl, about age 9, who disappeared in rural Missouri. I believe this happened in the mid to late 80s. My mom actually told me this story, as she remembers learning about it while in high school. She told her teacher one day that she was going to visit her new friend. The teacher just told her that was nice and to have a good time. That afternoon, Angie didn\u2019t get off the bus at her stop.\n\nLocally, this was a major thing. This was considered one of the safest places in the country to raise kids. Several days later, she was discovered in a wooded area by a hunter. It may have been a hunting conservation, but I\u2019m not totally sure. Her naked body was tied to a tree, and her clothing was nearby. She had been sexually assaulted and left to die of exposure. According to the reports, she hadn\u2019t been dead long, only a few hours if I recall correctly. She came so close to being rescued. \n\nAngie\u2019s murderer was never found, and like Bianca\u2019s case, it is still open to new leads. My mom actually has a pretty strong opinion to who it might be, seeing as she lived in the area, but the person has since died while in prison for other sexual crimes.",

            "I read this in a book called \u201cStranger than Science\u201d published in the late 50\u2019s that purportedly recounted baffling true stories. I had to root around for it, but man if it is true it is one of the strangest things I\u2019ve ever heard (copied and pasted from [here](http://anomalyinfo.com/Stories/1880-september-23-mystery-david-lang)):\n\n>On the afternoon of September 23, 1880, on a farm just a few miles outside of Gallatin, Tennessee, a remarkable -- and unexplained -- event was witnessed by five people.  \n>  \n>The farm was occupied by David Lang and his family -- his wife, Emma, his two children, eight-year-old George and eleven-year-old Sarah, and their household servants. On that afternoon, the children were playing in the front yard, when Mr. and Mrs. Lang came out of their house and Mr. Lang started across the pasture toward his quarter horses. As Lang was crossing the pasture, the horse and buggy of the family's friend, Judge August Peck, came into view on the lane in front of the house; the children stopped playing, as Peck always brought them presents when he visited. Both Mr. and Mrs. Lang saw the buggy, and Mr. Lang waved to the judge as he turned to walk back towards the house.  \n>  \n>Then David Lang completely disappeared in mid-step.  \n>  \n>David Lang had just suddenly ceased to exist. This was fully witnessed by his two children, his wife, Judge August Peck, and the Judge's traveling companion (the Judge's brother-in-law); understandably, Mrs. Lang screamed. All five witnesses ran to the spot they had last seen Mr. Lang, but there was nothing to hide behind or under; the field contained just short grass. The adults quickly searched the field for other possible clues, but to no effect. Mrs. Lang soon became hysterical, and was taken back into the house as neighbors were called with an alarm bell. By nightfall, all the neighbors were involved in the search and, by lantern, they checked every foot of the field, stamping their feet to try to detect any caves, holes, or cracks that Mr. Lang might have fallen into. Nothing was found.  \n>  \n>In the weeks following the strange disappearance, Mrs. Lang was bedridden with shock. All the family servants except the cook, Sukie, left the house. Curiosity seekers were being chased away from the farm by the local authorities. The county surveyor confirmed that the field was on perfectly solid ground, with no caves or sink holes. No one had any answers for what happened.  \n>  \n>Months after the event, in 1881, Lang's children noticed that the grass at the site of their father's disappearance had grown strange and yellow; it formed a circle with a fifteen-foot diameter. Sarah called to her father and, seemingly as a result, both the children heard him faintly calling for help, over and over, until his voice faded away.  \n>  \n>Mrs. Lang never fully recovered. There was never a funeral or memorial service for Mr. Lang. Mrs. Lang eventually left the farm and allowed Judge Peck to rent it out, with the exception of the field in the front of the house. That pasture was left untouched as long as she lived.  \n>  \n>What had happened to David Lang? In the years since, many authors have guessed -- possibly Lang was an abduction by fairies or UFOs, perhaps he somehow fell into a different dimension of existence, or perhaps he somehow had the very atoms of his body suddenly break into their component parts and simply ceased to exist -- but all of it are just guesses. In the end, there just isn't any way to ever know for sure where the missing farmer went.\n\nEdit: So there seems to be debate about whether this is true or a hoax. All I'll say is I read the story 20 some-odd years ago and it has stuck with me. Now I'm reading through and it sounds like a hoax, which had I known sooner it could have saved me 20 years of nightmares. Also, I fixed the formatting because of complaints.

Well, that day she had commit suicide and simply left the vague message that he was safe, in a place he would never be found.\nHis father was upset; he wanted his child, especially since his mother was gone. He searched for years. The closest he'd gotten was a few years later, a teenager claimed to be the child. This ended up being a lie; he was an adult who looked like a teen who often disguised as random people.\nPeople seem to have forgotten about this case."

Exciting, I know.\n\nAnyway, I kept it and the other birthday presents I got in a cardboard box in my room. Evidently, at some point, moisture got into the box *and* the plastic the powder was in, and it began expanding.

When 2 months have passed, I decided to scratch my skin under the cast using a pen since my fingers couldn't reach further areas. While doing so, I accidentally put the pen further away inside that I can't remove it under my cast since I can't reach it then I just ignored it after that thinking that it will be just fine and I didn't tell that to my parents since they would be mad. After 2 months, they decided to remove my cast since its already due but the night before removing my cast, my mom noticed that my arm smells rotten. So fast forward, they removed the cast in my arm in the hospital then they noticed that the pen was penetrating my skin for months and the hole is about a size of a penny full of pus. I didn't even feel a thing. After that, the hole eventually became a penny-sized scar in my skin.",

The horizontal lines of the F aren't part of this story though, that was just a minor thing where a 70s Malibu wagon ran me over when I was two and the fan blades chopped me.  No, we are going to talk about that vertical line.\n\nI was Sixteen, this is about three days before I would get my freshman pictures taken.  Something I had always done as a kid was run out of my from the door and do a leap into the front yard, no big deal for short me, but I had hit a growth spurt that summer and didn't realize it.  New factors just came into play, like the giant metal overhang of the front porch.  Well, my mother was chatting outside with someone, so I thought I would do my usual entrance, but I didn't realize just how grand it was about to be, the top of my head just barely clipped that overhang and rang my bell, I cleared the porch spinning as the back of my head slammed into the sidewalk below.\n\nI wasn't in a lot of pain yet, but I remember sitting up and saying out loud 'man that was stupid'. My mom looks at me, and I quote 'Yeah that was stupid, you're BLEEDING'. I had gashed the top of my head straight open.  We were poor, but my mom was no dummy, so she already had some home made ice packs (50/50 water and rubbing alcohol) and towels ready for my dumbassary.  We get to the ER, and as the doctor starts to assess my ass he sniffs me, looks at my mom and asks 'Why do I smell alcohol?'. My mom had to reassure him that I was stupid all on my own and didn't need any help.\n\nAnd then the adrenaline wore off, holy shit was I in pain. My mom, the saint that she is asks 'Is there anything I can do to make you feel better?' My response at the time, while gold, wasn't exactly what she was expecting with 'Can I have a car?' She punched me and the doctor laughed.\n\nSo three days, nine stitches, and a slightly shaved skull later I have to take school pictures.  I hid the scars, but I had to live with that picture for the rest of my days in school. (I combed it all straight down to hide it the best I could, I can probably find the yearbook that picture is in if I feel like embarrassing myself any more today.)\n\nEdit: it's a bit hard to see, being an over 20 year old picture, but if you look at the right side, you can see the edge of my [bad comb over](https://imgur.com/K80ntLh).

            "\nIt\u2019s finally my time to shine!!\n\nIt was Christmas Day, 2010. I was 10, my brother was 12. I was in that stage of my life where I greatly admired my brother, and basically followed him around and did what he ordered me to do.\n\nAt this given moment, my nan and her boyfriend were at the table sitting outside enjoying the sunshine and listening to Mariah Carey. My mum,  preparing the Christmas feast of ham and roast veg. My dad, probably trying to figure out how to make ice with the new ice machine and cursing his existence.\n\nNow for a little more context, I\u2019ve grown up in the Australian suburbs. This is important to reference, as it explains why my brother and I were trying to peep over the fence to see what our loud neighbours were doing. You\u2019re probably confused...I\u2019ll explain. In Australia, it\u2019s common culture to extend to your neighbours, or the entire street, an invitation into the family.\n\nThis includes inviting them over to celebrate birthdays, having afternoon siestas on the front lawn, joint Australia Day bbqs, that kind of thing.\nHowever, my family was never really close to the neighbours behind us. I personally feel like this is because they never cut their bloody tree that\u2019s palms dipped into our yard. \n\nAnyway, on this particular Christmas, those neighbours were being louder than usual. My brother, being the nosey bastard he is, decided he wanted to see what the commotion was all about. So he decided he had a plan; get a chair, put it against the fence and look over. \n\nBut alas, this plan would not work, as the way the chair was positioned, my brother would surely topple over. Cue my involvement. I sat down in that chair as if my life depended on it. My brother needed my help, so I\u2019d be sure to give it. I watched as my brother climbed the chair, using the headrest as a step. \nHe peered over. \nI caught my breath. \nIt felt like eternity before my brother started to jitter and panic. \n\n\n\n\u201cWHAT ARE YOU DOING UP THERE?!\u201d\n\n\n\nHOLY TURTLE DOVES, \nI thought, as my brother clambered down the fence. The bloody neighbours had seen his boof of a head peering into their yard. Now panicking as well, I yelled at my brother to hurry down so I could runaway myself, but that wasn\u2019t before the incident occurred.\n\nThe life changing moment that gave me my scar.\n\nI bet you\u2019re wondering how it happened? Did my brother somehow topple the chair over and make me fall, cutting my hand on the pot plant below? No. Or did the neighbour throw over a cricket ball in anger, it landing on my head and causing me to bleed and have a little Harry Potter scar?\n\nNot even close. \n\nAs my brother rushed down from the fence, his feet came too close to my face. His big toe specifically. And in a moment you could say was set on 0.75 speed, his toe nail collided with my cheek, cutting my face.\n\nHe landed safely on the floor and ran to the outdoor table, including himself in my nan and her partner\u2019s conversation as if nothing happened. But I knew something was wrong. My bloody face was burning!\n\nI abandoned the chair and the yells of fury behind me and darted for the bathroom. I looked in horror at my new battle wound.\n\nMy god, I looked like a prisoner you wouldn\u2019t want to fuck with. The cut resembled la teardrop. Almost exactly so. It was rather fascinating in a way. But the stinging overcame the wonderment.\n\nI cleaned the wound as best as I could, being 10 years old and not very bright, and stuck a band aid on it. I know.\n\nI walked out and copied my brother; sitting at the table and acting like nothing happened. Of course everyone picked up on the bandaid, but I simply said I wanted to be a Christmas Pirate (doesn\u2019t make any sense? I know) and they moved on.\n\nTo this day, I have that scar. Yes, it still resembles a tear drop.",

            "9th grade. Dorm room. Put shampoo all over the big bathroom which was around 6m long with multiple stalls on both the sides of a straight corridor. Me and the Bois were slipping and sliding till I decided that I wanted to do a slick move that I saw in the movies. On my knees with my arms and torso stretched backwards is how I wanted to slide. I started too fast, or rather, my legs ran too fast, before I knew it I was halfway across the room. If I crouched now to proceed with the slick move that I had thought of, my whole body would've been stuck on a wall on the other side. So instead I choose to cease running. Legs stopped. Body still moving. Felt face-first onto the ceramic tiles and saw a white spark sorta light in my eyes. Got up and felt a small cut right above my eye caused due to the eye socket bone area?(idk what it's called). Thought it was no big deal. Proceeded to look in the mirror when my cheek was covered in blood. 6 stitches. Worse than the physical pain was the pain of telling people how I got this scar\n\nEdit:typo",
            "I was in the Ecuadorian mountains as a kid and we pulled up to a farm where we were going to buy fish. They also had chickens, so as a typical 9 year old I chased the chickens around for fun. But then while no one was looking I ran into a barbed wire fence that cut open my left face cheek pretty good. So close that it almost took out my eye too. It took hours to even get to a hospital because of how remote we were\n\nI just tell people it was a knife fight mostly though! And you'd be surprised how many people ask if I just had a really good nap. I always have to think about that until I realize what they're talking about.",

            "There is a competitive scene for people to breed, raise, and race homing pigeons. The longest races are usually 620 miles in distance, and the winning birds can return home in 9-12 hours. Some races are over 1000 miles long. Birds can race competitively from 6 months of age, up to ten years in some instances. The fastest birds have been clocked at a speed of over 90 mph over short distances.\n\nPigeons will imprint the location from which they first fly, and they will always return to that location when released, regardless of their location. Competitors release their birds at predetermined locations, and RFID devices are used to time the birds from release to their eventual return to their home loft. Their lofts are entered in a database with GPS coordinates, and the sanctioning race organizers will take the birds to predetermined locations to ensure all birds are flying the same distance. Generally, organizers will create a similar flight path for all birds, ie birds will be released x miles south from their respective  lofts so the group as a whole is generally north. This helps to standardize weather conditions for all competitors as best as they are able to.\n\nElite racing pigeons can be sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars. \n\nThere have been doping scandals in pigeon racing. \n\nPigeons have some of the most amazing eyesight in the animal world. They have a 340 degree field of vision, and it is estimated that they process visual information three times faster than humans can. They can also see light in the UV spectrum. \n\nPigeons also have an amazing sense of hearing, the range of frequencies that they can perceive is far beyond what humans can hear. While it isn't completely known how pigeons are able to travel 100s of miles to navigate back to their roost, it is believed they use both their sight and hearing, as well as using the sun and earth's magnetic field to orient themselves. \n\nIt was once believed that the sun was the primary factor affecting their sense of direction, and while pigeons don't generally prefer to fly at night, they are able to navigate their way home without the aid of the sun.\n\nOddly enough, it is believed that their sense of hearing is the most crucial tool that pigeons use to fly home. As mentioned previously, their hearing range is far above what people can appreciate. Perhaps it is more accurate to say it is far below what people can sense, as the birds are able to sense infrasound, or ultra low frequency sound waves. \n\nIt has been theorized that they are attuned to the custom 'infrasound fingerprint' that is unique to the location of each pigeons individual roost. In fact, hearing is so important to their navigation, compared to eyesight, that researchers have done studies where they temporarily inhibit these senses, and measure how it affects their ability to fly home.\n\nWhile the vast majority of birds that were temporarily blinded were able to navigate home over several hundred miles, *zero birds that were temporarily made hearing impaired were able to return home.*\n\nI'm not a pigeon racer, and there are certainly ethical concerns for this sport, pigeon racing may have started over 1800 years ago. Truly incredible feats for birds that are such close relatives of those city pigeons that most people consider sky rats.",

Maybe now the lizards you see are darker and slightly larger (brown anoles). The reason for this is that brown anoles are larger and faster, and therefore more adept at hunting lower to the ground than green anoles. This depleted the amount of available food so green anoles have adapted their feet (in an astoundingly short amount of time) to be better climbers and are now more capable at finding food higher in the trees. They\u2019re still around, just out of your line of sight. There are situations, though, where green anoles will remain lower to the ground. Abundant food sources, like flies and such, and covered areas, like porches, provide favorable conditions that green anoles like. Also, fewer children that will mess with them condition green anoles to find shelter on your covered porch. Part of this is the fact that they are able to mate and successfully reproduce more under these circumstances.\n\nEdited a couple of words",

This is what we should be asking the presidential candidates how they intend to end this.\n\nEdit: So some people seem caught up on the fact that I stated that this should be the biggest issue. Mentioning that covid and black lives matter is more relevant right now. So first of all there are a lot of important issues that need to be addressed in this country. Many I also care deeply about. However where on your list is it time to address the US governments authorization of people raping children? Like 5th, 6th on your list or? The fact that it has ever existed let alone pushed aside is a stain on this country. Especially since of all the many problems we have. This is probably the most bipartisan issue I can think of and the quickest to solve. Sadly we will never live in a world where we can promise that no child will ever be raped again. But we can ensure that we seek justice whenever it happens, and we damn sure shouldn\u2019t condone it.",

            "Alright. Here is a sampling of some of the channels that I am currently subscribed to. This is by no means all of them but these are some of the ones I get excited to see a video pop up in my subscriptions. If anyone knows any similar channels to these, I would love to hear them. For each, i have given a channel name, brief description, and video(s) I would recommend.\n\n(Disclaimer: I am very into media analysis so you will see a lot of channels in that vein in this list.)\n\nEdit: obligatory thanks for gold! Also, I find it funny how many of the channels being recommended to me are ones that I am subscribed to but have not done a deep enough dive into to be sure of recommending them. :)\n\nAsk a Mortician - An excellent channel that aims to make us all a little more comfortable about death and everything that surrounds it. She has a variety of informational videos ranging from answering questions about historic dead to talking about iconic corpses to just answering questions! As a starter, I recommend either the \"iconic corpse\" series or her video about the dead of Pearl Harbor.\n\nBreadSword - A channel taking a deep look at movies in long form essays. He's not a consistent uploader but the work is consistantly good. I recommend \"Treasure Planet - Disney's Biggest Mistake\" (a video about how failed marketing and treatment killed an otherwise good film)\n\nCinemaWins - While the style is one of those CinemaSins knockoffs, this channel is actually a celebration of film other than one that does poorly made, bad-faith, film critique. It's a lovely watch and you can start just about anywhere.\n\nDefunctland - A video series tackling the amusement park attractions of yesterday. He's recently branched out into a few small side things as well. I recommend starting with his video on the Nickelodeon Hotel as well as the podcast episode that followed and supplemented it.\n\nFilmJoy - I will admit that I have only watched the Movies with Mikey series on this channel but it's a great dive into films with a wonderful atmosphere and great humor.  I recommend the video on Thor Ragnarok.\n\nFolding Ideas - Dan Olson is one of my favorite video essayists. While he talks about film a lot, he does have a dive into other things now and then that keep things fresh. My recommendation is his \"A Lukewarm Defense of Fifty Shades of Grey\" trilogy that I keep coming back to time and time again. It's a monster of a piece but well worth your time.\n\nFredrik Knudsen - Better known as \"the Down the Rabbit Hole\" guy, Fred makes miniature documentaries on strange things that happened both on and off the internet. His most recent one was feature length and interesting to behold. I recommend his video on Rajneeshpuram.\n\nInnuendo Studios - He's a inconsistant uploader as well but his content is too good to miss. Currently he's working on a series about the rhetoric of the alt-right and how it works. I would recommend as a start \"We Don't Talk About Kenny\".\n\nJenny Nicholson - This channel is a bit of a grab bag but is just a fun time diving into various media. I love just about everything that Jenny puts out. I would recommend \"Nobody on the Planet Remembers Beastly\", \"Is Forces of Destiny Good?\", or \"The Worst Reality Show of All Time\" \n\nLindsay Ellis - Once again this is another video essayist about film (can you tell I like a certain type of channel?). She's easily one of my favorites! I recommend either her trilogy on the Hobbit films or \"Bright: The Apotheosis of Lazy Worldbuilding\"\n\nLowart - This is a smaller channel and a bit of a newbie but he's definitely in need of more eyes. While he does talk about other things, this one is definitely more animation based. I would recommend his series \"Is Teen Titans as good as we remember it?\"\n\nNightMind - A channel diving into and explaining something pretty niche, horror experiences online. Most of them webseries. He's branching out a bit more lately though. I recommend his first video series breaking down Marble Hornets.\n\nQuinton Reviews - Quinton is another one of those channels that can be a little all over the place at times, but the content is generally interesting and chances are that there is something on there you'll enjoy. I recommend the \"fallen titans\" series, a dive into why some of the greats of youtube just kind of disappeared.\n\nSuperEyepatchWolf - A great anime channel, though there is some video game talk in there as well. I recommend his video \"The fall of Bleach\".\n\nThe Dom (Channel name might be changed soon - Main series titled Lost in Adaptation if it does) - A channel looking into the difference between books and their adaptations, why these changes might have been made and how it affects the story. I recommend his series on the adaptations of Harry Potter or his recent series covering Scott Pilgrim.\n\nYesterworld Entertainment - Much in the same vein as Defunctland in covering old theme park stuff, though with a very different style. Though there has been some coverage on movie related stuff in the past as well. I recommend his recent video on the evolution of the Carousel of Progress at disney.",

            "As someone studying to be an engineer I'd be thrilled.  There are a ton of extra conversion factors in Imperial and it sucks lol.  In middle school we all learned how much nicer it is to multiply and divide everything by 10 rather than arbitrary numbers like 12 and 5280 but that's just the beginning of it.\n\nHere's an example.  In basic kinematics, scientists distinguish between weight and mass.  Weight is a force, mass is a property of an object.  Well in Imperial we use pounds for BOTH quantities, even though they're different quantities.  It'd be like using feet to measure force as well as distance.\n\n\\>How long is the piece?>10 ft.>So how much force will it exert?>5 ft.>Great!\n\nPretty fucking stupid right?  Just you wait.  In SI weight is mass times gravitational acceleration.  Simple.  Clean.  Easy.  Technically you have to also divide by a constant called gc but that constant just equals 1.  In Imperial, the equation for weight is the same, except gc isn't a dimensionless 1, it's 32.17  pound feet per pound second squared.  What the FUCK?  Yeah, me too.  And yes, lb is in both the numerator and the denominator of that unit, but they can't cancel, because the numerator is lb mass and the denominator is lb force.  Good times.\n\nAnd upperclassmen tell me horror stories about Imperial units in electricity and magnetism.  Apparently it gets worse lol.\n\nI really don't care that it failed in the 70s.  The idea that gay people were people failed in the 70s.  It's time to switch and the sooner the better.",

When I worked at Raytheon, which being a US defense contractor works in imperial, everyone younger than about 45 works in metric and then converts the units to imperial before handing anything off. At my entire engineering college, the only reference to imperial units was a reminder that they existed and that we might work at a company that insisted on using imperial tools.",

After lunch we took one of our coworkers to the semi-famous Nike store which was a couple of blocks away and that was the day Justin Bieber happened to show up.\n\nWhen he and his entourage arrived he said something somewhat loudly along the lines of \"Y'all are going to have to leave for a bit 'cause I'm here to do some shopping\" and some of his people acted like they were going to try and politely force the already-present customers out of the store so Bieber could shop alone but the Nike employees even more politely told him that was not possible. At that point Bieber lost it-I mean he threw a total tantrum because they wouldn't shut down the store for him.

Once it was something very sentimental to her (can\u2019t remember what it was) and when she told me and I expressed sympathy, she said something like, \u201cOh no it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s my fault. If I told my children to clean their rooms but they didn\u2019t and had their friends come over, their friends would go home and tell their parents about how much of a slob my family is and that can\u2019t happen.\u201d This was her concern at 10 years old. \n\nWhen it came time for college, they sent her to an expensive, hard-to-get-into school and told her that her sole purpose there was to find a husband (specifically a doctor or an engineer) to keep her as a stay at home wife. She flat out told me this was her only purpose, which broke my heart because she is a smart person who was able to get into said-school to begin with and her parents should have been encouraging different goals for her. \n\nWell, she found a boyfriend but at the end of her four years of undergrad, he turned out to be a cheating narcissistic douchebag (the narcissistic douchebag part was obvious to me from the get-go but she had no idea what a healthy relationship looked like, however the cheating was obvious enough to be a deal-breaker). \n\nSo instead of going straight to marriage (which disappointed her parents and they kicked her out of the house), she suddenly had to become solely independent, find a job and an apartment and is doing well for herself.

He was incredibly socially inept. I felt bad for him. We developed kind of a weird little friendship where we only ever talked at our lockers, but we had these little two-minute deep conversations. Mostly focused on him getting bullied, and me advising him to just chill out and stop running his mouth so much because that was why it was happening. He was *obnoxious* to classmates and teachers alike, and he reveled in it.

He liked being hated/envied, to some extent, but he also hated being an outcast. \n\nHe did listen when I told him about the stuff that was bothering me (I was shy and felt ignored and excluded all the time). There was absolutely a kernel of a good human being in him. He was actually an important person to me in a way...

He won easily, because people didn't realize it was the kid. \n\nAs a state rep, he posted on Facebook about \"Enjoying his women battered rather than plain\" and asking to join the black caucus because he like hip hop. He also dropped a loaded gun on the floor in the middle of a session after fighting for the right to carry a gun in the state house as a \"responsible gun owner\". He kept getting elected despite these issues because his family was well-connected and he had a dedicated following from some political groups.\n\nAfter 6 years in office, he gets busted for soliciting sex from a minor over the internet.

Her dad was a CEO of a fairly large company and had an income north of $1 million per year in the late 90s.

They did background checks on everyone and found out that her dad lied about his experience and education. He did not have an MBA from Stanford. He did not have any college.

            "For a couple of years in high school I went to this super expensive American private school in Switzerland.  The company my Dad worked for paid for almost all the tuition, so it was an amazing opportunity for me.  Most of the kids in this school were either State Department or from American families living in Saudi (Saudi provided expat kids with school up until 10th grade, so you had to go to a school abroad to finish HS).  There were however, a few Saudi kids that were there, mostly so that they would be able to speak flawless English to help out their future careers.  One of these kids, who I will call The Prince, was somewhere in the line of Saudi succession, but honestly, he was like 1,455th in line for the throne.  Not a real contender for King, but his family was rich.  Like rich in a way that most of us can't even imagine.\n\nThis school had some rules, like you couldn't have a car as a student, even if you were old enough to get a license Switzerland.  This rule was a real buzz kill for The Prince, but he made it through the year somehow.  Over the summer after his Junior year, he drove back to the school from Geneva in his Lambo, probably just because he could do it outside the school year.  On his way up the mountain (the road is like a endless series of hairpin turns) he managed to flip his Lambo into vineyard while trying to navigate one of those hair pin tuns.  I'm guessing a Lambo has a lot of power, and he took it to hard.\n\nHis parents, furious at what he had done, decided to punish him by replacing his Lamborghini with a Porsche.  And The Prince was SOOOO angry.  He complained about it bitterly when the school year started up again.  The rest of us kind of just looked at each other in amazement.

            "I have a story that's a bit different than what I've read here so far. It's about a spoiled, self-proclaimed 'rich kid' I knew from the dorms my freshman year who went to college and was hit with the realization that while his family may have been seen as wealthy in his poor hometown, he was barely even considered above middle class compared to the people here. Note that I went to a public school on scholarship, so we're not talking about some 70k/year private school here...this guy was just the perfect mix of clueless/delusional and being cocky.  This happened a while ago so I'm a bit fuzzy on the details (I also never had more than a few conversations with the guy and never saw him outside freshman year), but anyways...to make a long story short.\n\n* \u2018Rich\u2019 Kid comes from a pretty small town a few hours away from campus that is pretty much known as a pretty poor, mostly industrial and agricultural town.\n* His family, I assume, was considered wealthy by town standards but was probably just marginally upper-middle class at best in the real world.\n* While most of the freshmen (myself included) are busy trying to make friends and adjust to college life, he\u2019s busy humble-bragging to anyone who will listen about his family\u2019s wealth. \n* We\u2019re maybe 3 or 4 days into classes and he\u2019s doing his usual routine of striking up a typical freshman dorms conversation (what\u2019s your name, where are you from, what are you studying, etc?) solely as an opportunity to brag about how rich is family is. In other words, acting like a complete and utter condescending snob a week into freshman year while everyone\u2019s just trying to make friends\n* He stumbles across some \u2018actual\u2019 extremely wealthy kids (the \u2018multiple expensive vacation homes and full time staff at their mansion\u2019 kind of rich) and tries pulling this on them by one-upping them at every turn in their conversation.\n* It takes less than 2 minutes for them to realize he\u2019s either delusional or a complete fraud and they pretty much start tearing into him for everything. For bragging about being rich when he came from one of the poorest towns in the state, for acting like some privileged snob and looking down on other people when he\u2019s an in-state student attending a PUBLIC school of all places. Asking him why he\u2019s wearing $15 button up shirts from Kohls and $20 jeans if he\u2019s as rich as he claims etc etc.\n* The kicker at the end is the \u2018rich kid\u2019 tries mentioning his dad\u2019s job at a large pharmaceutical company as a final bragging point while saying he probably made way more than their fathers. Note: this would be a job that would probably pay something like $150,000 in salary (definitely not bad, but **definitely** not \u2018rich\u2019). One of the other guys nearly collapses a lung laughing at him because his own dad recently stepped down/retired as one of the senior VP\u2019s of the same company\u2026estimates of his yearly compensation without considering whatever bonuses or packages he got when he stepped down were \\~5 million a year.\n\nIn short, the \u2018rich\u2019 kid finds out about the meaning of the \u2018big fish in a small pond\u2019 analogy the hard way and is pretty much the butt of \u2018my parents are so rich\u2019 jokes the rest of the year. He manages to pretty much alienate an entire floor of freshmen less than a week into college and is publicly humiliated by \u2018actual\u2019 rich kids (who ended up being complete assholes BTW, they\u2019re not exactly the heroes of this story). All because he decided go into college bragging about the same shit he probably got away with in his small town in high school.",

            "Friend in high school had two parents with pretty good jobs. She had a lot of name brand clothes, bags etc. She got a big solo trip abroad once a year. Her dad would buy the plane ticket and her mom would upgrade her to business class. I once invited her to come on a family vacation with me to Disneyworld. Note that this is a huge deal because we live so far away it takes 20+ hours and multiple airplanes to get there. She said \"No thanks, it's really far away and I can't spend that long in economy class.\" Last time I invited her anywhere.   \nShe was all set to go to a really prestigious, expensive university in Switzerland too, paid for by both her parents. Then her mom died. Her newly single-income household wasn't poor by any means, but all the little luxuries just weren't there anymore. She still gets her big trip abroad (barely), but it's only ever economy class now. She didn't get to Swiss university because her dad couldn't pay for it on his own.  \n\n(Throwaway because she knows who she is and she knows who I am)",

            "So my dad is the PAL wrestling coach in my town.  If you don\u2019t know, PAL is basically sports for kids not yet in high school.  I wrestle for my high school and one time I went to the PAL practice to help my dad.  It was the 5th grade to 8th grade practice.  There was this one kid, 7th I think that was the most SPOILED kid ever.  He acted like he owned everyone just because his family is rich.  He always talked when my dad showed moves and sometimes flat out refused to practice.  My dads a fair guy, always politely asking the kid to stop talking and stuff like that.  That night he had enough though.  The kid was kind of bulling this 5th grader and my dad just snapped.  You gotta imagine the scene: A scared spoiled rich kid picking on a 5th grader with a 300 lbs weightlifting competition winner stomping straight toward him.  My dad yelled \u201cOK (insert snob name here)!  YOU WANT FIGHT? LETS FIGHT IM READY PICK ON ME IF YOU THINK UR SO STRONG!\u201d My dad continued for a couple of minutes while the kid looked petrified.  My dad ended it with kicking him out of the practice.

            "When my family and I traveled to my mom\u2019s home country which is the Philippines. (She is the first in her family to come to America.) \n\nNow I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m spoiled rich kid, but when I was little I never really wanted for anything. I got to be picky with food, the clothes I wanted, the stuff I wanted (if I complained about it enough). And every time my mom would say \u201cwhen I was your age...\u201d but I was little so this meant swat to me. \n\nBut, when we took a two week vacation to the Philippines when I was 15, 2ish years ago (one week to visit family in Manila, the other to a resort on one of the islands). I wasn\u2019t completely oblivious I knew I was extremely lucky with being in a lower/middle middle class family, but when I saw how my cousins lived damn that really opened my eyes. When they came to the hotel we were staying at it was the first they saw a pool (it was in the upper class of Manila where all the skyscrapers are). This was one of the many \u201cslap across the face\u201d moments I had for the first week. The other more prominent ones being seeing their bedroom which was single bedroom with like 4 beds and one window A/C unit, seeing the neighborhood they lived in for the first time, and the dinner we had while we there. But, how they lived that\u2019s probably middle class for the Philippines. The gap between the middle class and the upper class is absolutely terrifying there. \n\nMan, after that week I felt like I was the luckiest kid in the whole wide world. Sadly, I don\u2019t think it hit my brother in the same way he broke his phone a few months after and I think it was newest/previous generation of iPhone that we got the spring before the vacation.",

Not because I didnt want to, I was just stupidly lazy to say them.\n\nI have a cousin who is less privileged than me, she didn't like how I was spoilt obviously.  We had a fight where I left her out on a playdate. And my stupid response was Ill buy her a chocolate milk and we should be friends again. She snapped at me publicly how I will never have friends If I think I can can just buy people off.  At age 11 those words stuck to me. She also never grew close to me since then no matter how mindful I tried.\n\nCruel twist of fate, I went to a private school with classmates who are millionaires or trust fund babies, 20x more richer than I am.   because I was less white and less richer than them + fell into some financial hardships, I got bullied a lot for it.",

She started partying waayyy to much, which led to dating a GIGANTIC douchebag, which led to her selling weed and LSD on campus! She graduated college and started working as a programmer, but she had also graduated to heroin, and when her parents cut her off (because, like, she supposedly had a job that paid her bills now), she crashed REAL hard.

Eventually she found friends from the same social class as her and it got easier for her.

(\u201cJesus Christ, Frank,\u201d Dean Martin exclaimed. \u201cI got Scotch older than this kid!\u201d)\n* Red Skelton, the famous comedian, was one of the few witnesses at the marriage. (\u201cThat guy over there, Red? He just shot his wife,\u201d Frank confided to Mia right before the ceremony.)\n* Mia Farrow broke up the marriage of Dory and Andre Previn.  In 1969 Dory Previn discovered that Farrow had become pregnant by her husband, which led to their separation. Andrea Previn then divorced Dory Langan during her hospitalization for a mental breakdown, where she was being treated with electroconvulsive therapy.\n* Dory and Andre made music for both Frank Sinatra and Valley of the Dolls. Valley of the Dolls starred Sharon Tate (who was later murdered by Charles Manson).\n* Sharon Tate married Roman Polanski (who raped a 13 year old at Jack Nicholson\u2019s Bel Air house).\n* Roman Polanski directed Rosemary\u2019s Baby, which starred Mia Farrow.\n* Rosemary\u2019s Baby is what broke up Mia Farrow and Frank Sinatra\u2019s marriage, and shot Mia to stardom after Sharon Tate had previously out-shined her.\n\nThere's so much more!

            "Webcomics, there's a ton out there of every genre you could be into. Personally, fantasy is my favourite genre but I've found a ton of comics of many genres to enjoy. \n\nI personally read uh, I assume, over 100 ongoing webcomics on multiple websites and platforms ?\n\nWebtoons (App+Browser) is a great collection of comics which are all free to read, unless you want to pay to read a few episodes ahead, which will be released in a week's time each, which I don't do because there's plenty of content from daily \"Originals\" updates + Canvas which is the more free model (no time limit once a week) for artists.\n\nA few favourites from there:\n\nOriginals:\n\nThe Weight Of Our Sky, a historical fiction about a Malay girl, Melati, with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. This is set during the time of the race riots in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 1969. (These riots ended up in deaths of many hundred because of stupid racism.) I am personally really glad to know there is a webcomic with a realistic portrayal of OCD out there as I suffer from severe OCD (although a quite different type, contamination OCD). This comic is based on the novel of the same name which I am hoping to pick up some day soon.\n\n[Link to The Weight Of Our Sky](https://www.webtoons.com/en/historical/the-weight-of-our-sky/list?title_no=1739)\n\nTower Of God is an ongoing comic that has been going on quite a while about a well built fantasy universe who's inhabitants all supposedly live within a enormously large and tall tower. Within it live a large amount of different races, however, one boy is found very abnormal... A boy who came from outside of the tower with very great potential. This is such a well done and complex series that I've taken weeks to reread it twice, or thrice ?  Can't remember if it was 2 or 3 times lol\n\n[Link to Tower Of God](https://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/tower-of-god/list?title_no=95)\n\nSpirit Fingers, a slice-of-life/drama webtoon about an average south korean teen, Amy Song, who finds herself a love of art and a great group of friends when she joins a colourful group of strangers in their sketching/croquis club. \n\nAs Baby Blue Finger, or Babl, Amy learns to grow from her experiences and find her own colour.\n\n[Link to Spirit Fingers](https://www.webtoons.com/en/drama/spirit-fingers/list?title_no=1577)\n\n\n\ncoLouR* (Canvas)\n\nA supernatural/dark fantasy with psychological/cultural elements as well about an international organization that works closely with the supernatural, Asterisk. I find this international modern fantasy organization idea which even includes many different languages really interesting.\n\n[Link to coLouR*](https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/colour/list?title_no=384015)\n\n \nTapas/Tapastic (also app+web) has more paid stuff sadly but some of which can be read freely on timers + as well a similar model of many free to read comics that are not \"originals\", basically paid. Of course, I don't think it's bad to support artists, the money goes straight to them and all but I personally prefer saving my money in general, especially as they have free comic book days unlocking temporarily premium comics and such.\n\nOut Of The Blue on tapas is one of my favourites there, about fishboy stuck in dam meets blindboy dam worker.\n\nhttps://tapas.io/series/OutoftheBlue\n\nThe Witch's Bakery is a very cozy fantasy comic about Granny Snap's bakery, which she runs with her grandchildren, Dragon Snap and Ginger Snap.\n\nhttps://tapas.io/series/The-Witchs-Bakery\n\nUltramarine Weather\n\nTwo childhood friends meet a weather witch who lost his memories.\n\nhttps://tapas.io/series/ultramarineweather\n\nHiveworkscomics.com (Website only) is a great collection of online comics that was created by the longtime comic creators of the comic Namesake.\n\nhttps://www.howtobeawerewolf.com/ is about Mal, a   werewolf who was bitten by a wolf as a kid and then become one. However, one day she actually meets another friendly werewolf, who sniffs her wolfyness after visiting the cafe she works at.\n\n\nwildelifecomic.com\n\nOscar rented an old house off craigslist,\u00a0then things got weird...\n\nFirst it was meeting the ghost of a 1940s mathematician in the upstairs hallway, then it was\u00a0finding a\u00a0teenage werewolf in the bathtub. Now Oscar doesn't know what will show up next. Maybe that's okay, as long as nothing eats him.\n\nWilde Life is a supernatural adventure/horror series set in a small town in rural Oklahoma. It focuses on stories about\u00a0creatures from Native American mythology as witnessed and documented by a journalist from Chicago, Illinois.\n\n\nIndependent comics:\n\nMiss-Melee.com \n\nSuperhero comedy about a hero and mother who got back to superheroing after raising her kid some... however her daughter's taken a lot after her.\n\nAva's Demon (Also up on Webtoons Canvas, but I reccomend the website for the full experience, with all animations and animated backgrounds)\n\nA gorgeous Sci-Fi/Fantasy adventure about, well, Ava and her demon who is literally inside of her. As she meets other vessels, and forms a pact with her demon after an incident... well... things change for her a lot. Including glowing skin and barfing lava.\n\nAvasdemon.com\n\nColorless\n\nhttps://www.colorlesscomic.com/\n\nSimilarly to Ava's Demon, this comic also uses animated scenes.\n\nColorless\u00a0is a dark fantasy webcomic that follows the story of Joki, who wakes up in a supernatural city called Aisho, with no memories of previous events. He learns about the creatures lurking Aisho city's streets and just how unwelcome humans are.\u00a0\n\n**Ok since I have now taken like a hour to write this I better get uppp**\n\nAnyways, if anyone would like any other suggestions, I know these are mostly fantasy but I read many others including different topics too, feel free to ask for other recommendations!",

Tired of the mediocre milfs and subpar stepsisters, I na\u00efvely clicked on the banners. Yes, it was intended for a more male audience, but did I care? Nay. The screen was enticing to say the least. Busty women, flat chested women, women of all races and backgrounds, and even a few celebrity chicks and fictional women I was into were all getting smashed or engaging in splendid sex. Alas, I made the foolish choice to proceed into this dangerous web of lies. The appeal of being able to customize a sexual scenario sucked me in. Being able to choose my partner, gender, and style of sex was undeniably appealing. I mindlessly clicked through question after question, determined to play the \"#1 free sex simulator ever.\" Unfortunately, I arrived at the screen of doom... The screen which required age verification. I began my quest to enter this forbidden domain, looking for many accounts and fake credit cards. After many failed attempts, I finally made a bold move, swiping my father's credit card and subscribing to the service.\u00a0\n\nUpon entrance to this supposedly \u201c#1\u201d website to finally claim the virtual coochie I longed for, I made a horrific discovery. I was on some bizarre website that I don't remember the name of. Were there any beautiful women awaiting me? Nay. Was this a professionally made website with cutting edge graphics and gameplay? Nay. Instead, there were horrendous knockoffs of Candy Crush or games such as Solitaire. These games were of the same quality as the shitty mobile games that you see in those adverts on Instagram. Desperately, I searched through game after game, hoping to find the game that \u201cI wouldn\u2019t last 5 minutes playing.\u201d Unfortunately, the truth sunk in and I was left devastated. This strange company had my father\u2019s credit card, and worse, it wasn\u2019t even free...

            "A lot of people have commented that it's either a scam, or for a totally unrelated product. People seem confused by the actual product. Why would they do that? So I can explain if anyone is interested.\n\n**TL;DR: Porn sites generally have cheaper traffic, so it favors those who are incentivized to get traffic only and not conversions. This may be a legitimate app developer trying to illegitimately inflate their download count. It may also be a site owner or marketing company trying to show real human web traffic. If you're ever buying a website or paying a marketing company, never focus exclusively on traffic.**\n\nI worked in marketing and had some app developers. Most of the app stores heavily favor apps that have been downloaded more. So in order to get organic traffic and show up in a search, they needed to seed downloads. Buying paid search traffic for something like 'conferencing app' or 'base building game' is a good way to get relevant traffic, and they may be doing that as well, but to inflate app download numbers you just need the cheapest traffic possible. Because large brands with lots of money tend to avoid porn sites, and because no one goes to porn sites to buy products, the traffic is cheaper. Even if conversion is 5x lower, that's worth it if it's 10x cheaper.\n\nThis is why that Evony game had big tit ads everywhere maybe 5 years back. They were technically SFW, so you would see these scantily armored women with enormous boobs wherever they could buy the cheapest display ads. It wasn't about finding the right audience or retention. It was entirely about being number one or two in the app store for this category of game. You see this less on non porn sites now because as the market has consolidated the major players and display have attempted to align user intent and push down ads with low relevance scores (every platform calls it something different, same idea.)\n\nThere are a few other scenarios where sites may want cheap porn site traffic. Sometimes there's a crooked site owner who wants to show an increase in traffic that can be verified externally. In other cases it's a corrupt marketing company trying to show that they're sending traffic that is human. Oftentimes traffic is sent through a redirect on a nonsense domain to mask the actual source.",

            "Not a father, but I have a wholesome story of my own dad. I was born very early, at only four pounds. On top of that, or possibly as a result, I have a fragile immune system, especially so when I was young, and up until a few years ago, I got seriously sick (fever, vomiting, sore throat, the whole shebang) five times or more a year. I would become so dehydrated from vomiting or get such a high fever that at times, I had to be brought into the emergency room. As a result, I drank exclusively pedialite to counter that when sick, and I developed a serious distaste and hate for the stuff. \n\nMy dad was responsible for bathing me one night to help me cool down, I must have been six or seven at the oldest. We were on a vacation, and even as and adult, I always get really sick during or after traveling, and I had inconveniently gotten sick while we were staying in a hotel. I'd had a high fever, and my body was so sore and tired I'd slept for 24 hours, no one could wake me up, and I hadn't drank anything in that time. So my dad put in front of me a very big glass of pedialite and told me I had to finish the whole thing while I sat in the bath. I took it as obediently as I could, but a fourth of the way in, I just felt so miserable and mad that I started sobbing. \n\nMy dad had this heartbreaking look on his face, and stroked my hair, near tears himself. It was late, and we were tired, so he wrapped me up in a towel, and put me in bed with he and mom. My dad drinks a lot of mountain dew, and he told me that for every three sips of pedialite I get down, I can have a sip of soda to help wash out the bad taste, but don't tell mom. I never did, and it's one of my favorite memories of me and my dad.",
            "While building the outdoor play set for my five year old, I drilled a screw completely through a board and into my shoe, barely stopping just as the screw broke skin. I swore right in front of him, something along the lines of \u201cMother-fucking fuck mother fucker.\u201d We are sworn to secrecy to this day.",
            "My dad has passed away so I\u2019ll tell this on his behalf:\n\nMy sister was maybe 10 or 11. My dad was very worried and had been waiting all day for us to come home from school. When we got home he pulled her aside saying he needed to have a serious talk with her. He said to her \u201cI was looking for a pencil, and found this in your desk\u201d and pulled out a plastic baggie filled with some dried plant material. She said, \u201coh, catnip?\u201d He thought it was pot. We would make little cat toys with catnip and the bag had ripped so she put it in a ziplock bag. He sighed a huge sigh of relief and laughed and told her he thought she was doing drugs and asked her not to tell our mom. He was so embarrassed!",

I ended up telling her that evening because it was just too funny and cute.",
            "Not a father but I was with my dad and we thought it was a good idea to start a small fire, on the porch, the wooden porch. It was made of mostly paper and we made sure to scatter the embers and everything but after we went inside and to bed, the wind must\u2019ve kicked up because we came outside the next day and there was a giant hole burned into the porch. My dad just told me,\u201dhey don\u2019t tell your mom, I\u2019ll get it fixed\u201d, he the proceeded to cover it with a small table.

            "Not a real \"don't tell your mother about this\" moment, but when I was little, my dad had a workshop in the garage where he'd do wood work.  I'd come out and talk to him while he worked, and he'd let me sit on the car that was parked in the garage.  He framed it as something that was so bad and edgy and we couldn't tell my mom, and I was five, so I believed it and felt so cool without actually doing anything wrong or dangerous.",
            "My dad, brother, and I went out to these dunes near where I live with bottle rockets. We each had an empty milk jug and each took like 20 bottle rockets for ammo. Then, we ran around launching bottle rockets at each other. I was the youngest, which made me the hardest to hit, so I won the rocket war. But yeah, mom never found out",
            "In my second year of college my best friend committed suicide. We were all pretty heartbroken, so my mum and dad drove up from the next province to be with me. My dad, being a great cook, decided he would cook my roommates/friends and I a nice dinner to bring everyone together during the bleak moment. My dad and I ended up getting completely shitfaced as one tends to do during heartbreaking times. \n\nHe got embarrassed at his drunken state, and snuck out the back door and jumped in a cab without saying good bye. I was upset he dissapeared like that, but he also still had the car keys I needed so I could drive my friends and I to the funeral the next day. I called him and asked him to get out of the cab, and that I would meet him at whatever street corner he was at, which he did. When I found him, he was sitting in the stoop of an apartment building puking and crying. I rolled up and together we staggered home drunk and crying arm in arm. \n\nWhen we got back to my apartment, he was still embarrassed, so he asked to sleep in the car. I said okay, grabbed him a blanket, Pringles and a Gatorade for midnight munchies. I go back inside and no sooner did I sit down did I get a text from him saying he was cold and wanted to come in. I went and got him from the car and he was covered in Pringle crumbs. Like. Covered. I dragged him up the sketchy spiral staircase to my apartment and the last thing he said before he went inside and to bed was \"god your stairs are like fuckin Hogwarts man. Please don't tell your mother. \" And he passed out. \n\nIt was the moment I saw my dad as a real person, not just my father. I think alot of fathers try to be strong and stoic for their kids during hard times, in an attempt to be stable for us. Sharing this heartbreaking moment with him just brought us closer together. I love my dad. \n\n\nMan cooks a mean Bavette steak",

            "One night when I was about 8, after I had gone to bed, my Dad was playing a Nintendo game, Legend of Zelda I think. We had both been playing it but we were stuck. He finally found a secret passage, paused the game, and came upstairs to wake me up. He told me he figured out where we were stuck, \"snuck\" me downstairs in a blanket (I'm sure my mom knew), and I got to stay up after midnight on a school night, hiding under a blanket, to see where the hidden passage went. It was a silly little incident, but very memorable.\n\nEdit: Wow! It's one of those \"blew up overnight\" situations. Thank you all for the awards and sharing your own versions of the story. I'm glad this warmed so many hearts!\n\nEdit 2: (don't read if you don't want the feelz ruined) A few asked about my relationship with my dad. We actually weren't that close, and still aren't, because... reasons. But this story stands out in my memory not just because it was awesome and wholesome, because it wasn't like him.\n\nEdit 3: As to the specifics of the game/secret passage, after some Googling, I can't find a Zelda related secret that matches my memory. I recall a path that is going east then turns south. To the right there's an ocean, and if you just keep going east instead of turning south, there's a hidden path where you can walk over the ocean. We played several similar games with that old top-down view. Could have been Dragon Warrior, Eight Eyes, or so many others. Maybe someone on here can figure it out!\n\nEdit 4: Thanks to the hive mind for figuring out it was Zelda 2, when you get the water boots and can walk over the water to get to the Ocean Palace. It's great to fill in the gaps of a nice childhood memory!",
            "It was my weekend with my 15yo son, we had divorced when he was 10. We were at a pool party BBQ at my friend's condo complex and I had brought a couple sodas for him. The dude cooking the chicken overcooked it and was dry, and another friend had pilfered one of the Dr. Peppers so my son needed something to drink, I suggested he go back to the condo and find something in the fridge.\n\nThen he pointed at the plastic pitcher with about a glass left of margarita, I said OK but don't tell your mom. I figured he would just take a mouthful to wash down the food but nope, he pounded the whole thing. I was like OK, well there wasn't that much in there so no biggie. \n\nI said \"damn dude didn't think you were gonna chug the whole thing!\" He was like \"what, is there alcohol in it?\" I was like \"yeah duh it's a margarita\". He said \"but you guys used to make us kids margaritas when you had people over the house!\" I said \"yeah, virgin ones with just ice and the mixer in the blender, not the adult version with tequila in it!\" \n\nWell next thing you know he's super chatty, actually talking to all my friends like a normal outgoing person instead of his usual teenage introverted small talk. \n\nProblem was it was Sunday and I had to take him back to his mom's that evening. I was planning on getting bitched out about it, or she would find it hilarious, honestly it could have gone either way with her I could never predict how she would take it.\n\nLuckily she was out when we got there and I told him to just go to his room and take a nap, he already fell asleep in the car on the way there. She was none the wiser, I think some time later he eventually told her about it and she did find it funny after all.",

            "Not exactly because we were caught in the act but here we go. \n\nWhen I was ten years old I was in a head on car crash with my dad and my little brother. My dad ended up with two shattered feet and he was in a wheelchair after getting out if hospital. \n\nNow my dad did stereotypical dad things around the house before this happened and being stuck in a wheelchair was difficult for him. One day while my mum was out it was just the two of us in the house. Suddenly I'm being called by my dad to go grab the lawnmower and the strimmer. My dad had decided to cut the grass while in his wheelchair. \n\nSo ten year old me does as she's told and grabs what needs to be grabbed and plus everything in as told. I move what needs to be moved into the garden but there's one problem, dad can't get into the garden in his chair. The entrance is just too narrow.\n\nSo my father being the reckless and mischievous man that he is, comes up with a plan. He's going to lift himself up using the garden wall, I'm to collapse the chair and move it through and then reopen it so he can sit down. The pressure is on. Little ten year old me is ready to go. He gets himself up and we manage it in one try.\n\nAfter that cutting the grass together was fairly simple but by this point we'd attracted the attention of the neighbours. My neighbour from across the road was frantic when she saw what we were doing. Husbands from other households were joking my dad was making them look bad. \n\nThen, the jig was up. Mum was home. I didn't get into trouble exactly but mum never let us live  down\n\nEdit: spelling\n\nEdit: So this kinda blew up! Thank you for the awards! I'm gonna show my dad all the comments tomorrow. I'm sure he'll appreciate so much talk about his balls.\n\nTLDR; my wheelchair bound father made me an accomplice in his garden mowing escapades.",
            "One night I was enjoying a small bit of ice cream after my four year old daughter went to bed. She came downstairs and 'caught' me. So I offered her a small bite, but since she was supposed to be in bed, I said \"don't tell mom.\" She assured me she wouldn't. My wife wouldn't have cared anyway but it was a fun little game to play.\n\nAfter she went up to bed and I was down on the couch, she snuck in to the master bedroom where mom was resting. She told mom that I had let her have some ice cream, and she was afraid of \"sugar bugs\" so could she please brush her teeth again.\n\nMy wife just laughed at me the next day. Little shit ratted me out to brush her teeth, something she doesn't like doing anyway.",
            "When my son was 6 I was playing Grand theft Auto late at night. He wakes up and comes to the living room, tells me he can\u2019t sleep, and asks can he watch me play. I say he can but not to tell his mom he agrees with a big smile. Maybe after about an hour he is playing and I\u2019m watching and helping him. He can\u2019t stop laughing driving into people and running from the cops. I was telling him to watch out for the 5-0 and he asks me what that means, so I tell him it\u2019s the cops, he just shrugs and keeps playing. Now fast forward about a week later and we are all driving in the car. All I hear is a scream of \u201cDad watch out it\u2019s the 5-0!\u201d And I absolutely start crying from laughing so hard all while his mother is questioning where he learned that.

            "My dad and I (around 5 years old) were on our way home from a car show when we were getting followed by the cops. My dad struggled to put on his seatbelt quickly in hopes he wouldn't get a ticket. Unfortunately, we got pulled over. This might have been the first time EVER that I saw a cop this close up let alone speak to one. I was a deer in headlights the whole time.\n\nWell, with a cop on either side of the car, the officer leaned in and asked my dad why he was swerving. That DICK told the cops I was tickling him. The cops looked at me straight in the eyes and asked if this was true. I was too scared to say anything and just nodded yes. The officers smiled and said, \"Never to do that again while your father is driving, ok?\" They left without any further words and my dad gave me the lecture of 'don't tell your mom.'\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr - Dad and I get pulled over when he tried to get his seatbelt on, blamed it on me tickling him instead.",
            "I'll speak for my dad here:\n\nHe had just gotten a really shitty motorcycle while we were visiting his parents at their farm in a semi-desert area. Note: He's never ridden a motorcycle before AND his youngest brother died in a motorcycle accident.\n\nI remember coming outside in the late afternoon and I saw my dad absolutely *covered* in scrapes, cuts, and bruises all over his body, but mostly on his legs that had been bare.\n\nI freaked out and he assured me he was fine and explained that he had ***fallen down a mountain nearby*** while on this motorcycle. \n\nI don't remember if the bike was salvageable, but I do remember him turning to me, puting on a very serious face, and saying:\n\n\"Absolutely do ***not*** tell your grandmother about this.\"\n\nEven at like 50, he was that scared of his mother.\n\n\nBonus story: I was at the beach with my dad since I was staying with him for the weekend (divorced parents). We went swimming in the ocean near this rock formation that jutted out of the sea no more than 100m of the shore line. We went in when it was high tide turning into low tide and we got swept out by a riptide that formed around the rock. \n\nMy dad told me he was too tired and old to swim out and was just going to let the current take him and hope it would spit him out. I, a young, strong swimmer, started swimming parallel to the shore for a good 15-20 min straight, according to my dad (felt like hours to me).\n\nI got out and started screaming for help and saying that my dad was still stuck in the ocean. No one could see him and I was so scared he had drowned. Then someone said, \"Is that him over there?\" and pointed about 200m down the beach. Sure enough, there was my dad walking towards us in his lumo green swim trunks. I ran to him and we met in the middle and feircely hugged because we had both thought we had lost the other for ever.\n\nAs we were packing up to leave shortly after, I looked at him and asked, \"I don't have to tell Mama about this, do I?\" And he snorted in a \"Oh dear God no\" manner and said: \"*Please* do not tell your mother about this\"\n\nConsidering I've almost drowned 3 times under and broke my collarbone under my father's care, I can understand his desire to keep this under wraps too",
            "When l was 12 or so I walked into my dad's office to find him counting money. He says don't tell mom and you'll find out what its for. So I don't say a thing. Two days later he wakes me up early to run errands with him. We came back with a new (used, but new for us) car. He also said if I don't tell how much he spent on it he'll let me drive it. It was only a couple hundred dollars but we were broke and she would have been mad. My mother tried so hard to find out but I kept the secret. So anytime we were in an open space like an empty lot he would let me drive it. I felt like the coolest kid in middle school knowing how to drive a car. Again, don't tell your mother he says. It was our secret thing and I'll cherish those memories forever. When I got my permit at 16 I was so excited to drive it for real. I ask my mother if I can drive her around when she has to go out but she says absolutely not since I have no experience. Well I can't argue because I don't wanna get Dad in trouble. This goes on for a few weeks, I keep asking she keeps telling me no. This finally happened one day while dad was home and overheard. He comes in the room gives me a nod and says to my mother 'she's a better driver than you anyway',  tosses me the keys and tells mom everything. I was so stoked and cheering I can drive! I can drive! Dad says 'Drive it? No. If you can keep a secret for that long you can keep the car too.'  Twenty years later its still one of my favorite memories.\n\nEdit: Wow. I love you guys. This memory made me so happy while sharing and even happier to see all of your responses.\n\nTo answer some questions;\n\nIt was a 95 Geo Tracker \n\nMy mom was expecting me to get driving experience taking a driver's ed course I was signed up to attend a few weeks down the line.\n\nMom was not mad. She was surprised is all. We didn't keep it from her because of her expected reaction, I suppose it was just more fun to have a secret between only us. \n\nMy dad absolutely is an awesome dude. I am so very lucky to have had him and to still have him. \n\nThe greatest gifts he gave me were not material. It was his time and attention. I have so many amazing memories with him just doing regular stuff. He has the best sense of humor and is a genuinely good human. I strive to be like him as a parent and as a person.",
            "I was having a good heart to heart with my step dad as a teen. We were chilling in the Shop where he does most of his odd job work, and by the end of our conversation he pulls out his bong and asks \"Wanna keep going? But don't tell your mom she will throw my ass through a window\" Ironically enough the way they met was at a bar and my step dad was hitting on her and she said she could throw him across the bar, he dared her, so she did.

            "When we were kids my dad took me and my sister out on a bike ride. My sister had her own bike while I was sat in the kiddie seat on his. At some point we come to a stop, and I guess my sister was still a little unsteady on her bike because she started wobbling. In a bid to help, my dad leaned over to steady her, so much so that I flipped right out of the seat (in true 90s fashion there was only the single buckle to keep me in) and landed right onto asphalt.\n\nI was fine except for the deep scrapes right across my face and abdomen. It was completely an accident but my dad panicked and told both of us \u201coh god don\u2019t tell mom\u201d and ushered us home to patch me up. \n\nHe caught some hell from mom because he couldn\u2019t hide a face injury especially when it started scabbing over into an ugly mess but he impressively managed to conceal the rest by volunteering to be the one to bathe me and put me to bed every night.

It took a lot for me to not laugh in his face. I was proud of him for doing a pretty good job of cleaning the mess.

            "Not a father, but the son.\n\nOne time when I was younger, my dad took me to the zoo while my mom was visiting with my grandparents (so her parents). I had a nasty habit of climbing on anything that looked like it could support a kid's weight - the living room couches and entertainment center, trees, cars, the roof of our house, etc. - how I never got hurt was either a miracle or sheer dumb luck depending on who you ask. Anyway, I was up to my usual bullshit when we were at the zoo, walking along the retaining walls of the animal enclosures, and this was well before rational reasoning skills set in and I could have known that these were dangerous animals that would have killed my 7 year old ass without even thinking about it. To me, they were just the cool animals I saw on the Discovery Channel or in cartoons. Naturally it was only a matter of time before I fell into an animal enclosure and my dad looked back to see where I had wandered off to. Around that time he hears some woman scream \"oh my god, there's a kid in the bear pit!\". At least he knew where I was lmao\n\nMuch like the kid that fell in Harambe's pit, I had fallen into a pit of water that I later learned was slightly separated from the bears, but bears being curious animals, they noticed my presence and decided to wander over to check me out. I remember being upset that I was all wet for about five seconds before starting to splash around and then seeing about two or three black bears slowly walking over to me and sniffing me out. Keep in mind that I lived (and still do live) in central Texas, so there's no bears around for miles; the idea of making yourself seem bigger or fighting back was about as foreign to my young brain as translating the Iliad from its original Greek at the time. Thankfully by this time my dad had alerted the zoo staff and from what I was told when I got older and asked about it, a couple of workers distracted the bears with food while another worker grabbed me and got me the hell out of there and back to my dad. From what I was told, a small crowd had gathered by this point, but thankfully this was before cellphones with cameras were a thing, so I didn't get ripped on by my classmates whenever I went back to school for being a dumbass because they saw me on LiveLeak or whatever.\n\nAfter my dad got a hold of me, dried me off, and read me the riot act, he bought me a bag of cotton candy I had asked for since we didn't get to see the rest of the zoo that day and told me he'd only get it if I promised not to tell mom about the ordeal. I agreed since I wanted the cotton candy, and I think he told my mom that I'd fallen into an artificial pond or something. Of course mom found out later anyway, but it's something we all laugh about now since we all kinda share a quirky, sometimes dark sense of humor, so I don't hold anything against him. It was my own damn fault after all.\n\nTL;DR fell in an animal enclosure at the zoo before it was cool",

When we got to the hospital he told me to call him when I was done faking it. \n\nAbout 45mins later I called to tell him I had an apendicitis, I was going to need surgery and if he didn't want me to tell my mom he'd better come back. The only words out of his mouth were \"I'm on my way and you better not tell her I left.\" She ended up calling me 10 minutes later, my dad claimed left to go get me something I forgot at home, and that's why he wasn't with me. And she still made it to the hospital before he did.",
            "Speaking as the son: my dad and I weren't so close in my youth, but we did both enjoy the theater, both movie and live. *Team America: World Police* had just come out in theaters. My dad decided one morning to take me to the movies. IIRC there was some other action flick in theaters, and that was the movie he suggested. I was down for it, and my mom of course saw no issue (she would have taken great issue with him taking me to see something like *Team America*). We got to the theater and instead of going to see that action movie, we saw *Team America*. It's not a humor high on either our lists, but we enjoyed it on that shared sophomoric level men share with their teenaged sons.\n\nAs we were getting back to the car, he tuned to me and said, \"So, what movie did we see?\"\n\nBeing quick on the uptake, I answered with the other movie. Mom was none the wiser.",
            "This was my dad and not a funny story but made me realize my dad did love me.\n\nMy step mom had started to charge me rent when I turned 18. I accepted as it meant I didn't have to do as much chores and can for the most part be left alone. It was about $200 a month. At the time I was making $9/h which was slightly above minimum wage for my state. I was miserable at the time so I saved up to get a refurbished xbox one to play games and I asked my dad if I could just use the small tv in the guest bedroom in my room. This was a tv NO ONE used. He said he will think about (which meant he had to ask the overlord). \n\nA couple days later he said that I can but she wanted to add $25 a month to my \"rent\" to use it. I broke down. I told him that I was saving up to try and leave and she is the reason my sister left. He then said it's okay, you *are* paying rent. He didn't make me pay the extra 25 and it turned out that he saved the money I paid for rent and gave it to me for my deposit on my 1st apartment. It was a \"we won't tell your step-mother about this\" and made our relationship a little bit better.\n\nIt's not a grand or funny story but I resented him up until that moment and he started to defend me more in arguments against her after my sister left. Also they are now divorced so small win.",
            "My dad is a huge watch enthusiast, and one of his favorites brands is Panerai.\n\nOne day, he took me to a Torneau AD so he can have his watch fixed. While in there, I picked up the words \"appraise\" and \"installments\" and I immediately knew he was going to buy something big.\n\nHe actually got into debt over watches and it got so bad, they'd fight over it and almost got a divorce. So I went up to him and asked, \"Dad, are you buying another watch?\" He just got real silent, and even the salesperson sort of backed away.\n\nHe started pleading with me not to tell mom about it. If I didn't, he'd buy me an Xbox 360, along with 3 new games of my choice. And so we did! It was an awkward drive home. \n\nAbout a week later, he went into my room with tears flowing down his cheeks. That was when I found out he also skimmed my college savings for his watch buying. But even knowing, I wasn't even mad. I just wanted him to stop wasting our money and just be happy with us. With that Panerai he just bought. I kept my promise, so long as he doesn't buy another one for 5 years. My mom to this day still doesn't know, he sold off most of his collection, still has the Panerai to this day, and payed off his credit cards and loans.\n\nHe still apologizes to me about it from time to time, including today. I'm just glad it's all behind us!",
            "My dad passed away when I was 11. My favorite memory like this one was when I was 8 and Signs just came out to dvd. My mom said I was too young to watch it, but I had an alien obsession thanks to my dad. He woke me up before school around 5:30am so we could watch it while my mom was still asleep before I left for school. I was soooo tired throughout all my classes, but it was still the best day ever. That movie was so creepy! We were both laughing and jumping the whole time. I have a huge tattoo of a UFO over the Signs crop circles to remember him by",
            "So, this story was about when my dad told me not to tell my mother about something:\n\nMy parents have always been huge exercise buffs, so there was never soda in the house when I was a kid growing up. Unfortunately, my dad had a drinking problem when I was younger, and would sometimes find ways to hide alcohol from my mother.\n\nOne day, to my absolute shock, there was a bottle of 7up in the basement fridge. Looking back on it now, just one bottle was pretty odd, but it being there at all was shocking enough for me. So I go into the living room where my dad has company, and I ask him if I can have some 7up. He\u2019s actually confused himself, but tells me, \u201cif you can find some!\u201d Cool!\n\nI go back to the fridge, grab the bottle, and take a drink. After just a little sip, I stopped. It didn\u2019t taste what I remember 7up tasting like. After some hesitation, I took another sip, just to see if I somehow, I don\u2019t know, tasted it wrong I guess? It tasted just as bad, so I put it back in the fridge.\n\nI went back to my dad, and told him that something was wrong with the 7up. Now he\u2019s suspicious. \u201cWhat 7up!?\u201d he asked, as he got up and made his way over to the fridge. He opened the fridge, and to his surprise, saw a 7up bottle sitting there. He grabbed it, opened it up, and smelled it. His eyes widened, as he told me, \u201cdon\u2019t tell your mother about this.\u201d\n\nWhile I didn\u2019t know the taste at the time, I now know it to be beer. Turned out he went to the bar, ordered beers and a bottle of soda, dumped the soda, and ordered another beer for the road, but asked them to put it into the soda bottle for him (he knew all of the bartenders). This was so my mom wouldn\u2019t see the beer in the fridge, and the soda, though unhealthy, could be explained much easier. He forgot that they filled the bottle with beer, and he also forgot what soda bottle he got (he doesn\u2019t drink soda), until I drank some of it. Oops!\n\nEdit: typos",

            "Years ago, when my daughter was 1 or 2, we were on a road trip.  We stopped at McDonalds, got food, and continued on.  My daughter had never eaten french fries at that point.  My wife gave her a small size bag of french fries to nom on.  She happily sat in the back seat, in her car seat, munching away.\n\nSuddenly my wife was in a panic, saying that our daughter was choking on french fries, which makes complete sense in hindsight.  We should never have assumed she'd just *know* how to eat fries when she was still learning how to eat everything else.  My wife leaped into the back seat.  I assumed as an EMT she could handle it *easily.*  What I didn't anticipate was the panic.  She shrieked and freaked out, and couldn't solve the problem.\n\nSo I pulled over.  I got out of the driver's seat, walked to the back seat door, opened it, and sat down next to my daughter.  There were tears in her eyes, and she was looking at me for help.  That kind of broke my heart.  She knew she was in trouble.  So, I handled it like I was unplugging the rain gutters.  I literally tilted her head back, looked down her throat, saw a pile of fries, shoved my hand in, and pulled them free.\n\nShe immediately began to breathe, and everything was fine.   Except it wasn't.  My wife sat opposite of me, just staring at me in disbelief.  For the next few hours of our road trip, I had to endure her lecturing me and ranting to me about how putting your fingers in someone's throat will almost always shove the blockage deeper.  I understood what she was saying was true.  I also understood that I could literally see the potatoes in our daughter's throat, and easily yanked them up.  That's the nice thing about fries -- they're long, like little handles perfect for grabbing.\n\nIn the end, my daughter lived, so I was fine with what I did and happily endured the hours-long lecture afterward.  None of this is the \"don't tell your mom\" story.  But here it comes.\n\nIt was now a month or two (or three) after that incident.  We were having dinner with friends.  Our daughter sat in a high chair at one end of the table, with me to her side.  Everyone else around the table was happily chatting.  They were talking about board games and what we should play after dinner, and it was nice.  I was not looking at my daughter.  I was watching everyone else, as we discussed games.  In fact, no one was looking at my daughter.  And then I felt her little hand on my arm.  I looked over at her, and she had tears streaming down her face.  Her mouth was open, no sound coming out.\n\nI have to tell you how *stunned* I was when my little girl reached over, grabbed my hand, picked a finger, and put it into her throat.  I had no idea that children could understand or even remember significant details like \"I was choking and my father used his hand to un-choke me\" at that age.  I had cleared her throat literally over a month prior.  I didn't think kids had any \"object permanence\" or memory like that.  But I was wrong, at least in this case.  Maybe trauma burned the memory into her mind.  I don't know.\n\nIn any case, I looked at her with my hand in her mouth and realized she was in trouble again.  I tilted her head back, looked down her throat, and saw an almost completely unchewed mini-muffin or something like that.  It wasn't even that far down.  I looked over at my wife, because I was about to do something that would infuriate her.  She was happily chatting about games, still.  She wasn't looking.  I plunged my fingers down my daughter's throat, pulled out the muffin, and then once she was breathing again I whispered to her, \"We never tell your mom about this.\"\n\nI gave her a kiss and held her hand for a little while as everyone else debated whether to play Rummikub or Ligretto.  No one even looked.  No one saw.",

So naturally when I started playing he wanted to show off and teach some of his tricks.\n\n\n\nWe were playing in the backyard and he wanted to show me how to make a good cross with decent curving. He placed a garbage bin on the opposite end and told me he was gonna place the ball there with a single hit. Naturally I was excited but the first time he tried he actually kicked it so high that it broke my mother's office room (she's a writer so keeping her place organized and without too much wind/sunshine was one the most important things for her). Dad took me to eat some delicious milk-shake and told me that if my mom asks about the window I should say it was a bird and that we took it to a vet so mommy wouldn't get angry. Obviously he said \"don't tell your mom about the milk-shake either\".\n\n\n\n\nAt first my dad told his version and my mom kinda believed it since we lived near a park and there were a lot of birds near the house. One weekend my mom asks me if I don't wanna learn about handball with her in the backyard but I tell her I don't want to play with balls there because I don't want to break anymore windows. Oh boy that was a big fight all week later on, then my parents sat me down and told me that I should take responsibility for things that I did even if it they can make someone angry or sad.

There\u2019s this metal bar that goes across behind the driver and passenger seats at about head height, and he tells me I can only ride in the back if I stand and hold on to the bar. I\u2019m about 5 or 6 at the time, so the bar is roughly at chin level for me standing up in the back. \n\nOn the VERY short trip, something happens and my dad has to slam the brakes. I\u2019m being good and standing in the back, holding the bar, but when he slams the brakes I also slam full force, face first in to the metal bar. \nDad pulls over panicking that he broke my nose and my mum\u2019s gonna kill him. He realises I\u2019m ok but just shaken up, so he spends a little time consoling me (and presumably also himself) and making sure I know never to tell mum about this, before we head back off to school. He drops me off, i\u2019m cool - Crisis averted. \n\nExcept that as the day goes on, I start to develop two very black eyes. \n\nMy teachers notice and pull me aside and ask me what happened.

They had been dating a few month's and we didn't really know him that well. It was movie night and my mom invited him over. He offered to do the store run for us, so my mom gave him the only cash she had, a $100 bill. \nAbout 45mins later my step-dad returns....with a car load of junk. Im talking Pinwheels, Fudge rounds, oreos, chips, popcorn, class jars of chocolate, strawberry, and regular milk,  sour patch kids, marshmallows, twislers...EVERYTHING a kid could ask for. My mom was FURIOUS. I've never seen a man look so confused, a mom so angry, and children so excited. As 3 defensive naturally skeptical of anyone who wants our mom, we accepted him that day.

My sister put her foot under it to save my head from getting cracked open and she sprained her ankle.

            "Speaking for my deceased father.\n\nOnce we were home alone together while my mom was at work and we had only one thing to do: the dishes. Wasn\u2019t much, so we absolutely dicked around all day. Played laser tag inside the house cause why fuckin not. At the end of the day we have set aside 2 hours to do the dishes, but when we checked under the sink there were zero dishwashing detergents. We were supposed to buy some.\n\nGonna pause real quick and say that my dad was a big stoner. You\u2019ll understand why that\u2019s relevant very shortly.\n\nMy dad, being his own unique brand of genius, decided there was no difference between dish washing detergent and washing machine detergent (for clothes) and me, being a dumbass nine-year-old, immediately agreed and we set about our task. Hour and a half left.\n\nFifteen minutes later I walk into the kitchen for a snack and I see the whole space (it was a very small kitchen), from floor to countertop, was filled with suds and bubbles. I yell for my dad. He yells out \u201cFUCK!\u201d and we scramble. We erased all evidence of the fuck up and left the dishes out to dry. \n\nAfter everything was put away, my dad asks me to check the time. Mom should be home in 10 minutes. He looks at me in utter disbelief. True shock. He says, \u201cMy god. We did it. You. Cannot. Tell. Your mother. About this.\u201d This was my dad so our word was our bond. Its been 23 years and my mom (sitting across from me reading something on her ipad) still doesn\u2019t know that happened. The man took that secret to the grave. Now I really can\u2019t tell her. Cheers, dad. Firing up the bong in his honor today.",

            "There was a hill at the end of our road, the bottom of the hill had a stop sign at a T intersection.  I was driving my wife\u2019s RWD Mercedes in the winter with the kids in the back.  The hill seemed to be the only thing they never plowed or salted.  I put on the brakes well before we reached the crest but the car didn\u2019t stop. i was able to keep it sliding slowly but couldn\u2019t regain control.  There is a driveway about halfway down the hill with a large tree at the end of it.  They had a pile of brush in front of it so i slid the front of her car straight into it going no more than 5 MPH.  I got out to check for damage and basically just had to straighten the license plate.

            "I feed crows.\n\nI buy unsalted peanuts in the shell and toss them as I walk my dogs or wait for the bus. I have about 4 murders now who recognize me, plus random crows at different locations. The ones by the lake feed from my hand and almost let me touch them.\n\nAfter about a year of doing it, I got my first gift a few weeks ago. It was a walnut shell.\n\n**Edit:** Thank you for the silver! \n\nThis is now my highest upvoted comment, which is kind of funny because I mentioned this a year ago, talking about the [Lake Crows](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/8hx9jb/what_is_something_you_do_alone_for_fun_that_99_of/dyob77c/). Since that post, babies happened! The babies are crows, but all they do is tag along with the older crows and scream at them until they are given peanuts. They're skittish of me.\n\n**Edit 2:** Oh boy, thanks for all the shiny things. I'll try to answer some questions here. *I AM NOT AN EXPERT!*\n\n1) *You're living my dream/how do I begin?:* Live your own dream! Find a good place you enjoy spending time in, a public park or something, make sure there are crows, and just start tossing your treat. Unsalted, lightly roasted in-shell peanuts are the best peanut option. Unroasted carries a chance of disease or bacteria or something that's harmful to crows.\n\n* Low/no salt treats. Low phosphorous cat kibble is apparently a nice well-rounded snack. Fruits and veggies but not apples. Fish is good, too, but impractical. Basically use your common sense.\n\n* Crows like flat feeders, so like a screen with a frame set horizontally, lightly lifted off the ground. If you want to keep squirrels or other things away, apparently cayenne pepper is good for this. Birds don't have the receptors for capsaicin (The thing that makes peppers hot), which is why birds are the main 'planters' of peppers. Oils and grease can get in animals fur and feathers and cause trouble.\n\n* Toss the treat toward them, watch out of the corner of your eye, don't stare. They'll be cautious at first and it takes a lot of patience. Gradually they should start to trust you and come closer. Having a set schedule helps, too.\n\n2) *Pictures please!* Sorry, I like to keep Reddit and the rest of my internet presence separate and I already have some pictures on my Instagram. Due to nature or God playing a very cruel joke I'm a very distinct individual who is hard to forget. But, then again, this is the biggest effect I've ever had on the internet so what do I know?\n\n3) *Don't feed animals!* You're not wrong. We don't want animals to become dependent on us or lose their weariness of us. And we don't want them to become pests, or lose their self-sufficiency. My crows are often seen grabbing worms from yards or fish from the lake so I'm not worried about mine in particular. Crows aren't bears or raccoons or coyotes, all of which I have in my area. I do not fuck with those and I never will.\n\n4) *I always wanted a pet crow!* That's [illigal](https://www.fws.gov/laws/lawsdigest/migtrea.html). Birds are protected If you find a wounded animal, call your local Wildlife Rescue. Nature belongs outside, no matter how good your intentions are.",
            "Shrimpkeeping. As in, keeping freshwater shrimp in an aquarium. You can go get a cheap, plastic, 3-5 gallon aquarium from amazon. Put in a small sponge filter with a pump, pick out some decor/plants, and buy some neocaridina shrimp. They are small, easy to care for (only really require topping off their water and maybe an algae wafer once every few weeks.) and you get to watch them jump and swim all over the tank. Even better, you'll get to watch the females carry around and then hatch lil baby shrimp to add to your colony.\n\nYou could get like a 3-5 gallon tank with a cool color-changing LED light and keep it next to your bed so you can watch it when you're really stressed out, too.\n\nedit: I wish my colonies were huge so I could send all of you that are now interested in the hobby some shrimp!

I just sat there and watched them.\n\nThey are small creatures, but it is awe-inspiring to see them gliding around under the surface. They're delicate and drab, but have a mystical, prehistoric aura about them.\n\nI stayed in the grass for an hour or so and thought about how privileged I was to see into their world.\n\nI realized that generations of these amphibians have been living and breeding in this pond since before I was born.\n\nSo many crazy things have happened in the world, but the salamanders only have to worry about eating and not being eaten. They're swimming around in the muddy water, not caring about politics or religion or war or the economy. Nothing has changed for them.\n\nI got back in the car and drove home feeling refreshed.\n\nBefore bed, I listened to some relaxing music and wondered what the salamanders were doing back at the pond, now swimming under a starry sky.\n\nMy current career and living situation have almost pushed me to the brink of suicide, but I am finding ways to hold on.\n\nLast weekend, some salamanders saved me. Next weekend, it might be a duck, or a pretty flower, or a massive old oak tree, or a tiny moth.\n\nIn nature, there is always something to save me.",

            "I'm deaf and it helps.\n\nI haven't heard a dog bark but I understand why a dog barks and combine that with the body language of a dog and the scene makes more sense",
            "Yes, they help. Movies, tv shows, games, etc use sound to convey emotions or danger or information and so on. By not subtitling those, Deaf people miss out on a lot. \n\nI was playing the Fable franchise recently, and apparently there's gargoyles in the game that insult you and goad you into shooting them or something. I would have never known if I hadn't read about it, because those insults aren't subtitled. I didn't even know gargoyles were a thing until i was nearly done with Fable 2. \n\nTo answer your question, I don't imagine them as sounds, that's impossible to do. I imagine the emotions they were meant to convey. \\[Dogs barking\\] means there's something disturbing them. \\[Tense music\\] means shit is getting real. Other things like \\[Phone rings\\] tells us what noise the people in the scene are responding to. \n\nSubtitling everything 100% helps.",
            "I\u2019m Deaf.  It definitely brings the story to life.  Deaf people are incredibly visual: we want as much information as possible.  If the story teller is insisting on certain sounds or music to evoke feelings, then I would also like to know and have those feelings, too.\n\nedit: holy moly the conversations y\u2019all are having under this are amazing",
            "I\u2019m deaf and it helps in certain contexts. If it\u2019s just a shot of a farm and it says dog barking it\u2019s out of context so it\u2019s like whatever. But if it says dog barking to warn the person it definitely helps in that context. It also depends on how good the subtitles are. Netflix is superb at doing subtitles but cable tv is that good so by the time the subtitles come up it\u2019s already a different scene or different convo.",

            "I used to work in subtitling and both my parents are completely deaf so I know a bit about this. Subtitles like dog barking do help as they are usually included if they are plot relevant, hence they can follow it better, and understand why someone looked up from their book in the show or whatever. \u201cTense music\u201d and the like does not really help much beyond telling them the mood of the scene, as they have no real conception of what sound is, which answers your second question. My mum compares it to trying to explain colour to a blind person.",
            "I'm moderately hearing impaired, but not deaf, so this doesn't *quite* answer your question but I thought I'd chime in. I really appreciate these kinds of subtitles, as they can add context and help communicate something non-visual that the show or movie creator wanted the audience to pick up on. The sound of a dog barking may be the only hint they give that a family owns a dog (which becomes a plot point later); tense music can prime the audience (me) to be on edge despite a scene otherwise seeming calm and relaxed. \n\nMad respect to whoever's in charge of Netflix's subtitles, because they are absolutely top notch.",
            "Deaf person here. These types of subtitles help set the mood and provide some sort of foreshadowing to events that might occur. For example, when watching a horror movie, a hearing person might leave as a cue once they hear eerie music. As a Deaf person who\u2019s not a huge fan of horror movies, I cannot tell you how many times I\u2019m so grateful for subtitles like that. Think of it like constant jump scares :)",

            "Not born deaf, but am hard of hearing and interacted with enough deaf people to at least give a response to both questions that I can't find anywhere on the comments.\n\n  \n\n\\- Subtittles relating to sounds like \"dog barking\", \"door slam\" are (at least for the folks I know and myself), help us understand a scene better, especially more so for a scene beyond the screen edges.  So like subtitles that shows \"dog barking\" but the screen shows a kid in the backyard in front of a fence, would just let us know that hey, there's probably a dog behind the fence or at least nearby somewhere.  Or say a horror movie with a girl on a bed, and suddenly jumps but the subtitle says \"door slams\", but we see no door but we understand that the girl was spooked/scared because she hear a door slam somewhere.\n\n  \n\n\\- What do you imagine them to be like? Again, this is for my own experience and the people I know but sounds that we have never heard of... if it's folks like myself who is not born deaf, but never heard of it either, for example, raised in an environment that just so happens to not have a dog present, we would just imagine a sound that we think would best fit based on what we currently know.  We could be spot on, or completely off.  Best example I can think of is.... youtube Mikhail from Drakenguard 3 and Smaug from the Hobbit. Both are dragons, but the voice is completely different.\n\n  \n\nHowever, when I asked the folks who were born 100% deaf, sound is more of a visual or the sense of vibration intensity.  But for what it actually sounds like, it was blank.  Like asking a person born blind to describe the color of the sky.  It's blank and ultimately meaning less.  Like before I ever heard what the trees rustling from the wind sounds like.  So when someone says \"oh the trees are whispering\", I would know that they're referring to the wind blowing through the trees but I have no idea what it actually sounds like.  When I did finally hear the noise, I still didn't know what it was even though I was looking at it till someone told me what it was.",
            "Even though Ive never known what the sound is like, atleast I can imagine some sort of sound that a dog would make. It still helps me understand what is going on in the movie.",

            "It may provide helpful context. Like if said noise is relavent to the plot even if they don\u2019t know what it sounds like, it may help with overall comprehension of the storyline to know that at this time a dog barked.",
            "Finally one I can answer! I was born deaf, but have a cochlear implant. This means with it on, I can hear perfectly fine. When it breaks, the subtitles do help. It makes me think the sound, as I have heard it.",
            "Hello redditors who are hearing impaired, Id like to ask how do jumpscares affect you? A big part of it is sudden loud noises that accompanies the scary imagery. Since you dont hear the building tense music nor the sudden loud one does that takeaway from you experiencing jumpscares?\n\nMany at home movie watchers will tell that the key to not being as scared is to turn down if not mute the volume of a scary movie when you know the jumpscare is coming.",
            "We understand basic sound principles. So it helps a lot, I spend a lot of my energy looking for visual cues in movies that are lazy because other people don't rely on them. Tell me ominous music is playing in the background because I can understand what that is and how that feels. I can't read lips in a movie all the time. They aren't looking at the screen, or it isn't dubbed correctly. \n\nIf you have not shown me a picture of a dog barking, and then a dog just barks in the background, how am I supposed to know why someone looked up or why it cut to a scene? They just look to the side with no explanation and body language changes. I get really upset having to rely on hearing people to watch shows sometimes or like I'm holding them back because I just can't understand.",
            "I\u2019m deaf, culturally and medically. A lot of deaf people actually have residual hearing and can hear loud noises, but even then, these subtitles help provide context for the scene so I think of course they help regardless of whether we have ever heard a single sound",
            "Deaf here. To help you understand how useful descriptive subtitles are for Deaf people in films, think about how authors describe sounds, visuals, and tone in what is being said between characters in a book. \n\nOr better yet, do an experiment yourself: watch an episode of something you\u2019ve never seen before with the sound off. Turn on subtitles. See how that helps you. Do comment here if you\u2019re hearing and completed this experiment!",
            "I am deaf and I treat TV and Movies like novels when it comes to subtitles, I see the effect the sounds have on the characters and it helps me to imagine it better. For example, if a woman on TV walks into a room and it says [ Music Playing, ] I can imagine her emotion when I try to see her reaction and I try to imagine what kind of music it is and if it's familiar to her or not and things like that. I became deaf when I was 4 years old, so I can't exactly remember music. But a small part of me by instinct sort of get a glimpse of it when I try to imagine it.",
            "i am Deaf in one ear and hearing impaired in the other. to me those subtitles are really cool, they work just fine.",
            "Don't know if anyone has asked this yet but if you are deaf, how did you respond to the movie \"A Quiet Place\"? I felt like while talking etc. was minimal some of the big tension moments were the outlier sounds in an otherwise very quiet world. Was it a movie you enjoyed? Was your reason for enjoying/not enjoying related to being deaf (vs. not liking the actors, or genre etc.)?",

            "[20th century fox intro](https://i.imgur.com/FmxMU6k.jpg)\n\nYes, this context helps give a better idea of the audio heard at that particular moment of the show. We don't need to actually know what it sounds like, but it cues us into what the mood is like or what's happening in the scene, like if a phone rings in the room, we know why the person stops to look at it or chose to ignore it.",
            "Slightly off-topic but my grandparents were both deaf, and my mother would often tell me how much they enjoyed watching actors like Jerry Lewis and Abbot and Costello, because they could always understand and enjoy what was going on regardless of subtitles. They lived in the golden age of physical comedy, I wish it would was appreciated the way it used to be. Jerry Lewis was an absolute legend.",
            "As others have mentioned, it provides context. Even something like \"ominous music\" - if you were watching a horror movie and hear (or read) ominous music, it builds tension.  Otherwise, you're just watching some dumbass take 5 excruciatingly boring minutes to go down the hall and open a door.  Or two people are looking into each other's eyes and \"romantic music\" starts playing.\n\nMy family has had the closed captioning turned on our tv's for a long time.  My dad had tinnitus that got worse as he got older, and also had chronic insomnia.  After a while, he wouldn't bother to turn the sound on when he watched tv.  Closed captioning meant he could watch at night without bothering anyone.  We all got used to it and kept turning on the closed captioning even after he died.  \n\nI have an auditory processing disorder that makes it hard to understand what people are saying if there's background or ambient noise, so the music on a program or just a noisy car driving by outside can mean I miss a lot of dialogue.  I also notice as my mother gets older, she's started doing the same as my dad: watching tv without the sound on, and she's definitely starting to have hearing problems.\n\nI prefer to have the sound on as well as the closed captioning.  I often understand emotion better by tone of voice than by facial expressions.  I've also heard some really excellent film and television music.",

            "I once tried to watch a movie without subtitles with my deaf friend but I realized 5 minutes in why it kinda sucked for her. First scene in the movie was the introduction of a monster that hid in the fog. To her it was like the human character was just running around zigzagging like a maniac because she couldn't hear the footsteps or the omnious music, leaves crunching and whisper sounds when the monster was apparently right behind the human character."

            "My wife needs me to be mentally and emotionally strong, capable, confident, able to make decisions, able to lead and manage. I cannot show weakness, anxiety, indecision or exhaustion in front of her. I cannot make mistakes. But I *am* weak, anxious, indecisive and exhausted - because I am only human. 2020 has been a tough year for everyone, but in addition to Covid I have started a new job, in a new country, and borne the brunt of all the administrative, logistical and financial management of moving us. I have decision fatigue. I wake up with a sense of dread. All I really want to do is hibernate. \n\nBut I can't show it. She 'loses faith in me' if I don't keep a stiff upper lip and just 'handle it like a man'. She supports in lots of practical ways - shopping, cooking, cleaning, childcare - but what I need now is a friend, someone I can be myself with, and can share my fears and vulnerabilities with, can have the liberty to be less than perfect with. She won't let me do that, because it scares her too much. She needs a strong man to cling to, and if her man turns out not to be strong she lashes out in fear. \n\nSo I have to kind of bottle it up. I used to have a group of male friends - I couldn't really discuss these things, but at least we could go out for a drink once in a while and unwind - but Covid and moving have put an end to that. I now feel that I have no-one, really, who is close enough with whom to share this crushing burden of responsibility.\n\nIt is affecting our marriage - because it doesn't feel like a partnership. A husband and wife should first and foremost be friends, but she says she can't be my friend because friends don't have to rely on each other financially. It's like being married to a housekeeper / secretary. We have sex from time to time, but without the emotional support of a friend I feel like that, too, is a performance - that I have to put on a persona of a super-masculine, hyper-dominant 'real man'; anything less she says is 'disgusting'. She doesn't even like cuddling afterwards because she thinks it's 'pathetic' and 'real men don't cuddle, they f*ck and leave'. \n\nI'm deeply, deeply unhappy. But the only people who know are random internet strangers. \n\nOne day I swear I'm going to crack. The only reason I don't is because we have a kid.",

My parents aren't bad, I know they just want the best for me, it's just that I am afraid that I cannot meet their expectations and disappoint them.\n\nTo try and get rid of the stress and pressure temporarily I usually play games, watch shows, or read books. I will admit that I do put a lot of my time into those things, but the reason why is because it helps me temporarily forget about my problems in the world, while doing those things I can feel at ease, but sometimes my parents condemn me a bit for spending too much time on those things. Sometimes I just wanna say that I do these things to help me calm down about life, but I don't know how to say it or even if they would understand it.\n\nLastly, I feel like there's no purpose in my life, I just wake up every day, go to online classes, listen to the teachers, do my requirements, sleep, rinse and repeat.

            "Im still in high school and I already hate myself. As a kid, I was extremely smart and was put into the gifted program (a class for kids with an iq above 130). Problem is that because of this, I was always told I was smarter and brighter than all the other kids, and in gifted they never actually gave us work, so for all of elementary I never had to work at all.\n\nMiddle school wasn't too bad, but I did have to start working a lot more than before or I would fail my classes (I learned this the hard way in my first year). Eventually, I pulled things together and got through it.\n\nCome high school, I still never had to work to much to get good grades, so I kept the same attitude, and it went ok enough for 9th grade. I didn't do nearly as well as I wanted, but I still didn't fail anything. Now I'm in 10th and I still have zero work ethic, extremely high expectations from my parents, and there's a pandemic and I haven't seen any friends since April. Im failing four classes because Ive never had to work nearly as hard as I've ever had to in my entire life. I'm pretty sure this year is as hard as every year of school I've been through combined. \n\nIf I tell my parents, what happens? The kid they thought could do great things for the world  is now just a fucking no good, do nothing failure. They'll tell me I'm overreacting and high school isn't hard. They'll tell me that I'm gonna end up homeless if I don't put shit together. They'll start punishing me by taking away my only goddamn escape from reality. Theyll lock me in my room until I get my attitude togheter, but I just fucking can't. I'm taking four AP classes and I want to drop two of them but they won't let me because they're still under the impression that I'm smarter than everyone when I'm just an average kid who was lied to from a young age. I don't necessarily want to commit suicide, but I wish something would come along and fucking end me. Car crash, shooting, house burnt down, just fucking anything that could kill me. If this is the hardest I've ever worked before and its only 10th grade, what happens to me if I go to college?

Hell I can barely get my own father to understand that non-white people aren't out to steal our jobs. \n\nAs for how I'm feeling? Tired. Physically,  mentally. I very likely have some form of depression, likely because it's a common co-morbidity of having Asperger's syndrome. A lot of the time I don't even feel like I have it, but there are periods where I just don't give a damn or I have this dull aching at the front of my head that I only get when I'm feeling down, like I want to cry but physically can't. Apparently people with Asperger's who are aware that they're different and cannot change that respond in one of four ways, and I've responded with depression. What makes it worse is that you have the same desires as everyone else, the same emotions, the same feelings, but no real way to express them, and no real way to fulfil those desires because you lack the social skills to really fit into society, and cannot maintain relationships. \n\nI'm also tired of the way things are. Of the way society works, of the way that it hates us for existing but refuses to help is when we try and make the best of a bad situation. How can people who hold the same opinion as my mother does take themselves seriously when they say that and then refuse to offer a hand up if someone asks? You don't go and take money from a homeless person, and then say \"you only get out of life what you put in\", why do that to others? \n\nSo yeah. I'm tired, depressed, angry, and disillusioned with society. And it's not going to get better anytime soon.",

I see her every few days to give our 5 year old son back and forth. \n\nThe truth is I don't have feelings of love for her anymore, but I still dream about her 4-5 nights a week. I'm able to step back and see that she wasn't perfect or anything, we both had our faults and I'm pretty sure I understand why she left. \n\nBut the problem is the only time I'm honestly happy is when I'm having those dreams. I wake up and realize it was a dream, and I just wanna go back to sleep to stay there forever and never wake up.

            "I\u2019m tired, frustrated, scared, and lost. It feels like everything I do \u2018right\u2019 is just me bumbling forward and getting lucky or fitting into somewhere. I may get good grades, but will that ever translate to real job ability? I doubt my education on microbiology will come up much in my future, yet here I am spending time, money, and effort all on it. I rented an apartment so I could take this class. My mother helped me get my first car so I could be here. My dad\u2019s life insurance will pay my loans. My grandparents\u2019 savings account will pay my way to continued schooling if I take it. And all for what? I can\u2019t help but feel all this effort and work will just lead to disappointment. All of this effort and time and money and I\u2019ll end up in some dead-end job that I don\u2019t enjoy, saving my own money until I can retire. Then what? I guess I\u2019ll just sit around until I die? What\u2019s the fucking point? I\u2019m too busy or financially unsound to delve into hobbies I really want to. For the same reasons I don\u2019t want to waste time, effort, and emotional resources on dating. I mean, for fuck\u2019s sake, the last time I got rejected I kind of just shut down because I get too fucking invested in one person and overthink it. This is the shit I\u2019m doing right now, too, fucking overthinking. And don\u2019t get me started on Covid. I thought it was nice to just sit around and to a degree I love not having to go around and interact with people, because it\u2019s exhausting, but I also don\u2019t have as much push to eat better and work out. I\u2019ve gained so much weight that I hate to look in the mirror, since it\u2019s a reminder that I have to fucking climb that weight loss mountain again if I ever want to have the body I want. To clarify, I don\u2019t think fat people are ugly and whatnot, people can rock whatever look they want, but it\u2019s not the look I want. Trying to lose even 11 pounds before the pandemic was rough, and now I\u2019ve got more to lose. Every effort I put forward seems to just burn up before anything comes of it, and I\u2019m sick of it. All these fucking expectations make me feel like I\u2019m going to crack under pressure and I haven\u2019t even started looking for a job yet. Hell, I\u2019ve nearly finished my major and I don\u2019t have the slightest idea if what my career will be in my field, which is massive. I want so bad to have someone I can just cry with. Someone who can hug me and rub my back and tell me it\u2019ll all be ok. I can\u2019t do that with my friends because I\u2019d be a burden. My sister wouldn\u2019t understand and, knowing her, might laugh or just drop it and say \u2018get a therapist\u2019. I don\u2019t want to throw more on my mom since she has enough going on in her life and doesn\u2019t need my insecurity in top of it. I\u2019d feel nothing but guilt if I tried to date to cover this too. As they say, you can\u2019t really date someone if you feel like you need someone. All of these fucking expectations and all the effort put in behind me is incredibly anxiety-inducing, and I already feel like I\u2019ve failed the expectations a million times over. So many fucking failings and shortcomings. I hate being a goddamn perfectionist because it\u2019s the most impractical fucking thing. \n\nAll that to say, I\u2019m fucking tired. I\u2019m fucking scared. I feel like people believe in me, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever stack up. Nobody deserves bearing all this shit from me. So I\u2019ll just shut the fuck up and keep bumbling until something happens. I\u2019ll either finally crack or make it somewhere and settle. I\u2019m glad threads like this exist, so I can just shout all this stuff out while finding solace that it\u2019ll just fade into the ether like with any other comment. People might reply with comforting words, and I thank the people that do that, but realistically, everyone will forget this thread in a few days. All back to normal, no weights on anybody\u2019s emotional shoulders.\n\nTo echo what a lot of people have already said in this thread, being erased from reality sure does sound nice. That way I couldn\u2019t disappoint people. Maybe the money that got put towards me could\u2019ve gotten my mother a better place to live, or my sister a better education.\n\nA final thing I need to rant about is that I just feel fucking angry. Or maybe frustrated. Any time I think about all this I can\u2019t help but get angry with myself. Why can\u2019t I be better? Is this really all I fucking have to give? I can\u2019t help but get angry in general. This world is a shithole. There are some absolutely amazing and breathtaking aspects, sure, but existing here I\u2019m not sure is worth it. Not when I might be doomed to fucking around in a job I won\u2019t enjoy, likely with only a few friends who I just chat with, probably not about a hobby I enjoy, all while making just about a living wage, saving money for the day I can retire when I\u2019m too old to do half of the shit I could\u2019ve, so I can then just sit somewhere in the world and rot. \n\nAll that was probably just anxiety, anger, and fear. I don\u2019t even know if I actually believe half of what I said except for the fact that I don\u2019t want to impose, despite feeling like I need someone to hold me and tell me it\u2019ll all be ok. Above all, I just feel so damn alone. But I\u2019d feel guilty if I asked someone to accompany me.",

I get for those who had a far commute or what not, but I honestly never expected that the office would clear out and go 100% remote nearly to a man, from the jump to now like 9 months later. The place had soul. For the headcount, it's a LARGE place and the CEO pretty much poured himself into making it the nicest place you could work, lots of cozy areas, even a fireplace, etc. \n\nWhat I'm saying is, now I spend 8-10 hours a day feeling like I'm living some kind of a watered down version of Fallout. I roam through a ghost office as I go down to get coffee or my lunch. I wear a mask in the common areas because that's what I'm supposed to do and on *rare* occasion I encounter another human being. So I'm masked up, stalking my ghost office, lol. The lights work on motion sensor, so I'm sitting there doing my work and the place goes pitch dark (especially now that it's winter). I feel like I've been abandoned. I know people are just doing what they feel they need to do to be safe, but part of me can't help but feel like this is not normal, not right. Ironically, I might be the most introverted person in the office. I should be loving this, but what I've realized is that I \"get\" something from being around others, especially when trying to work together, even if I'm hardly the most talkative. That something doesn't feel at all replaced by Zoom calls and emails. I dunno...I just feel like I'm living in some weird dystopian future and it's sucks the big one.",
            "So i was in this long distance relationship since July of 2019 up until this morning. Before any assumptions are made, yes, it was difficult but that wasn\u2019t a deterrent for us. We had our up and downs, and we took 2 breaks. Now, upon having our breaks, we had a set of agreements. Her side was that if she fucked another guy, I didn\u2019t wanna hear about it and she had to use protection. Naturally, as we were planning on getting back with each other, I trusted her to follow these agreements. I find out last night that she LIKELY (not for sure but this really feels like it :( ) only wanted the break to have sex with him, as she heavily disliked me calling him some random guy, but she ALSO didn\u2019t use protection and thought she was pregnant for about 2 months, which was well into our break being over. So not only did she not tell me during this whole time that she might be pregnant, she says that an agreement like that was me trying to be controlling of her body and she fucked him raw anyway. I explained to her how hurt I am by it, and how much it hurts that she would blatantly disrespect our relationship like that, but all she cares about is the fact that I\u2019m upset in the first place and she\u2019s called me manipulative and told me to shut up when I was crying about it. She NEVER acted like this before. Literally the day prior she was normal and loving and felt safe. I really thought that she was the one. After this discovery for me, however, it felt like i was talking to another person. We\u2019ve had disagreements before and she never acted so insensitive and she had never disregarded my feelings this way. She has completely betrayed my trust and fully stomped on my heart. I asked her to at least apologize but she says she didn\u2019t do anything wrong, and even though trust has always been key for me ( and this was known ), she doesn\u2019t even think that her not telling me about it is that big of a deal. I really feel like shit. I\u2019m in disbelief. I\u2019ve never been so hurt in my life. I\u2019m feeling a lot like I don\u2019t wanna live anymore. I don\u2019t know what to do or who to talk to but this is some really painful shit... she was also the only person I\u2019ve ever been able to fully confide in. So I lost one of my best friends, confidantes, and the love of my life in one night. It still doesn\u2019t feel real."

Sugar Bear is a wild animal that has taste for 3 things: blood, tears, and the delicious taste of Golden Crisp.",
            "Okay so this is how things played out in my wife\u2019s head:\n\nAlright so all the cereal mascots are captured and taken to a closed-roof colosseum. They are told that they are to fight to the death, and only the last mascot gets to leave. The mascots, being cutesy characters, are all in disbelief and don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nThe first to act is Cap\u2019n Crunch, which makes sense since he\u2019s a white sailor man. He immediately moves to smash the Honey Nut Cheerios bee between his hands; Buzz dies instantly. However this backfires as all the bees in a five-mile radius react to Buzz\u2019s pheromones and swarm the stadium and attack Cap\u2019n Crunch. He is unable to escape them or fight them off and perishes.\n\nAll of this causes chaos and the other mascots turn on each other. Toucan Sam immediately flies away to get some distance, but Count Chocula turns into a bat and chases him down. They have a prolonged aerial battle, but ultimately Count Chocula wins, as his fangs do more damage than Toucan Sam\u2019s beak.\n\nTony the Tiger, being the most fit of the mascots, makes a break for the weapons rack and chooses a large mace. Frankenberry also attempted to make it to the weapons rack, but Tony the Tiger strikes him down in a single blow.\n\nLucky the Leprechaun, knowing he\u2019s at a strength disadvantage, uses his magic charms to create smokescreens and other diversions, allowing him to throw off would-be attackers and find hiding places in the rainbows generated by his charms.\n\nThe Cinnamon Toast Crunch pieces cannibalize each other until one is left, who is crushed in the chaos.\n\nSnap, Crackle and Pop attempt to gang up on Tony the Tiger, but his raw strength is too much for them. Meanwhile Count Chocula has won his air battle with Toucan Sam, but as he\u2019s returning to the ground, he\u2019s caught by surprise and eaten by Sonny, the Cocoa Puffs mascot, who uses his chocolate body as a source of strength to enter his \u201cCuckoo for Cocoa Puffs\u201d state of mania. He attacks Tony the Tiger in a frenzy, knocking the mace out of his hands, and they brawl for what seems like an eternity, until the smoke clears and they\u2019re both found dead.\n\nLucky the Leprechaun lives out of sheer ingenuity, magic, and a little bit of luck.\n\nBooberry elected not to participate on the grounds that he is already dead.

As seen it makes your feet look go extremely quick which is usually only seen by really fast athletes so I am considering he could go around 25 mph with this.\n\nClover of Charm:\n\nThis allowed him to duplicate and even fall into hay to secure fall damage.\n\nRed Baloon Charm:\n\nMakes himself and other things light pretty useless imo.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, here is this mf going all out and finally retaliating against the kids to really see how powerful he is.

            "Worked at an animal hospital. They did necropsies for zoos all the time. An alligator died, and they shipped it to the hospital, refrigerated etc to stop the decay. They took it out and put it up on the table. After doing all the paperwork, they started opening up the alligator. After the first cut, the alligator opened its eyes. Turns out it wasn't dead, the zoo vet mistook an illness for death and the low temperature put it basically into a coma.\n\nEdit: Unfortunately this is all the information I know on this story. It's been 7 years since I worked at that place.",
            "I worked at a coroner\u2019s office for a while and once we had a guy who we thought had died from an OD on meth. Well we started the autopsy and i went to cut his lungs out and blueberry muffin mix started coming out of them. I stuck my finger in his mouth and it was full of blueberry muffin mix. And it was in throat. Turns out he got just high enough to pass out while eating the muffin mix and he ended up choking to death.",
            "Six months after my aunt\u2019s passing in a drunk driving incident, the coroner decided to ring up my mum and inform her that they completed their report on her passing, and deemed the likelihood of \u201csuicidal intentions\u201d which may have factored into said incident; I initially didn\u2019t understand how coroners could deduce such a thing.\n\nUntil i remembered, self harm scars are a thing.\n\nMy mum had only just gotten to the acceptance stage of grief, and it put her firmly back to square one.\n\nShe\u2019s fine now.",
            "So I'm not an autopsy doctor or anything of the sort. I did sit in on a murder trial, the mom drowned her infant in hot water. She claimed she was giving her newborn a bath in the sink with one of those sling type inserts so babies can't go under, the doorbell rang, she answered and came back to her kid in scalding hot water. She claimed the kid had somehow turned on the hot water and burned himself while she was answering the door, but drowning was the ultimate rule of death. In the autopsy photos, the most disturbing thing I've ever seen in real life, is you could clearly make out hand marks on that poor child's skin, on his biceps. You could see the finger outlines like you do if someone slaps you. I was 18 years old taking a criminal justice class. Just the ease of watching the trail and her nonchalance killed most faith I had in humanity at the time. I know this doesn't quite fit the question but for years I saw that boys face in my sleep. What really kills me is despite the evidence she got off.",
            "I did the autopsy of both a robber and his victim. The robber shot the victim in the back when he tried to escape in a motorcycle, and the robber was shot by the police in the exact same situation. \n\nWhat's interesting is that they both died by exactly the same lesion. Both of them had their 4th lumbar vertebra shattered and their aorta (main artery of the body) sectioned at the same level. I thought of it like an extreme example of instant karma.",
            "During my internship rotation a couple of years back, a 40 year old guy came in because he 'suddenly collapsed' while drinking with friends. He came in unresponsive, mouth bleeding, and not breathing, so we had to intubate him. For some reason, the endotracheal tube (the stiff tube placed inside the trachea to help the patient breathe) won't go in, but we managed to suction copious amounts of blood clots. After CPR (still with unsuccessful intubation so we had to bag him with a face mask), the patient was declared dead, and diagnosed with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. During the autopsy, they found out that the guy was apparently shot by a gun from the top of the head (the entry wound was obscured by his hair, and was barely bleeding at all), and the bullet somehow went through the back of the guys throat and made a hole behind the base of the tongue, which the endotracheal tube kept slipping into.",
            "As a student in the medical field, I had the opportunity to visit a cadaver lab. I was very surprised to see how many people had died from choking. Out of the twelve or so cadavers in the lab that day, at least 7 or 8 were from choking. I went home and immediately looked up how to perform self Heimlich.",

            "Training in the Medical Examiners office. Elderly woman found dead by herself in her home. There was nothing suspicious so I was given the case. Took out all the organs, dissected everything, completely unremarkable. I cut through the larynx as the last step before I could clean up and finish the case and boom, giant piece of chicken lodged in her windpipe. Died choking on dinner.",
            "I was an investigator for a state medical examiner for just over 2 years. Had a mom that had \u201cdrank herself to death\u201d according to the husband after relapsing on Mother\u2019s Day weekend. I just felt like something was off. Sent her for an autopsy. Had a ruptured liver where dude had essentially beat her till she internally bled to death. \n\nLater, while out on bail, he stole a semi truck, crashed it in a pond, got out shooting at a deputy, and they killed him.. saved the tax payers a good chunk of money.",
            "Former homicide detective here. Suspicious death, 30-ish male found alone by cleaning staff in the back row of a sparsely attended sci-fi movie. Strange scratching wounds around/in mouth.  Some petechiae in eyes and on cheeks, but no signs of strangulation. No obvious signs of chronic illness or disease. Presented as healthy, normal adult male. Found on his person was a wallet with normal contents, and a single cancelled movie ticket, indicating he went alone. Weird, spy movie shit going on here. \n\nAutopsy: a large amount of popcorn compacted in his esophagus.  Like a half cup. Dude was apparently excited by the movie, stuffing popcorn in his mouth, and choked. The scratch marks around/in his mouth were self inflicted, trying to dig out popcorn (verified via fingernail scrapings, his was only DNA present). Loud movie, he was in the back, no one saw or heard him choke.  \n\nI\u2019ve never eaten popcorn again.",
            "reading all this makes me paranoid that I have something wrong with my organs that I\u2019m not aware of",
            "Med student almost graduated here. A couple years ago i attended the pathological anatomy course and during a class the professor showed us some autopsies. Despite the tremendous smell of 4/5 consecutive autopsies, one of them was carried out on a homeless patient that died in the ER probably due to heart failure. The body had massive ascites (fliud in the abdomen), so at first he had to evacuate it. Imagine him cutting the abdomen and the yellow rancid liquid started to come out like a fountain. One of my colleagues fainted.\n\nThen the next step was to examine the abnominal organs. Imagine the face of every person in the room when it became clear that the patient had some form of inherited polycistic disease and the liver and the kidneys were full of cysts. The liver weighted more than 10kg (normal weight 2-3kg) and the kidneys almost 3 kg each (normally 150g each). The professor was really shocked at the beginning, but then he really enjoyed cutting through the cysts in order to get samples, they popped like airball spreading liquid all over the place. Second collegue fainted.\n\nThe other ones were pretty standard, but i think i will remember forever this one, in particular that liver on the scale. I even took a picture but i can't find it anymore :(\n\nP.s. I'm sorry for any mistakes but I'm not a native English speaker",
            "Not a doctor, but a whole body scientific donation technician. I'm the person who dissects cadavers after they were donated. \n\nWe very commonly would get young cases, normally overdoses. Had a mid-thirties female, went to medical examiner prior to donation, but they only did an external evaluation.\n\nI went to check her genitals to see if I could palpate a uterus, found a condom full of pills. Similar to most, the body became a crime scene and we couldn't touch her. \n\nWhen we finally were able to continue, they asked us to photograph the pills to send to the examiners office. \n\nThey were mostly Advil and Zyrtec, easily one of the weirdest things I've ever found.",
            "Working in the ER, young man comes in, one of four in a nasty auto accident. Speed+inexperience=car flipped, passengers ejected. One expired shortly after coming into the ER. \nI transported the body down to the morgue. First time I had felt a human being with all their bones broken. Felt like trying to lift sheets full of rolling bowling balls.\nOnce in the morgue I commented how unscathed he looked; he really did.... some dirt, the ET tube, not much else. ME offered I could view the autopsy if interested. \nI was interested. \nThe first thing they noted were the xrays of the fractures, basically all the major bones including multiple multiple rib fractures. When they opened the body the organs were described as near liquified. \nIt wasn\u2019t until weeks later I got the whole story from the EMT who had been on scene. Seems the passenger had been 1/2 in 1/2 out the window while the car had been flipping. He was just days shy of 17. The driver was just days past 16, his parents had bought him a brand new car, he\u2019d had it less than 72hrs. Driver lived, though with severe brain damage, front and rear passengers died, rear drivers side passenger survived with not too much permanent (physical) damage. \nI have friends who\u2019s kids are getting their drivers license. I never pass up a chance to drop that story on them. I\u2019ve seen a lot of f\u2019d up things in my healthcare career. That is one of the grand total of 3 that make me tear up, and it\u2019s one from early on.",
            "I was a forensic tech for a state medical examiner's office for about 2 years. I've assisted in about 1000 autopsies and have removed bodies from scenes from likely twice that. I told these stories in another AskReddit thread about people who clean up crime scenes, and I have a few takeaways:\n\n1. Man who had a psychotic break and castrated himself and stuffed it all into this mouth before cutting his own throat.\n2. Man who was sodomized to death with a broom, a baseball bat, and the tuning end of a guitar.\n3. Man who decapitated himself by hanging himself with high tension cable and jumping off a bridge.\n4. Woman overdosing whilst carrying an 8-month pregnancy.\n\nNo really any major revelations like, in terms of something wild unexpected or a medical finding that contradicts the police report. Just seen enough shit in one lifetime for 100 people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: You can likely dig through my posts if you want to find the whole stories. Pretty sure my profile is public.",
            "When my parents were in medical school they attended an autopsy of a patient who had died in a car accident\n\nAutopsy revealed that apparently this guy had survived a chest shot in Vietnam years ago that the surgeons/medics left in rather than perform risky surgery, the accident had migrated the bullet to his heart and was ruled the cause of death",
            "This story circulates every year at my medical school. \n\nA body came in with a gunshot wound to the chest. There was no exit wound. They tried to locate the bullet during the autopsy. No success. They then did a whole scan (X-ray or CT) of the upper chest/abdomen/pelvis. No bullet.At that point someone said fuck it lets scan the whole body. \n\nLo and behold the bullet was detected in the popliteal fossa (area behind the knee). It had embolized/traveled from the heart all the way down the arterial system to the knee where it got stuck in one of the narrower blood vessels.",
            "Forensic pathologist here. Two come to mind:\n\n\\-I had just moved back to my home state where family lives. Get a case with a man with a distinctive last name in the family tree. I put a text out to my mom to see if we were related, but before she texted back I pulled the sheet back and already knew; he looked like me. It was my great uncle.\n\n\\-Get a case where it's a \"house fire\" death. On exam he's got multiple, textbook stab & incised wounds. I spend the next 30 minutes getting ~~gaslighted~~ quizzed by PD about \"Are you *sure*?\" because they thought this was a straightforward house fire. Un-fun fact: fires not an uncommon way for people to try to conceal a homicide.",
            "My grandmother had a massive stroke in her 30s that paralyzed her entire left side, and died in her 60s from a heart attack, but while doing the autopsy they found out she had bad lung cancer, but she never had any pain from it because it was in her left lung. She was a very heavy smoker, so it made sense, its just crazy that she had lung cancer and never knew.",
            "My wife is a pathologist assistant and during her schooling carried out the autopsy of a newborn that died minutes after birth. The mother was desperate for a child and had a history of multiple miscarriages at different terms. This was her first time making it full term and all prenatal checkups revealed no problems. The delivery was difficult, but successful, and baby was alive for a short time. Skip to autopsy. All signs point to baby being fully developed. Get to the abdominal cavity and the liver is lacerated and hemorrhage everywhere. During the difficult delivery the resident used too much force with the forceps to pull the baby out. The ruptured liver the caused the baby to bleed out internally.\n\nWife was enthusiastic about autopsy up to this point, now has no interest.",
            "Sheep farmer, I have to know how to do a necropsy for when something dies to know if it's something that could spread. Had a ewe fall over dead after losing a ton of weight and after treating her for everything under the sun. She would gasp for air and struggled to breathe but antibiotics, steroids and anti-inflammatory drugs didn't touch it. She finally passed away and I cut her open to see what the hell happened fully expecting to see her lungs riddled with shit.\n\nHer heart was 5 times the normal size and hard as a river stone. My guess is she'd had that issue her whole life and it didn't kill her until she was 2.",
            "I was in charge of making copies of all evidence to be used in the trial of Donald Harvey in 1989.  He was known as The Angel of Death. One bit of evidence was an autopsy photo of an exhumed elderly woman. The examiner was holding with tweezers an 18\u201d piece of cotton being pulled from her throat.  Harvey liked to stuff cotton so far down into the victim\u2019s throats that it could not be seen. I still can\u2019t shake the image from my brain.",
            "Masters in forensic pathology here. You'd be surprised to know the number of people that have life threatening issues that never went diagnosed and that they didn't die from. Seen an older guy who died of pneumonia in hospital. On autopsy the guy had both an elarged heart and a couple of medium sized aneurysms in the brain. Another guy in his ~70s apparently came into the ER and had chest pain then died shortly after. Dies of a heart attack but also had cancer.\n\nIn less natural circumstances though...saw a guy who had been shot in the head a couple of times. Three definite entries and a blown out skull but police only found one bullet. Couldn't find the other bullet in his head at all. Assumed the police missed it.\n\nWent on as normal with the autopsy until we got to the chest cavity. The other bullet was just chilling beside his lung. Turns out it entered the skull, hit the inside, ricocheted down his neck and into the chest. That was pretty wild",
            "I may be late to the party but I finally have a good story to tell! \n\nIn medical school, my group\u2019s cadaver was an 80+ year old female who was EXTREMELY unfit. Morbidly obese with muscles half the size of any other cadavers. Her pectoral muscles were paper thin, to get some reference. We figured she was bedridden during her last few months, which would somewhat explain these findings. \n\nWhen we started our neurology unit and began to dissect the infratemporal fossa, I discovered a small metal pellet under the skin behind her right ear. My tank mates and I went on to find dozens of these metal pellets strewn around her head\u2019s anatomy, with some lodged into the cranium and others in the bones of her face. \n\nWe contacted her living relatives to get some clarification and they ended up revealing that when this lady and her brother were children (they said she was 8 years old) they were playing with an old decorative rifle that the family had mounted above the fireplace. Long story short, the brother accidentally discharged the rifle into the girl\u2019s face :( \n\nThe aftermath was this lady was blind and wheelchair bound for the rest of her life, and the pellets weren\u2019t all removed. It was an interested dissection with that information from then on, but a sobering moment in reminding our class that our cadavers are humans with their own struggles and rich lives. If you\u2019re considering donating your body to science, please know that we don\u2019t take the responsibility lightly and a million thanks aren\u2019t enough. \n\nI have more stories if anyone is curious!\n\nEdit: I should add that her granddaughter made a point of saying this lady did not hold a grudge on her brother, and they lived full lives on happy terms :)",
            "Not mine but a Doctor i used to work with. Back when he was in school, he would do his cadaver labs really late at night.(to many people during the day.) One time it was really late. Around 2am. He was listening to his lecture on his head phones and he saw the cadavers arm move/twitch. He thought it was just his mind playing tricks on him. Then he saw it again. Proceeded to run away in a panic. \n\nHe told a few of his classmates what happened but nobody believed him. Next day they had a group cadaver lab with the same cadaver. The arm twitched yet again. The professor did some digging and it turns out the patients pacemaker was still fully functional and occasionally fired, causing the arm twitch. \n\nHe was so relieved. He thought there was a zombie in there.",
            "My dad used to perform autopsies.\n\n His best story was that they were brought a body that has no real indication of any issues. After examining the body, the only thing of note was that there was blood coming out of the guys rectum. They begin the autopsy and the guys organs are completely liquidified and the body cavity is filled with lead shot. It became apparent really quickly that someone had shoved a shotgun up his ass and pulled the trigger. \n\nThis was in the 70\u2019s and I still have to wonder what this guy did to piss someone off enough to get a shotgun up his ass.",
            "Not exactly an autopsy per se, but it was  a patient found unresponsive, with CPR in progress by EMS.  The man was clearly homeless, based on his appearance and smell. he reportedly had not been seen for several days by his friends, and was eventually found behind a fast food restaurant dumpster.  We were briefly able to get a pulse back, and when the nurse cut his pants off to place a catheter we saw the cause:  He had fashioned some sort of makeshift cockring out of the neck of a plastic bottle. It was way too tight and completely cut off the circulation, the penis was fully black and necrotic.  I did a bedside ultrasound and found his abdomen full of free fluid (which is bad); most likely his bladder had ruptured from being unable to urinate for days. His labs suggested he was in septic shock and full blown renal failure as well. He did not survive much longer than that.\n\nEdit: I remembered another one. In my final year of training we had a cadaver lab to practice advanced airway management techniques (e.g. difficult intubation,  Cricothyroidotomy, etc.). While I was helping an intern do a basic intubation, she commented the tube wouldn't pass. \"I think she has some kind of growth or mass in her airway\".  I took a look, asked for some foreceps, and pulled a half-eaten hot dog out of her larynx. It of course had been embalmed along with the rest of her.  Cause of death identified.",
            "Medical student here and this story is from anatomy class. One of the cadavers in our class died of cancer and when we took out the gentleman\u2019s liver it was very large and full of bumps all over. The liver itself was also hard as a rock. The poor mans cancer had spread all over his liver and was full of tumours. It really hit home that this was what cancer was like and demonstrated it\u2019s pure destructive nature.",
            "Medical examiner here. This probably isn't a big \"wow\" revelation but it certainly made an impact on me. Very early in my career, I did an exam on another doctor who worked at the hospital where I trained. I didn't know this gentleman personally but was acquainted with him by reputation; he was a very happy-go-lucky sort, much loved by everyone in his department. He died unexpectedly at a young age of what turned out to be a drug overdose on pharmaceuticals he had been diverting from the hospital. I don't think anybody saw that coming, myself included. It was a lesson to me that anybody can fall victim to addiction, and that it's hard to know what anybody's private struggles are.",
            "I am not a pathologist but when my father died from drowning, it was noted he had acute cirrhosis of the liver. The corner also removed a bullet from between his heart and spine that dad recieved in Viet Nam. It was very degraded. He had also lost a thumb and several feet of intestine there, the evidence of which was noted in the report. \n\nDad had served 22 years in the Army, and had been awarded the Purple Heart three times. He lived a hard life after and it was speculated he would have passed soon of cirrhosis of the liver had he not drown.",
            "My friend had to do an autopsy on a baby. The dad claimed she died after rolling off a couch. My friend found that the kid was slammed against a hard surface multiple times. Dad eventually admitted he hit the baby against the wall after she wouldn\u2019t stop crying. \n\nMy friend had to quit that job cause it was so taxing mentally.",
            "Not a doctor, but my family requested an autopsy of my grandfather so we could (hopefully) get some answers about how he died. Our family has a history of unusual medical conditions (shout-out to my ancestors who were MASSIVELY inbred until a hundred or so years ago), so we wanted to see what made him so sick leading up to his death. \n\nWe never got a clear answer, unfortunately, but we did get an AMAZING summary of their findings. In the autopsy report, they listed all of my grandfather\u2019s body parts. Now, Papa was a large man. It stands to reason that his body parts would be a bit larger than the average guy. \n\nThe list of body parts went something along the lines of \u201cheart - above average, liver - above average, brain - above average\u201d all the way down to \u201ctesticles - average.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve never laughed harder at average-sized testicles.\n\nEdit: added a \u201cthe\u201d because I don\u2019t grammar good sometimes",
            "Not a doctor but I did a necropsy on one of my birds a couple weeks ago. I couldn't tell how she died before it happened but after opening her up I found about 14 masses of tissue in her reproductive system. At first I thought it was cancer from dissecting one of the masses. Later I found out it was actually an intestinal infection :(\n\nEdit: it was actually a reproductive tract infection\n\n\nSome of yall were asking about the vulture that lives in my backyard named randy so I made r/randythevulture",
            "When I was a med student in my final year I did a placement in forensic medicine. Had a body come in, some guys had gone to the cops and said their friend had died after he\u2019d fallen and smacked his head on a coffee table a few weeks prior and, in a panic, they\u2019d dumped his body in the median of one of the big highways. This is in the middle of summer. By the time he was brought in he was pretty significantly decomposed but his body was still intact. \n\nAutopsy revealed a small subdural haemorrhage (bleed in the brain) consistent with the story. Then we discovered a ruptured liver (the laceration was about 10-15cm long), spleen, and heart, as well as a complete collection of broken ribs. This guy hadn\u2019t just fallen and hit his head on a coffee table, he had been beaten to death with excessive force. Turned from a suspicious death to a homicide case pretty quickly after that.",
            "Not an autopsy doctor, but thought this would be the place to share the story: I spent every winter break during high school cutting down trees and splitting wood. We used a hydraulic splitter connected to the back of our tractor. One cold winter afternoon we cut down this really old red oak, one of those old, yet still strong trees your father\u2019s father\u2019s father even said was big when he was a child. Anyway, after using the chainsaw to cut up manageable sections, I threw a chunk up on the splitter and the oak cracked open. About half a foot into the oak, there was a nest of hair inside. Didn\u2019t think much until we cut the half chunk into quarters and then the splitter got jammed up on a chain. Upon closer inspection we saw some fossilized indentations that looked like a jaw bone. We called the authorities (game warden). Next day homicide squad was out in our woods. After a few weeks we got news that someone was chained up to the tree and left to die. Over many years the tree grew around the body. Never could find DNA match to anyone in family or missing persons. So...yea.",
            "I\u2019m a med student, not a pathologist or coroner. But in anatomy lab the tank next to me had a donor with an inflatable penis pump inside his scrotum and shaft. It was completely self contained. Fluid in the container in the scrotum could be pumped into the shaft tube creating an erection. Then the fluid would just be released back into the pump and the boner would go away.\n\nPretty wild.",
            "Late to the party but, in university I applied and got into the Prosection lab. Basically, we got the fresh pickled cadaver and dissected it for the anatomy lab. We weren\u2019t told anything about his medical history or cause of death.\n\nList of things we found:\n-metal fragments in his quad and calf\n-sternum was wired together (old surgery)\n-blood jelly in the brain\n-old school stent above the heart\n\nThere were other weird things. Mostly though I still struggle with the smell of pepperoni because it\u2019s so similar to embalmed corpse. Found that out after prosecting for a few hours and then going to the Cafeteria for pepperoni pizza- and then vomiting said pepperoni pizza.",
            "I'm a medical student, not a doctor, but when I dissected my cadaver in my first year, it had lots of surgical markings and was pretty overweight. After I'd been able to work through all the parts of the body with my group, we were able to piece together with our lab leader that our donor had been in and out of the hospital for a quadruple bypass, followed by a pacemaker, a stomach stapling, and then what looked like an emergency open-heart surgery that she died during. \n\nNot a rare disease or strange occurrence per se, but it was interesting finding clues around the body as we learned anatomy.",
            "I\u2019m not a medical examiner yet, but I\u2019m getting there. I thought I\u2019d share my favorite case that I\u2019ve come across, by one of my favorite people. This particular one is a landmark case that really springboarded our knowledge of what happens to the human body after it dies, and as the man who worked the case would put it, it was a humdinger. \n\nIn the 70s, Dr. Bill Bass was only a few years into his professorship at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville. He wasn\u2019t a medical examiner, but a forensic anthropologist who in addition to teaching, also helped the police in the field whenever they found a body in an advanced state of decay. \n\nOne day, he got a call from the local agency. An old civil war grave had been disturbed on what used to be a plantation belonging to a confederate officer. Remains had been found, and they looked fresh. Our hero arrived at the site to discover the body of a headless man wearing a tuxedo half in the coffin that belonged to one Colonel William Shy of the Confederates. The flesh was still pink, there were no skeletal remains left in the wet and boggy Tennessee soil, so when the cops asked Dr Bass how long he thought the man had been dead, he said the famous, fatal last words, \u201ca few months, I\u2019d guess.\u201d \n\nSo the body was taken back to the medical examiners office and a workup was done, but strange things started happening. The suit the man was wearing was hand stitched, and the stitch pattern was reminiscent of the mid 19th century. The clothing itself was pure cotton, no additives, no plastics, no blending, no nothing. Further examination of the coffin revealed not a trace of bone, anywhere. A sinking suspicion started to settle in amongst the investigators. \n\nEventually it was revealed that the body was indeed Lieutenant Colonel William Shy, who had fallen in battle in 1864. The reason for his remarkable preservation was that to get his body home from the field, it had been embalmed and hermetically sealed in his coffin. In the anaerobic environment, no bacteria could grow and break down the tissue. And that is how he stayed for 113 years. Eventually it was determined that grave robbers had disturbed the body looking for goods, but had probably been spooked and fled the scene. \n\nThis case lit a fire under Bill Bass. In 1980, he acquired an acre of land behind the UT hospital, and in 1981, the very first truly scientific experiment on human decomposition was conducted. In the 40 years since then, we have learned an enormous amount about how and why things break down, what causes it to speed or slow down, and even how it looks on a molecular level. (If you want to be amazed, you should look up some of Arpad Vass\u2019s work on volatile compounds involved in decomp) More than this though, the first scientists to work on the body farm paved the way for innovations in cut marks, entomology, chemistry, reconstruction, and alums of the program are some of the most well respected and renowned scientists in the field. I know that as a starry eyed teenager reading their technical manuals for the first time, these people were my idols and I wanted nothing else but to be just like them. I\u2019m so glad that right now, I\u2019m training to be part of the next generation of dedicated scientists, and in my case, physicians, who can speak the language of the dead and don\u2019t mind getting their hands dirty.

            "Not an autopsy doctor, but did take Anatomy and Physiology II with lab in college. The lab was working on cadavers being prosected by more advanced students.  A prosection is the dissection of a cadaver (human or animal) or part of a cadaver by an experienced anatomist in order to demonstrate for students anatomic structure. \n\nANYway, one of the cadavers (we had a male and a female for obvious reasons) was a big ol' linebacker lookin dude. Like, and older bodybuilder type? IIRC his age at time of death was late 50s. \n\nHis heart has been removed by the anatomist , and we were examining it because it was very enlarged and contributed to his death. We all had to hold it in our hands to feel the heft, like size and weight, and compare it to the heft of the female's heart, which was normal sized, about like a large apple. The male's heart, for comparison, was the size of a small cantaloupe. \n\nI went first, for whatever reason, and the instructor lifted the enlarged heart out of its preservative bath and placed it in my hands. I damn near dropped the thing when it shocked me with what felt like a jolt of electricity. I (understandably, I think) made a startled noise, and the instructor took the heart back before I could juggle it onto the floor. \n\n\"Oh,\" she said. \"I forgot to warn you, look out for the pacemaker.\"\n\nApparently when someone has a pacemaker there's a battery too and they don't bother taking it out/off. They just snip the leads and leave it there, so if you touch both bare leads you get a mild shock, even through your exam gloves. \n\nThat was a mildly disturbing experience.",
            "When i worked for the ME office, a pathologist came and got all of us to check out a post she was doing. The guy had what\u2019s called Situs Inversus. All\nHis organs were backward. Left lung on the right, stomach on the right etc etc. no mention of it in his medical history.",
            "I am a pre-med student and one time while shadowing a forensic pathologist, 3 days before Christmas, he was doing an autopsy on an automobile vs pedestrian accident. The man\u2019s face was completely smashed in. When they take samples of the brain they cut the skin, pull it over the face, and the cut off the top of the skull. when they did that the skull was basically shattered and bone fragments pulled back with the skin and when they cut off the skull cap, the brain was obviously damaged and the eyeballs had been pushed back/fallen through the orbits and into the cranial cavity. \n\nThe guy also had $10,000 in cash in his jean pockets. According to police he had a record involving drugs so the theory was either a drug deal gone bad or he stumbled into the road while under the influence.",

            "While in medical school: We had to observe an autopsy and could assist. One of the lectures was to observe for head trauma. You do this by hitting the skull with a hard object (scissor or the like). A hollow sound is normal but a \"dull\" sound indicates trauma.\nOne of the other students did this exam and found a \"dull\" sound. The coroner had not yet himself examined the person and was very surprised, as he had not been informed by the police of head trauma.\n\nThey then continued to examine the head and they found a gun shot wound through the skull. All of a sudden the person was a \"crime scene\" and they had to call the police again and leave the person as untouched as possible.\n\nI believe it was later confirmed that the person had shot himself, but it could have been a murder.\n\nEdit: this blew up! Thanks for all the upvotes. As someone pointed out there must have been some information that was missed between the police and coroner. I myself was not present , but I do believe the story is true, as it is now a lecture in why you should always examine for skull trauma and not just assume something before knowing.\n\n\nAlso edit: there seem to be a lot of interest so I have added another story which is unfortunately true, but crazy.",
            "This is a copy with slight edits where I answered something similar before, but I am not a doctor but I did an internship in a coroners office for a summer. My job was to help with autopsies, clean up the office, dispose of old bags of organs (bags with pieces from each organ are required to be kept for 5 years unless homicide, SIDS, or unknown cause of death), data entry, and other odds and ends. Two stories that really stick out:\n\nOn my first day I was to help with an autopsy of a homeless man who was living in a storage unit. Remind you it\u2019s the summer, he was relieving himself in buckets that he also kept in the storage unit. He died in there and wasn\u2019t found for a month. Anyways when we rolled him out into autopsy you could smell him through the bag it was so bad, I can\u2019t articulate how bad it was, but I was gagging and we hadn\u2019t even started. But then something weird happens, one of the techs puts a sheet down on the floor before we roll the cart onto it. I\u2019m like why? We\u2019re gonna have a disgusting stinky sheet now. That\u2019s when the bag is opened, and I don\u2019t see a body. I see hundreds of maggots crawling all over and they start to fall off the cart. I was then informed I had to stomp on all the maggots as they fell so they didn\u2019t spread throughout the building. So here I am, playing the worst game of dance dance revolution in history over a half liquified skeleton holding my nose so I don\u2019t puke.\n\nThe other story is that in the basement where we would keep all the organ bags and stuff like that we also had notable objects from old crime scenes like murder weapons etc. For some reason there were a lot of jars of fetuses but that\u2019s a different story. Anyways, there was a buttplug in a bag that had the case number written on it. Now I found this during the first week of my internship, and I kept wondering, how does someone die by a buttplug?  Now I had access to all case files as I had to enter data and all that Jazz. So eventually I ended up looking up the case and it turns out an older guy had it in as he was jacking off to a magazine called \u201cThe Spanking Times\u201d. Obviously he died as his buttplug was in our office, but the autopsy showed he had a heart attack presumable as he climaxed. I suppose there are worse ways to go.",

            "In college I took a figure drawing class and the teacher was adement that you couldn\u2019t draw the figure if you didn\u2019t know what was in it so he drug us over to the anatomy lab and had the anatomy teacher show us two cadavers that were being dissected by their med students. \n\nWhen it came time to ask questions of course \u201chave you ever found something weird\u201d in a body came up. \n\nThe story is as follows. \n\nThey get a body, and for legal reasons they aren\u2019t told much about the person aside from medical history. They *were* told that the old man was a sort of rock star type and was a one hit wonder from his youth and to use extra discretion with him in particular/not tell the students who might recognize him. The lab is full of 20 year olds and so nobody recognized who he was (unsure if the teacher even knew but it didn\u2019t sound like she did) or what his deal was so they wrote it off as non useful information aside from his lifestyle. He had drug use and alcohol issues in his life and they were told he partied a lot. Cool. \n\nThe body has a raging boner. Like 100% of the time. Teacher doesn\u2019t think much of it aside from that he was particular endowed and everybody wrote it off as not important to their studies. So they go through the general dissection that they do. One kid wants extra credit and the teacher said sure, dissect his penis/see why it\u2019s hard still and write a report (apparently they don\u2019t normally do that for that particular class so the penis itself goes untouched from their dissections so it would have otherwise always been a mystery) \n\nKid finds an actual rod that he had medically inserted under the table (not in medical records) so that he would always have a boner and could get it up while on drugs. They suspect it was done over 30-40 years prior to his death. \n\nThey removed it and keep it in the lab I believe to show their students as part of a section on under the table medical surgeries. \n\nAnyways, that was probably the best day in figure drawing class I\u2019ve ever had.",

The people suggested that my sister NOT look at the body for identification and she said she had to but asked me to go with her. He didn\u2019t look like the same person or really like a person. His hand was formed into a clawing type of position with it frozen in place and bent in the wrong direction in more than one place. The only thing I could make out of his facial feature was an indicator of some sort of mustache though it was shaped in a very odd manner. The rest of his face didn\u2019t look human nor did the way his body was twisted at odd angles that were not normal.

            "My mom loves this story:\n\nMy aunt got accepted into nursing school, but had to get prerequisites done in the summer. She knew someone who pulled some strings, and she was put into a pre-med class that taught pretty much the same thing as one of her nursing classes. She was the only woman, and because she has always looked younger than she is (and she was only 20 to begin with), and she\u2019s really pretty, all the pre-med students groaned and complained that she would keep hold the class back. \n\nAnyway, time came for the cadaver lab. The decedent had been in a car accident. The lab director and professor kept telling them that they weren\u2019t looking for a cause of death\u2014it had already been determined\u2014they were just looking at the anatomy. \n\n My aunt was looking over the x-rays and asked, \u201cwhat were the circumstances of the accident\u201d (my grandpa was a fire fighter/paramedic, so she knew that was a huge thing). The professor is like \u201cWe\u2019re not looking for the cause of death. We told you, it was trauma from a car accident.\u201d My aunt responds, \u201cThere\u2019s a small spot on his kidney right here on the x-ray\u201d.\n\nThey went and checked the kidney, and sure enough, there was a tiny tumor in his kidney. Based on the size and placement, it was determined that the tumor would have caused excruciating pain similar to a kidney stone\u2014based on that information and the nature of the car accident, they said the man either blacked out from the pain while driving, or had a sharp, sudden pain that caused him to lose control of the vehicle. \n\nThey had to change the death certificate to add that to the contributory causes. \n\nAnd my aunt also set the curve for the class. \n\nAnd, two years later, she passed the boards with the top score. While in labor. My cousin was literally born 3-4 hours after my aunt pretty much aced the boards. \n\n***My mom just informed me she merely passed the boards. My mistake. \n\nI\u2019m glad the pre-med students didn\u2019t hold her back.",
            "Well idk about revelation to their death but I work in a cadaver lab at a university and we once found a brain with a massive hole proceeding the third ventricle (essentially a chamber for cerebral spinal fluid).

But when i was cutting there were this perfectly human little white form, not more than 3cm, i was shocked and very sad, we all in the room stood quiet\nOne time we also received a liver with cancer, usualy they weight 2/3kg, but this one was 7kg it was so huge we needed 2 people to hold it and had to buy a special box to keep it.

            "Oh my God this just reminded me\n\nI'm a vet student and we have a pathology class where we do autopsies on dead animals (most of them submitted by local farms to see if there's something that may be contagious, or to see if the death was a result of the way of living, some owners wanting to know what happened to their pets, etc). At first it's kind of disturbing but after a few autopsies you get used to it. So anyway, during class one of the technicians brings in a big box, and you can hear chirps from the inside. Our professor was still focused on the first autopsy of a dog, but I managed to slip a bit closer to the box. Little chiks! The were adorable so I stuck around to observe them. The technician then moves them all into a plastic container and asks me to hold the lid. I figured it was to prevent the babies from jumping out so I gladly helped. However, before I can even process what's going on, she tells me to pop open the lid just enough for her to slide a hose in, and I automatically do so. She then tells me not to flinch. I saw that the hose was connected to a big red cylinder but didn't put two and two together until it was too late. Next thing I know the loud PRSSSSSST sound comes and there's cold white mist coming from the container, the loud chirps getting fainter.\n\nThe chicks were sent in by a farm as specimens because there was a disease or something that contaminated the whole farm. They needed to perform an autopsy on them. The technician was had to find an efficient way to preserve the specimens. She froze them to death with a fire extinguisher. I then knew what it was like to be an accessory to murder.\n\nI firmly believe I will never, for as long as I live, forget the dread of hearing chirps getting fainter and fainter until they stopped altogether. \n\nIf you really really really love animals, don't go to vet school.\n\nEdit: y'all really went and made my most traumatic experience in aiding to the murder of lil chicks my most upvoted comment, huh.",

Me being the 16 year old Bible-belter surrounded by rednecks that I was, I wanted a big cross filled in with an American flag on my arm. I'm now an atheist who doesn't care about patriotism at all and cannot be happier that my ass didn't have the money at the time. Moral of the story - if you're going to get a tattoo before you're 20, I advise getting something simple and non-controversial, because you never know where your life is going to take you and tattoos are permanent."

            "My husband and I back country camped on our second date. He was a pro so I trusted him abs he says he was impressed at my willingness to be bold and do something adventurous.\n\nWe spent several hours hiking in to spot with only conversation and the woods. We set up camp and cooked together. The feeling was peace. Just at peace to be with each other, work as a team and comfortable with the quiet and fire. I knew he was the one that night.\n\nI always thought love at first sight would be a powerful rush or energy. Turns out it feels like coming home. \n\nWhen your soul feels at peace, that\u2019s a green flag my friends.",
            "Early in our dating days, I was on a train with my now-husband. The inspector was checking our tickets while we were about to pull away from the station when my husband spotted a woman come running down the platform. He pointed this out to the inspector, who stuck his arm out the window and held the train until she got on. \n\nMy husband was so casual about it, didn\u2019t think anything of it really, and it was a small action, but one that likely made her day better. \n\nI thought it said a lot about his character, that he\u2019d help out a stranger who didn\u2019t even know it.  \n\nI was right, he is still that kind of guy!",
            "This was one of the most romantic things my husband did when we were early-ish in our relationship. He doesn't even remember it or think it was a big deal but it was a *huge* green flag for me.\n\nI was preparing to move to a new apartment and had a ton of stuff going on in my life, including trying to coordinate moving out with expensive heat treatment for bedbugs that my a-hole landlord refused to be involved with. I was super stressed and drained and when I was cleaning the fridge one of the shelves inside literally shattered. I was basically beside myself and so frustrated because I knew that said a-hole landlord was going to screw me on my security deposit now after all I put up with. So I vented to my husband (then boyfriend) and was basically just like I give up, everything is the worst. \n\nThe next day he let me know that he had looked up my fridge model, found the shelf as a standalone piece and ordered it and it would be there in two days (or whatever). I cried. I was so, so grateful. I was so overwhelmed and emotionally exhausted over the bedbugs and moving and everything else and the fact that he saw that and just *took something off my plate and handled it* was such a relief. It showed me what a supportive partner he could be and it was just what I needed. \n\nAlso, when my parents' dog which I'd grown up with got old and stopped being able to jump onto his favorite chair, my husband (then boyfriend) *built a ramp for the dog* so he could still get up there to sit with my mom. And he matched it to her decor on purpose.\n\nThese were all things he just felt like \"well, of course, it was needed\" about, but they reinforced what a caring, thoughtful, loving, true partner he was. He still seeks out ways to do little things to make my life easier all the time, many years later.\n\nObviously these examples are specific, but hopefully you see the overall \"green flag\" qualities they showed.",
            "My husband and I have endless conversations. There's nothing we can't talk about. Nothing. The first time we ever chatted on the phone we talked for 6 hours. \n\nWe've been together for 15 years and STILL talk every day, several times a day. We love our breakfast time because we chat after eating and really enjoy each other's company. We love talking no matter where we are. And since he also works from home, we work together. There's lots of times we're saying nothing, just enjoying being around each other. \n\nBut I love that we can talk about anything we want and it doesn't descend into an argument.",

            "Taking embarrassing shit in stride.  This was pretty literal for me.   \n(Sorry, this is my second post).   \nI used to have Ulcerative Colitis really severely, which led to me shitting myself far more often than one should shit themselves in their early 20s. When I first started seeing my husband, (who has ASD), we'd drive from campus to my apartment, and I'd be like, white-knuckle concentrating on not shitting myself in his car, run up the stairs, usually barely making it to the bathroom before he walked through the door. \n\nOne night I didn't make it. I'm basically hiding in the bathroom and turn on the shower b/c it's a gross mess. On the other side of the door, he's all \"Why are you always so mad at me when we drive to your place? Did I say something?\"   \nHe'd been reading my \"try not to shit\" face as \"I'm angry\".   \nSo I came clean and admitted I'd just shit myself, preparing for him to sort of back out slowly and end  things as quickly as would be polite (this was within out first two months). \n\nHis response instead : \n\n\"Oh. So you just shit yourself? Where are your jeans?\" \n\n\"In the garbage...\" \n\n\"That's silly. Jeans are expensive. The laundromat is locked for the night, but do you have a bucket or something? We can soak them overnight and wash them tomorrow.\"   \n\"...you're really not grossed out?\" \n\n\"\\*shrug\\*. Not like you could help it. Just like...talk to me. I thought you were mad. Tell me what's going on, you know?\"   \n\n\n  \n\n\nI had feared that exact scenario since I started having UC symptoms. And my future hubs...just rolled with it. Years later, when I had my colectomy, he bathed me in the hospital. After that, when he had to have a circumcision @ 25, I looked after his stitches/changed his bandages several times a day...and we laughed about how gross stuff was. He's seriously the best.",

I didn't have a choice...it was \"his home\" and he could do whatever he wanted. Whatever. My brother is 3 years older than me but hadn't made the best financial decisions at that point and now lived with me. He started eating and drinking everything that was mine, I'd have to fight him to get half the utilities (and this was after not paying anything at all for the first 8months), and it was always just a fight. I had one rule, no food or drinks (other than water) in his bedroom. I'd helped him move out of multiple places and I didn't want that bedroom to become like the places he'd been at before. He didn't respect the one rule. It was a pain. \n\nSo one day, I woke up at 5am to get ready for work and notice that my new bag of goldfish was in the trash. He'd eaten the whole bag that night after I went to bed. I'll admit, I was feeling emotional due to mother nature occurring, and also the fact that my food and drinks would always be taken by him. So I immediately start bawling over a bag of goldfish crackers. I call my dad up (he worked early so I didn't wake him) and I'm hysterical on the phone. So here I am, like 26 years old, crying on the phone early in the morning to my dad who is gravely concerned that something horrible has happened, and all I can get out between my dramatic sobs is, \"He *sobs* ate *sobs* my *sobs* goldfishhhhhhh *more hysterical crying*.  My dad was super nice and told me he'd handle it and I went to work, but everytime I thought if it I'd start tearing up at work. I had texted my bf about it while I was at work, he sent flowers to my work, and when I got home he had wine, and 2 bags of goldfish crackers and then cuddled my dramatic ass on the couch while we drank. Green flags all the way. \n\nI mean, it was a lot of things that built up over time and the goldfish were just the last straw that broke me....but also his 26year old gf was hysterical over goldfish crackers....soooooooo",

Most actors had their own professiinal german voice artist for as long as I can think and that was just how it was done, period. Some even outdid the original and instantly, Bruce Willis comes to mind.  I swear, his german voice is so much more badass than the original.\n\nUnfortunately, things have changed in recent years and even the most well known actors might be dubbed by a different voice artist in every other film they appear in. It's like nobody gives a shit anymore about something that was so sacred once. The X-Files of late became unwatchable because of Duchovny's new voice. Imagine the shit show when first Marge Simpson's german voice died and then Homer's not too long after and they were perfect. \n\nTo make a long story short, my day is save whenever I watch an episode of Modern Family and Ed O'Neill comes on, because in times when nobody cares anymore, someone actually went through the trouble to track down the very particular sounding voice actor of good ol' Al Bundy after decades and asked him if he wanted the job and thank heavens, he said Yes!! \n\nI cannot put my finger on why that is such a deep satisfying feeling every time I hear his long lost familiar voice, but it works like a charm for me every single time.",

I rarely went because I just wasn\u2019t a fan of bars or her drinking friends. One night she went out with a couple that I didn\u2019t mind that much.

Sure enough he was friends with one of my ex\u2019s friends. \n\nI knew his name now and that I wasn\u2019t as crazy as I thought. I sat on the information though. The next weekend she goes out drinking again and still had not returned home at 4 am. I tried contacting her multiple times and I got no response. I woke up to her coming home at 7 am and jumping in the shower immediately. I decided to check her phone while she was in the shower, and she kept all of the messages with this same guy. Some pretty telling information in the text thread. While she was still showering I grabbed a fresh pair of clothes and headed to my best friends house. 20 minutes later I get a phone call with her going ape shit about me leaving and not saying anything. I laughed at the projection, told her that if she wasn\u2019t moved out by Monday the police would be there to force her out.

It did sort of explain the pretty brunette that followed him off the plane at the airport and kept looking at my kids and I at the luggage carousel (what an ass to make his side piece come face to face with his wife and kids).

            "4yrs ago I was dating a girl who became distant and disinterested in a lot of things we both enjoyed together. Despite attempts to talk about it, she only grew more distant then became less available to hang out and suddenly was working late a lot. I started getting suspicious about cheating when she was on her phone nonstop. Again I tried to talk about it but she wouldn't engage. She also just didn't want to break up with me for whatever reason. \n\nI was actually going to end it on my own, but one weekend when she was seemingly unavailable, some mutual friends told me they spotted her with a dude from her work and they were all over each other. Coincidentally, she had also lent me her ipad and it was synced to her phone so I saw lots of texts between those two over that weekend. They were talking about running away together, etc. \n\nHe was married and her supervisor. Mutual friends were also composed of her coworkers and reported them to HR.

            "This isn't my story, but my parents.\n\nMy mom had a boyfriend when my parents met, and she broke up with him to be with my dad. Fast forward ten years or so my parents are married with two kids: my older brother and me.\n\nAnyway, she travels for work semi-often and she started taking trips to see her \"friend\" in Chicago. I was young enough that I don't really remember when it started, but my I noticed that my dad was really irritable on these weekends. I think I was about twelve when I realized what was going on. I figured it out before my brother did. I used to sit at the top of the stairs and listen to my parents argue. I don't even remember if I heard something that gave it away, if it slowly dawned on me as I grew up, or if one day it just hit me. It's always just been a part of my life that my mom lies. Still is.\n\nMy dad used to beg me to not say anything to her that I knew because A) he was desperate to keep the family together and 2) my mom would get on *his* case for getting the kids involved. No joke.\n\nOne day, during the summer after I graduated high school, I came home from work to find my mom in the garage loading up her car. I asked her why she was putting blankets in her car and she got quiet for a moment and said \"well... I'm moving out.\" I just went inside. \n\nLater she texted my dad that she had moved to her brother's house. That's how he found out. They were married for twenty years and she sent him a fucking text message. I don't know if she was planning on telling me at all if I hadn't happened to come home when I did, or if she would have just disappeared. There have been times when she left without telling me she was going somewhere. I'd realize that I hadn't seen my mother in a few days and ask my dad where she was and he'd be like \"Oh, she didn't tell you? She's in 'Montreal' for a week.\" Or something like that. So anything possible.\n\n\nETA: also this thread had around 300 comments when I started typing this and by the time I posted it was at 1.3k so this is totally going to get buried lmao",
            "June 1, 2018. Normal day. A Friday. My husband had kissed me goodbye and gone to work. I was cleaning the house for company who was coming to stay the weekend. The doorbell rang. There was a man at my door who introduced himself as the husband of a woman who my husband worked with. He was there to tell me that my husband and his wife were having an affair. He had busted them about six months prior and had told his wife that she had to end the affair. He thinks that she did end it...for about three months, but then they started up again. When he found out they were at it again, he called my husband (because he knew if he confronted him in person, he'd be in a jail cell for what he'd have done). On the phone, he told my husband to leave his wife alone or else he would come and tell me everything that was happening. Apparently, my husband thought that he was bluffing.\n\nSo I was literally the last to know. My husband never came home again. He got an air b'n'b and a lawyer. The divorce was December 21, 2018. We had been together for 24 years. Still hurts.",
            "I owned a house with my fianc\u00e9. I woke up in the middle of the night and he wasn\u2019t in bed. I went searching. His truck and another vehicle were in the driveway. Then, I went upstairs and found the guest bedroom was locked. After barging my way in... I found him with another woman in bed. That bed happened to be my childhood bed. He forced me out of the room... literally grabbed me by the neck and pushed me out and closed the door back. I knew I couldn\u2019t do anything at that point, so I called his parents who lived a few blocks away. His dad showed up and another fight broke out. I ended up leaving and staying at his parents until dawn. I moved out that weekend and let the house foreclose. 9 years later.. it\u2019s finally off my credit report, I\u2019m happily married to an amazing man and we own a beautiful home together.",
            "Edit due to pronoun issues TLDR: My ex husband was sleeping with his best friend\u2019s wife while I was 8 months pregnant, it had been going on for a while.\n\nI was 8 months pregnant with our second child at the time and he wanted to go visit his brother for the weekend. I asked my doctor if it was safe for me to travel and she said it would be fine. I told my husband I could go but he said he was really hoping to just have some time with his brother, I understood because a new baby really makes it hard to spend quality time but I asked if he could take our older son (3yo at the time) so he could see his grandma and cousins. He said they were planning on drinking and whatnot and wasn\u2019t sure it would be a good idea. (They\u2019re country boys so think shooting, drinking and whatnot) I agreed and he left for the weekend. After he left I get a call from his best friend telling me that he\u2019ll be in town for the weekend and he wanted to meet up, not weird he called me because my husband was terrible at answering his phone. I told him unfortunately my husband was visiting back home, bad timing. His best friend then said ok, I\u2019m going to call you back. And hung up very abruptly. Turns out my husband and his wife had been caught by him a few months previously and he gave them a chance to make it right...I don\u2019t know why. He didn\u2019t tell me but threatened to if they didn\u2019t stop. Well, they didn\u2019t stop and he told me.  I think the worst part was that my husband\u2019s family knew and never once thought to tell me. These people were my family for 5 years and nothing. It\u2019s been almost 10 years now and I\u2019m so much happier but it was definitely an eye opening experience.",
            "The husband of one of the women he was cheating on me with called me at work. At first I didn't believe him and hung up. How could the man i spent the past 8 years with,had 2 beautiful babies with, suffered together the loss of one of those children do something so hurtful?? Still a part of me had doubt. He had affairs in other relationships and we had a rocky patch early in the beginning where I suspected an affair but didn't have proof.\nI told my boss I felt sick and had to leave early and I called this guy back and found out that my ex and his wife along with one of their friends were all sleeping together for about a year. He had confronted my ex and told him that he was going to tell me but my ex convinced him to wait a month since my mother had just died. I took my time coming home and confronted him and told him to pack and leave. Since I've pieced together a lot of what happened and all the lies he told me where if I was in a different headspace I might have caught on to the affairs earlier. I also found videos hidden on one of our computers and found out he was having bootycalls in our apartment while I was at work and he was watching our daughter. At that point it put the headstone on any possibility of reconciliation.",
            "I found a used condom on the bathroom floor.\n\nI just emailed him a 30 day end of tenancy notice.  (I own the house.)",
            "I was married. \n\nOut of the blue while at work I get an email that says (husbands name) \u2018s wife. \n\nWhen I open the email it lists off a name and says (husbands name) married to her. Check on Facebook \n\n(English was not the first language, this was overseas) \n\nSo I do and what do I see? Tons and tons and tons and tons of pictures of a woman with my husband. The woman and her kids with my husband. The woman and her family with my husband. \n\nI was stunned to say the least. It was October 6th 2017, 7 months after I almost died from an ectopic pregnancy. Yep we were trying at that point to have kids. \n\nAfter work I went home and started throwing all of his stuff in the dumpster. He was out of town at the time so I had plenty of time to do it. Spent all of Saturday and Sunday throwing EVERYTHING he owned in the dumpster. \n\nA month later I moved to a new apartment and waited until then to tell him I was divorcing him. \n\nHe then killed himself a few months later",
            "Oh story time!!! Classic love at first sight. I love you after 2 weeks. Moved in together after 2 months. Engaged after 6. Been together for 4 years and change. Left my rent control bachelor pad and Picked a bigger apartment so she could have her art studio. Did everything together and split all bills 50/50. We had different jobs in the same industry and made around the same money. We really loved each other and, as cliche as it sounds, completed each other: I am very analytical and stoic and she is a liberal artist. \n\nShe goes to ComiCon in NYC (she is an expositor) I help her pack. I drop her at the airport. Everything was fine. No signs of anything. She should be back in 4 days. \n\nShe never came back home. She Simple disappeared. Ghosted. The day she should be home I freak out that she may be dead just to find myself blocked on everything: email, phone, social media, the works. \n\nEverything I know is due to the bills she left behind (all unpaid) the credit card we shared (she stopped paying 2 months before) and her cell phone bill (which T-Mobile was nice enough to give me a log because technically was on my SSN). Found one particular NYC area code over and over on the call history and put 2+2 together. She met him on San Diego ComiCon few months before and methodically and systematically put together a plan to abandon me, take as much as she could to NYC and never look back. \n\nPlot twist: she maxed our credit card and amazon card furnishing their new home in NYC. By the time grief turned into practicality it was too late for me to cancel everything. I literally had to log in and see all purchases of houseware, made with my money, for a house I will never live in. \n\nI could not live at our house or afford our lifestyle in one income alone. It was a good 6 months of Blackout drunk, tinder and overall self loath. I am sure I caused damage to other people in the process. It wasn\u2019t even the love part that hurt me the most but the flat out betrayal and economic damage (took me over an year of living paycheck to paycheck to get all balances to zero).\n\nShe is a Redditor: if you are reading this E. Frye. I don\u2019t hate you, but you destroyed my self-steen forever. I cannot ever trust anyone ever again. You ripped my heart from my chest, watched it die slowly and didn\u2019t care for the mess. \n\nEdit: thanks for the wishes but please don\u2019t hate on her. To this day, all I wanted is to know why she did it. Where did I fail as a partner or as a man.\n\nEdit 2: [This is the gentleman she left me for. ](https://www.bookishbelle.com/2019/12/30/pietro-filipponi-2-years-later/) I\u2019ve became close friends with his Ex (she wrote the column linked above) and we shared stories and became good friends. That helped me a lot. Zoe: you rock!!! \n\nEdit 3: who would know my biggest heartbreak would blow up? thanks for the support. Please do not hate on her. I am not suing anyone (it is been 2ish year by now and TBH I would pay to know why she left over trying to get my money back) total amount was $7kish give or take plus having to move out and loosing a nice rent control condo. Money come and goes; lack of closure may last forever.\n\nFinal edit: It\u2019s crazy how much people can change in such a small amount of time. How you can think you know someone in and out, but they can still surprise you in the worst ways. How they can say such nasty, childish things when before you had so much respect for how they held themselves and how they acted. And regardless of how much you prepare yourself, it still hurts. You just have to remind yourself that not everyone has the same heart you do. And regardless of how angry it might make you, nothing is worth sinking to that level. Being the bigger person is always the only positive to come out of something so negative. Be safe out there.",
            "Very unhealthy relationship. He was emotionally very abusive and I was in a terrible place with my mental health.\n\nI found out at the ultrasound to determine the gender of our child. He was late and I was noodling on Facebook waiting to be called. \n\nHe was tagged in some photos in my news feed from a gig he\u2019d been at on the previous weekend.\nRandom lass was in all the photos of him and they were all over each other. Also they were making out in the background of one photo.\n\nHe turned up after I was called in. While the technician was printing the images I told him I knew. \nHe went off and on about how I was making it up, he\u2019d never do that, obviously I was lying to compensate for cheating on him and so on. When I pointed out there were photos he stormed out and left me there.\n\nMy Dad had turned up during the appointment (anticipating that he\u2019d react badly if we were having a girl, which he did, that was scattered through the cheating denials) and took me home.\n\nI considered us broken up at that point and stopped all contact except texts related to the pregnancy.\n\nMostly I was relieved. I had concrete evidence that it wasn\u2019t in my head and I finally managed to escape that relationship.",
            "Ex-wife actually asked me for her blessing to commit adultery with another married man.  She was shocked when I said I don't support it, she went ballistic (has severe mental health issues), went and did it anyway and ended up in a psych ward.  2 marriages ended and now the two cheaters are engaged.\n\nLittle devastated at first.  Blessing in disguise.",
            "I caught my ex sexting a chick and telling her how he missed her on my birthday. I was young at the time and reacted with crying and yelling. If it ever happened now I would just get up and leave. No point in trying to mend the relationship because its near impossible to gain the trust that was lost.\n\nEdit: spelling error\n\nEdit: Thanks for the award. Its really sad how many people have gone through this same experience, I hope all of you are in a better place now.",
            "Long term relationship for 3 years. I took him to the hospital because he had unknown rashes on him. Long story short, he was diagnosed with syphilis. I was tested, and was not (no idea how i dodged that). I got treated anyway.  I was so stupid in my early twenties.",
            "Funnily enough the girl he was cheating on me with actually told me. She messaged me at 3 in the morning asking if I was still with my ex and I said yes he\u2019s asleep next to me, why? She told me what happened, sent me screen shots and I grabbed his phone. I believed her but ya know just wanted to see it all for myself. I left the room and looked through it all, he didn\u2019t even try to hide it. I went back in threw something at him to wake him up and confronted him, of course he played dumb. Said he didn\u2019t know who I was talking about blah blah blah. Then I said oh ok well maybe this will jog your memory and pulled his phone out of my pocket. The look on his face was priceless. He knew it was over. I screamed at him, called him every name under the sun and then he left the house. This was a year ago and then a few months after that I\u2019m being told that he misses me, fucking pathetic.\n\nEdit: to make it all worse, I uprooted my life completely across the country to be with this guy and this is how it ended",
            "I couldn't find my then wife after she got off work one afternoon/evening. I tried to call her cell phone with no answer. She didn't show up to the house until 9:30 pm. She weaved some tale about getting stuck in traffic. I did some sleuthing and pulled the State Farm good driving app up which tracks your movements. I found out she had been leaving work early, going to the nearby rest area off of the expressway, and having sex with a 20-something trucker she met at her previous job. I decided to interrupt the festivities one afternoon. I showed up to the rest area, parked in front of his rig, and jumped right up to the door. The cabin shade was drawn. I withdrew the shades and saw my loving ex wife with a meth pipe in her hand and was going to town on this guy. He had the gall to tell me to give them privacy. I didn't handle it very well. I called the cops, they both were arrested for possession, and I promptly filed for divorce. The icing on the cake is that a few months after I left, she cheated on her new trucker friend and is well on her way to her 7th \"friend\". God speed, you wet, musty nightmare.",
            "Was (~6 months in) recovering from being hit by an SUV as a pedestrian that left me with a severe TBI (GCS of 4), broken back (3 places), legs (two places), and pelvis (2 places). I had moved back in with my then-GF for about a week when we went to a party and I got left at the party because she couldn't find me. I didn't know any of these people as they were all her friends and none of them could help me get home when I was told she left with the group we arrived with. I managed to walk back to the apartment quite drunk, tired, and in pain from over using my still recovering injuries; banged on the door till my knuckles bled only to have a dude answer the door, let me in, and then he proceeded to crawl back into bed next to her, in my bed. I didn't have the cognitive ability to deal with that. So I laid down right on the floor next to the bed and and passed out. She broke up with me the next day and blamed me for it. This story has so much more detail to it, but I don't want to re-live that year of trauma in too much detail.\n\nTl;Dr: walked in from a party to them in my bed in my room.

She had everything public, photos with him, bragging about the texts they exchanged etc. \n\nSo I engineered a way to befriend her roommate, I would then find out she was bringing other dudes home besides my boyfriend and when I confronted him I also let him know about who else she was sleeping with and for him to get an STD test.",

            "In a relationship for 6 years, broke up 1 month before our wedding because I found out my fianc\u00e9e had cheated on me... \nTwo years into my relationship with my-then-fianc\u00e9e lots of suspicious little acts kept adding up, the biggest one being that I found some condoms were missing from my drawer, confronted my fianc\u00e9e at the time (I was very sad/angry/confused), she denied any affair, 4 years went by, and about a month before our wedding, she broke down and confessed that she had indeed slept with her ex boyfriend at the time because she was depressed and was simply seeking any sort of way to feel something else. That broke my heart. I was also in the middle of an insane work day from home and had to power through the rest of the job with that on my mind; not fun. Anyways, I had always had a bad feeling that she had been lying to me over the years, and she had an undying jealously towards all of my friends who are women; she was clearly projecting.... It hurt  bad that she had cheated on me, but hurt waaaaaay worse that she had lied to me for four years AND went along with planning the wedding. I\u2019m am grateful that she told me before the wedding since we called it off due to the mistrust (amongst many other things that weren\u2019t going well in our relationship; we met at a young age so no big surprise). I genuinely believe that she was going through some really heavy emotional turmoil from her past so I don\u2019t take it so personally. I wish her well. With that said, I have cut off all communication to her because I simply could not trust her after that. All\u2019s well that ends well; and have met the love of my life, and we plan to get married as soon as this Covid-19 takes a hike and it\u2019s safe to gather in groups again.\n\nEdit: changed fianc\u00e9 to Fianc\u00e9e because spelling matters",

So later that day I went on his phone (I would never usually do this) and found many naked girls on his phone, screenshots of snaps. I also found pictures of me I didn't know he took. I called my best friend and cried. She told to confront him so I did. His response was it's normal for men to keep their porn on their phones and was smug about his response until I mentioned they were screenshots.",
            "Visited my long distance bf over spring break in Nebraska since he was stationed there. Before knowing anything, I ended up meeting and having lunch with the girl he was cheating on me with (I sat next to her and he sat across from us) and his coworkers/friends and hung out with the same group twice more. I could tell she didn\u2019t like me but I brushed it off since I was there for my ex and could care less about her feelings toward me. Later in the week, I asked if I could send a text from his phone to one of our mutual good friends and saw walls of texts from her giving him an ultimatum to end our relationship. My ex and this girl had also been texting throughout the week where he\u2019d called her the same pet names he called me and he\u2019d call her the most beautiful woman after she\u2019d send him her outfits/selfies all while being in the same bed/room with me. \n\nHe ended up ending their relationship and we decided to work on ours. I flew back home, he continued seeing her and having sex, gaslit me every time we FaceTimed making me feel like I cheated on him, and after 2 weeks of indecisive battling on the status of our relationship, I broke up with him. \n\nNo one is worth the mental gymnastics that comes from being cheated on.",
            "All these answers are about people who caught their spouses cheating, however I briefly became the \u201cother\u201d woman (unbeknownst to me) and it\u2019s never sat right with me. I was young, single and  going through a family crisis (sibling unexpectedly passing). I  met a guy who was fun and great and very \u201cbusy\u201d  which was exactly what I was looking for as I was grieving and didn\u2019t wAnt anything serious. 4 months of romance later I find out he\u2019s actually married with small children. We were with his colleagues after work at a bar and a coworker asked him where his wife was. I kept my cool, didn\u2019t make a scene but once drinks were over I obviously brought it up and said how terrible that made me feel. \n\nI ended up just ghosting him after that. I wasn\u2019t in the mental state to deal with any of the fallout so I just stopped replying to messages. I should have contacted the wife but I didn\u2019t want to bother playing relationship police. At the time I was under a lot of stress and grief and had my own problems and emotions to deal with. It\u2019s been 5 years and I always feel so terrible for the wife whenever I think about what happened. Sometimes I feel like contacting her and telling her what happened but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the right move or even worth it.",

            "My ex thought he had deleted the texts. I didn\u2019t usually go through his phone at all, but I had this suspicion that he was seeing someone else based on his behavior, his hiding his phone, and by staying later at work. I was actually really hurt, but mostly angry at myself for being stupid enough to date him. I had been warned he was no good but I wanted to fix him, and I ended up getting hurt just like all the others. \n\nMy reaction was initially asking him for an explanation. He tried to cover it, and lied to my face. I immediately told him to get the fuck out of my house and so he did. Which he responded to this by saying some very personal things about me on Twitter. It was a really bad time for me, and I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong. \n\nBut I picked myself up, got the courage to apply to a job at a larger company a few hours away, and ended up moving to a bigger city. It was there that I met my now husband. \n\nCouple years  later (when I was first dating my now husband) he messaged me trying to make amends and said he missed me. I ignored it, and honestly it felt so good to be able to say no to him. \n\nI\u2019m blessed actually, he sprung me forward and helped me more than he knows. Because if that hadn\u2019t  have happened, I don\u2019t think I would have applied for that job, would not have left my hometown, and I don\u2019t think I would have met my husband.

            "The story is remarkable in that it happened before the internet was widely available, in the very early 90\u2019s, when the world seemed much bigger. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 (Meg) had one semester left of college that had to be taken as an internship abroad for her major. She chose to go to Belgium for this internship. I stayed back & the plan was that I would set up house & when she returned that summer, she would move directly in & we would set a date for our wedding. So, while Meg was off in Europe, calling every couple of weeks to check in, (the long distance was super expensive back then) sending me postcards & letters, I moved in to a brownstone, bought furniture, etc... \n\nAbout a two weeks before Meg was supposed to return, I stopped in to a nearby coffee house that I had noticed down the block, but had yet to visit. To my surprise, I found that my neighbor from growing up in a completely different city, Claire, was a waitress there. We hadn\u2019t seen each other since high school, so we made a plan to meet up after her shift for a cup of coffee to catch up. We met & Claire told me that she was engaged as well, to a man, Ben, who was completing his course of study by working on an internship in...you guessed it, Belgium. I couldn\u2019t believe the coincidence, & told her about my fianc\u00e9, & that they HAD to know each other. Crazy, right? \n\nA couple days later, I stopped in for a cup of coffee & Claire looked extremely upset. She asked if I had time to wait, as she had a break coming up, & that she needed to talk to me. We went outside & she told me that she had gotten a call from her Aunt Sue the day before. Aunt Sue had just returned from Czechoslovakia, & that something very strange had happened. While they were touring Prague, Sue & her travel group had stayed in a local hotel & the next morning she had run into Claire\u2019s fianc\u00e9, Ben, in the lobby...with a female companion by the name of Meg. She said that he introduced her as a student from America, that they worked together, but it was very awkward & they both looked scared shitless. \n\nClaire said that she immediately called long distance to Belgium, & after several tries over the course of a day or so, got him on the phone. She asked him about the chance encounter & he said he had been kind of expecting her call, & ended up admitting that he had been seeing Meg pretty much the entire time they were in Europe, spending weekends & holidays traveling around with each other. I was floored. Couldn\u2019t believe it. \n\nI went home & started trying to call Meg at her dorm in Belgium, finally getting through to her late into the night, early morning for her. I point blank asked her if she was dating Ben. I didn\u2019t even explain how I knew about it. She hemmed & hawed for a moment, kind of acting like I was crazy for saying something so nonsensical, but when I said that I knew Claire, she dropped the facade & admitted to all of it. \n\nSo Ben & Meg had a very bittersweet homecoming. Meg got off much easier than Ben, as Claire had already left all of his belongings on the front lawn, from the day she found out, which had been pretty picked over by the time he got back two weeks later. I did pick Meg up from the airport, I think at the time I really just wanted to see her face when I told her that all of our friends knew what a piece of shit she was, & that I never wanted to see her again. \n\nTo this day I revel in how many utterly astounding factors of complete random coincidence went in to Meg & Ben (who later married, then later divorced after he cheated on her) being caught. The universe works in incredible & mysterious ways. \n\nEdit: removed TL;DR & inserted paragraphs to please the masses.",
            "She walked dogs for work. She said she was going on late night walks. She's fucking dumb though and had her pictures synced to the kids iPad. Daughter asked me \"Daddy, who is this?\"\n\nSo kids and I left to go see my mom, after her denying it up and down. Get a nest notification that there's movement in the apartment. Open the app, the guy is there and she's taken down all the family pictures. Got to hear and watch them have sex. I could only sit and breathe very heavily in anger. \n\nCall her, she denies it, says she's at work. I found out who he was through her Facebook likes. Messaged him all of our family pictures I had just spent $500 on, he just sent back a thumbs up and blocked me. Find his \"business\" website (life coach, LMAO). Email him, he writes a huge apology email saying she lied to him.\n\nTried to forgive her for the kids. It's a Saturday morning I want to take the kids to the park together. She has to \"work.\" Still has her iPad synced to her phone. We get back, kids want to FaceTime grandma. I open the app, I see she called him when she was at work. Finally fesses up. Huge fight, then she blames me. A wife with a good husband wouldn't cheat. Then she hits me in front of the kids, throws my phone and keys off a fourth floor balcony, because it was my fault.\n\nI moved out. Not a day goes by where she doesn't beg and plead for us to get back together. Now love is trauma for me, and I cannot let anyone love me without me assuming something sinister is behind it.\n\nI don't care about her at all, and it makes me want to throw up every time she tries to speak to me. It sucks because I have to deal with her the rest of my life for the kids.",
            "Was dating a girl during college. Took her on a vacation to the beach where I had planned on proposing to her as we had been together 4+ years. \n\nWhile she was in the shower checked her phone looking for something. Saw several pictures of her making out with someone from her college. Had apparently been happening for several months.\n\nWas an awkward drive home for sure.

            "He broke up with me after 8 years together, seemingly out of nowhere (I look back and see the signs now). He told me I was the cause of his severe depression/ attempted suicide, I had no clue he was even suferring with mental health issues. Obviously I carried a huge amount of guilt knowing I was the reason someone didn't want to be alive and took the break up really rough. \n\nOur cell phones were on the same bill and it would get sent in the mail. 3 months after we broke up I had the thought to check through the calls list, there was a number he was calling at all hours of the day/night every day. Decided to look back through previous bills from when we were together and sure enough same number and same volume of calls as far as 6 months prior to our break up. Called the number and a woman answered. Confronted him and he fessed up. I had a very hard time processing the fact the someone I trusted for 8 years would purposely make me feel like I was an awful human, when it was actually him all along.",
            "My now ex husband casually mentioned that his coworker (a woman) was having marriage difficulties.  The info he knew about her marriage was not casual info.  This was the kind of stuff you only tell someone you could confide in.  This set off my radar.  I told him at that point to be careful because she might be using him as her reason to end her marriage.  \nMaybe a month goes by and he decides to go on day-long road trip just to do his own thing.  He sets his alarm to wake early and he showers, shaves, etc.  On his way out of the house he asks me, \u201cdo I look okay?\u201d  \nThat day he spent \u201cdoing his own thing\u201d I searched and found a keylogger that I put on his pc.  Two days later I get the info that he and the coworker were together that day plus he was telling her about all the nice things he wanted to buy her when they were together.  \nSo, I called coworkers husband and we chatted.  He filed for divorce right away.  I, on the other hand, tried to work it out with my husband.  \nSeveral years later husband starts needing a lot of alone time.  Starts staying up later after I go to bed, gets up before me, works longer hours.  Again, I get those concerns he\u2019s cheating.  This time a keylogger won\u2019t work because its all on his phone.  I check the phone calls on the bill and there are so many calls to this one number.  He talked to this person more than he talked to me.  \nThis time I didn\u2019t try to work it out.  He had been unemployed for the previous 2 years, claimed he was looking for a job, and did zero around the house.  I mean, zero.  He didn\u2019t want to mow the lawn but when I said fine, hire a landscaper to do it he didn\u2019t want to.  Couldn\u2019t even make the damn phone call.  \nHe denied the affair but I just said it didn\u2019t matter and I wanted a divorce.  I believe he moved in with her as soon as I filed.  \nGood riddance. He\u2019s her problem now.  Last I heard from his sister he still doesn\u2019t work and he his wife (now) live off some settlement wife received which was running out.  \nJerk even had the audacity to ask my lawyer for maintenance aka alimony.  Like, no you lazy bastard, you have a degree and once had a career, not my fault you chose not to work.",
            "Typing this on my phone that does weird spell check stuff...\n\nI had my suspicions. He was supposed to go out of town and he came home early Packed his bag and ran out the door. Barely saying goodbye to me or our children. We lived on the fifth floor of an apartment building I looked out the window and saw him get into the car of a woman I could tell because she had a sunroof and I could see down into the car. The look on the guards face was priceless.\n\nLater I got a phone call from a woman who was very upset. She said she was his fiance. She said she worked for the airline and found that he was traveling with another woman. The other woman was the woman in the car.\n\nLater following my suspicions I found a receipt in his briefcase. It was for in a very expensive store. I went to the store with my two children one was a toddler at the other still in a stroller. I made up some story about why I needed to know what was purchased. Purchases were quite expensive. I was not allowed to buy clothing for myself. Keep in mind this is in an Asian country (we were expats there) and this was a very high-end store so they kept handwritten records in a notebook. They looked up the receipt and said \"oh yes Mr. Z, he was here with his Thai wife\". She looked up at me, waited a few beats, and then her face just fell and she said I'm so sorry. I said it's okay I just thought he was here with his Singaporean girlfriend.\n\nThe woman at the airline I believe has two children with him. The Singaporean women went on to have two children with him. And the Thai women had one child with him. All are younger than our two children.\n\nOh and then I was walking through a hotel and I caught him having breakfast with the woman he went on the trip with. And then another time I saw them drive past me in his car.\n\nI also found a trust document that, by the way, was totally fake that he wrote for the Singaporean women putting her in the family trust.\n\nKeep in mind I hadn't lived in the states for 10 years. I didn't have a driver's license. I didn't have bad credit I had no credit. I had no money. I couldn't go back to my job because technology has significantly changed. I had an 18 month old and a three-year-old. As all this was going on I was planning to somehow leave. Eventually I packed bags hid them away and try to figure out how to get back to the States. I didn't have access to money or credit card. He had the bright idea one day that I needed to go visit my parents. He bought me a one way ticket I figured he was never going to let me come back. That was fine with me. \n\nHe married the Singaporean women cheating on her the whole time. I know for a fact he was engaged to someone else for 4 years while they were married. After scamming that women out of hundreds of thousands of dollars. He basically dumped her. He moved to a different country and now he is married again with two children having never divorced the Singaporean woman. In actuality I don't believe they were truly legally married because he married her before we were divorced. By the way it took me seven years to divorce him.\n\nThe most awkward dinner I ever had was when our oldest graduated from graduate school. He came back to the states with the women he was engaged to for 4 years while married to the woman he was married to while still married to me. Are you following this? Anyway she was a very high government official. Very bright woman. I liked her very much. On the way to the dinner my daughter explained to her friend who was accompanying us \"so we're going to dinner with my dad who cheated on my mom with the woman we are trying to keep secret from his girlfriend who were having dinner with\".\n\nYes those are just some of the highlights!\n\nOooh I forgot when our youngest was 10 months old he wanted to do a get away to mend things. We went to Hong Kong. We flew separately because he had a meeting...so he said. He traveled more than 340 days one year and I finally figured out we flew separately because he was likely doing most of the flight attendants. Anyway, I arrived  at the hotel before he did and checked in. The Front Desk said \"Welcome back Mrs. Z!  I see you and Mr. Z were here with us last week as well.\"...Ummm that was the other Mrs. Z...\n\nOh...and he gave me an STD when I was pregnant with #2.",
            "I caught my ex husband cheating as an accident, we had gone to work in the evening and I couldn\u2019t get into my office due to a building screw up, so he let me in his so I could print something. \n\nHe went for a walk to get his \u201csteps\u201d in. As I was on his computer I realised it was logged in to Facebook. I just had a feeling. \n\nI looked in the messages and he had been chatting with a woman he met in another country via our work. \n\nI copied all I could and confronted him when he returned, made him take me for a drink and told him there would be no reconciliation. He was shell shocked and I told him to go home and pack a bag. That was 6 months ago and I\u2019m really happy to have lost the dead weight.\n\nHe was a difficult man, emotionally abusive, but I lived my vows and tried to help him as much as I could and reorganized my life around him.\n\nEdit due to questions: yes, he had some odd behaviours leading up to this (including a \u201cwork call\u201d from a woman on our family vacation). And in the texts he described wanting to have an affair with her, and they met periodically over 2 years, including one time he stayed with her for a month in her country. So yes, he cheated, not just a flirtation nor an emotional affair.",
            "I knew he had been unfaithful in the past but I didn\u2019t really love him so it was not that bad. \n\nHowever, I was bartending one night and this drunk chick walks up and tells me that I looked familiar. She then proceeds to yell, \u201coh my friend is fucking your husband!\u201d. So I walked into the beer keg cooler with a bottle of vodka. I downed some shots and went back to work. \n\nI held it in that I knew for a few months while I hired an attorney and figured out my next move. I had three kids to think of too. So I moved with my kids back home to Texas and got divorced. \n\nNow, I\u2019m engaged to my childhood best friend and we plan to marry in Yosemite next year. He\u2019s the complete opposite of my ex. Kind, supportive, and loving. \n\nSo fuck that sasquatch looking cheater!",

I assumed he and Sam weren't texting this way. I made him come talk to me outside and he lied saying it was an old girlfriend from high school who was going through a divorce and needed comfort. I knew this was a lie because he had no girlfriends in high school. I started crying and he told me to STOP CRYING. That was when I knew our marriage was over. How dare he be so callous to me when I just found out that he was cheating on me? Come to find out he had been sexting random women and hiring prostitutes.

            "Ok, get ready for this one.\n\n\nHanging out with my boyfriend one day, I saw a message thread while he was on his computer where he gave his Snapchat to a group of friends. I noticed it was not the same Snapchat I had for him... I didn\u2019t say anything at that moment, but remembered the username.\n\n\nSince seeing it, I had a terrible feeling. Later, I decided to try to log in to his account, and voila, the same password he used for everything worked.\n\n\nI immediately saw HUNDREDS of chats with different women, multiple unopened messages from just the past few hours, and a ridiculous Snapchat score. I scrolled through the many, many messages and realized this dated back for around 3 years. We had been dating for 4.5 years. I even found messages and dates from my birthday\u2019s and our anniversaries. Days where he spent the entire day with me and still managed to do this behind my back. \n\n\nI called him and demanded he come talk to me, he drove over and I got in his car and confronted him. He panicked and immediately started apologizing. I was young and livid, took his phone and drove to my best friends house.\n\n\nThere, I looked through his phone and found he had signed up for every dating app/site available (messages with multiple women on all of them), he posted videos of himself jerking off on Vine (yes, VINE of all places and again, tons of different women), and even responded to local Craigslist ads asking for sex. He even bothered to ask if they were clean! I found a secret email account too and tons of nudes of girls in there. I\u2019m sure there was more, but by then I had seen enough.\n\n\nHe desperately tried to redeem himself, changed his number, cleared his phone and got a shitty little flip phone, but you can\u2019t come back from that kind of damage. I had absolutely no idea too - he never did anything sketchy, we rarely fought. I was so in love with him. Turns out, of course, he was just great at hiding everything. I never saw it coming and the weight of it all absolutely crushed me.",

When he came back and I asked him, he blew up and began yelling at me that I was invading his space and he has a right to talk to whomever he wants. He ran out and deleted the messages. I followed and asked if that was his dealer since I thought he was planning to relapse on heroin. He was still super defensive and began arguing with me in front of his sister and her bf so I got up and left. \n\nThis went on for a few weeks and I just wanted us to go back to normal.

            "So this has a ton of responses so I doubt this will be read but I\u2019m going to tell my story anyway. \n\nI had a girlfriend who was great, we were together two years and living together in an apartment before I bought a duplex when the American housing market crashed. I didn\u2019t want her to feel trapped or anything so I said that it was my house and I would like her to live with me but that I would pay the mortgage and bills if she would just help with utilities and food. She lived with me for a year and started to have signs of depression, the duplex was a bit in the country and she talked about wanting to live in the city, so being the loving and trusting boyfriend I was, I moved her to an apartment in the city, including buying her furniture for her birthday and helping her move it in. We made it clear we were still together to all friends and family. We talked daily and did weekend dates in the city as well as nights at my place since it was close to the town we both grew up in and we had a lot of mutual friends who lived near me. (The city was probably 30-45 mins away depending on traffic) \n\nWell all our friends and us made plans to see a movie together that we all were VERY excited about coming out. She came up the day of and right before we were getting ready to go she got weird and said she was too tired to go. I explained that she could sleep but made sure she knew I still wanted to go as we had been planning this for months and I frequently didn\u2019t get to see this group of our friends due to work. She said that was okay as long as it was okay she didn\u2019t go, I left. The movie was great and I had a blast, I get home and she is awake, and blind drunk. \n\nI feel I should mention I am a police officer who specializes in interviewing (usually pedophiles) and I don\u2019t drink but I do have a very nice bottle of whiskey above my fridge for the days when I need to come home and have two fingers with a BIG meal before bed (not drunk but also no nightmares that way.) well, she had drank it all. I was a little upset about that but mostly just concerned, who gets super drunk by themselves when they could go out with their loving boyfriend and friends? Well I pride myself on not brining work into my personal life but the interrogator in my head went \u201chey dumb dumb, somethings wrong, figure it out.\u201d \n\nSome pro tips for anyone who is still reading. \n\nWhen asking someone a yes or no question, anything that isn\u2019t a \u201cyes\u201d or a \u201cno\u201d is the bad answer. \n\nExample: \u201cdid you kill that man?\u201d \n\u201cNo.\u201d \n\u201cDid you kill that man?\u201d \n\u201cWell, last week I went to the store...\u201d \n\nFirst it was that she kissed someone else, then when I pressed she admitted the full nasty details. \nI am not a big crier, it\u2019s good if people do but it\u2019s just not something I do well (hello childhood trauma) so tears came from my eyes for the first time in our relationship and she goes to comfort me. I said \u201coh no, you don\u2019t get to do that anymore.\u201d That really helped it hit home for her I think. I called her a cab and paid for her to leave, she tried to pay and I informed her \u201cI\u2019m the one who wants you gone, I\u2019m happy to pay.\u201d \n\nNo excuse for cheating.",
            "He left his facebook open. I saw his messages, he was telling his ex he was single and invited her to a wedding i was only told about vaguely. The messages got very sexual...Thankfully my friend was with me, she helped me calm down. I basically told him i was disgusted and didn't want to see him ever again. He tried apologizing, he tried giving me gifts, he even tried proposing to fix things. It made me hate him 100% more. I ended up calling his ex and informing her that we were in a three year relationship, i told her she could have him but he would most likely cheat on her too if he didn't already. She played stupid and said she didn't know what i was talking about so I'm assuming they're meant for each other. He tried to control me by holding my stuff hostage lol. I ended up telling him \"burn it, wear it, sell it, i don't fucking care.\" I got to start fresh with a whole new wardrobe and a whole new me. Couldn't be happier!",

            "I lived in a house with my best friend and my girlfriend, I was working one night at my pub and got a phone call from my best friend to the works telephone as I don\u2019t answer mine whilst I\u2019m working, apparently he came back from grabbing a few drinks with his work colleagues and found my now ex in bed with another man, my friend being completely wasted decided that he didn\u2019t like that and wound up throwing some naked Indian guy down the stairs and beating the hell out of him once he reached the bottom, I immediately came back and rushed from work to find the police at the door with the Indian guy in the back of the cop car wearing his boxer shorts and cuffs being attended to by a medic and my mate sat in the front room talking to the other officer, he was let off with a caution as it was an \u201cunderstandable\u201d reaction even though he was drunk. I am honestly so glad to say that he still lives with me because otherwise I would\u2019ve never found out",

            "This will probably be buried but I was in my third trimester with our son. I had a weird feeling about how he had been acting lately, nothing that stood out, just a feeling. We were getting ready to go on a date. He was getting in the shower and hesitated to put his phone down in front of me, I instantly knew. \n\nIn all of our years together I had never looked through his phone or I would have found out much sooner. He had a fwb situation for ten years with a married woman that he had known since high school. I would probably recognize her vagina if I saw it before her face.",
            "Wasn\u2019t my SO, but my dad in 2012. I guess he didn\u2019t set up iCloud correctly and so all of the messages that were being sent back and forth between my father and his mistress were being sent to me. I was 15 and already having mental breakdown, and having to show everything to my mom made everything so much worse.",
            "His phone died and he wanted to check his Facebook, so he logged onto his Facebook on my phone. He forgot to log out (and I assumed he logged himself out). \n\nWe were supposed to meet the next day (we didn\u2019t live in the same city) but he sent me a text saying he wasn\u2019t feeling well, so he went home. No problem there, I told him to take it easy and rest. Even offered to visit him and take care of him, but he said no. \n\nThat night I wanted to check my Facebook. Didn\u2019t realise his account was still logged in. Thought I had a private message. It was a message from the girl that had been chasing him for the past few months, saying she had fun that afternoon and they should hang out again soon. That \u201cmaybe next time they could go further ;)\u201d\n\nEverything clicked and I dumped him lol.",

            "I never actually caught him, because I didn\u2019t even try. I just got it some day. And in retrospect, he left a ton of clues. First there were the ads for dating sites that kept popping up on the tablet he had given me. Then he I skated on splitting *my* computer\u2019s hard drive into two separate partitions for absolutely no reason other than to \u201cgive each one of us their own space\u201d. Then he started stalking *me*, even though he was the one who had the time and means to cheat, especially as he has to travel for work 2-3 days a week, while I was stuck at home with one, then two toddlers, when I wasn\u2019t at work. He stalked me by following my every movement first via the \u201cfind your phone\u201d app he had installed on my phone, then by putting a tracking chip on my keychain. \n\nLife with him was hellish, so I said I needed some space and time by myself. A friend who was put of the country for 4 months offered me to stay at their place. We\u2019d have the kids alternately. On my second weekend without the kids, I went out with a group of friends (plenty of witnesses, yay!) and whom did we stumble upon, sucking faces with a complete (yet really pretty) stranger? Yup, him. \n\nMy reaction: laughing hysterically, because he\u2019d been whining and harassing me so much about my supposed infidelities and how they made me an awful mother, and there he was, having dumped the kids at his parents\u2019 place and sleeping FB around after less than a month. My friends were so scared I might cry all night they bought me plenty of drinks so I ended up absolutely shit faced for the first time ever and had the time of my life! \n\nThe separation became definitive and we\u2019re now divorced. After bragging about all his Tinder dates, he bragged about \u201csettling\u201d with a single mom because of her high-end job. Good riddance.",
            "Not me but my cousin caught his fianc\u00e9e cheating.\n\nHe was away every few weeks for work while she stayed at home, doing nothing and refuse to find a job. One day, he decides to come home early from the work trip to surprise her for their anniversary. He came home and found her fucking some guy in the shower. They didn't hear him come in to the house or the bathroom. The first thing he did, he took out his phone, took a photo of them having sex and send it to her mother. A class move it you ask me :D he then dumped her and move on.",
            "After I broke up with him, a bunch of women came to me saying that he had been cheating on me. Like enough for me to realize that the entire time we were together, he was probably messing around with someone. Which I had suspicions about but could never confront him as I never had proof.\n\nThe last straw was this girl randomly came into his life (probably via a dating app) and would flirt with him over Facebook. Like every single post. He'd flirt back most of the time. Me, thinking he's just making himself look sleazy, tried also flirting with him. He deleted my comments. Every single time I commented on his post, within seconds, he deleted it. I confronted him about it and he said he deleted mine because they weren't funny enough. Apparently this other girl was a real riot. Pissed off with him and not buying it, I friended this girl on Facebook. She accepted, and then he immediately blows up on me. I find out that he was also being just as flirty with her as she was with him. He blows it off as just joking around, and then he changes his story and says that he's flirting with her to get free stuff out of her, and then he changes it again and says he's doing it to keep creepy guys from hitting on her online. I did not buy any of it but he promised that he wouldn't talk to her ever again because I threatened to dump his ass.\n\nCouple weeks later and he blocked me on one of his alternate accounts (he had then because he was always going to Facebook jail). I asked him why and he claimed that he got hacked so he blocked everyone. Suuuure. I let it go until one night we were watching a movie and I saw that girl's name pop up as a notification on his phone. He quickly grabbed his phone and turned it upside down and I pretended not see for the rest of the night. The next day, I confront him. He lies a bunch and accuses me of cheating because I've been taking my birth control even though we haven't been having sex. That and I come home late too many times, even though I'm and EMT and I explained to him before I became one that I probably will never be home on time. I steer the conversation back on him. He never admits it, just kicks me out of the apartment that I pay the bills for \n\nWhen I come back very shortly after to gather my stuff up, he has that girl with him and they spend the entire time making mean comments under their breath about me, and my brother and dad who came to help. A week later, a friend told me that he changed his relationship status on Facebook with her even though he refused to with me because he didn't think everyone needed to know our business.",
            "I just had a deep, unshakeable gut feeling, so I showed up without calling, and there they were.\n\nMy reaction was, in retrospect, not admirable or advisable, but the truth is I slapped him so hard it nearly took his head off. And then I left.",
            "I was young and naive. I met my ex at my work place, I actually mentored him then grew close to him since we had the same break times. We eventually started hanging out which lead to him asking me out. I poured everything into that relationship. Even when he got kicked out by his roommates when he couldn't hold down a steady job, I packed all of his shit in my car and helped him move to his mom's place. \n\nOne day he starts talking about how much he loves hanging out with his childhood friend Z. Well, Z has a gf who has a bestfriend who's always over there. Eventually my Ex keeps telling me how great this girl is and I should meet her. I do. I ate sushi with her, I did her makeup to boost her confidence, I went shopping with her. I notice how often my bf would rather hang out with them than spend time with me. I thought it was my fault since I had two jobs and tried to save up for us to go on dates. \n\nI finally do save up enough for a theme park and wore a cute outfit. The whole day bf was giving my attitude. I pay it no mind. He's always like that. His depression and anxiety or whatever. After that day at like 3 am he calls me and starts accusing me of cheating on him because I had a bruise on my back. I worked furniture. I'm a small woman so typically I get slammed into or bump into things. I call for a break and found out he had been \"cuddling\" with that bitch throughout our break. \n\nBlocked him off everything and chewed out his mom (who worked with me and knew what the fuck he was up to) It was a clarifying moment for me to fully understand that although his mental issues explain why he did it, it doesn't excuse his actions. Fuck you Codi.",
            "We were ordering food and I was holding his phone looking at the menu when he received a message that said \"you make me so happy <3\"\n\nHe tried to explain it away, but I knew.\n\nEdit: forgot my reaction.\nI saw that was just one of 4 recent messages from the notification header. I finished ordering food, and I asked for an explanation. He said he had been helping her with drama about her ex and they were just good friends. I took some time to cool off, but couldn't drop it, and came back and asked to see the messages. He said they were too personal.\n\nWe ate, I kept trying to let it go, but I told him I needed to see the messages. He refused, I said he had to explain a lot better, and he explained that they had been talking about him breaking up with me. So we broke up that night. Lots of crying, holding each other, apologizing for things we had both done or not done.\n\nThe next morning I moved out, but not before I confirmed that he was cheating. Not explaining here, because he uses reddit too. I was only able to move a third of my things out, as it was pretty painful to pack the last 7 years of my life into bags, so I came back the next day I had off and got everything else.\n\nOnce I had all my belongings out, I sat him down and told him I knew he was cheating. He apologized for emotionally cheating on me, said he hadn't considered it cheating at the time. But he's not that dumb, and it wasn't just emotional. He still wants me in his life, but I'd rather never see him again. I don't blame him for the breakup, but I can't condone how he went about it. He pushed me away, neglected me, ignored me, lied to me, and proved in so many ways how he had no respect for me.\n\nI should have known.",
            "My first long-term girlfriend and I were going to go to the same college. I got accepted, but had to start the semester after she did meaning we would be slightly long-distance for a few months.\n\nIt wasn't too bad because we were only about 2 hours apart so it was pretty easy to visit, but our relationship did struggle a bit. I remember one night I got a phone call from her and when I picked up it was obvious it was a butt dial. I could hear her talking to some guy, but couldn't make out what they were saying. I called her and she picked up and I asked what was up? She said she was in bed about to go sleep. I told her about the butt dial and she said it was her friend Jack, who I had met, asking to borrow something. I thought it was odd but brushed it off.\n\nA couple weeks later I was up there visiting her and I met a bunch of cool people, including this guy Luke. After I got back from visiting I get a Facebook message from him saying, \"Look man I hate to be the one to say this, but I think you're an awesome guy and you don't deserve this to be happening to you. She's been cheating on you with this guy pretty soon after she started here.\" \n\nI was devastated, but I had to hear it from her, so I called her and said, \"Are you cheating on me?\" She gave a heavy sigh and said, \"Well, at least I don't have to lie anymore.\" That guy's voice I had heard wasn't Jack, it was the guy she was cheating on me with, I just trusted her so much that I took her word for it. \n\nEven though it was painful, I was grateful for Luke sending me that message. What's funny is that most of the people I met up there that were her friends sided with me after the break up, so when I started going there that next semester I had a group of friends to support me and most of them are still very close friends of mine to this day.",
            "She\u2019d been acting off my entire visit so when she took a shower I looked at her phone. There was a lot more leading up to that moment but that\u2019s the cliffs notes version. \n\nI was in absolute shock at what I saw. I texted my sister. And a friend of mine that lived 3 time zones away. I showed them what I saw. They both suggested I leave immediately. So I started packing. Before I knew it, she was standing there asking me what I was doing. I was in my boxers and a T-shirt with socks on and one shoe.  I was in such a daze I had no idea how long I had stood there.  I told her we needed to talk. So we did. I just asked her what the hell was going on with our relationship. And why she was being so aloof. She shrugged it off and said it was me. I was running around in my own head finding things to worry about. Then she promised me everything was ok. I decided to believe her despite what I saw in her phone. Until I got a txt from that friend in the early morning asking if I was ok.  I gave her an update. She encouraged me to leave and said I was being lied to. I finished packing while she slept. Loaded everything into my car not looking forward to the 5 hour drive home. I decided to tell her before I left. I saw what was in your phone with your ex. I snooped. I\u2019m not proud. But I can\u2019t be here anymore. She didn\u2019t say anything. She gave me a hug. I still remember how warm she felt in my arms. And I left.",
            "I was working two jobs for 18 to 20 hrs a day, nearly 7 days a week. She started to seem very distant, despite the fact that she would never put in any effort to work or be helpful to the marriage. She started becoming glue to her phone.\n\nI check our phone records and sure enough there was one number that stood out. When I asked to see her phone, she gave it to me thinking I was going to FB. When I went to open the messages app, she grabbed the phone and ran. \n\nI had a back up phone and since our phones use SIM cards, I went to ATT and got a new one for her line. Well all her accounts were linked to that number, so after digging around I found Tinder, POF, Nude Snapchats, hidden messages on FB. You name the dating app, she had a profile. \n\nIt turned out that she had been lying about me for years to all her friends and family. Saying all kinds of negative things. I just felt utterly betrayed. We actually reconciled, but I didn't trust her to say the least. So I installed a keystroke logger on her phone and months later she was back at it.\n\nI miss my kids so much but I'm financially, emotionally, and physically better. I got sober and clean and have gotten my depression in control. It was honestly the best thing that ever happened.",
            "Didn\u2019t find out till after we broke up, but it\u2019ll feel good to get this out. \n\nWe were on the rocks after four years together. Mostly because he was a lazy piece of shit who couldn\u2019t hold down a job. We finally got sick of each other, broke it off, and he was FINALLY gonna move out. I relied heavily on our (previously) mutual friend, who \u201ctook my side\u201d in the break up. Aka, she took me out for drinks, we were working out together, and basically doing the post break up girl stuff. \n\nHe finally had the guts to tell me to stop hanging out with her because they had slept together. Multiple times over a few months, while we were still dating and \u201cworking on things\u201d. Not great to have my trust betrayed by two people. But, I was honestly more upset at her being two-faced, because I had already decided that he was garbage and wouldn\u2019t waste anymore tears on him. \n\nFuck you, Maddie. So much.",
            "He wouldn\u2019t let me do anything on his phone without him pulling up whatever I needed for me - if I needed a flashlight, he made sure to pull it up for me first. He also would angle his phone away from me while using it. So one night while he was sleeping, as invasive as it is, I went through his phone. He had been sending nudes to random people. My heart immediately dropped and I couldn\u2019t breathe. I woke him up and I think I screamed at him? I don\u2019t remember much of anything between waking him up and crying myself to sleep.",

            "I had told him I\u2019d be at his place at noon to do laundry (in my machines). I get there, unlock the door, and the chain is latched. I called and texted several times before getting fed up. Guess he never realized that the chain was useless because all I had to do was slide it up to unhook it. \n\nWalked into his dark apartment and saw a purple water bottle and her purse on the couch. I knew instantly what I was going to find in his bedroom. I\u2019d had a feeling for months that something was going on and this was the proof I needed. I felt overwhelming relief. I starting recording on my phone as I walked down the hall, opened the bedroom door, and flipped on the lights. They were snuggled together under my blanket, asleep. They woke up and she smiled at me like a cat that had caught the canary before covering her head with the blanket. He glared at me and rolled over. \n\nI shut the lights off, grabbed my stuff, and went back to my car. The three of us worked together (they\u2019re night shift) and I sent the video to everyone in our department before I left the parking lot. \n\nHe assumed I was too meek to retaliate so he had one hell of a surprise Monday afternoon when he strolled in to work. \n\nI found out that day, from his mother, that I was not the first woman he\u2019s done this to. It was actually so bad in his hometown, that he had been forced to move across the state to get away from the death threats and angry husbands. Would have been nice if she had warned me before it happened to me too.",
            "2AM, alone in our apartment watching junk TV while the ex was out. Not a big deal, it was Friday night and I would usually be out with some friends, had supposed to be, in fact, but backed out last minute and decided to stay home instead.\n\nA knock came on my door, which was strange because our apartment had controlled entry but I looked through the peephole and saw it was a good friend of the ex. We'll call him Oscar. Afraid something was wrong I opened the door and greeted Oscar.\n\nStanding awkwardly in the hall, Oscar tells me he can't find his wife and that he's pretty sure his wife and the ex are together. Oscar had previously caught them having an affair months prior but had forgiven them, and together, the three of them had decided to keep it from me, and instead let me and the ex move in together. Hell, Oscar had even helped us move furniture and unpack.\n\nStory finished, Oscar abruptly leaves.\n\nI spend the rest of the night calling the ex and leaving several devastated messages. I was in complete shock. At some point I drove around town to all the shitty motels to look for his car, knowing exactly how his little brain worked, looking for a confrontation.\n\nTurns out later, I'd haunted the correct route, only he'd traded vehicles with his sister so he could disguise his run better.\n\nOscar and wife moved across the country a month later. The ex tried to reconcile with me.\n\nI was young and dumb and broke. It tools me several months but I eventually saved enough money to break the lease, got myself a new place, and left it and him all behind me.\n\nFew years later, I get a call from the ex, who was having a mental breakdown and was considering suicide. Said I was the only person he could trust and talk to and would I support him through his mental trauma?\n\nKnowing I was unfit for such a job, I told him he needed to talk to a professional. He begged me not to tell anyone but I contacted his sister and washed my hands of the situation. After the fact, I struggled with guilt, wondering if I'd just been too selfish by turning him away? I know now it was for the best; he'd often manipulated me in similar situations before, and my self-preservation had instinctively kicked in.\n\nIt's been 10+ years and I am now I'm happily married to my perfect mate and we're expecting our first child. Last I heard, the ex managed to clean up his life some and I'm happy for him but thank fuck I had gotten out of that drama-filled relationship.",

            "My best friend caught his ex cheating in a really funny way. She was super sly in talking to the guy and they used a shared google doc to talk to each other, my friend didn't realise until he asked to use her notes for a class they had together. He noticed a doc called \"Slycooper\" which piqued his curiosity and he realised what was happening when he read it.\n\nSo he started fucking with them, whilst she was in class and wouldn't be able to access the doc he would leave weird messages for the other guy and then when the guy responded he would delete both the messages he sent and the guy's responses. He also figured out when the guy would respond as it was a pretty standard pattern and did the same but the other way around. Eventually he set it up so that they both thought they were going on holiday together with the other paying for it, tbh I don't know how he pulled that off still but his ex was as bright as a lampshade so it's definitely possible.\n\nFast forward to the day of the \"holiday\", he sees his ex and the guy meet up for their romantic weekend away and starts arguing about why the other hasn't bought tickets etc. He then texts his GF to look at the google doc and it just says go fuck yourselves with a selfie he took with them in the background. I wish I was there to see the reactions.",

I really don't even remember driving from California to Texas, it was all a blur. \n\nMy mom said \" I was pale white and I slept for 3 days\"\n\nAnd i never looked back.

It sucked, and I was not in any way equipped to handle that situation.",
            "Wife was on vacation in another country with her parents.\n\nWe get into a huge fight after she spends a whole month longer than she said she would stay. She breaks up with me and, well, I'm heartbroken. She spends a few more days in the country before confirming she's flying back but only to move out her stuff.\n\nHer phone was linked to my Google account so any pictures she took would be uploaded to my account automatically. A day or two after she breaks up with me I log into my photos account to reminisce on what I'd be missing and, lo and behold, I see her getting cozy with a guy in a van, kissing him and everything.\n\nTurns out she had been seeing this guy behind my back for a few weeks. We had been best friends for years in high school, together for 10 years and married for 6.\n\nMy initial reaction? Nothing, actually. I didn't feel anger or sadness. We weren't in an open relationship but we had this mental connection that made me understand what she might have been going through mentally. Maybe she was just feeling like the fire was gone, maybe she just didn't look at me like a romantic partner anymore. It's okay, she was my best friend... I don't need to keep her locked in a relationship she doesn't want.\n\nSeveral months pass by and she makes good on her promise, divorces me and actually flies back to the country she was vacationing in to stay for \" a little while.\"\n\nShe ends up marrying the guy, having a few kids with him.\n\nPlot Twist: The guy she ended up meeting while on vacation was her ex boyfriend and I didn't recognize him because he didn't have a mustache from the few pictures I had seen of him a decade before.\n\nAnger. Pure anger. She knew that this was literally the only person in the world I would have never wanted her to end up with. I was wondering the entire time we were breaking up why something didn't feel right and the person I practically shared a consciousness with was suddenly distant. Turns out she was feeling that way because the guy I considered a scumbag for the way he treated her during their relationship was the person she would end up with and she knew how badly I'd react if I had known.\n\nEven worse, she had always been hesitant to have kids whereas I always wanted them. She would end up popping 2 out just 3 years out of our own marriage.\n\nTook a few years to recover from all of that, dated around a bit, but ended up being in a good place with a girl that's arguably the best thing that's ever happened to me.",

My infant son was in my arms and I'm just sitting there thinking \" Stay calm\" \n\nI asked what was going on and he told me an old high school friend was in trouble. I thought okay maybe I'm over reacting.\n\n( I was only 17 yes I was married at the age of 16 and he was 23. I had a terrible childhood , my mother was and still to this day a heroin addict who put me in extremely traumatic situations. She lost custody of me when I was 5 and I was sent to live with my father who when I was 16 kicked me out of his home because his then girlfriend who was also his ex wife didn't like me because I was depressed. I had a lot of self esteem issues and desperately wanted love , attention, etc and found it in my next door neighbor. He preyed upon me , I do take some responsibility in I shouldn't have been having unprotected sex with someone at 16 but I thought I must've been mature and I must be special if he has my attention. I'm explaining all if this if anyone is wondering why the hell didn't you leave? I literally couldn't because I was a child with no support, friends or family. ) \n\nThey talk on the porch for nearly an hour. I go and look and I can see him kissing her forehead and rubbing her back. I was devastated because I had felt like I knew who she was. I had never met her , or seen her but I felt like this was a woman he had mentioned before. He had mentioned that he had feelings for a neighbor girl for years and nothing ever happened. He always pined for her but she was always dating someone and eventually she was married. \n\nWell he comes inside and proceeded to tell me she was moving into our two bedroom home. I was upset because I had never met her and we simply didn't have the space. I asked him why he was moving her into our home and without discussing it with me , but also why he was KISSING HER. He proceeded to tell me her husband had cheated on her and beat her up and she had no where to go. She lived in the next town over and she has parents who could have taken her in. I was not okay with this. He proceeded to tell me I'm selfish and insecure and that I should know better than anyone what it's like to not have anywhere to go. He made me feel like garbage. He moved our son into our bedroom , got her a job almost immediately at his job and funnily enough they had the exact same shift. She would never sleep in the room that he furnished for her , never showered on the home, she was only around when it was time for them to go to work. This man made me pack her lunches for the evening ( they worked third shift ) he would occasionally drop her off at her mom's house. Suddenly she left a note on her bed one day saying she can't stay with us and didn't want to give us a reason but she would just move in with her mom. \n\nI started questioning my ex and he blows up at me telling me he loved her , will always love her and that I need to get used to it. He told me I'm not half the woman she is and if I pressed any further he would put me on the street and keep our son. This terrified me. I didn't push it. Later that evening he came home with a broken hand and lacerations because he was so upset that he punched machinery at work. \n\nFor the next six years he proceeded to cheat on and off , openly brag about women who wanted to sleep with him and he eventually got into another relationship with another co worker at his job. I ended up fleeing the relationship. I'm now remarried and happy. I was with my now husband for 7 years before we got engaged. He married his mistress two months after our divorce was finalized and honestly they deserve each other. \n\nOh and his first mistress is on his social media.",
            "My mother\u2019s story, but I was so impressed with her. \n\nShe had suspected my father was cheating for a while, so she hid a tape recorder (or insert the modern term) in his car. She retrieved the recorder a few days later and had proof that not only was he cheating, he was sleeping with her BEST FRIENDS and talking shit about her the whole time.\n\nWell her opportunity to listen to the tapes came while my dad was getting LASIK. He hadn\u2019t gotten to sleep soon enough, so he spent a few hours in agony while he recovered.\n\nIt was while he was writhing around blind and in pain that she came into their room and played the recording of him screwing her best friend.\n\nI was in awe of how savage she was when I found out.",

            "My wife started talking non-stop about her male co-worker, for almost 6 months. In November we took a weekend trip for our wedding anniversary. In December her job exploded and she started working long hours and weekends. At Christmas we took a trip to see my family and she had to leave a few days early to come back and \u201cwork\u201d. Everyone in my family just gave each other knowing glances and didn\u2019t say anything.\n\nBy January we were in a serious rough patch, as she was never home and when she was, all she did was sit in front of the computer and work. I worked my full time job, and cooked, cleaned, and looked after our 2 children. Finally one morning after essentially not speaking for days, I told her we needed to sit down and talk and work things out. She teared up immediately and told me she didn\u2019t know if she still wanted to be married to me. Then I had to go to work with that knowledge.\n\nThat night I sat her down to talk and asked her directly if there was someone else. She said yes and I knew exactly who it was - the male co-worker. I pressed for details but she insisted all they had done was make out. I mulled that over for a day and thought about how parts of her story didn\u2019t add up. Sat her down the next night to talk and told her I know how she operates. Asked if she was texting him. Yes. Was she sending him pics? Tears. Yes. Sexting? Yes. Pushed for more details and got her to admit it was much more than just making out. It had become physical. In the office. While I was home killing myself to try and raise our kids and run our home.\n\nThus began a 9 month long nightmare of her refusing to stop talking to the other guy. I am a walking train wreck most days, now in therapy and on anti-depressants. Hugely embarrassed about the time I got overwhelmed at work, couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her and the other guy, and I broke down crying in front of the CFO of the company. Turned 40 this year too, no celebration due to COVID, just a bunch of self doubt and mid-life crisis about how have I let things get this fucked up.\n\nSpoke to a family lawyer who assured me I would almost certainly not be able to get full custody of my son, and I\u2019d most likely never see my step-daughter \u2014 who I treat as if she were my own \u2014 if we were to get a divorce. My children need me and I won\u2019t leave them, but most days now are some form of living hell. 2020 has broken me.",
            "He brought a girl to my work, while I was working. He was a person who had a hard time being physical with others, but his hand was on her lower back and he was rubbing it/kept pulling her close in a type of side-hug. He'd been ghosting me for about two weeks at that time, and he knew my work schedule. Two weeks of no contact, but the *second* I texted him to go off about what he'd just done, he learned how to use his phone again.\n\nI honestly think he was too much of a coward to break up with me, which was incredibly insulting since we were both coming from long-term relationships where our exes had cheated on us.",
            "My ex was from another country and when we met he was in the US on a work visa that was about to expire. He had come here for college about 7 years earlier. He was now working full time at the same place I had a summer internship. At the time I was 20 and he was 26. After dating for a month my internship ended and I went back to my college town which was about 6 hours away. We stayed dating long distance. \n\nFrom the beginning he told me had 2 foster families in the town he went to college (about an hour away). He showed me pictures of all of them and talked about them frequently. He would make weekend day trips to go see them often. He told me that he told them all about me. \n\nAbout 6 months in his visa expired and he got a job in Norway. He was still in the US for about another month but was staying with one of his foster families. We of course had a discussion of marriage, he said his foster father had suggested he marry one of his daughters for a year to get a green card. I was super in love so I suggested why not me instead? Anyway, neither ended up happening and the day he was supposed to be leaving arrived. We texted all day everyday so when he didn\u2019t respond to any of my messages all day I was very worried. I found one of his foster sisters on Facebook and messaged her asking if she knew where he was. I didn\u2019t hear back but my ex finally called me a little later and told me that the foster family had hit a deer on the way to the airport and he had missed his flight. I believed him and moved on. \n\nThe next evening I had just ordered his Christmas gifts on amazon when the foster sister messaged me back. She said she didn\u2019t know who I was and asked if I could show some proof that my ex was in fact my boyfriend. After seeing said proof she told me that in fact her sister and my ex had been dating for TWO YEARS. I was absolutely heartbroken. He was the first person I had ever been in love with. I\u2019d gotten to know his sister over text who still lives in his home country. He\u2019d met most of my family as well. \n\nObviously what followed was a complete and total shit show. The foster family kicked him out of the house. I blocked him on everything. A couple days later he showed up at my house (I was home for Christmas break) and begged me to take him back. He told me that the sister was lying because she hated him and he had texts of the other sister (his gf of 2 years) saying she was lying as well as a video. Anyway he ended up returning to his home country with 0 girlfriends instead of 2.",
            "The first time I got cheated on was when I was in high school, my  bf at the time  was nice enough, but was sleezy (hindsight)  and ended up messing around with another girl in my grade for MONTHS until her friends started telling me. One day she came up to me in the hall and was straight up like \"Hey I'm not fucking your boyfriend, do you want a hug\" And I wanted to punch her. I found out initially because one morning he called me to pick him up in front of a store and that \"his friend and him slept over at the friends house but couldn't drive him homee\" or something, and i was late to school. Then when I walked into my class, the girl's friend said \"you know you had to pick him up because he was at her house last night right?\"\n\nI confronted him and  denied denied.  I just left him and ghosted him. He sent flowers to my work and wouldn't leave me alone for months after that and eventually told me that he was cheating but that he would show me where her house was if I wanted to get back at her. (LOL WOT)\n\nHe later went on to being wanted by the cops for selling drugs or fake ID's or something. I hope he got caught lol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe second time was when i had just moved out and was in college, i moved in with my boyfriend at the time. He had this thing still for a few girls but one was mainly his ex who he never got over, another was his most previous girlfriend and the last one was this girl who he never dated but was totally in love with, some russian model or something that he went to school with?  ANYWAY for christmas (the week before christmas) i drove us up to his hometown and i met his parents and family, but he never met up with any friends. We were planning a dinner with one of his girl friends the last night of the trip and a few hours before the night was up he said he would actually rather not have me come to the dinner. He said hed be back in 2 hours. I was sleeping at his mom's house and he didn't end up coming home until like 4 in the morning (i was driving back 12 hours super early in the morning, too) anyway the next day (christmas eve) i looked in his phone and he was texting her things like \"wow it was so great to see you, i remember how hot you looked in that blue dress the first time I saw you\" and stuff like that.  I'm sure they fucked the night that they went to dinner, too. Anyway, I waited until him and our other roomate went out for christmas the next day and literally just moved out without saying anything  to him. Keep in mind our whole relationship he had also still stayed in contact with his first ex that he wasn't over, AND the last girl he was with broke into our house and broke EVERYTHING.\n\nSafe to say he was pretty horrible.",
            "Towards the end of amicable divorce (like 10 days before we signed and finalized) I get a call from a women I haven't spoken to in 15 years telling me her husband and my wife are sleeping with each other. Shocked couldn't begin to describe it, my ex and this women had been friends for 20 years. I knew the guy (worked with him overseas) \n\nShe had filed for divorce with the generic \"I'm not happy\" nonsense. I couldn't figure out why she was adamant to divorce. That phone call and subsequent emails of these two idiots proclaiming their love for each other gave me a clarity. Guess it's was good I found out so late in the process because I would have spent everything I had (I had 99% of $ in the relationship) ensuring she got nothing. We are out West and he lives on the East Coast so not sure how that relationship works out. \n\nWorst part is we have two small kids, 8 and 7 when it happened. They ask me every week why we got divorced and every time I have to bite my tongue nearly in half and keep quiet.",
            "My girlfriend went to visit her parents and friend and when she came back I just knew. I sat her down and apologized and told her I cheated while she was away. She immediately nuked me with \"Well guess what! I did too.\" When I told her that I actually hadn't slept with anyone and she'd just been faked out she was \"displeased,\"",
            "Well, one of the worst times I caught an ex cheating on me, she had been going to school (college) from the moment our daughter woke up in the morning (around 9am) till well after our daughter went to bed. She'd come home after her \"theater\" class. \n\nI'm not stupid. I know that college classes don't go until midnight around here. So that was the tip off that she was avoiding our daughter and me. This went on for like a month and anytime I asked why she was gone the entire day she would tell me she was getting ready for an important play. \n\nIt took everything I had to not go through her phone because I loved her and I trusted her. Well one morning before she left for school she left her phone on the bed while she went to take a shower. I finally broke and looked at her messages. I saw a from an ex of hers and decided to open it. There were her nudes his nudes everything I never wanted to see. \n\nWhen she got out of the shower I confronted her about it and said it's either him or me, and told her she needed to have made a decision before coming home. That night she came home and told me she told him she wouldn't be speaking to him again. That made me feel better. \n\nThe next morning as shes getting ready I looked again because i felt like she might have been just telling me what i wanted to hear. Sure enough the messages were all about how she got caught and they'd need to be more careful in the future. I kicked her out that day and told her when she found a suitable place we could work out the details of a schedule for us for our daughter but in the meantime I'd have her with me so she was safe. \n\nThroughout the month she was gone, i made sure she got to spend time with our girl. One day she calls and says her mom is in town and that they'd like to see our daughter. So we meet at a public place with a playground and while she and I were talking her mother grabs our kid and starts to walk away. I began to protest when out of nowhere two cops show up and one stays between grandma and I. I was then handed a no contact restraining order claiming that I was physically abusing my ex and our baby. \n\nI didnt get to see our daughter for 3 months after that. I went through 3 years of court battles just to get a fair shake and I ended up only getting weekends. I never lifted a finger towards either of them and I loved them both immensely. But I live in a mothers state so court went as well as can be expected.  Definitely one of the worst times in my life.",
            "I was working with my ex at a place that also provided accommodation but we had separate rooms. One night we were having drinks with some other people and I went to bed early because I wasn't feeling well. In the middle of the night I wake up to a girl moaning and immediately knew my ex was involved. So I get on the hallway but can't locate where the noise is coming from but it's definitely not my ex's room. I end up wandering around for almost an hour (unfortunately that made me even more sure it's my ex) but couldn't figure out where they were. I got so nervous and angry I started throwing up. \n\nSo the next day I ask my ex if he heard anything, he said no, he went to bed not long after me. I decided not to confront him and instead of trusting my gut I started believing I'm turning into a crazy jealous girlfriend, I even thought that maybe it was all in my head. We broke up about a week after for different reasons, I moved away and told him not to contact me. A few month after, I'm doing great and he starts messaging me and after realisinf that I'm doing fine without him, he confesses that he was cheating on me several times during our relationship even with friends of mine. Turns out, that night they were having sex basically under my window. During winter.\n\nThat's how I learnt to trust my own gut and why to get out of abusive relationships.",

            "My (ex) wife and I always had opens phones through our relationship. One night I checked my her phone looking for a Hulu login screen shot, found a lot of nudes (she and I never exchanged those so red flag #1). I checked her messages and there were none, like she\u2019d cleared them before she went to sleep (red flag #2).\n\nHopped on her iPad and found tons of messages with her boss, critiquing me and making fun of me while they were in a relationship. Took photos of the exchanges and then confronted her about it when she woke up. She blamed it on me and other things about our life.\n\nI wasn\u2019t perfect in some ways, but I also know now she threw away the best thing she ever had. After reading the woman I loved criticizing and making fun of me to her new lover, in explicit detail; I still deal with self confidence issues to this day, despite a loving great relationship I have now. \n\nIf I ever see her again it\u2019ll be too soon. I try not to hold onto hate, since it only hurts me, but it\u2019s not something I can ever forgive someone for. I can only wish her a life of unfulfilling relationships and constant inconveniences.",
            "Didn\u2019t catch anyone it was my dad doing the cheating with my mum and I feel horrible for it. I decided to share cause I haven\u2019t been able to vent to anyone irl.\n\n\nSo i started scouts when I was around 12 and it was a small scout group so we went through a lot of leaders,my favourite leader  (who we will call Callum) who volunteered as a leader with his wife Milfred (again fake name). Now this scout leader was super chill he\u2019d let u stay up, laid back but still able to put his foot down and he would listen to the scouts and plan activities around what we wanted to do. So alls going great right? But one day he\u2019s suddenly quits and starts crying in front of us because him and Milfred are breaking up. It was pretty upsetting but nothing to worry about right?\n\n\nFast forward to about a month later and my stepmum is going through my dads work phone and discovers there\u2019s been multiple calls from Milfred. It leads to an argument and it turns out dads been cheating with Milfred. We get kicked out the house and I have to move in with my grandad  (I\u2019d probably be an emotional stress right now if it wasn\u2019t for my grandad so god bless him). My stepmum pretty much raised me since I was 1 so I\u2019m now going back and fourth between three houses which is pretty difficult.\n\nFast forward to the present (almost a year later) and I\u2019m still living at my grandads. My dad still has the nerve to speak and call Milfred which pisses me off but my stepmum is trying to be oblivious to it so she can mend the relationship (which no one in the right mind should). What hurts the most is after the scout leader left the rest of scouts ended up breaking up and drifting apart and I feel like because I joined scouts and introduced Milfred to my Dad I\u2019m the problem \n\nThanks for letting my vent reddit",

A night nurse caught her in the act and all of her shit had to be searched. We found 20 half tablets of Oxycodone she had been stashing.

            "Not a doctor, but doctors often think my family is faking. For an unknown reason, when there's something wrong with our organs, our white blood cell count doesn't go up. My younger sister got appendicitis when she was in her early teens. Crying from the pain, but blood work showed nothing was amiss. If it hadn't been for other tests and my dad's insistance on them, she might not have been treated in time. So they open her up and surprise! A gross appendix that was close to bursting.\n\nMy dad insisted because of an operation he had just had to remove his gall bladder. He was in so much pain that he was vomiting, could hardly walk. It had been building up for a while and he was pretty sure what it was. He went to the doctor, but blood work showed his white count was normal. My dad had to scream in agony on their table for ages before they finally gave in and took him to surgery. They go in, see a perfectly healthy looking gall bladder. They pull it out, cut it open... and sand spills out. Dry sand. We learned later that it had completely stopped working and totally filled with protein chains. It was removed before it started killing my dad in earnest.\n\nSo yes, people fake it, people lie... but do double check just in case.\n\nEdit: Holy cow, OK, this is now my most upvoted comment! And my first awards! Thank you! These stories took place over a decade ago, so my details were sparce and sometimes incorrect. So, after double checking with dad: the stuff only looked like grains of sand. They were deformed trypsin protein chains. We learned this when dad was diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder called alpha-1 antitrypsin FM phenotype. It's not fun, his lungs and liver deteriorate over time because of incorrectly shaped proteins getting stuck in his liver cells and not making it to the lungs, to put it simply.\n\nAnd yes, my dad is being studied! Every time he gets a biopsy doctors gather data because his phenotype is so rare.\n\nAaand I got a couple of details incorrect, it had been a while since this story was told to me. The gallbladder didn't actually look healthy; that was a tidbit from a different story (my father has had basically every organ removed that he can and still be alive). Turns out that my dad found out about the white count thing during his own appendectomy. So, later, when he was in pain again from his gallbladder this time, he made sure he went to the same doctor he had gone through that whole kerfuffle with and, by that point, my dad's severe pain was enough reason to operate and take a look. They found the most diseased looking gallbladder they had ever seen, full of sand. They estimated it hadn't functioned for years. \n\nAs for the white cell thing, there is a name for it that we've since found out that I didn't know about! But no one can remember it at the moment, sorry... And weirdly, can't find it on Google. \n\nThen, this is all exacerbated by biliary disconesia. Very small, small duct work that is easily clogged. More pain. \n\nAnd to top it all off, Dad was exposed to high levels of radiation as a child. This on top of winning that dumb genetic lottery that no one wants to win. \n\nThanks again for all your amazing comments and questions!

            "When their allergy list is 30 medications long and their reactions to said medications are things like \u201ctotal body numbness\u201d or something that isn\u2019t mechanistically possible, and they come in with a painful syndrome that isn\u2019t mechanistically possible. They generally claim that their body is \u201cspecial\u201d and that no scientific training we get applies to them. They also claim everyone is out to get them and like to tell me stories of previous doctors they hated, rather than helpful information.\n\nThere are 2 reasons people do these things- secondary gain (requesting opiates for a high) or psychosomatic reasons- stress causes a physical response rather than a pure mental one. The latter is real pain and not sinister in motive, just not organic pain that is a sign of true organ injury.",
            "My wife is a nurse and used to work on an adult unit (now works in NICU). She said there used to be drug seekers that would come in stating they were in the worst pain they had ever felt and they needed pain meds for it, often asking for a specific drug. After leaving the room to talk with the doctor and getting the appropriate perception filled (or denied),upon her return to the room to give the patient their drugs she would often find the patient soundly sleeping in their bed. Someone who was in 10/10 pain 15 minutes earlier is now just taking a nap. A lot of the doctors would tell her to just spill out the drugs, and give the patient some saline, then send them on their way. \n\n\nThe opiate epidemic hit our part of the US pretty hard.",

I had blood poisoning and infected kidneys, I could barely walk, was puking and feverish but the ER doctor wanted to send me home because he thought it was period cramps and I was overreacting. I waited for more than 6 hours extra  insisting on more tests(for some reason they wanted me to take like 3 pregnancy tests???) until a nurse finally took my blood and urine sample and instantly put me on antibiotics and IV. I was told I could've died the next day if left untreated. I had to stay for 2 days and was bed bound for a week and it took me almost 3 weeks to fully recover. I almost died because a doctor didnt want to run a few tests because he didnt believe my symptoms or pain. Better to run an extra test to be sure instead of missing something.

One of the things people told me was that I was a prude, because I never had had a boyfriend at that point. Apparently, some of my classmates got inspired by that and started a bet: whoever could \"do me in\" (a slang word in my language that can mean anything from making out to sex) would win. Every contestant put in a certain amount of money, at the height of the contest it was about \u20ac100, that would be their prize. All of a sudden, I was invited to popular parties, people tried to make me drink, random people started talking to me, flirting, groping... More and more people became aware of the bet so even people I'd never talked to or who were complete strangers to me started to hit me up. It was weird, I was still in the dark about the bet and I didn't get why some guys, sometimes even girls, wanted to hang out with me or wanted to see me drink. Luckily for me I don't drink, but it was all very uncomfortable.\nMy crush and I went on a school trip together with the rest of our year, and all of a sudden things get out of hand. People groping me now the supervision of the teachers is half gone, people trying to ask me if I ever kissed someone... The most scary experience was when a couple of guys cornered me in the park and told me, very detailed, how they wanted to have sex with me. Some of them were my classmates, some of them were friends of my crush, one of them was my crush. \nYou can imagine how scared I was as a 15 year old, no adults in sight, only me and these 10 16 year olds. I was hoping my crush would defend me - he was a nice guy, never laid a hand on anybody, always friendly. But he just laughed. They were telling me how they would rape me and he laughed.\n\nIt took 2 more months before another girl had the courage to tell me what was going on. She used the word \"do in\", and I was too flustered to ask if she meant the light version or all the way. When I told the teachers about the bet, about all the people who were involved, about how no one told me anything about it, not even the girls, they told me I had \"no proof\", \"was imagining things again\" and that \"boys will be boys with hormones, what can we do about that?\"\n\nIt all stopped when I got a boyfriend that very summer, who was 5 years older than me and would later turn out to be an abuser. He looked like he was 30 though so I guess most of the guys got too scared to lay a hand on me. \n\nBut yeah. That's how my crush lost my interest.",

My parents allowed the doctors to do some lung treatments that at the time were still very new. I spent a long time in an incubator and had a feeding tube...the scar makes it look like I have two bellybuttons, which I used to think was super neat when I was a kid. All in all, I turned out fine. I have two kids of my own who were born healthy and on time.

            "This is a change I made only a few months ago, but it's been major.\n\nI struggle with clinical depression and extreme executive dysfunction, two conditions that exacerbate each other and have taken a lot of time out of my life the past twenty years.  I've been doing better but still experience long periods of time when I'm barely functioning and it's a miracle if I can even make it out of the house, let alone do anything productive.\n\nMy therapist is a big advocate of being kind to oneself, and in theory that's the mentality we all should have.  There's no reason to punish ourselves when we're already struggling.  But for me, the idea that I should \"be kind to myself\" is far too easy to corrupt.  As in, I'm not going to clean my kitchen because I'm tired and the kind thing is to let myself sleep for 15 hours or watch Netflix.  It's really NOT kind to let myself do that and it only makes me feel much worse, both physically and mentally, but it's way too easy to fall into that trap and make it a habit.\n\nBut on the same token, constantly valuing productivity over rest is the other nasty end of that spectrum.  I burn myself out being overly productive, and then have no time for creative pursuits or fun things or resting, and then I inevitably crash and end up right back in the pit of depression where I started it.  It's simply not sustainable.\n\nFinally, my therapist came up with a narrower concept to follow:  **\"Is what you're doing right now the restorative thing?\"**\n\nSomehow this was the key for me.  Every day, I ask myself if I'm doing something restorative, and if I'm not, I go do something that is.  Most of the time, it's something productive or creative, and when it's not, I'm doing something fun or restful.  There *are* times when lying in bed watching Netflix is the restorative thing, but usually I find the answer is somewhere else, and I'm much happier and more functional for it.",

The idea is to force users who share news stories to find two separate sources with different references before posting. Hopefully to make the quality of the news posted slightly better. I got really tired of seeing a story that was posted by 40 different outlets but every single one was just repeating the same information from the same original source. I also wanted to have a way to encourage users to think about where they're getting their news from by making them actually look up where it originated before posting.

            "A lot of hobby fish importing is pretty shady. You have farms of certain types of fish like bettas in some areas of the world that are run with the fish in horrible conditions. Which is why a lot of the ones you get in a major chain store are sick before you even bring them home. The stores will blame the fish being stressed, but I've ordered and received hundreds of fish from small breeders/sellers and outside of cory catfish that really enjoy committing suiciding by poisoning their own water, the fish arrive healthy and fine. \n\nOutside of boutique fish farming, the way some wild fish are caught is just horrible. The trappers will lightly poison the water supply to knock out the fish, then scoop them out of the water without a care for that area's ecosystem. This has led to depletion of some natural species to the point they are now endangered. \n\nLastly, boutique fish sellers/major chains do not give half a rat's ass what happens to the fish in the end. This means that people who buy fish like plecos, bettas, goldfish, etc. end up getting sick of them and dumping them in local waterways to supposedly get rid of the problem. So in some areas, these fish have completely destroyed the local water ecology because, like other invasive land species, they were never meant to be there. One of the worst offenders is the lionfish in florida. It's venomous and has no natural predators so its population has exploded out of control.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSd7pgvOV3M\n\nthe same is true of plecos:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/V1_lcprYp5U\n\nand goldfish:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/fzXiUxwGGIM\n\nbasically releasing fish into the wild is a terrible idea. releasing any animal into the wild can have disastrous consequences, but fish are being released into a very limited ecosystem and outside of a few diseases, if they can adapt to the water and have no predators they will survive and breed incredibly quickly.\n\nI love my fish, I love the hobby, and there's a lot of value to it as global warming may make things like reef tanks a valuable source of coral in the future.

            "Medical research.\n\nThe only way people can keep their jobs at a lot of the institutions with better facilities is to create a steady stream of \"high impact\" publications. Now, research doesn't work that way, you get the supported results whenever it happens, but that's not how hiring, promotion, or tenure committees see it. \n\nThis means that, in order to ensure you get enough of these desirable publications in the right period, you have to do all sorts of corner-cutting. You publish before the results are well-supported, you publish results that are unrepeatable, you write papers in the smallest possible units of the work so people need to wait years to see what the full results are. \n\nIn the process, junior scientists' careers can be made or absolutely destroyed in this system. A lucky student who gets the right project can find themselves as first author on a very high impact paper and be set for years, but an experienced and previously successful postdoc can be ruined when they can't produce the results the senior scientists want, or just not in the right time frame. The senior scientists rarely have the time to do, or carefully look over, the actual research because they are so busy actually writing the papers and the grants needed to fund the work in the first place.\n\nIf reviewers catch these issues with the papers, the authors just shop the paper to other journals until it passes and/or they put up such a pitched battle with the editors they just let it pass. Sometimes the eds feel they can't handle the pressure, sometimes are just convinced by the bombast. All of us have seen published papers that we rejected for other journals earlier because the work is poorly done or is just incorrect. To be clear, the authors really believe in their papers even when they are aware of their shortcomings, and they usually have plenty of evidence that papers just as problematic or worse have been published, so why not theirs?\n\nOn top of everything, the universities and research institutions work over these findings with their press department and by the time it makes it to journalists, the story is so distorted that it's barely related to the actual work. Bloggers digest this even further and the misperceptions of spread all over a much wider community. Even other scientists in different areas of the same field will absorb this news as truth. These are the scientists on those committees mentioned above, demanding a particular kind of result.\n\nAs a result of all this, medical research is much more inefficient and expensive than it needs to be. However, scientists need to jobs, grant money, and good facilities to do their work at all, and the system makes it clear what they need to do to ensure those necessities, so they oblige.\n\nEDIT: I want to be clear that I am only speaking to a very specific area of scientific research here, and I do not intend to tar the whole field with the same brush.",

Lets say you have a Wal-Mart appointment for 9:00am, for a 2000-carton order. It would take at least 2 hours to load all that, but once the loading is done, the truck driver needs to wait until confirmation is given in written form. Well, Wal-Mart truck drivers vanish halfway through the loading and never return. Now, Wal-Mart has about a 1000 boxes not accounted for, plus no confirmation whatsoever that these 1000 boxes were part of that 2000-carton order, so they treat them like a bonus. So far, only UPS, FedEx and Fred Meyer are the only companies that keep a close count and send back anything that wasn't in their original order. Heck, Fred Meyer sends the entire order back just for a single mislabeled box, lol. These three guys are the \"good guys\", from what little I've seen, but Wal-Mart...

            "I've recently returned to 3D modeling. It's a hobby with a rock-bottom price of entry you can invest in $10-$20 at a time. You can start with Blender, a free and powerful program that lets you do everything from modeling and sculpting to texture painting and animating.\n\nGetting the fundamentals down is also free thanks to incredible tutors like Grant Abbitt and Andrew Price. After that, the world is your oyster. You can either throw a few bucks towards more in-depth tutorial courses or buy add-ons that enhance your workflow. You don't have to do any of that, though and can just let your creativity run wild.\n\nEDIT: I'm pleased to see that this has blown up. If you want to learn more about 3d modeling on a budget, I suggest you download Blender from steam or their official site:\n\nhttps://www.blender.org/download/\n\nAlso, here's an excellent beginner's course to help you get started for free:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MRonzqYJgw&t=9s\n\nAlternately, you can try the fabled and updated doughnut tutorial:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPrnSACiTJ4&list=PLjEaoINr3zgEq0u2MzVgAaHEBt--xLB6U\n\nAlso, be sure to check out the amazing work your fellow redditors are posting to subs like r/blender, r/allegorithmic, r/maya, and r/3dsmax\n\nEDIT 2: For the people who are still checking this out, here are some more tidbits to clear up confusion:\n\n* When I made this post, i was thinking specifically about 3D modeling for its own sake, as a relaxing hobby you do to unwind without thinking ahead. Picture yourself sitting down, creating a kitchen or a spaceship or a zombie dog for fun's sake and feeling good about yourself. That CAN lead to commissioned work or 3D printing later on, but it absolutely doesn't have to if you don't want it to. \n\n* Having good hardware helps but isn't a prerequisite. Any computer made in the last 10 years is good enough to run Blender and let you pick up the fundamentals. Whether you want to upgrade after that is up to you, but you shouldn't need to unless you've gone way down the rabbit hole.\n\n* Being artsy helps but isn't a necessity either.

The fixation Seuss has on the Sun and the lack thereof resembles that of many creation myths, particularly those originating in the cultures of the indigenous American Indians, however this subject has already been addressed at length in other works which would be better explored by the reader than gone into here. Of particular note are *Dr. Seuss and the Prototypical Sun Myth, an Exploration* by S. T. Morganson and *Overcoming Darkness Through Whimsy in the Earlier Works of Seuss* by the aforementioned Morganson and Margaret Nielsen.\n\n2. As a reader of this book I assume you have delved into the more readily available materials on the whole fiasco. Sally's interview with Vogue^4 is particularly easy to find and one of the more telling, the horror and separation she displays are quite real. Other interviews she has done before and after the events with the ~~Cat in the Hat~~ stress the difficulty her and Seuss were having in their marriage, suggesting to some scholars that the entire ordeal was merely an allegory for the struggles of modern marriage and separation anxiety. The mastery with which Seuss weaves her documented quotes with more fantastical meter must truly be noted here, though of course that is more subjective than the subject matter of this document would require. \n\n3. \u02d9\u01dd\u0183\u0250 s\u0131\u0265 s\u0279\u01dd\u0265\u0287o o\u0287 \u0183***\u0287\u0287\u0250 \u0265\u0287\u0131\u028d ***\u0265p\u05df*** u\u0131 p\u01dd\u05df\u0183\u0183*** \u01dd\u028c\u0250\u0265 o\u0287 s\u026f\u01dd\u01dds o\u0265\u028d `\u0279o\u0265\u0287n\u0250 \u01dd\u0265\u0287 \u025fo s\u0287u\u01dd\u0279\u0250d \u01dd\u0265\u0287 \u0265*** s\u028d\u01dd\u0131\u028c\u0279\u01dd\u0287u\u0131 pu\u0250 s\u0279\u01dd\u0287d\u0250\u0265\u0254 \u0279\u01dd\u0287\u0250\u05df \u01ddu\u0131\u026f\u0250x\u01dd \u01dd\u028d s\u0250 \u01dd\u0279o\u026f \u01dd*s \u05df\u05df\u0250\u0265s \u01ddM \u00bf\u0183u\u0131\u05df\u0250\u01dddd\u0250 pu\u0250 \u01dd\u029e\u0131\u05dfp\u05df\u0131\u0265\u0254 os \u0183u\u0131\u0265\u0287\u01dd\u026fos \u0279\u01dd\u0287\u0254\u0250\u0279\u0250\u0265\u0254 s****uo\u026f \u0250 \u0265\u0254ns \u01dd**\u026f \u028e\u0265M \u02d9uo***n\u0254\u01ddds \u0265\u0254n\u026f \u025fo \u0287\u0254\u01dd\u027eqns \u01dd\u0265\u0287 u\u01dd\u01ddq \u028e\u05df\u0279\u0250\u01dd\u05df\u0254 s\u0250\u0265 ~~\u0287\u0250H \u01dd\u0265\u0287 u\u0131 \u0287\u0250\u03fd~~ \u01dd\u0265\u22a5^5\n\n4.

I\u2019m talking about things that either are, or aren\u2019t, and the facts are established without ambiguity or bias. \n\nOne such mistake I routinely encounter, maybe not the best example but still, is people mixing up the definitions of \u201cright to work\u201d and \u201cat will employment\u201d as these phrases pertain to labor in the US. Not even a question of how you feel about these concepts, or how they vary by state, or how they fit into political platforms, or how they compare to (other countries), but strictly the definitions of the terms routinely get mixed up. I get it, they\u2019re vague terms and intuitively the name of one does seem more apt for the definition of the other. Still. This mix-up happens in an authoritative top upvoted post and now you\u2019ve got a host of people who think they\u2019ve learned something new, who actually learned the wrong thing, and the correction may be sufficiently buried or just comes too late to do any good. \n\nAnd the worst consequence: some of those people who learned the wrong thing, will now go on to propagate that mistaken knowledge, not deliberately but because they simply learned it wrong (and put too much stock in the source of the info to fact check).",

            "This is a problem with the internet in general, but Reddit is a core offender in consolidating and amplifying fringe political beliefs.\n\nBefore all of this, a person with a fringe, 1 in 100 political belief would be forced to confront the reality that almost nobody agreed with them. Whenever they expressed their political beliefs in the real world, there was only a 1% chance that the person they were speaking to would agree, and this would give them the best chance of reconsidering their position.\n\nWith the Internet, and especially places dedicated to custom political communities like Reddit, these people can now congregate together and trick themselves into believing that they hold normal, mainstream beliefs. They can also trick others into believing that their beliefs are more widespread than they really are.\n\nWith a population of 320 million in the US, this means that even a 1% fringe belief can attract up to 3.2 million participants all focused together in one place. \n\nAdd in the fact that social media allows us to curate our feed so that we no longer see opposition messaging, and suddenly you have a group of millions of people who hear only themselves. \n\nThis tiny band of fringe lunatics begin to think that they are \"the people,\" and that their beliefs are not just mainstream, but possibly the majority opinion. \n\nThis then has a tendency to snowball, as fringe communities that are effective at brigading other communities can create a false sense of size and scope - thereby attracting others to their cause.\n\nThis issue is reflected on both sides of the political aisle.\n\nThere are comparatively few KKK members in real life, and while Reddit in particular has done a fairly decent (though far from imperfect) job of expelling the far right fringe,  web presences like Stormfront have allow them to network and grow. Thus the recent resurgence in places like Charlottesville. \n\nSimilarly, there are comparatively few actual Marxists in real life, but if you judged their demographic weight based on Reddit representation, you'd think that they were a major faction of the Democratic Party.\n\nThis amplification also causes demonization across the aisle. While most of the time we are sheltered by our little online echo chambers, occassinally these fringe messages bleed through, and we start to think that the Republicans are mostly KKK members, or Democrats are mostly Marxists.\n\nI do not know what the solution is.

Say its not sore, doesn't hurt, not that bad, was an accident. You won't find out how it happened.\n\nSexual abuse children know that whatever has been done to them is bad.

Adult terms like cock, pussy, cunt.\n\nAre they regressing in toileting, night time or day time wetting etc.\n\nDo they have an aversion to a place, person or certain day. Perhaps on Tuesdays they go to a friends house so they only display this behaviour sometimes. As parents do they suddenly hate a place they used to love.\n\nAbusers will try to get children to trust them. To want to be praised by them. Sometimes that's a \"you're so mature for your age shall we go do x together that's your favourite right\" now x is tarnished. As a parent you're wondering why they don't want to do this with you.\n\nSleeping patterns may change.

One student, living with his father and 6 hours from his mother, was swore at and told he wouldn't see his mother for Christmas because he had a C.  The kid cried in my classroom after school and poured his heart out about not having seen his mom for 3 months.  *Berating a child and withholding seeing his other parent for a grade?*\n\nHigh expectations are great.  High expectations without support, however (in this case, emotional) put undue stress on students, resulting in a cycle of anxiety that can permeate their lives.\n\nEdit:  Commented on this as I left for work and 11 hours later on my way home I was surprised this blew up!

I didn\u2019t think anything of it at first (he was a very active child with a lot of energy), so I nonchalantly asked what happened. He instantly responded with \u201cI ran into a door.\u201d And the way he said it was so quick and forced that it sounded rehearsed. \n\nAny teacher is required to report suspicion of abuse, even if it may be nothing. \n\nTurns out, his moms were the worst kind of evil. Regularly beat him, made him sit in a closet for hours if he acted out, forced him to stand for hours holding water buckets and if he stumbled they\u2019d hit him more. \n\nBelieve it or not, his baby sister (about 3) had it worse. Found out she was being sexually molested by the step-mom while her biological mother watched. Now that I\u2019m looking back on it, I can realize something was wrong because she was so developmentally delayed when it came to speech.\n\nThankfully, the pieces of shit that called themselves parents were arrested, and both children went on to live with their grandmother, but it\u2019s disgusting what happened to them. \n\n\nAnyway, tl;dr answer to the question: Unexplained bruises, rehearsed lines trying to explain them away, sometimes developmental delays in speech, drawings (not always, but sometimes kids express what they can\u2019t say through drawing).\n\n\nEdit: There seems to be a lot of confusion, so let me clear up some things. \n\nThe biological father left the children, and the biological mother later married a woman. \n\nThis is one instance of abuse originating from a same-sex couple, but that in no way indicates that same-sex couples are inherently bad parents, nor does it mean they should not have children. \n\nI\u2019m not longer their teacher (and haven\u2019t seen them in 4~ years) but last I heard they were doing well.

I was always suspicious of this but the other staff would just say 'oh they don't have money' so I tried to let it slide even though I knew it wasn't really true and that clothes for a 12 year old are not that expensive, especially when we had lots of discount shops around.\n\nShe would also come in smelling badly or her hair being greasy. After subtly talking about it, and her telling me she just didn't like to shower, I found she wasn't allowed to shower often. As a child going through puberty, this was unacceptable to me. But again, the other staff brushed off my concerns.\n\nOne day she started talking about the bugs in her room and I felt my intuition growing stronger about the situation. This was a clear case of neglect. There were little things here and there that made me suspicious as well, like stories of her grandfather stealing money from her and other little signs of it.\n\nAfter being concerned for a long time, the thing that broke it all for me was hearing how she was given old, moldy food for lunch.\n\nI called DCF that night.\n\nA week later she started coming in smelling fresh and wearing new, clean clothes and new shoes. I can't say what else changed at home, but seeing her confidence rise when she was finally clean was worth it to me.  \n\n\n  \nedited to add: to the people upset I didn't call sooner - I hear you and I understand. I am mad at myself that I hadn't called sooner. I was too easily influenced by bosses and coworkers and believed them when they fed me reasons not to call. Believe me, it bothers me too.",

            "Regression.\n\nI\u2019m a speech therapist who works in an inner city elementary children where we see a lot of poverty, drug abuse, etc. I had one case stand out to me in particular that stands out. \n\nI saw a little girl, 7 years old, who had been delayed on her language skills. We knew she had a very difficult upbringing since she was the product of a rape. She lived only with her mother who impressively kept the two events (the rape and the birth of her daughter) as separated as possible. The rapist (who I refuse to call a father) had served time in jail but was released at this point on house arrest. He had no rights to see her. But the rapist\u2019s parents, technically the child\u2019s grandparents, went to court and  demanded rights to see their \u201cgranddaughter\u201d. They refused to ever believe their son was a rapist. Some judge, who I hope thinks of this case often, allowed it as long as father was not present. It started as supervised visits and eventually turned into visitation without supervision. Mom fought as hard as she could, but she couldn\u2019t afford a lawyer like the grandparents could. Mom had to drop her daughter off to the parents of her rapist every other weekend for one night. I don\u2019t know how she did it.\n\nAnyways, I started to see a huge regression in her language skills. Her mean length of utterance decreased, she couldn\u2019t logically organize her thoughts into sentences, she couldn\u2019t categorize anymore and so forth. Academically when I spoke to the teacher she said the same thing. But it really came to a head when she started to regress in other, non-school related skills. \nOne day she wet her pants in my classroom. And she just lost it. She was crying, she destroyed my room, she was hitting and punching to the point where I had to restrain her from hurting herself. She just lost it. Finally when she calmed down, I brought her down to the nurse, got her a change of pants. But this was a girl was not only potty trained since Id known her, but she was known for being sweet, polite and just slow to warm up. She was NOT a child to have outbursts like this. She wasn\u2019t sick. And I felt like I really needed to say something outside the school.\n\nLong story short, grandparents were sneaking over to fathers house so that her \u201cfather could see and help raise his daughter\u201d. Turns out he started inappropriately touching her in the bathroom, during tub time, at the kitchen table, watching TV. Basically any chance he could when the grandparents walked out the room for any amount of time.\n\nMy heart broke for the mom. I\u2019ll never forget her telling us about how she couldn\u2019t live with herself knowing the fact that the man who raped her, also touched her daughter. Anyways, you can probably imagine all the hurt and heartbreak the mother felt.",

Once I had to do p.e in shorts and I had a huge  black spot on my inner thighs which spread from the genitalia almost to the knee. I always told people I fell from my bike. Broke crying out of nowhere regularly. My grades were awful and I had to repeat one entire year. I was a teenager and actually asked for help to the school counselor, which, after listening to me, said: \"since your younger sister is involved, we'd have to act and call the police. If you don't want, we can just pretend we didn't have this talk\". I was scared so nothing actually happened. She left me with a bunch of sort of propaganda pamphlets (she was into politics in my school town) asking me to give them to random people.

Other case a girl went from typical happy teenager to choosing to sit by herself in the corner and not talk to anyone. I asked one of her former friends she would sit with (a girl who was previously in my class whom I had a good relationship with) if something was up, what had happened, etc. and she got super upset and said all the girl would say is that her stepdad was back living with them.

            "A sign of sexual abuse is a child constantly grabbing their bum or genitals.\n\nWhen I went through training for a job I thought, \u201cLittle kids are notoriously awful ass wipers, so how would I spot the difference between a kid with an itchy shitty bum and one who is being abused?\u201d Just a couple months after training I noticed a young girl who *constantly* grabbed at her bum, and it struck me as really odd.

I\u2019m not sure what current awareness training involves these days (this incident occurred before 2010), but here\u2019s some things to know if you\u2019re a parent, guardian, or just have a little one in your life: \n\n90% of victims know who their abuser is, so teach your kids how to protect themselves against sexual abuse. \n\n1. Use proper names for body parts. Might sound weird to hear your three year old shouting penis or vagina, but it\u2019s critical for children to know how to appropriately label their body parts. When it comes to investigation of a crime, there\u2019s no room for misinterpretation of \u201che touched my penis\u201d vs \u201cshe touched my cookie.\u201d \n\n2. Teach them it\u2019s okay to refuse to hugs, kisses, and time around an adult or child. Little humans have gut instincts too, and we should respect it. Establish a code word they can use when they feel unsafe. \n3. Teach them that respect does not mean blind obedience, and it\u2019s okay to say no to an adult/peer who asks for inappropriate things.\n\n4. Be aware of any physical changes to their genitals (bruising, bleeding, etc) or difficulty walking/sitting.\n5. Behavioral/emotional changes can include: inserting objects into genitals, or trying to touch peers/adults in a sexual manner, refusing to take off clothes or adding extra layers, increased aggression, withdrawal, change in eating habits, bed wetting, clinginess, thumb sucking, or any other sign of age regression. \n\n6. And the most important thing you can do is listen! If a child comes to you with information about someone else or themselves, stay calm, listen with compassion, **take the child seriously**, and report to the proper authorities immediately. If necessary, ask only open ended questions such as, \u201cWhat did abc do,\u201d and not \u201cDid abc touch your xyz.\u201d\n\nEdit 2: linking some helpful comments from other redditors:   \n\n[u/katyfail](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jixnzs/teachers_of_reddit_what_are_some_signs_that_a/ga9ildh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)\n\n[u/LurkForYourLives](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jixnzs/teachers_of_reddit_what_are_some_signs_that_a/ga9ep77/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) \n\n[u/DeviousAlpha (UK)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jixnzs/teachers_of_reddit_what_are_some_signs_that_a/ga9hhz9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)\n\n[u/ikrakenmyselfup ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jixnzs/teachers_of_reddit_what_are_some_signs_that_a/ga9h283/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)",

Does that girl who is rapidly putting on weight need to talk about an eating disorder, does she need to learn about healthy eating, does she just like it, or does she get sexually assaulted by a parent so she thinks being less attractive will stop it?  I've seen each variation.\n\nDoes the meek kid who barely talk just need to learn social skills, has to learn to share interests to build friendships, maybe needs a gentle push to speak and share?  Or maybe they learned if they don't talk, it reduces the amount of times their dad beats them?  \n\nDoes the bully need to get his ass kicked, is he covering for a learning disability, is his family poor and every night they listen to their parents worry about keeping the heat on?  Or does Mom call him a bitch because he's not tough like his father.  And he's the reason Dad left so he better take care of the family because they didn't want you.\n\nOr maybe the other kid wit... Oh there's the bell.  And they rush out. And a student cornered me with a question about the actual course.  So I can't get to these kids and now they think another authority figure doesn't care about them.\n\nThat's what it feels like.  Abuse manifests in so many ways with no direct correlation.  You'd be terrified at the amount of kids who manifest it as love... So doing something about it, is seen as depriving them of love.  And in class, they sit and are normal.  Because they don't think they're abused, they just messed up and mom burned them to teach them.  On their back.  Which I can't see.  \n\nSome do have signs, but it's so hard to know without complex understanding. Think about how many of you thought your parents were the fucking worst because they took your Xbox away.  Think about the things you thought.  And now you realize you never knew abuse.  But at that time, you felt like it.\n\nIf you want to see it get worse, ask what happens when we actually see and know it's abuse.",

            "Swedish teacher here, in Sweden. My mom was a principal for almost thirty years at a school for kids aged 6-12, so she'd seen some bad shit during her years. She didn't tell me everything because of non-disclosure agreements on her part, but she did tell me some things. One such thing was a young girl from Somalia. She and her parents went back to Somalia on vacation and when they got back the girl told one of the staffers that she had been cut with scissors \"down there\". Now, female genital mutilation is quite common in Somalia and Eastern Africa, and extremely illegal in Sweden. So, the laws forces you to call child protective services if you even suspect somethings afoot, so the staffer did and the cps and police show up and place the girl in protective custody and the parents are arrested and held in custody. The girl goes to an hospital and is examined and it turns out the whole thing was a lie. The parents are furious and remove their kid from that school and threatens legal action. As far as I know nothing came of it.\n\nEDIT: To clarify: the parents weren't put in jail. They were being held by the police until their daughter had gone thru a medical examination.",

            "Not a teacher but have worked a lot with abused/neglected kids.  \n\nSexually abused kids may behave very inappropriately for their age. Potty-trained kids may poop their pants habitually, or bedwetting for older kids. Promiscuity or other sexual acting-out is common, since they've learned they can use their bodies to get attention.  \n\nLacking bruises or other marks, physical abuse has subtler tells. Always apologizing, or unwarranted aggression/bullying, are learned ways of dealing with a threatening environment. Defensive behaviors may be reflexive, like flinching when offered a high-five.  \n\nNeglected kids might hoard food or other things that bring comfort, and appear mature for their age.  \n\nEmotional abuse has lasting effects on a person's ability to relate. As others have said, kids will emulate their role models, and their language & attitudes toward others are telling. Acting like an absolute turd may be the kid's strategy for staying safe, if their most formative relationships have led them to expect only abuse and abandonment.",

Drew several graphic scenes of a boy masturbating, a girl giving head, and them having sex. Some drawings were just genitals. Some were in school, never reported to home. \n\nIn sex ed (5th-6th grade) I knew the answer to everything, literally. I would ramble about things beyond the scope of class and it was brushed off as \u201coh not everyone\u2019s parents have talked to their kids like yours have.

If a kid is that afraid of their parents, believe them, I keep thinking what if someone would have asked me, just ask, maybe I could have said something, maybe I wouldn't have to go through all of it and end up where I did now, maybe I could have had somewhat of a normal life.

These injuries often picked up by the PE department. In academic subjects though this can be presented by students refusing to take off their blazer for example during a science practical\n\n- flinching in response to people coming close to them\n\n- aggression towards other students\n\nNeglect\n\n- students complaining of hunger, for example, I had a student tell me that all the food they had for the day was a lollipop.\n\n- students not wanting to go home at the end of the day\n\n- Poor hygiene, dirty clothes (a particularly difficult one to approach with parents)\n\n- Sleeping in lessons\n\nSexual abuse\n\n- hyper sexual language for students of their age \n\n- constant readjusting of genital area\n\n- particularly adverse reactions to teachers of a specific gender\n\nEmotional abuse\n\n- Dramatic change in a child\u2019s behaviour, be it becoming more outlandish or more reserved\n\n- low self esteem, constantly down playing their ability\n\n- Bullying other students to deflect their own insecurities \n\nAgain, some of these could be one off incidents to the teacher. However everything must be reported so a big picture can be formed.\n\nAnd I must say I\u2019ve seen an increase in safeguarding incidences during the pandemic which is truly hard to see. \n\nLuckily we have professional footballers who will work to look after our most vulnerable while the UK government actively vote against them \ud83d\ude44",

            "I\u2019m not a teacher but I can give you the answer from the abused child\u2019s perspective. Me and my siblings grew up in an extremely violent, abusive household and we each reacted differently. We were also sexually abused by a male family member. \n\nI was extremely sensitive and withdrawn as a child. At elementary school I struggled to form friendships and kept myself to myself. I would often hide in the restroom during recess as i had a fear of interacting with others. I would cry a lot, especially if i made a mistake at school. I was labelled as shy but in actual fact I was just terrified of the world and traumatised.\n\nOne of my sisters, on the other hand, was pegged as a \u2018problem child\u2019 and a bully as she was aggressive to other children and struggled with authority. She had frequent angry outbursts at school and was unable to regulate her emotions. She would swear at other students and teachers and use inappropriate adult language. She would also expose herself and was overly sexualised, talking about things that no child should know about. She started self harming at age 10, which is when a teacher noticed and the relevant authorities were informed. Up until that point, no one had intervened even though with hindsight it was so clear something awful had been going on behind closed doors. \n\nOne thing to note with physical abuse is that abusers are often calculated and will hit a child in an area where bruises are not easily detectable/can be kept covered. We were always hit in the torso or the back of the head.",

I looked it up and it seems to be common for victims of rape or abuse.\n\nSorry for any mistakes, english isn't my first language.\n\nEdit: There are many comments from people who also don't like physical contact and are neither a victim of abuse or have autism or something like that. I didn't meant to be offensive to someone and I didn't wanted to say that everyone who avoids physical contact is a victim of abuse.

We decided to wash my husband's new car sitting in the driveway because it was hot out and an excuse to play in the hose.\n\nWe were literally walking out the front door, and I said \"eh, we should eat lunch before we get all wet and stuff\", and everyone agreed, so we turned around and went back inside.\n\nI was warming up something in the microwave (a hot pocket I think), and all of a sudden I hear the loudest BANG I think I've ever heard, from the direction of the front door. Hubs and I look at each other wide-eyed and run outside.\n\nI was greeted by the back-end of a Crown Vic, smoking something fierce, plowed into the tree in the middle of our yard. For a split-second I was just stunned, then screamed to my sister inside to call 911. I looked over to the driveway, at the car we had been planning to wash just 5 minutes ago.\n\nTotaled. Completely totaled. Brand new 2011 G6, destroyed. Guy hit it so hard it did a complete 90 degree turn across the driveway. He actually hit it so hard, it ended up ricocheting and hitting the other cars in the driveway, mauling 2 other cars. Yard was fucked, Crown Vic was fucked, tree was fucked.\n\nWe immediately assumed it was drunk driving, being the 4th and all...I went over to the driver's side and found a very old man, very bewildered, unable to comprehend what I was saying but conscious. I will never forget the look he gave me - confused, helpless, scared. I was on the line with the paramedics as they sent over the ambulances, and tried my best to follow their instructions. (My sister was only 14 at the time, so I handled the call)\n\nTurns out dude was diabetic and had passed out behind the wheel due to low blood sugar, hit the gas pedal with his weight as he passed out, and was plowing down our residential street at about 65mph. He jumped the curb, drove down the sidewalk past another house, then slammed into my husband's car, and subsequently, the tree.\n\nIf we had been anywhere near that yard/driveway, I have no doubt one or all of us would have been seriously injured or dead.

            "About 10 years ago, I was in a relationship with someone, and she became pregnant. We were only a few months in, and I was terrified. But I did the right thing, stuck with her, did my best to help her through her pregnancy, turned my whole life upside down... sold my house to move to the other end of the city where her daughter went to school (she was divorced, had a kid with her ex husband).\n\nEverything was going great until she became pregnant. We were having a lot of fun, and enjoyed each other's company very much. The instant she became pregnant, it was like a switch had been flipped. She became a straight up psycho. It wasn't just hormones from pregnancy... this was a whole other level. She was psychologically and verbally abusive. She took being unreasonable and belligerent to a whole new level. I asked what she wanted for dinner one night, and she responded with \"You should KNOW what I want for dinner! You're supposed to just MAKE it!\" And it turned into an hours long fight over how the hell I'm supposed to know what SHE wants for dinner. Apparently I wasn't in tune with her enough to know and that was an unforgivable error. This is one of hundreds of little things she did to make me feel like a piece of shit. She NEVER missed a chance to take a shot at me. Miss my turn while driving somewhere, and have to turn around? I'm the most embarrassing boyfriend she's ever had, and she can't believe she even ALLOWS me to drive anymore. Shit like that, all day, every day. It was demoralizing, and I was broken for years because of her abuse.\n\nAnyway, we move into the new house, and within a month, she leaves me. So all this shit I did to turn my life upside down... I sold a house and bought a new one, which costs a lot of money in real estate fees/moving fees, and it was a more expensive home. Worse than that, I now had to deal with this fucking psycho for the next 18 years because she was carrying my baby.\n\nOn top of all this, she had been cheating on me, and was with her ex bf now. That's who she was moving in with.\n\nBut I was going to be a dad, which was cool I guess. Wished it was under different circumstances, but not having to see her every day was going to be nice.\n\nAbout a week before she gave birth, I ask if it's okay if I'm there when the child is born. She says \"I really need \\*other guy\\* to be there.\"\n\n\"I'm okay with that if he is.\"\n\n\"I gotta tell you something. There's a chance it's not your baby.\"\n\nAnd after fighting with her for 3 months to get the baby's blood type, it was inconclusive who's baby it was. So we went to the DNA test. Which she fought against me about, finally caving after I laid out in text everything she had done to me, and now she was leaving this question of whether or not I have a child unanswered.\n\nIt wasn't my baby. Bullet dodged. This was an enormous relief. Having to deal with her for 18 years while we co-raised a child would have been a nightmare. I had witnessed how she handled literally EVERY COMMUNICATION with her ex husband (***not*** the same guy she cheated on me with and moved in with). She was a fucking cunt to him. It didn't matter what it was about, she always found a way to start a fight.",

            "My ex husband! He told me he wanted a divorce, but I didn\u2019t.  He agreed to work on our relationship and give it a few months. We set a date and went to work, and he acted like things were changing and he wasn\u2019t going to leave. He started encouraging me to take out debt and spend money out of our savings, etc. \n\nTurns out that he was lying to me and had every intention of leaving on the date we set and \u201ccrushing\u201d me emotionally so I\u2019d hate him forever, and was encouraging me to take out debt since it was all in my name and he\u2019d get half the savings. I only found out his little scheme because he gave me his Apple Watch (that we\u2019d just purchased) while he was working on something and I read his messages because I had a feeling something wasn\u2019t quite right. For those of you that don\u2019t know, if you delete a message on your phone, it doesn\u2019t automatically delete from your Apple Watch. I found a few hundred messages to his best friend and mom talking about how much better he could do than me, he had feelings for a coworker and knew she wanted him too (spoiler alert, she didn\u2019t, she\u2019s just a nice lady), he hated me and I was the worst decision he\u2019d ever made, he never really had feelings for me anyway, etc. It was a bunch of savage, cruel shit. Finding it rocked me to my core. I\u2019d never imagined anyone could hate me like that, let alone someone I was married to!\n\nThis happened like two weeks after he\u2019d initially sat me down to talk. We were in public and I cried after finding the messages. I went up to him, held up his watch, and quietly told him I knew his plans and to find a different ride home. His smile dropped and the color drained from his face so quick. I went straight home and by the time he arrived, I\u2019d packed him a bag of essentials, left it on the doorstep, and called both his mom and best friend to let them know he\u2019d be needing a place to stay. He was crying and we hashed it out on the steps, which wasn\u2019t my proudest moment. I won\u2019t lie though, to see him cry after what he had said about me was so satisfying. \n\nThe next day, I had the locks changed. By the end of the day after that, I had all of his shit packed and waiting neatly in the living room for him to pick up. By the end of that month, I had filed for divorce and we were officially and legally done forever. \n\nHe\u2019s a fucking loser and I absolutely dodged a bullet. It\u2019s been a long road to rebuild my trust in people, though. I\u2019m definitely better off having gone through the whole situation, and while looking back it was the best thing that could have happened, it absolutely sucked to go through.",

            "Edit: Thanks to this thread a new Sub has been born! Please share your experiences.   r/PoorNarcissist\n\nLiteral bullet dodge story.\n\nIn my twenties I was really in to clay bird/sheet shooting.  I discovered an old ammo reloader from the 50s in my parents basement.  Father let me have it, he used to use it in his youth as well.\n\nSo, I started reloading the shells myself.  Shooting a few times a week it was worth wild to reload them for the savings.\n\nThe problem however is that the reloader was worn out and wasn't putting the proper proportions in to the shell some times. I wouldn't know this from lack of experience and not able to see the bar that fills up the powder in to the shell.\n\nThis bit is important to understand what's going to fail and how. How a reloader works is, put the powder in first, a plastic wad to keep the powder sealed in place, then the BB's (ammo) on top and the shell folds into it's self.   Doing this by hand would take a very long time. A reloader automates this process. All you have to do it put the physical shell in there, pull a hand crank and out comes the completed reloaded shell ready for action.\n\nAnyway, went to the range with two friends. We were having a blast (no pun intended) using this ammo. Up until this point we hadn't used a bad round yet. Friend tossed up a bird, I took a shot and it sounded weak, barely any kick to the gun.  What I should have done is stop right there and check things out.\n\nInstead I took another shot quickly so not to loose score.    The results are as follows.\n\nWhen I took the first shot the plastic wad went 3/4 up the barrel.  The shell didn't have enough powder in it.   When I took the next shot the bbs hit the plastic wad and the barrel flowered outward like a cartoon.\n\nI felt a BB rub my sideburns, that's how close the blow back was.  The box behind me was peppered with BB's, some how by pure luck none of us were hurt.\n\nI spent over $300 buying a new barrel for that gun as it was a 25th anniversary blood wood edition shotgun with changing choke tubes. It was my fathers, I wasn't going to return it like that. None of mine had choke tubes.\n\nAttached are pictures of the aftermath.   This happened in 2003. I have never shot a gun that uses gun powder again.  I made the switch to PCP air rifles, ordering over seas as that wasn't and still isn't really a thing here.\n\n[https://imgur.com/NgwW3KN](https://imgur.com/NgwW3KN)\n\n[https://imgur.com/wythb2Q](https://imgur.com/wythb2Q)",

It was ran like trash by trash people but I loved my immediate coworkers.\n\nThe day my friend asked me if I wanted the job, the managers had pissed me off something feirce, so it helped me make up my mind. I had my friend setup and interview. The pay was slightly less than what I was making. But in my gut I thought it was for the best.\n\nSo I did it. I switched jobs.\n\n5 years later I'm still with my friends company. I've thrived here. Even with the pay loss when I first started it was a net gain. Because this company picks up 100% of your insurance premiums, and it's a top of the line \"platinum\" plan that is so good nobody I've talked to has had anything even close. That should tell you how this place treats their employees. Oh yeah, and now I make more than double what I did at the last place. \n\nI look back on that time when I could have turned down my friends offer. Knowing myself, had I been in a different frame of mind that day I would have turned him down, which would have been the worst mistake of my life.\n\nEdit: To expand on this a little more. I still maintain contact with people from the previous company that I liked, things got bad after I left. The one manager I really liked and was fair and rational was fired. The big boss guy who fired him was also fired for unknown reasons. The cool shipping manager was fired. The dick headed other shipping manager was demoted and a bunch of people I liked left.\n\nI got one other guy from there a job at my current company when an opportunity presented itself and we've become better friends. \n\nI offered one other person a job but he turned me down.

We got our alcohol and my boyfriend said that we should take a different route home, to which I pulled him back and demanded we buy a taxi instead. The junkie chimed in and told him it was much safer for that anyway as the other boys had been flashing some weapon at us. I had stuffed an extra 20$ in my shoe just in case of any emergency. When our taxi pulled up we jumped in as fast as we could, as we drove away we seen the same 2 people who were following us take off running the same way we were going. Obviously we were quicker because of the vehicle, as we turned the corner we both noticed a huge group of like 13 people? I couldnt count every single one. That's when it hit me that we were about to be jumped. The taxi driver overhead our conversation and also seen the group so he ended up driving us home for free.

He knocked up the next girl after me twice, fathered 2 kids, got super-behind in child support.  He lost the FREE house his grandmother left him and recently declared bankruptcy.  He never married the mother of his children either, so he's bankrupt, lost a FREE house, and has children he can't support. Oh, and he sued his own grandfather (other side of family) and LOST.  He turned into as big an asshole as his own father was.\n\nHUGE bullet dodged - actually that was more of a dodged nuclear bomb.",

Firefighters show up, start mocking us when we tell them how long ago the alarm went off (~six hours or so). They stop laughing and get very serious when they pull out their own CO detector.\n\nA quick Google search tells me that CO at rates above 150-200 ppm can become fatal. The CO level in our apartment was over 400 ppm. Firefighters cleared the entire apartment building, which included preparing to break down the first floor apartment door because the women took so long to respond to their knocking (it was the middle of the night). \n\nWe couldn't go back to our apartment for a day or two and our landlord got in deep shit. **But here's the kicker:** my one roommate brought our CO detector with him from home when we moved in. Despite a law requiring it, none of the units in the apartment building had CO detectors in them by default. We survived that night because my roommate brought a detector, and last second decided to call his brother for advice about it going off before we all went to bed.

            "While in Iraq, my platoon got called up as a QRF (Quick Reaction Force) when one of the other platoons in my company got into some heavy shit. We didn't know it at the time, but they were getting cut to pieces during a planned night raid. \n\nYou have to understand, QRF getting called up doesn't NECESSARILY mean anything. It can just mean they expect resistance and need backup, or maybe they found something they didn't expect. \n\nSo I've had maybe 2 hours of sleep, because we'd JUST gotten off patrol, and we get called up. No biggie, get the guns and armor, pile into the vehicle, we're on site in maybe 20 minutes. \n\nThere's a motherfuckin' racket going on when we get there, gunfire, explosions, all the good stuff. At this point, we find out why we got called up. The platoon we got called in to back up got fucked up by the numbers. 30 guys went in, nearly all of them got wounded. Turns out they got a REALLY good tip about somebody making VBIEDs, and the entire house had been turned into a fortified fighting position. \n\nAnybody that knows anything about MOUT knows taking a fortified fighting position is REALLY expensive, when it comes to casualties. And this got really expensive for us. 1 kia, like 25 wounded or something crazy like that. \n\nThere's only one way to take a position like that, when it's surrounded on all sides by civilian houses. Can't blow it up, because you're in the middle of a city block. You've gotta go in the front door and kick their teeth in. \n\nMy PL gives us the call that we're gonna breach the house again. The other platoon didn't know what they were walking into, so they were cautious and held their fire until they were engaged. By then it was too late. \n\nWe know what's in there already, so we're just gonna go in guns blazing, kill everything in that house, and call it a night. \n\nWe get out of the vehicles, get ready to stack up outside the door, frag grenades ready to go in.\n\nWe get the call to stand down. We're like, \"What the fuck? Why? Let's just do this shit.\" \n\nTurns out Special Forces wanted to take a crack at it themselves, along with a platoon of Iraqi Army. \n\nThey breach, and we hear them bringing the fuckin' ruckus, then....\n\n*BOOOOOM*\n\nThe dudes inside the house wired the entire thing to blow, so once they saw they were gonna lose, they opted out of life, and took one of the SF guys and the entire platoon of IA with them. \n\nThe aftermath was fucked up. Blood in the streets, bodies everywhere, UXO rolling around, just a complete fuckin' shit show. If all the explosives they'd wired up had actually detonated, it would have taken out that whole block, and I'd probably be dead, even if I hadn't gone into that deathtrap. \n\nI'm only here right now because SF wanted to harden up the platoon of IA they'd been training. I was 30 seconds away from getting a shiny medal and a gold star for my Mom, along with most of my platoon.\n\nStill makes me sick to this day. \n\nTLDR, Almost got 'sploded.

            "Right before freshman year of high school, I was interested in trying out for the tennis team. I was lukewarm about it, and the morning of tryouts my dad came into the room and asked if I wanted to go.

I ended up meeting my absolute best friends, rekindled my love for tennis, was on varsity for three years, and it completely dictated my high school career.",
            "The first day I ever signed up for internet back in 1999, I installed mIRC (because it was on the starter disk my ISP gave me) and joined a random chat room.

All that practice made me a fast typist and WAY better communicator than I was before that.  They would even help me when I had trouble understanding something in my college classes.  I also met my husband in that room, and we\u2019ve been happily married for 18 years.  Others from our little IRC family are married, too, and we still keep in touch.

My oldest player has a younger sister who came to watch a practice - we will call her Grace. She saw my daughter on the team, told her dad \"There's a girl on that team!\" and the next week, she was on my roster. Her and my daughter became fast friends. While the flag football season was wrapping up, I was putting together my roster for the upcoming rec volleyball team.

            "Decided to approach a girl in a wheelchair in a bar because I thought it was cool of her to be out and about having a good time. We become bar buddies. A week later she brings a friend with her. I get along with the friend. We start dating, we marry, we have a daughter. Had I not said 'hi' to the wheelchair lady that night, I wouldn't have the most precious things in my life right now.\n\n\nEdit: ok, since this got a little attention I'll provide a little bit more literature.\nLike said before, after approaching the girl ( let's call her Y) on the wheelchair  we hung out the rest of the night and exchanged contact numbers. I did not intend to pursue her in any romantic fashion even though she was actually very attractive. Her disability was temporary. She told mr she passed out in the bathtub and hit her head and when she woke up she couldn't feel her legs. Shr was doing physiotherapy. As far as I know, I believe she started walking a couple years after meeting her. \n\nSo, we were buddies for a while, I would push her chair all over town and made sure she was accepted in my group of friends. Even though my friends made jokes about me liking her, I never put myself out there as someone who was interested and she always shut those jokes off and kind of belittled me as if I was not good enough for her. Which was fine, I took it as banter between friends. The night I met my wife, I took Y home because well, she was in a wheelchair and it was like 3 am. We sat outside her house and talked until like 7am. We talked about everything and she asked if I liked her friend (my wife), I said yes and she asked if I wanted her to give it a little push. I said I didn't need that and I prefer it for things to be natural and that I would approach her friend on my own terms and that was that.\n\nWell...she didn't like that. Not that I didn't accept her help, but that I liked her friend. Apparently I had been leading her on for weeks by being nice and considerate of her disability. I didn't know it when I approached her first but she confessed later she didn't have a lot of friends, so I tried to be one. Even if I was romantically invested in her, which I obviously wasn't, she would often assure me I had no chance with her. Now thinking about it I guess she was \"negging\" me? Well, it worked pretty well. I had absolutely no interest in her in a romantic way. And after hanging out for weeks I actually stopped liking her because she would create drama every where we went. Shouting at waitresses, bullying bouncers in overcrowded bars to let her in because she was in a wheelchair, playing psychological games with my friends, the list goes on. After finding out I was interested in her friend, she cancelled dinner with me and my friends and went to the restaurant her friend worked and created a scene and told her not to see me ever again. Her friend told her to calm down and still wanted to meet up at the same bar we always went. They came and Y spent the whole night bad mouthing me to my friends, every time I was talking to anyone in the bar - specially girls - she would come over and start shouting and telling them I wasn't worth shit. I had no clue why she was acting that way and it turns out she liked me the whole time and told my friends I was a acting like a teenager leading her on - even though she constantly negged me and belittled me in front of everyone? Someone was a little bit delusional. I had to come clean with her friend and said I never showed interested in Y and that I actually liked her and wanted to take her out. Y proceeded to run her friend over with the wheelchair. Her friend is now my wife and everytime Y's name comes up she won't shut up about how her foot still hurts even years after that incident.\nY spent the next weeks trying to turn my friends against me even though they had known me for decades and knew I wasn't this mean person she was trying to say I was.\n\nI don't regret any of it. I was always fair and never tried or showed any interested besides friendship with her. When she asked me if I was into her friend I straight up told her yes. I'm happy to have met her, and that she introduced me to my wife, I hope she is well and healthy but we don't keep in touch, no.",

I must say our relationship was pretty on the rocks but I was still going to go through with things even though at that point I had tried breaking up with him like 100x, he was pretty mentally controlling. I went for an interview at the beginning of summer...I was straight forward and told them my plans for moving at the end of summer. They said they wanted someone who would be staying past summer. So I applied for a bunch of other jobs, one being a grocery store about 10 minutes from my house. Of all the places I applied I really decided to pursue keeping up with my application process with them. They lost my first application so I filled out another one and after a week or so ended up calling just about every day to see if my app had been looked at. Eventually the manager of the position I applied for agreed to let me come in for an interview. After one with her, one at corporate, a drug screening and so on they told me I got the job.

            "When I was eighteen, I used some spray on hair dye for a Halloween costume. It looked freaking awesome, so I decided to go get it permanently dyed for the first time. This, in turn, made me incredibly attractive to a girl who was into that sort of thing, whom I began to date. We were in school, so when the year was over, I looked at my savings and realized I had enough to purchase a car, and that way, I could drive over to her town and see her when we weren\u2019t in school together. Because I suddenly had a car, my parents realized I was more independent, which made them reevaluate their current hometown. See, they had both grown up in a big city, but they moved to a smaller town to raise my siblings and me. When they saw that we were adults, they decided they didn\u2019t need to live in that smaller town anymore, and then they moved back to that bigger city. Well, this meant that I took a work term in that bigger city, where I met a coworker who helped me see where my relationship with this girl was not healthy, so I eventually decided it would be best to leave it. When I moved back to school at the end of my work term, one of my friends needed to go to the city where my parents lived for some paperwork, and because I had a car and I liked that big city, I offered to drive her over. This led to a long chat in the car where she and I got to know each other really well. We eventually became each other\u2019s best friend, after which point we started dating. In comparing this relationship to the previous one, I can see how this one is so much more healthy, and I understand that much more about healthy relationships.\n\nTLDR a costume led to hair dye\nHair dye led to relationship\nRelationship led to car\nCar led to parents moving\nParents moving led to job\nJob led to breakup\nBreakup plus car plus parents move led to long car ride\nLong car ride led to healthy relationship\n\nAnd that kids is how I met your mother",

            "One day when I was about 11 years old, I went to a farmer's market with my father. While we were there, I saw a street performer who was juggling, and I absolutely loved watching him. So I decided I was going to learn to juggle. A few months later, I started 6th grade, and my middle school had a juggling club after classes one day a week, where the very same guy i saw performing at the farmer's market would be teaching kids to juggle. So of course I went.\n\nTwo years later, I'm now 13 years old. I was looking online for some juggling forums, and /r/juggling was the most active one I could find. So I created a reddit account. Eventually I started exploring other subreddits, and then one day I found myself in /r/IAmA, where I read an AMA by a guy who had loaded a bunch of camping gear onto his bicycle and spent a year and a half riding from northern Alaska to the southern tip of South America. I loved cycling, I loved camping, and at the time, I'd recently returned home from my first international travel \u2014to Costa Rica, a country he went through on his journey\u2014 and absolutely loved that, so the way most 13 year olds obsess over something, I developed a bit of an obsession for bicycle touring.\n\nFinally, the summer when I was 16 years old, I felt ready to pitch the idea to my parents, though on a much smaller scale. So one day, I borrowed my mom's bike, because the bike I had at the time had no way to carry my stuff, and I took whatever camping gear i could find in our garage and haphazardly bungeed it to the back of the bike. And then I rode to a state park about 40 miles from our house that we'd driven to many times before. I camped there for the night, then biked back home the next day.\n\nI absolutely loved it. So the next summer, it wasn't quite such a surprise to my parents when I pitched the idea of spending four days biking 200 miles, again camping in state parks each night. After that, I was going into my senior year of high school. I realized that perhaps my best opportunity to do some big crazy year long bike camping adventure would be before I got stuck with a bunch of college debt, and then a career I couldn't easily leave, etc. So I decided to take a gap year after high school.\n\nAfter finishing high school in 2017, I realized that long term traveling would require more money than I had. So after spending one last summer screwing around with my friends from high school before they scattered across the country for college, I took what little money I did have and went off on my most ambitious bike trip up to that point, spending 20 days cycling  1,300 miles around Lake Michigan, starting and ending at my home in southern Wisconsin.\n\nWhen I returned from the Lake Michigan trip, I had two dollars and change to my name, so I quickly found a job, selling my soul to the world of retail for the better part of the next two years. The first two weeks of October of 2018, I took my vacation time from work and flew my bike out to Asheville, North Carolina to spend those two weeks cycling up the Blue Ridge Parkway and part of Skyline Drive before turning east to Washington DC.\n\nAnd then, last summer, I decided it was finally time. I quit my job in early July, and then spent the next month and a half preparing for that big crazy bike ride I'd dreamed of for so long. In mid-August, I was finally ready, and I left my home in Wisconsin with the vague goal of riding to Seattle and down the Pacific coast. I spent the better part of the next seven months cycling 5,300 miles around the country, turning east from San Diego into Arizona. In mid-March of this year, I was hanging out in Sedona, Arizona, waiting for the nighttime temperatures at the Grand Canyon to warm up a bit, when the coronavirus really started to take a turn for the worst. I was worried that airports and train stations might start shutting down, and not wanting to be halfway across the country from my family if and when that happened, I decided to bike the final 30 miles from Sedona up to Flagstaff and get on an Amtrak back home to the Midwest.\n\nSince then, I've been back to work, saving up some money for my next adventure. Now that I've seen most of the US that I want to, I'm starting to think of doing some international bike touring, and I'm pretty excited about the possibility of New Zealand, once they reopen their borders. Eventually I intend to go back to college, but for the time being, I'm not in any rush to do that. But when it does happen, I'll surely be studying for a field that will allow me to continue to travel extensively.\n\n**TL;DR** going to a farmer's market one day as a kid had a huge effect on my career choices and college plan, and along the way I learned to juggle, got introduced to Reddit, and rode a bicycle across the US.",

That last internship I applied for was the one I got. 5 years later, I'm still working there, moved halfway across the country, and I've gotten to go to grad school because of it.

            "My freshman year of high school, I had a crush on a girl. She was into theater.

I got the part, she didn't. Then I found I liked theater, and the people there were actually friendly instead of the toxic friendships I had.

Lost weight (270-190 pounds), started going to the gym, doing skincare and taking care of my hair. My clothes didn't fit anymore so I got into fashion and streetwear.

My theater friends had gotten me into computers and math, too - so I joined an accredited mechanical engineering program. \n\nNow I'm nearly out of college with a mechanical engineering degree and a good job.

I didn't have much money but I still wanted to join my friends for a New Years party in Minneapolis so I headed back up in the afternoon. My car threw a belt (the tensioner died too) and instead of calling a tow truck, I called an old friend in the area for help to save money. After a multiple hours long debacle, we ended up at his dad's house who he'd borrowed the truck from. His dad offered me a job, so I ended up moving back to Milwaukee, and eventually renting a flat from my grandma. \n\nIn Minneapolis, it was me and friends. I had no responsibilities, no obligations except the occasional trip home to see family, and my life was truly mine.

Kitbashed photography darkroom doors lead to checkered dance floors where somebody was inevitably mixing some real dirty, thumping shit of their own accord. Somebody had built a whole ass ball pit and decorated it with blacklit neon jungle faux-flora. Holes had been sawed between the different floors and sturdy wooden ladders had been installed, so every floor could be connected without exiting into the drab, undecorated hallways and concrete stairwells which masked this glorious rainbow assault on municipal fire safety codes.\n\nAnd the people who maintained this marvelous work were *utterly fantastic.* Artists, musicians, welders, mathematicians, college professors, makers and designers and coders. I got caught up in a three way conversation with a professional UFO investigator, a woman who designed her own lesbian calendar photoshoots, and a guy who used 3D printers to build bigger and better 3D printers.\n\nEvery surface was a canvas, every person was ardently whole and realized, every doorway was a portal to something and somewhere new, and I'd never seen or conceived of any living situation so radically spectacular in my life. I returned to Jake's side of the apartment to find   him and his husband grinning at my reaction. I had been lead to a burner loft, a home for those folks who make the yearly pilgrimage to Burning Man. I decided then and there that I was going to find a way to live there and contribute, and it was the best and most impactful decision I'd ever made in my life.",

She set up a weekend in Austin. \n\nBy the time we left on Sunday she said \"I want to move there.\" I did not want to leave my job but figured I could give it a shot. Faxed a resume on Sunday night. Phone screen on Monday morning. They booked a flight for me to interview on that Friday. The following Tuesday morning I have a Fed-Ex'd offer letter and started two weeks later.\n\nThat company exploded in growth (early Internet explosion). Now I am 55 and have been retired for a few years, living the dream in Austin. And I bike every day.",

Because of that small decision to try something new, I gained some of the best friends I've ever had, gained confidence in myself, and met my husband.",
            "I decided to go to my friend's cosplay club meeting in college. I wasn't doing much so it was a nice way to spend an afternoon.\n\nFurther along, I ended up the secretary of the club and helped to set it up as an official club at the school. I ended up being the VP in my senior year just 2 years later\n\nDuring my senior year one of the members decided to do a makeup tutorial for everybody and asked me to help out and be a model for her. \n\nThat session made me realize that I was trans, and here I am over 4 years later, celebrating a year with my boyfriend and happiest I've ever been."

            "My father has extreme PTSD for Vietnam, a history of being abused physically and mentally, and I\u2019m sure several undiagnosed mental health issues on top of a CVS receipt worth of physical issues. He was heavily medicated for all of the above but there was no medication management going on so he was a mess and in retrospect I understand and feel terrible that he went through that. Most of my childhood was hard with him after a certain point. He was prescribed OxyContin for pain in his knees which he had just broken at work. This might have been the tipping point. \n\nHe told me \u201cyou\u2019re probably not my son, I didn\u2019t want you, you look nothing like me and your mother would tuck anything on two wheels.\u201d \nThis was followed by literally dragging me while I cried to take a paternity test, which he was very nasty about. But my mother explained that he had several serious conditions that were hereditary and that was his way of making sure I wouldn\u2019t be sick in the future. Turns out he\u2019s my dad and I have a future of disease to look forward to. \n\nAnother time he had a complete unprovoked meltdown while sitting in his truck with me in our driveway. He said \u201cI hate my life, I\u2019m going to lock myself in my bedroom and shoot myself in the head.\u201d\nI stole his .45 and threw it into a quarry along with his hunting rifles and a shotgun. \n\n\u201cI hope some day you have a child that you hate as much as I hate you.\u201d \n\nAnd lastly, Upon finding out that he had an extremely rare blood condition, he said \u201cI\u2019m going to die soon, you need to learn to be a man and not deal with it the way you deal with everything else, like a pussy.\u201d I didn\u2019t talk to him for years after this. \n\nI\u2019m sure there was a hundred more miserable me things said. But those were the shining stars. \n\nI confronted him one day when. I was around sixteen and could tell he was calm and in a mental state where talking wasn\u2019t out of the question. His anger wasn\u2019t an escalating thing. Or something you could really provoke. It just happened. Like an explosion. So I chose a calm moment and asked him why he said these things. You could 100% see in his face that he was almost in disbelief. He sobbed. Mind you this is my Vietnam vet,  strangle another karate dad in front of a crowd for making a snotty comment about me, flip the principles desk for suspending me over defending myself from bullies rather. A scary man. Sobbing. Begging for my forgiveness and telling me he didn\u2019t mean or believe anything he said to me. After that he went to a doctor and they managed his medicine. He was still a weirdo. But he never said anything abusive to me again. \n\nI\u2019m about to be 35 in a month. This all happened when I was around 13-16. It\u2019s not something we have spoke about since that day. In my adult life he\u2019s been my number one supporter, he\u2019s always supported my weirdo art, noise, filmmaking, he treats my children like they\u2019re his entire world. He told me that my son gave him a new meaning in life, he\u2019s always there when I\u2019m in a pinch. He\u2019s just a good person. My take away from this was that being on top of your mental health and medication management are so important. I learned from the experience, albeit at the cost of some of my sanity, I\u2019m sure. But When I found out that we were going to have our first child I went and got myself on the track to taking care of my own mental health problems. I would never want to hurt my sons feelings. Or daughter now. As of a week ago. And I\u2019m grateful that my father got beyond that point in his life and was able to move forward and become the person he really is beneath the shell that had formed. He\u2019s my best friend and I missed they best friendship.  Unless your parent is inherently evil, give them as many chances as they need to be your parent.

            "When my kids was potty training, he was in a phase where he loved temporary tattoos.  We used tattoos as a reward for a successful potty trip.  He got so he was covered on both arms, back and chest.  We didn't think much of it, living in Seattle, until one summer day we took him to the wading pool.  For one of the first times in public, we took his shirt off, and he strode out into the pool with his toddler abs, and Thomas the tank train shorts, looking like he had just finished a hard set of reps at the free weights in the prison yard.",
            "When my son was about two and a half, we thought it would be a good idea to start potty training him. We sat him down, talked to him explaining to him when he pees/poops in the potty he can a reward. He was less than thrilled. It was pretty clear he was not interested. We start the process of putting him on the potty, every morning, at regular intervals, etc. \nAfter 2 days, he hasn't done anything on the potty, with the added bonus of not having ANY bowel movements, at all( and this kid was REGULAR). After 4 days we begin to panic, prune juice, oatmeal, apple juice, anything to get him to poop. At day 5, we are at the Dr.s, who tells us to use suppositories. You guys we gave him suppositories for 3 nights, still nothing! Day 10 rolls around and we're thinking it's time for the hospital,he's got a blockage, he's sick, something is seriously wrong here! Take him to the Dr, one last time before the hospital. This time we see a different Dr, who looks at us and asks if we are potty training him, we shake our heads yes, wondering why it matters, since he hasn't even shit for 10 DAYS! He barely needs a diaper, let alone a potty. He kind of smiles and says, \"well, stop\". He told us that he thought that the potty training was causing him to hold his bowel movements. And that when he was ready to be potty trained, he would let us know. Sceptical, but willing to give it a shot, instead of the hospital we went back home. We made a big show of putting the potty chair up, and told him that if he pooped, he could have any toy in Target (we were desperate!) and no more potty training.......\n---20 minutes later he took the biggest shit of his little life, and we took our weary, but, relieved asses to Target to buy him his dream toy. \n---A Hotwheels Carwash. Best $29.99 we ever spent.\n---3 months later he wakes up, says \"I want to go potty like Daddy\" and has been potty trained ever since",

I mean financially and emotionally. \n\nThese are typically young women (sometimes young men as well) who do not work, do not have children, stay home all day and have no friends or hobbies outside of hanging out with their spouse. Very unhealthy, and a huge red flag. Always ends in a painful and messy breakup.\n\nGenerally, we try to get them to find a friend, join a community, get a job or volunteer - something to provide them with self worth and personal fulfillment outside of their spouse.",

            "Child & Family therapist here, not exactly couples therapy, but there are key family dynamics that set off red flags for interpersonal relationships within a family, whether it is between parents, parents and kids, or simply kids. \n\n\n The most important piece comes from invalidation. This comes in many forms, from gaslighting to just simple denial of another's opinion. Most of the time one or both parties are simply trying to be heard on an emotional level with an event or topic that was brought up, but the other party takes this as a personal attack on their ideals. \n\n\nWe've all heard of or know people who will **literally disagree with anything you say simply because you said it**. That's the invalidation I'm referring to. \n\n\nClich\u00e9 Moral of the story: Attack the problem, not each other. \nPeople rarely have the exact same stance in a conflict, but usually (in healthy relationships) have very similar core values. While 2 parents may disagree on how to parent a child (authoritarian vs authoritative for example), the core value of caring about their children and wanting them to succeed is often the same. By determining they are within the same realm of issue, 2 parents with different ideals can see themselves as allies in a conflict rather than enemies. \n\n\nTwo things that people believe are red flags of poor relationships are the amount of conflicts the couple has and yelling. Neither is inherently a characteristic of good or bad relationships, but may be perceived as more common in bad relationships. The reality of this situation is that healthy relationships actually have a comparable amount of conflicts, but more intensely focus on addressing the core issue rather than the beliefs and self-worth of the other. \n\nAs for yelling, in this case its an emotional response to not feeling heard. While not the best response to distress, it also isn't an indicator of poor communication skills. What *is* an indicator of poor communication is *yelling over* the other person in an attempt to invalidate their point.\n\n\nSemi-related example: \nI had 2 people who were seemingly incredibly upset at each other. Parent A felt that Parent B was out of the house too frequently and did not want to be a part of their children's life. Parent B felt that Parent A didn't understand how busy their work schedule was. The fight revolved around Parent B seemingly not caring about the kids, until Parent B explained they felt Parent A was better at parenting and felt like they were only escalating the children when they started to parent. Parent A's understanding of the argument quickly changed from \"You don't love our children\" to \"You're scared to let our children down\". As you can guess the tone of the conversation changed dramatically and there was no longer a sense that Parent A and B were on opposing sides. The issue instead became helping build confidence in Parent B's parenting abilities, which Parent A was much more validating and supportive of. \nNot all cases are this clean cut by any means, but I figured I'd demonstrate the basic idea of finding core values and attacking an issue together.",
            "I'm not a therapist, but my therapist straight face told me that \"there are worse options than divorce\". \n\nGot divorced and it was the best thing that happened to me.",
            "I saw a couple that was doing \"retaliatory\" cheating  (and telling each other about it).  When they got through their anger, they decided to call a truce and made peace.  With their level of emotional maturity, I doubt it lasted.  I don't know if I helped them or prolonged their suffering.  It was their decision to come to counseling, so I think it was the help they wanted. \n\nOther clients realize what they really want is \"divorce counselling\".  What's the best way to behave civilly and minimize damage to the kids while we go our separate ways?",
            "People who approach therapy with the idea that they must convince the therapist that they\u2019re right and their partner is wrong. Almost like they\u2019re complaining to a parent or boss to have them sort out the problems.",

            "Relationship therapist here.\n\nOne of the biggest red flags I see when working with a new couple is when they've totally forgotten the good. Part of relationship therapy is reconnecting a couple with what they like about each other, what initially attracted them to each other, and what the positives are between them. \n\nWhen people come in and they've been so unhappy for so long that they actually can't remember what it was like to be in love, or to even like each other, they're just about hopeless. \n\nYou don't have to be happy for therapy to work--but if you can't even reminisce about the good times, then the good times are probably over.\n\nEDIT - This is clearly resonating with some folks, so I'd like to recommend a book. If you find yourself in this situation, check out \"Hold Me Tight\" by Dr. Sue Johnson. She gives some solid explanations of how people get into this cycle, as well as some suggestions on how to try and navigate it.",
            "1. Couples in a tit for tat arrangement. For example: I cheated so you can have one night to cheat with whomever. Or I violated your trust and did drugs, you can go out and do whatever for one night. It erodes trust and compounds the hurt. \n\n2. An affair that won't end. I've never seen a relationship bounce back where a partner is still in contact with their gf/bf (I don't mean an ex gf/bf, I mean the person x is having the affair with), or is lying about it. \n\n3. Control to an excessive amount. I most commonly see partners having to send pictures holding up a certain number of fingers or proving that it's a live picture. This is abuse. \n\n4. Overbearing parents and in laws. I understand there's a ton of cultural nuance here, and I work with couples who have arranged marriages, as well as the south Asian community. However, when a spouse is more allied with their parents and calls them on speakerphone for fights, or often speaks ill of their partner to their parents,  I usually see these couples stay very unhappily married for years. It's sad. \n\nIf it's not abuse and a partner is willing to end an affair and genuinely work on it, I'll help support. I think couples therapy is sometimes helping couples have the courage to voice what they really want, and that may be separation.\n\nEdit: added another, and thanks for the awards folks!\n\nEdit 2: I can't ethically dive in to some of your comments or give specific resources, but get in touch with your local crisis line or community service agency and they can direct you. Wishing all of you the best with your relationships and in laws and parents.\n\nEdit 3: I answered some of the common questions in the comments. I intentionally have to be really vague and I can't comment on specific cases, it's unethical. I won't be able to respond to any more comments because this blew up far more than I ever expected, but thanks for reading. I hope this helps open the door to therapy for you or your loved ones in tough situations. If it's any help, I'm a therapist who goes to their own therapist. \n\nAlso, some of these situations are nuanced, some are not. I'm not saying sharing your location with your partner is abusive, or that sending a picture to your spouse is. Therapists get a ton of data and history and information that helps us better understand what's going on. Sometimes, there's a dynamic between two people and they can set off a cycle. (read Sue Johnsons books for this, Love Sense and Hold Me Tight). Other times, I think it's unethical to assume a partner was hit because they deserved it or set their partner off. That's not ok. Please reach out to your local agencies and crisis line if you or a loved one needs help.",

            "It's very easy to work out when one person knowingly prioritises their own wants and needs over their partners. Relationships like this are often doomed because the person simply doesn't care enough to make any meaningful change.",
            "Someone elses response made me think of this one. When a partner raises objection to meeting with me individually. During the first session I share that during assessment I like to meet with them both together and once each individually. Occasionally I'll have partners who suddenly become very critical or suspicious about this. Asking why I'd do that, and is it ethical, and the classic \"I've never heard of a marriage counselor doing that before?!\"  It goes beyond curiosity or simply inquiring about practice. There is an incredulous and almost panicked tone to it. And sure enough, Every. Single. Time. They turn out to be some variation of controlling, manipulative, abusive.\n\nEdit: Just to clarify for a few of the comments, I'm not talking about doing concurrent, ongoing individual and couples sessions. This is just a 'one-off' individual assessment session. My first 3 sessions are usually 1) couples session, 2) partner A individual, and 3) partner B individual. After that we are typically only as a couple, unless another 'one-off' is needed for further assessment down the road. If needed, I refer out for ongoing concurrent individual or pause for more intensive individual. \n\nAnd thanks for the silver and awards!!",
            "My mom is a therapist and she sometimes tells me a little bit about her cases (nothing specific or identifying). She once came home really upset about a case and told me a little bit. Basically this guy sent his wife in because she was \u201chaving trouble with the baby\u201d, he came with her and interrupted her at basically every turn and basically told my mom his wife was bipolar. In another session the patient admitted she almost felt angry with the baby, and herself because she knew she would be a terrible mother (her husband had been saying it since she got pregnant). My mom told me it became almost instantly clear that the husband was manipulative and abusive, and probably trying to stop her from connecting with the child. As soon as my mom suggested she was angry with her husband and not her baby all of their future sessions were canceled.",
            "Constant, needless escalation.\n\nWhen \"I dont think we need this expensive thing\" is escalated to \"you don't really love me\" - major problem.\n\nIt shows up quickly in therapy if you're watching for it.\n\nMostly because the one using this to avoid accountability is almost guaranteed to play this card in relation to therapy itself, either \"I had to drag them here\" or \"they're just trying to break up with me\"\n\nWhat they're doing is avoiding conversation about the issue by blowing it up into a bigger problem then it is, so they can make the other person respond to their feelings rather than dealing with their concerns.",
            "Not my client, but I had to watch as my own roommate dealt with her fiance. \n\nHe was:\nA. controlling her (physically/activities/financials).\nB. continuously dismissing her feelings/assessments/opinions (fiance would revert to baby talk, speaking to roommate like she was an uneducated child, \"daddy knows best\" type of gaslighting garbage).\nC. *trying* to hide his narcissistic tendencies behind his \"good church boy\" exterior.\n\n This was all happening in my condo while she was waiting to move out and marry him. I usually tried to stay out of their issues, but one afternoon I softly encouraged her-- saying I agreed with her re: an argument I'd witnessed earlier in the day-- she came back that night after the fiance *convinced* her that \"I was jealous and was trying to break them up so I could have him...\" \n\nShe barely talked to me again until she moved out. Sadly they did get married, have 2 kids, and she's a completely isolated stay at home mom. I don't even want to imagine what it's like for her at home.",
            "I'm an MFT (marriage and family therapist) and for me, an unofficial litmus test is when I ask at some point in the first few sessions how the couple met. If there is absolutely no positive affect from either person, no one even cracks a smile, or they just give me a single sentence answer (\"we met at a party.\"), that's usually a signal they've been so unhappy so long, or the conflict is so overwhelming that they can't access those good warm fuzzy feelings from the beginning. I partly wanted to do this job because I'm a romantic at heart and love hearing real love stories, and for the most part, hearing about their first few months together is an actually fun and illuminating part of therapy. Only a few times have I seen the flat or no affect couples and it breaks my heart every time. \n\n\nI remember learning in grad school that most couples who come for therapy have lived unhappily for an average of 7 years before trying to get help. They come for that first sssion and if they aren't \"cured\" after that, most think that therapy doesn't work and don't come back. To anyone who may be considering individual or couples therapy as a result of this thread, go for it, and be prepared for it to take some time and energy from you and your therapist.",

            "I\u2019ll just say that if you find yourself screaming \u201cI\u2019m not fucking yelling at you,\u201d you might have a communication problem.\n\nEdit: I want to add a more thoughtful note, but I should also mention that I mainly work with individuals. Similar to what others have said, the reddest of flags for me is when clients try to get me to take sides. I can understand why people may do that every now and then during more difficult discussions, but if it happens consistently it's a huge problem. There are plenty of reasons that people may do this, but the reality is that therapy is meant to foster cooperation between partners. Feeling like you need the therapist on your side indicates you're approaching the relationship as a competition, not a cooperative interaction, and nothing good comes from that.\n\nAlso, I once had a supervisor who did a great deal of couples work tell me that it has such a bad success rate because people rarely come before the relationship has crossed the point of no return. Unfortunately that seems to be a very accurate description.",
            "What-aboutism.  Instead of taking ownership and responsibility for their contribution to the degradation of the relationship one or both parties simply point out an example of the other exhibiting a similar behavior.\n\nIt's a red flag because it illustrates their lack of self awareness and poor communication skills.  Communication is key when trying to mend a tattered relationship because without respectful communication the conflict-recovery process can never begin.\n\nIn the conflict-recovery model both parties agree to the terms under which they will communicate (no yelling, no interrupting, no I told you so's... Etc).  Each party gets a chance to share how the others actions make them feel.  Then they each propose their solutions and identify where they made assumptions or where they got triggered and why.

I thought that would be great, since it may help us open up more having a member of both sexes there. My wife was hesitant about couples counseling, but agreed to try it.\n\nWe had our initial session together and it was cold and difficult (as expected), and my wife said she still wanted to leave, but they convinced her to try a few more sessions to see if anything clicked as we opened up. We had an individual session the next time, and I thought it went fantastically. I gained a completely different understanding of intimacy (not sexual, but emotional and relational) and I was jazzed to start working at putting it into practice. My wife came out with tear stains and sat in her car crying before she finally left for home. (We drove separately because she was coming from work and I from home).\n\nOur next appointment was another individual session. The male counselor and I were talking again, and he started digging into my expectations and desires in the relationship, what I loved about *wife*, etc. He point-blank asked me \"Do you feel *wife* is a good match for you in life, and that you want to continue this relationship\" and I was a little off-put, but figured yeah it's probably a good thing to establish that right off the bat, so I answered emphatically yes, and he just looked heartbroken and so very sad. I knew pretty well right then that we were toast. Wife admitted her affair the day before our next session and left.",

She recounted many times that her and the ex clashed. I said, you know, you don't have to interact with him and maybe just distancing yourself is the way to go.\n\nThen she told me that they still lived together and had no plans of moving...\n\nThe red flag, indicted I was dealing with two crazy people.",

            "My grand-aunt was a couple's therapist for many many years, now she volunteers at her church counselling couples. She's my relationship sage. Number of red flags she's told me about:\n\n1. Spouses who don't sleep together without a justifiable reason. As in, not due to work conflicts or medical reasons, but because one spouse just doesn't feel like going to bed alongside the other. Lack of intimacy, both sexual and non-sexual, will lead to the two drifting apart.\n\n2. When one spouse has a close relationship with a member of the opposite sex who doesn't like the other spouse. The old \"He/She's just a _friend_.\" If it doesn't lead to cheating, it still will usually cause unneeded strain that will break apart the relationship.\n\n3. One that initially surprised me: \"We're staying together for the kids.\" It leads to an unhealthy mindset where the couple sees the children as a burden and believe that by remaining in an unhealthy relationship, it will somehow make the kids turn out alright. Kids are smarter than you think, and if mom and dad don't love each other, they'll pick up on it. If the kids are really the priority, either learn to fix the relationship, or end it.\n\n4. In premarital counseling, when the couple states that they're saving themselves for their wedding night, and then one or both confides privately that they're not a virgin and the other has no idea. In broader terms, when a couple isn't honest with each other about their sexual history. So many reasons that's unhealthy, I can't even begin to list them all, but the biggest is that honesty is the most solid foundation on which to build a relationship. If you're afraid of what your partner will think, ask yourself if you want to deal with in now or later. Deal with it now.\n\nThe biggest problems she's dealt with are when it's clearly the fault of one member of the relationship and the other desperately wants to fix the issue. Like in the first instance, she told me of a couple where she understood that the wife wanted out of the relationship, but didn't want to directly confront her husband about it, while the husband thought the issue was just a minor problem. Turns out, the wife had to actually cheat in order for the husband to realize how serious things were, which led to him ending up on anti-depressants and contemplating suicide. From what she told me, that one ended in acrimonious divorce, but she never told me what became of either party.\n\nSomething she emphasizes is that people are often blind to the red flags that a therapist can spot right away. Such is the nature of being a trained professional. It's why she recommends people see a counselor even if they don't think their issues are that deep. It's not shameful to ask for help, she always says.",

            "Late to the party, but here goes.\n\nMy most favorite exercise in couples counseling is to have them listen to 45 seconds-1 minute of instrumental music. Think...Loreena McKennit - Greensleeves or something like that. Music that people don't really usually listen to. \n\nThen I ask Person A to tell Person B what they imagined while they were listening to the music. Then Person B shares the same.\n\nThen we listen to the same music again but I ask Person A to try and see what Person B (and vice versa) imagined and pay attention to what they think/feel when they do that.\n\nInteresting dynamics come up immediately.\n\n(I'll share my own personal story here from when my own couples therapist did this with an ex and I)\n\nMe: oh I imagined myself wearing a long, billowing green dress walking thru a green green valley. Think Scotland or Ireland. A remote castle was at the top of the hill and my scarf was flying in the wind. There was a gently, bubbly stream somewhere there too.\n\nHim: I imagined myself on a cliff with the ocean waves crashing violently on the rocks. There was a storm with lightning and thunder. I was cold.\n\nAwesome therapist (credit where credit is due, he was awesome): ok let's do that again, but try to see if you can visualize what the other person imagined, ok?\n\nMusic clip played again.\n\nMe (inner thoughts): ok so the cliff...yeah, I can see that, but C'MON now! A storm and violent waves? No way! Bubbly stream is so clear here!!!! Okokok so waves and...what did he say again? Cold? That's so stupid. It's a nice, warm day, maybe a bit windy but if it evoked cold I would've never imagined myself in a dress! Wait, I'm supposed to be imagining his scenario... It just... Didn't fit. Why did he.... When will this be over? \n\nAT: ok so tell me how that went.\n\nHim: I tried, I really did, but I started visualizing her scene and it was SO...off? I mean, I'll give her the green and all, but -\n\nMe: whaa? Why do you always invalidate what i perceive? (Never mind that I had just done the same in my head with him btw)\n\n\nSo. Anyone want to analyze the twisted dynamics that were at play during our whole relationship there?\n\nI laugh gently while I tell you guys this, but they were very clear from the outside and very confusing and combative from the inside.\n\nAlso imho (and sometimes not so humble) ALL therapists should experience couples counseling. Not only did it change the way I practiced it myself, but it literally changed the way I built future relationships. And yes, this is a glowing endorsement for that part of therapy (that I choose not to practice a lot), if one is ever on the fence about going to couples counseling, know that while it might not save THIS relationship - it will save you in subsequent ones. It will give you the tools to communicate with other partners in the future. Or will give you insight in how you love and relate to others in ways individual counseling sometimes doesn't. \n\nAnyway, I adopted this exercise into my repertoire and am continually amazed at how revealing it is. \n\nBig red flag when we do this:  person J has trouble expressing what they visualized, person K has zero trouble. Then Person J reports they can 100% see what Person K visualized and Person K is very critical of Person J's experience or heavily indulgent. \"Oh yeah I saw it.\" \"What did you think while visualizing it?\" \"I was doing the exercise correctly.\" Symbiotic relationships, codependency, narcissism and abuse are things I immediately screen for if this is the result. \n\nFinally, don't go to couples counseling if your partner is abusive. It doesn't work. It won't work. You will give the other person the tools and language to make you feel even worse and there will be heavy retaliations at home if you reveal the truth. Not worth it. Go by yourself if you know or suspect abusive markers in your relationship.",
            "I don't focus on couples counseling but I do have some couples therapy session from time to time. \n\nIf you are in a relationship, some advice that will help you out. You will typically find yourselves in 3 (metaphorical) positions.\n\n1) face to face: when you are here you are feeding into each other. Building each other up and communicating.\n\n2) side by side: this is when you both are working together on a problem to find a solution. Its not forcing one to do all the work but you both are taking responsibility \n\n3) back to back: this is the position you never want to be in because you take your focus off each other and you go your own directions. You either end up with one person pulling the other or a gap is formed. This position also says \"I don't care about your input.\"\n\nIf I get a couple in position 3 and they refuse to move to position 2 or 1 that is a pretty big indicator the relationship will fail",

It is very possible to decide from a place of compassion, and even love, that you and your partner(s) simply are at seperate places in life, have opposing values, or perhaps are just not compatible. It can be the case that deciding to let go is an act of compassion.

            "Therapist here... In my experience strong healthy relationships are built on two very important qualities: trust and respect. Love is not included in these qualities because love is not a determiner of a strong/healthy relationship.\n\nDysfunctional relationships are still possible among people who love each other. And loving someone isn't the only reason to stay with a person. Many of the clients that I've worked with in the past who are in very dysfunctional relationships have actually stayed solely because of love, but continue to struggle in those relationships because they lack trust and respect. \n\nWithout respect and trust most relationships are doomed  to struggle or fail. For the couples that I've worked with I always assess for whether or not trust and respect is present. And then build treatment goals around seeing if it possible to develope those qualities.

When communication about the communication turns meta the message gets muddled and a power struggle erupts from misunderstandings.\nTone, body language, and the way one responds to the request... All become the focal point. \n\nIf the arguments don't fall into meta arguments, then thats a sign the couple has a strong foundation, and the work is usually about exploring expectations of the relationship or readjusting roles. If they fall into meta arguments, it's a sign the couple needs to build up their foundation which will likely lead to them able to adjust the roles themselves once that happens. \n\nTwo different approaches, same base issue at hand.",
            "Things to be aware of/red flags:\n\n1.\tAny consistent or significant violation of boundaries. Unintentional (and minor) violations can happen while people are still getting to know each other. Any boundary violation should be discussed. Obviously any illegal behavior should be an immediate GTFO, no questions asked. Legal intervention may be beneficial or recommended for your safety. \n2.\tSpeaking of boundaries - sexual boundaries - one litmus test: Does this person ascribe to the following definition of sexual consent? An ongoing, affirmative agreement between two or more people who are sober, cognitively/legally able to provide consent, and under no duress (explicit - do this or I\u2019ll kill you or implicit - if you don\u2019t do what I want, you\u2019ll get a bad grade/job review/kicked out of your residence, etc.). That agreement is specific to that time/place to engage in specific actions. If someone wants to do something different or additional it requires obtaining consent for the change or addition.\n2.\tSubstance abuse that is chronic, severe, or someone who is unwilling to disclose their use habits or someone who consistently uses more than they claim or intend to. Not that anyone with a substance use disorder isn\u2019t a good person, but any of those may signal potential for distress and drama no one wants in their life. \n3.\tIf someone discourages you from spending time with friends, family, or other loved ones OR rewards you for not seeing/talking to loved ones. Isolation is a common tactic of abusive individuals.\n4.\tGenerally speaking, individuals who have experienced complex trauma will have a very difficult time maintaining stable relationships. Complex trauma is the term for when an individual has experienced so much distress/trauma that no specific event can singlehandedly account for their way of thinking or relating to the world. They may not even recognize their upbringing as traumatic. Example - someone who was raised by abusive people or people who ignored abuse, experienced homelessness, poverty, and survived sexual assault all before 18 would be considered a complex trauma case. These individuals can form meaningful and lasting relationships, but it takes a lot of clinical work. \n5.\tAnyone that tries to control where you go, who you see, or what you do. A relationship built on trust and mutual respect won\u2019t include restricting one another. \n6.\tAbusive partners tend to follow a cycle that includes being a wonderful partner (at times), being rude/mean/an asshat, big outbursts, and promises that aren\u2019t kept to behave in a more pro social manner.\n7.\tOther forms of emotional manipulation such as gas lighting, putting someone down, or making the other person feel like they are the only person in the world who can care for you. Mother Gothel from Tangled is a good example.\n\nOkay there\u2019s a lot more, but that\u2019s off the top of my head late at night. Hope this helps!",

That either means that the person isn't thinking about how this is also an important point for the other partner, or even worse doesn't care.

I was incredibly hurt, and unable to understand, why he didn't want to sleep with me. We had sex maybe 3, 4 times a year at the most. Without sounding big-headed, I knew that I was attractive, when I would go out with friends I was always having men flirt with me, even at work I'd sometimes get little messages from male coworkers left on my desk asking me out. I never encouraged this, I was completely and utterly devoted to my partner. \n\nThings got a little better in the months before we married, and I was overjoyed thinking that we had turned a corner and were on our way to being more of what my idea of a happy, loving couple able to physically demonstrate their love would be. Unfortunately, after the wedding things were worse than ever before. I had always taken care of my appearance, but I started wearing sexy underwear, corsets, stockings etc. I begged him to tell me what was wrong, but he wouldn't say anything. This truly hurt as I knew that he would masturbate and watch porn, but wasn't interested in touching me. \n\nA year went by without us being intimate even once, despite my attempts to initiate anything, even a kiss, but he wasn't interested. The only affection we shared was hugs or kisses on the cheek, I felt like I was more of a sister than a wife! Again, I asked him to go to marriage counselling, and again he refused. At this time I got a new job, I was headhunted along with close friends from our previous employer. We were required to attend several social events at the beginning, which generally ended with the younger employees going clubbing afterwards. I'm not proud of this, but I met a guy on one of these nights who was incredibly attractive, and who was obviously very interested in me, and a few weeks later I cheated on my ex with him. I was ashamed and told my ex everything, at which point he then decided we needed to go to therapy! \n\nUnfortunately it didn't go well, my ex would spend each session reading out a pre-written script about how sex isn't important in a relationship, and about how badly I'd treated him. I was NOT allowed to speak, even when the therapist got clearly frustrated and told him I needed to be able to express my thoughts and feelings. Although I'd wanted to try and fix things and was ashamed of what I'd done I wasn't allowed to talk at all, and this just made me very angry. My ex refused to answer any question about why he didn't want to sleep with me, so in the end the therapist just said that there was no way that our differences could be reconciled. 10yrs later I'm still very sad about how things ended, and I'll never stop being ashamed of cheating, but I doubt that we would have been happy even if I hadn't.",

Met with them for the initial session, and wife\u2019s perspective was basically that her husband felt neglected after she had their baby, had a one-time affair, and now she\u2019s forgiven him and wants to make it work.

            "I worked with this one guy who had a lengthy record. He had a system for getting released if he got caught. After committing a crime, if the police were in pursuit and he knew he was about to be cornered, he would act insane. His girl would play along with it telling the police that he was off his medication. The police would arrest him but then send him to a mental ward with papers instructing the ward to release to police once he was cleared. Once he was in the mental ward, he would cause a distraction that would make the person attending the desk with the file cabinet to leave said cabinet. He would then crawl to the file cabinet, look for his \"release to police\" papers, and then would literally eat the papers. When the psych evaluators decided that he was stable enough to be released, there would be no instructions to send him to the police, and he would be released to the general public. He did this about 10 times until police officers noticed him back on the streets. This stunt forced the state to change their procedure for detaining mentally unstable suspects. ",
            "My favorite was the guy who stole a post office mailbox off the street, repainted it, and then put it next to the night deposit box at a bank. And hung an out-of-order sign on the deposit box. All the businesses came along and dropped off their deposits in the mailbox. ",
            "A guy I went to highschool had been stealing from Walmart in a pretty clever way. He would grab video games, mp3 players, beer etc. and throw them away in a trashcan in the garden section. The workers never checked the trash contents and he would just wait, sometimes 5 hours until they emptied the trash in the back dumpster and hop in to get his items. Once he took a cardboard box from a display inside, filled it with video games, a PS3, and extra controllers. He grabbed some tape and pens and drew all over the box and taped it up to make it look used and tossed it. An hour later he had a whole new PS3 and stack of games. ",

            "I heard about one person that pulled a shoplifting scam on a large, popular and well known U.S. retail store. They walked in with some cheap nylon product to get one of those \"I walked in with this\" stickers they used to put on returning merchandise. The sticker easily peeled off the product undamaged. They walked to the electronics department, grabbed an expensive box off the shelf and went to Customer Service. They placed the sticker on the big box and asked if they could return the item without a receipt. \"Unfortunately, no. Not without the original receipt.\" Dang it, and they walk out. Customer service even gave the door man the thumbs up having just interacted with the customer. This took place before widespread inventory controls and cameras absolutely everywhere.",

He took out student loans, registered for a bunch of 300-person freshman survey courses where he would never be missed, then literally never went to class. All he did was go to raves and concerts and keggers and sell party drugs. \n\nAfter the first semester, he was suspended. He wrote the usual \u2018I was young and dumb and in over my head\u2019 sob story, and got put on probation for a semester. So he had a repeat of the fall. At the end of the year, he was kicked out, and didn\u2019t care. \n\nHe made something on the order of $150k, in return for about $8k in student loans to cover a year of housing and tuition. \n\nSo far as I know, he was never caught.

So he found out the flat beside the jewellers was empty and he hid there. For 2 weeks he triggered the alarm on purpose several times a night, massive headache for the police and the business, we turned up to see nothing there, nothing on cameras, thought it was just a fluke so the jewellers turned off the alarm system and said they'd wait until the morning to get a new one installed or that one re-wired because something wasn't right. \nAs soon as he heard that and the police leaving he tore down the wall (hed already been working on this apparently) and robbed the place taking his sweet time. Escaped without anyone noticing anything for hours, until the jewellers came back in the morning. \nThen he tried to re-sell something he stole which had a serial number on it and got caught.

            "One guy would print barcodes, bring them into home depot and stick them on merchandise in the $100 range. When scanned the items came up around the $10 range. Putting random barcodes on things isnt really illegal and super hard to notice. Guy two would come in an hour later and buy the underpriced stuff. Complete plausible deniability. They would then sell the stuff on Ebay. Only reason they got caught is because the guy with the barcode printer/software cut the second guy out of the operation so guy 2 stole a bunch of barcodes, put them on the merchandise and paid for it immediately afterwards. He then proceeded to rat on the first guy and spilled the beans they had been doing this on a weekly basis for over four years.

Alarms didnt go off until he exited out the back door, which the alarm company gets after a minute or two and takes them like 3/4 minutes to call in to us, giving him a good 5 minute head start so he was probably a few miles away before we got dispatched to it. He clearly scoped out the area before doing his deed too. Smart dude.\n\nEdit: So part of the building was built into a hill, so the hole was on the back side of the building along the grade line but when you're inside the building it was about 8 feet up, so it was easier for him to leave out a door.

            "Here's one.  I knew this guy back in the early 80's, let's call him Jim. well he really wanted this high powered superbike but he knew he couldn't ever afford it, so what he did was to take drive to London and scouted about for a few days until he found that particular model parked outside a house.  \nHe goes back that night with a slidehammer, pulls the lock, and steals the bike. He gets it home, puts it in his garage and completely strips it so that the only thing left is the frame and the bottom half of the engine - which he drags into the weeds at the bottom of his garden, then he pours fuel over it and burns it a bit.\nA few weeks pass and weeds have started growing over it. It's at that point he calls the cops and reports that someone had dumped a bike frame in his garden. The cops show up and he explains that he'd just got back from being away and found it.\n\n\nThe cops take the frame and note down hi name and address.  A few days later, the cops call him and say that the bike had been stolen from London a month or so ago, ( from the serial number on the bottom half of the engine and frame) and that the insurance company had classed the bike as a write off, and had told the cops to dispose of it.  \nNOW....\n\n  \nBecause the frame was found in his garden and the insurance company didn't want it, the cops were duty bound to ask him if he wanted to keep it, or if they should throw it.   So he tells them that he'd always wanted to build a bike....  \nHe gets the fame back from them, repaints it, then puts it all back together and re-registers it as a 'q' reg (stolen and recovered).\n \nI forgot to call him Jim didn't I?\n\nEDIT:\n\nTo all the people asking if I'm Jim, no, I'm not. I knew him well though, we went to school together and he lived a few doors down from me.  \n I had my own group of friends and occasionally when out at the pub, we would bump into him and he'd tell us of his exploits without a care in the world.   \nAs far as that bike goes, he proudly told a few people about it, but you know, we don't grass...he crashed the bike a few months later and was injured but I can't remember how. He was pretty much a career criminal the last time I saw him, and ended up in jail for a while.  \nWhile many regard him as scum, I always felt bad for him, both his parents died before he was 12 and he was in and out of care homes for years. Out of his 4 brothers, one was murdered, the other died of an asthma attack, and another commited suicide. He could never hold down a job and also suffered from depression. The bloke had a shit life.  It's been more than 25 years since I saw him last and I often wonder how he's doing.\n\n\n  \nEdit 2:. \nThanks for the gold my man!!",

            "not a copper, but this was pretty smart - \n\nI used to run bars at a number of venues around the north of england - one of which was Chester Racecourse. Usually, we'd just have to keep an eye out for scousers trying to nick drinks or sneak in without paying, and with it being so close to liverpool there was a fair amount of security on site. you could tell them, as they'd be suited, booted, a hi-vis waistcoat on and usually carrying a radio.\n\nnow there were a dozen or so bars dotted around the course, and you can imagine the amount of money that was taken from a hundred thousand or so punters drinking steadily from eleven until eight or nine in the evening. So every hour or so, the security would go round the bars in turn and take all the high-denomination notes from each till and stick them in the safe in the main building. \n\nSo I'm stood there one day, pulling pints doing the barman thing, the security blokes have been round a few times and it's getting steadily busier. Then one bloke shows up on his own, hi-vis on and radio in his hand, does the till, leaving the usual receipt so we can balance up at the end of the meeting. 'Bit early' I think, but hey ho - I've got plenty to do.\nThen ten minutes or so later, two more blokes show up, dressed the same. 'Oh, your mate's just been here', I said. 'No need to touch that just yet.'\n\n'What mate? we're the only two doing this duty today.' cue a rapid fire and increasingly panicked exchange over the radio... matey boy who'd done the till before used to work there apparently, so he knew the drill and he'd been watching the guards and knew just when to time it and what order they were going round the bars in...apparently he got round nine or ten before he decided not to push his luck any further and walked away with about eighty grand we heard later. just took off the hi-vis, dumped that and the radio and he's just one more guy in a suit in a crowd of thousands...\n\nthey were a bit stricter on the procedure after that... :)",

So the homeowner and his family attend the game, but when they return home they find the house has been ransacked and all items of value are gone.\n\nEDIT: Some of you have noted this is an urban legend, which is true.

            "Not a cop: there was an incident in Fargo ND where a guy wanted to steal electronics equipment. The store had plenty of alarms on it and generally cutting an alarm triggers an alarm so instead he cut ALL the alarms. This was before cellphones were really widespread and alarms were usually just connected to the phone line. He found an access point to one of the phone companies big trunk lines (correction: 9 access points). Massive thick copper cables with tens of thousands of lines running through them. He cut through the whole thing with a circular saw, knocked out phone service to most of the town and robbed an audio store during the ensuing chaos.\n\nThere were no leads until a tip came in from another town where he'd pulled something similar. They hadn't been able to pin that to him but had strong suspicions and he'd relocated to Fargo. So the cops pay him a visit. He refused to let them in because they didn't have a warrant so the cops left to get one without leaving anyone to watch him and he split. When they came back they found the saw coated in copper dust and a lot of the stolen stuff. \n\nHe was in the wind for a while but even after he got caught he had another card to play. While being transported between prisons he used a key he'd made to unlock his shackles and climbed out the roof vent of the bus.\n\nEdit: went looking for the news articles but found [the case](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/nd-supreme-court/1266964.html)",

            "Obligatory \"not a cop, but...\"\n\nClose on 20 years ago now a guy on Australia's Gold Coast got away with a bank robbery in broad daylight. \n\nHe cased the bank for a while and discovered a pattern of the bank manager arriving about 30 minutes before anyone else each morning where he would leave the front doors unlocked so staff could help themselves in without a key or needing to wait for the boss to come and let them in. \n\nOne morning the crook dressed himself up for a busy day of office work and waited for the bank manager to arrive. As the manager was unlocking the doors he made his move, entering the building and threatening the manager with a gun. He got all the details he'd need to access the vault and so forth and then tied the manager up and stuffed him in his office. \n\nWhen the staff arrived he told them that the manager had called in sick and that regional office had sent him in to do the open shop thing and no one batted an eyelid. This bank had a small walk in vault that normally only held about 30-50k on any given day but old mate had timed his robbery for the morning after business banking day when all the local small businesses would make their end of week deposits and reportedly got a score of close to 250k. \n\nOnce the vault was open he pulled his gun out and invited all the staff to enter the vault and locked them in. By this stage the bank was due to be open so when he went to leave there were a number of customers waiting to get inside to do their banking. He told them all that there had been an issue with the computers and that the tech team had estimated it would take about 30 minutes before the issue would be resolved and that they couldn't open until then. \n\nThen he got into his car and drove straight to the airport and flew to Hong Kong and then disappeared. \n\nTo my knowledge the cops never caught him and never managed to find the money - they knew he'd have had to leave most of it in Australia somewhere because you can only take 10k aud in cash in any currency out of the country before customs pulls you into their interview rooms so the assumption was that he had to have an accomplice here who would funnel the money to him slowly over time.\n\nEdit: For those wondering, he was identified later after witness statement and CCTV led to his getaway car being discovered at the airport where he boarded a plane destined for Hong Kong which is as far as they could track him.

It cost something like 5 dollars/pounds/euros to park. The old man collecting the fees was a pleasant chap, never missed a day of work in ten years, rain or shine.\n\nOne day the tourist attraction hears there is nobody manning the booth.

            "I remember some thieves would go and trigger the alarm of a vacant Blockbuster after they all started closing down. They did this for two weeks straight, so I guess the cops became convinced that this was a false alarm going off at the exact same time every night so they stopped rushing to investigate. One day we find out that the pharmacy next to the Blockbuster was broken into through the *wall* they shared. Not only that, but there was only one tiny section the wall that wasn\u2019t covered in shelves and panels in the pharmacy, so the thieves had to know exactly which part of the Blockbuster wall to break through.

            "A guy (let's call him Dave) I worked with told this story: He was working at a Mercedes dealership, he was sitting at his desk when this well dressed gentleman comes in and asks if he could test drive a specific car that was parked out front. It was also a busy day. Usually they are allowed to let people test drive by themselves after they have taken some form of a deposit or something (maybe the official Id or something, not really relevant).\n\n\nSo Dave gives out the keys, the guy goes on his test drive and comes back a reasonable amount of time later. He walks in and hands off the key, gets his deposit/whatever back. This was about closing time, even possibly on a Friday. Everything is in order.\n\n\nFast forward to the next business day. Dave's boss walks in and realizes that one of the Mercedes out front is gone. Dave has to explain that the car was returned and that they have the key and everything. Turns out the criminal didn't test drive, he drove somewhere to create a replica of the key and gave that replica back to the desk. He kept the real key. That smart son of a bitch.\n\n\nEdit: Dave is *not* the criminal. He is the employee.

            "I used to work at Chase Bank. At the time, upper management demanded that we Bankers \"work the lobby.\" meaning, we would grab people from the teller line and help them do their transactions. But it was just an excuse to try to get new accounts, credit cards etc. This particular day, it's mid day and it is super busy and one of us the female bankers got up to grab somebody from the line. \n\nShe asks the man if he needs help and he responds in Spanish. He says that he is okay with waiting. But she insists that he comes with her so he follows. He sat down at her desk and handed her his note that said he had a bomb and that he was robbing the place. She looked at him and said \"oh you got to get in line for this.\" The guy did exactly as she told him.\n\nShe went and told the manager on the teller side what was going on. He called the man over and opened up a window specifically for him. She went to the bathroom to go hyperventilate. The manager proceeded to give the bank robber somewhere in the neighborhood of $10,000. The guy left and ran a few blocks down where we assume the getaway car was.\n\nNobody knew what was going on. The phone started ringing and I picked it up.\n\n\"This is Chase corporate security, we just received an alarm from your branch is everything okay?\"\n\n\"Hahaha OK. That's funny. You got me. Who is th... (Just then I look up and start seeing a lot of commotion. A manager is locking doors, people are shuffling around quickly.) You know what, I think something did happen.\" I put them on hold and ask the manager and he confirmed we were robbed. He then took the call.\n\nA week later, a similar situation happened at a bank down the street. This was just as they were opening. They had a different type on entrance. Double doors on the main Street, a foyer and double doors into the branch. The robber goes in the main street entrance, walks through the foyer and realized the doors to enter the branch were locked. He knocks, someone walks over and he slips them the note, again stating he has a bomb. The employee read the note and was able to lock the street entrance from inside, effectively locking this dude in the foyer.\n\nThe employees all hustle out the back, the cops are called and he's arrested without incident. He isn't the same guy who robbed us, but the MO is the same. Spanish speaking with a perfectly crafted note in English. So the cops asked him where he got the note and he said that some guys picked him up at a labor site and told him that he would make thousand dollars just for dropping off this note. Then because he didn't speak English he didn't know what the note said. \n\nI don't know if they ever hit another bank or if they were ever caught, but that has always stuck out to me as one of the smartest crimes. They're picking up somebody who is completely unassuming and who doesn't know them whatsoever. They're giving him vague instructions with a note that he cannot understand. And I'm sure once the transaction is complete, they are dropping him off at the labor site and moving on with their lives.",

            "Having worked as a Disciplinary Officer in corrections, I\u2019ve always been amazed at the ingenuity of inmates. The problem most run into is the follow up of the crime they commit.\nOur department received a call one night that there were three of our inmates walking down a street a short distance away from our jail. The three were caught quickly (they were still wearing their stripes). However, upon doing a roster check it was discovered there was still one missing. He was caught about a month later.\nSo, the ingenuity was more in how they escaped. They were housed in one of our maximum security tiers. After lockdown there is really only one way out of the cell. There is a very narrow window in each cell overlooking the yard (this was never really seen as a viable escape risk as they were so narrow one would have to be really skinny to even attempt to try to squeeze through). Due to lack of staffing, our guard tower stayed unmanned, so they took note of that. They spent a year losing weight, and observing the officers that worked the tier, taking note of which ones were lax in their duties. They loosened one of the windows, and when they finally reached a weight where they could all fit through, they took their opportunity. The officer on duty that night was so lax he didn\u2019t notice that four men entered a two man cell at lockdown. Not just that, he didn\u2019t do a roster check at lockdown. So they got out and used a mattress to climb over the razor wire. \nThe problem is they didn\u2019t have a good strategy for after they escaped. The one that was out the longest was probably the smartest, as he decided to part ways with the three who felt like it was a good idea to walk on a street in their prison stripes. But, he had no real plan either. He spent his time living in people\u2019s fishing camps when they weren\u2019t around. He was caught when one of the campers surprised him, and called the department who was able to locate him shortly thereafter.",
            "Not a cop and this is not as smart as some of the guys on here but it's probably one of the smartest robberies in my small city.\n\nOne of the main streets is cut into a hillside and, as a result, there is a very steep and quite tall concrete-covered bank immediately behind the buildings. Between two buildings there is a gap that was filled at the street-end by an ATM. To access it for filling, the security staff went through the next door building, out a side door and into the gap, which had the ATM at one end and the steep bank at the other. On the Friday before Christmas, when the ATM was to be filled to the brim, one of the robbers abseiled down the bank at night into the gap and waited for the guys to arrive to fill the ATM (they came early in the morning). As they came through the door into the gap, he held them up, took the money, and took off through the building to an accomplice waiting in a van on the main street. Then the van took off on the main road out of the city and vanished.\n\nAfter a big search, the police finally found the burnt-out van. Turned out the gang had driven it up a gorge road and had two other accomplices in cars at the top and bottom of the gorge who simultaneously drove really slowly into the gorge and held up the traffic so that no one was there to see them when they turned off down an access road into some bush.\n\nThey ended up being caught, because one of the gang was a former employee of the security company.\n\n[Newspaper coverage of the crime.](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=1391908) And [the black fire exit between these two buildings is where the ATM was](https://www.google.co.nz/maps/place/Willis+St,+Wellington/@-41.2874883,174.7756528,3a,75y,298.76h,83.39t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sUuwOth3Tl_OGZ0ee8_O26A!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!4m5!3m4!1s0x6d38b0281e885af5:0x9956cbaa9dd9b723!8m2!3d-41.2918218!4d174.7732338).

He took notes of the schedule, diagrammed locations of the bank's cameras, and noted the armored car's blind spots. He also estimated how much money was being transferred to the bank and how much was being removed via ATMs. He decided on using a local creek to escape and created a cable pulley system to quickly pull himself, and large bags of cash, upstream in the creek using a connected canvas-wrapped inner tube.\n\n>Curcio's planning culminated with an advertisement he placed on Craigslist a few days before the robbery. The online ad sought 15 to 20 workers for a fictitious city cleanup project, promising $28.50 an hour. The laborers were told to wear jeans, a blue shirt, work shoes, and a yellow safety vest.

When they counted the money at the end of the night they would pocket the cash from that department code.  Since the department didn't exist, nothing in the books seemed off.  Supposedly got over 100k before being approached.  Quit on the spot and was never charged.  It took years to figure what had happened and the company was never able to prove who did it.  This was early 90s, when computers were still new to businesses and most people didn't know how to use them or what they were capable of.  Security was often very lax.\n\nHad another employee write small recycling slips for small amounts as well.  He would again pocket the money.  He got away with 16k if I remember.  Eventually got greedy and was caught.  Confessed to way more than they had on him.",

            "Not a cop.  Back in the 90's I worked for a BofA branch in a very wealthy community.  It always held at least $250k in the safe, and often upwards of $1m+.  Many citizens with large businesses banked there, and many state agencies also brought in massive cash deposits from state parks and so forth.  This branch was also somewhat isolated from surrounding areas, with only one road into and out of town, which theoretically made a bank robbery difficult because the cops could easily block the exit route.\n\nAnyway, the manager told me of a story of a previous robbery:\n\nApparently some guy had found out the names and home addresses of the branch manager, teller manager, and merchant teller (head teller).  He went to their homes and took photos of the homes.  He also followed other family members to find where they worked and went to school.  Presumably this was over a long course of time.\n\nOne day he showed up at the branch dressed in coveralls and with a large mechanics toolbox on a cart. and went over to the branch manager.  Basically, he looked like he was there to fix something.  He sat down and pulled out a folder with a brief letter on it stating this was a robbery and photos of the homes and family members and their schedule (where they were).  He threatened to have his accomplices injure them if the robber did not call the accomplice every 15 minutes, with an obvious connection to not setting off the alarm.  The manager called over the teller manager and merchant tellers, and explained what was going on.\n\nThey all went into the safe and he loaded his cart with plastic wrapped cash bricks, no marked bills (which were stupidly arranged back then - there was a small bundle of various bills and that was it), and obviously no exploding die packs.  He then wheeled it out, loaded it into a truck, and drove away.  Police found the truck a few days later, and it was stolen but now empty.\n\nTotal haul was $1.2m.  As far as I know he was never caught.",

I really didn't have any issues until about 10:30, back in the thick concrete jungle of Tokyo. I had a few hallucinations, but the worst was where I drove my car into a hole in the middle of the road. I was out for at least a few seconds, probably sleeping. Im fortunate that the roads were next to empty around me, but I could have died that night and everyone around me was in danger. \n\nDo yourself and everyone around you a favor. Don't drive tired.",
            "Visions...people existing where they shouldn't be. Like walking across rafters and ducts high above factory floors.  Memory loss. Irritability like you've never been through before. Pain. You lose time. An hour here. An hour there. Your cognitive abilities decline. I've gone week long stretches where I probably averaged between 10-15 hours sleep over a 7 day period so many times that it became normal. It wasn't that the stretches themselves were long. Maybe 20 hrs at most. But there was no deep sleep in the down time. Without deep sleep you start to go mad. And I've been pretty close to going over the edge.",

            "I once worked a 17 hour shift. I was working an event for a cocktail company. Work started early in the morning, and I drove about 30 minutes to their company premises.\n\nThe event was a private wedding in a field, and we were a pop up cocktail bar. After loading all the fresh fruit onto the van, I was driven about an hour away to the venue, where we unloaded the van. We had to physically set up a metal bar, stock it up, prep ingredients, decorate it and get all the glassware ready. People started ordering drinks at 3pm and it went on late into the night. Although we had breaks, we were on our feet all night.\n\nThe person in charge of our van had forgotten to pack a light, so we loaded the van back up in the dark, almost ran over one of the guests who had passed out in the middle of the field and I cut myself pretty badly.\n\nWe got back to the barn storage at about 4am, and I had to drive home. I was so worn out I was seeing cows everywhere. I kept having to stop for cows in the road, cows in the bushes on the side of the road. But none of it was real.. when I eventually got to lighter roads I stopped seeing shit that wasn\u2019t there and I\u2019ll never put myself through something so dangerous again.",
            "Earlier this year I took my partner to the ER because he was hallucinating. He was exhausted and dehydrated.

            "There were two incidents where I had auditory hallucination. \n\n1) I took a Child Development class my junior year of high school. I had to bring home and take care of the plastic baby. However, it always needed to be cared for at night instead of during the day time, and during the day time, I would need to complete my homework/chores/care for my siblings or grandparents/etc. \n\nI think I got less than two hours of sleep in two or three days, and I always dreamt of the baby going off. When I would wake up, I couldn\u2019t tell if the baby was actually crying or if it was in my dreams/head. It freaked me out so much. My grandmother found me one night, crying and holding the plastic baby in my arms. She asked what was wrong and I responded with that my brother, who was a baby at the time, was crying because I hurt him and didn\u2019t know how to help him. \n\nI hallucinated that the plastic baby was my brother and that he was crying in pain. The plastic baby wasn\u2019t even crying. I told my mom and her husband about this after I returned the baby because I was scared beyond belief. They said it was perfectly normal once you have children, so I guess I\u2019m never having children if it\u2019ll drive me insane. That sucks because I really wanted kids, but I would only end up being a danger to myself and them because they would leave me so sleep deprived. \n\n2) It was during the summer my Sophomore year of high school. I, of course, stayed up extremely late. I didn\u2019t even feel tired, but apparently my brain was because, all of a sudden, I hear heavy breathing outside my bedroom door. \n\nIt then followed with a cry for help, asking for someone to please help them and they were after them. The breathing was heavy and the voice sounded strangled, struggling to breathe. \n\nThat freaked me out too, but it was because I thought it was my grandmother, who slept next to my room. It didn\u2019t sound like her, but I was still worried about her. I woke my grandmother up to see if she was okay and she said everything was fine.",
            "I was going through a lot with an abusive ex, he'd keep me up for ages and when I could finally sleep I would have nightmares. So I started hallucinating spiders in my ceiling and it felt like hands were touching me. It lasted for days since the hallucinations messed up the little sleep I got. I got diagnosed with a beginning psychosis and schitzotypical disorder mostly because I didn't dare tell them about my ex so they couldn't set a ptsd diagnosis for me. They started giving me drugs to help the psychosis, but since it was because of my ex and lack of sleep it didn't really help and I had to deal with just being drugged aswell.",

            "Some are saying to rob banks. Nah, this isn't the good option, it has too much possibility of being caught in a variety of ways.\n\nFirst thing I do, get in my car and drive somewhere ~10 hours away from me. I then start going around to jewelry shops and I start taking the precious metals. Mostly ignore the gemstones, those have lesser value on the resale and also have the possibility of getting tracked (gemstone chemical signatures and such are tracked to some extent for this reason).\n\nI spend the bulk of the next 20 hours or so just loading up on gold/silver/etc before driving back towards my hometown.\n\nSomewhere ~2 hours away from home (probably on the opposite side of where I did my thefts) I go to a spot in the middle of nowhere and I dig a hole in the ground in some very out of the way spot and I bury the metals there. I then head home and at that point I should have a few hours left. More preparation is needed.\n\nThe MOMENT that time resumes, I go to my car and I head out into town to my various usual shops. The Starbucks, the Subway, the grocery store, the hardware store, etc. And I make it a point to chat with the people there, maybe I hit on some of the employees (while dying inside, that's not really something I do) just to make it a little more memorable in their minds. Pay for EVERYTHING using my credit cards. Stop by my bank and do something, like buying more checks or something.\n\nThe whole point of all of this is that if I left any DNA or anything behind, or somehow there was other indication that I was there, I have this alibi. Sure, you might have my DNA at the scene of the crime(s) but how do you explain that I provably was in my hometown 10 hours away from the crimes? I definitely don't have a twin!\n\nEither way, after a year or two (even if there's no sign that they are onto me) I go and pick up the metals. From that point I set up a little home-forge (they are pretty easy to make for <$200 using random materials). From that, I melt all the metals down and I cast them as \"artistic sculptures\". Little things like a pound or so. Then from this over time, I drive around and go to pawn shops wanting to sell \"my art\". Inevitably they won't give a shit about the artistic value of these things but will likely pay for them in terms of \"It's a 1 pound solid gold statue. I'll pay for the 1 pound of gold.\". And slowly but surely I convert all these things into cash. Never visit the same pawn shop twice. As far as the cash is concerned, basically just start paying for everything in cash, though I don't go ONLY with my ill gotten cash. Withdrawn money from my bank account now and then and when I'm paying for things, go 50/50 between the dirty money and the real money. Either way, I hide the sudden existence of the money by spending it slowly over time effectively reducing my expenses. In this way my bank accounts have no real visible difference in behavior other than I appear to be living a bit more frugally. It wouldn't be enough to trigger any audits so I should be good.\n\nIn the end, the reason I end up being able to buy something flashy is because it LOOKS like I saved up money over time, and I did if only because the dirty money helped me reduce my visible expenses.",

Bank vaults will be locked. \n\nFirst things first - get a truck for transportation of goods. Prolly take my neighbors F350 and bring it back before 48 hours are up. \nI think the best place to make money would be going to multiple jewelry stores. After like a dozen jewelry stores being cleaned out, I'd also go shopping for some nice fancy suits and clothing. I'm talking about the stuff that is like $250 per shirt and up. My skin would love it. Get a bunch of fancy shoes too.  I'd rummage the registers in all these stores as well. \n\n\nI'd even get shit for my girlfriend.

In that case, I'd take a wheel barrow, fill it with garbage bags, and walk with it to the closest stores I can find that have valuable stuff. I'd take everything Of value, and move it to an unsuspicious location. Fill the bags and just leave them there while I go to collect more. \n\nOnce time is no longer frozen, I'd be somewhat far from the crime scenes. No one would be able to report me for anything. The loot would be in black garbage bags so no one could see I have all this merchandise. I'd tell my girlfriend to rent a uhaul and get all the loot moved to my home.",

I'd do it in front of cameras, I'd go to the countries leaders house and just take the most obvious object. Once time resumes everyone would be shook at how I committed such acts without ever being caught on video etc. I'd make the world believe that I did in fact stop time, and then here's the fun part:   \n\n\nI'd tell them I can do it again, and so the entire world would see me as an uncertain threat. Tbh this would probably get me killed asap, but if people are scared enough I could get a lot of power.",

I'm not gonna steal from a family of 4 that's struggling to make ends meet, I'm saying that I'm gonna take that ERLBR\u00d6GNI from that guy getting into his Ferrari outside the IKEA, and some bills from his wallet.  \n\n\nAlso about the ball punching, after some research, I believe that the man will indeed completely disappear without even feeling the punch, but for science it shall be verified.",

You've heard \"cleanup on aisle four\", well this will be a \"cleanup on aisle...store\" because I'm going in ready for merry mischief. \n\nEverything I might need/want in the near future...I'm going to ~~st~~...\"creatively borrow\", starting with a pair of gloves to conceal my fingerprints. I'm talking canned goods, electronics, gadgets, condoms, whatever. If I think I'm likely to spend money on it in the next year or two, my inner squirrel gets to hoard. This also includes all the gas cans, which I'd \"creatively borrow\" to fill with similarly \"creatively borrowed\" gasoline/diesel fuel. Also, probably make some inroads into getting set up for solar here, which means oodles of batteries. They're usually dumb expensive but I'd kind of have a coupon for that. I'm also clever enough to know I need to clear everything by the registers on the way out. Ring it all up, then cancel the sale, this then chops a lot of potential headaches with some traceable items. \n\nThen? The fun part. The clothes are coming with me. Doesn't matter if it's not my size, I'll find somebody somewhere to sell or gift them to piece by piece, plus I'll finally get some wardrobe selection for myself (my closet is very sparse. I tend to shop for comfort, affordability, and utility rather than visual appeal). Fill all the blenders with mustard, ditch the lids, turn 'em on the highest setting, plug 'em in. (There's extension cords in the store, so finding a plug won't be a problem.) Alarm clocks set in one minute intervals. Any media device loaded with something loud and obnoxious at volume 10. Flush tennis balls down every toilet, hide globs of mayo in random hard-to-find locations, eggs hidden at random, etc. Creative mayhem. Over in hardware they got probably a thousand gallons of paint, plus hundreds of cans of spray paint...I'll find something fun to do with that. \n\nSecond? Well, fella's gotta have some jingle-jangle. Banks are insured, so I've got a few ideas. Creatively borrow some cash from pretty much all of 'em, clear those out. That gets hoarded back for the future. \n\nFella will wear out his new boots walking, so some transport wouldn't be a bad thing. I know a dealer who screwed over me and I'm thinking he'd love to give a free truck to an acquaintance of mine (whom I cannot stand) whom would then gift it to me. Since neither would be ready to sign, I'll handle that part, and getting it tagged in my name at the county clerk. (I'm not above hopping the counter and being a little DIY, seeing as how pretty much everybody would be too busy to help me. Want somethin' done right, gotta do it yerself.) \n\nThird? Swing by the local home improvement store. I've been meaning to build a better house out here...but I just got a lead on some very affordable building supplies. Also, a shitload of door locks. Of course, it might mean creatively borrowing a bigrig to help get the stuff home in one load, but that'd be more \"joyriding\" because I'd put it back when I was done and if I were lucky nobody might know it was even moved. I'm fairly handy with vehicles and am good pulling trailers, so it'd be fine. \n\nFourth? Well, I've been meaning to scrape up some money to invest in this property as a proper farm, but man, that's expensive...but I do have a good lead on where to source a brand new tractor, all the implements even the ones I'd never use but would like to have for trading purposes. Maybe a couple backhoes because I've always wanted one (and can make money with them), plus all the seed/fertilizer I could ever use, and all of it really cheap, like no cost at all, almost like they gave it to me gratis. That's my favorite French word, by the way.\n\nNow, it's a cold-hearted jerko who'd do solely for himself and nothing for others. It lacks any sort of human charity. So, I'd be charitable. I'd swing back by the store, both to survey my handiwork and on a shopping trip. Back my new truck down the aisle and load up. Perishable foods, canned goods, expensive cuts, etc. Load it up. I know a couple really poor areas around my town, and they're gonna eat better. Basically, robbing them backwards. \n\nBust in as best I can, drilling the locks as I have to (remember, I got plenty of replacements), and each fridge gets filled, each pantry loaded. Replace the locks, leave. Of course, if one place had a janky old TV or a seriously unimpressive desktop or laptop, might see about acquiring something on their behalf to remedy that. Also, I got lousy pockets and some have holes, so if some money fell out while I was in there... \n\nBy the time I've done all that? Probably be short on time and dog tired. I'd go home and get some rest; when the world unpauses, I've got a lot of work to do.",

            "I was not born yet, but my parents rented the observation deck on the Hancock building in Boston for their reception. Tallest building in the city, beautiful view. My dad pored over historic weather charts to figure out what day was statistically most likely to be nice out. Day of the wedding comes and of course, thick fog unlike anything they'd ever seen before. Couldn't see a thing out the windows of the room they had picked specifically for the view.\n\nWorked out well though, they were happily married for nearly 30 years before cancer took my dad's life a few years ago.\n\nThere's one other funny anecdote from that wedding: The wedding was held in Kings Chapel, which is an incredibly historic church here in downtown Boston that's somewhat of a major tourist attraction. To close that on a weekend afternoon for a wedding, it turns out, was not very expensive. The tourists waiting outside to see the church didn't know that, though, and someone started the rumor that my parents were incredibly wealthy, maybe even Kennedys. As a result, there were tons of people taking photos of them when they left the ceremony. Not sure if any of them ever figured out that my parents were most certainly not rich or famous.",
            "When I was 6 or 7 I went to a cousin's wedding. Everything was fabulous for little me, so much sugar everywhere, basically heaven. The reception was in a big community center that was reserved for the occasion. Went to the girls' bathroom, passing by the men's room to see my uncle on the floor. Went back to the main room to tell my dad my uncle was looking weird. Well, uncle had a stroke and had died.\n\n\n\nThe bride spent the rest of the afternoon crying, and everyone except close family left.\n\n\n\nBright side is the mariage is still going strong 20 years later, despite what happened that day.",

It was devastating.",
            "My dad and stepmom's wedding was a shit show. For context, her family was terrible on both sides (abusive father, neglectful alcoholic mother, and step parents who didn't care about her much) and she basically ran to my father to get away from it all when she was 15. Bigger problem was, my dad was 26, also abusive, and just a real fuckin shitshow of a person. On my father's side of things, he hated his mother and blamed everything wrong in his life on her (as he did to most women in his family, later doing it to my stepmom). So the wedding was doomed to be terrible. \n\nIt started when my stepmom was walking down the aisle. She'd reconnected with her father in the last year and had recently been in a fight with her stepfather, so it was just her dad walking Her. There was a branch in the way (outdoor wedding) but he pulled it out if the way for her. As she thanks him, he lets go and flings it back into her face and literally collapses laughing. She awkwardly chuckles, no doubt knowing he is going to get mad at her if she shows she's upset, and the day continues but she's visibly upset. \n\nAfter the toasts, some people didn't drink the champagne that had been set out. The one thing she had asked of her mom was that she not drink -- she was even given sparkling juice rather than champagne. So while stepmom is changing into her reception dress, her mom goes table to table pounding down all of the alcohol she can get her hands on. A cousin of mine who doesn't know what's happening starts chanting \"Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!\" and stepmom walks back to her mom downing the last one and denying everything. Cousin slips out the tent once he realizes what's going on and leaves the two alone to argue. Stepmom comes out crying a few minutes later, goes back to her car, and doesn't come back for a good 20 minutes. \n\nWhile all of that is happening, grandma pulls up and starts cursing out my dad for a ton of shit, including marrying a kid (stepmom was 25 at this point) who she hates, not letting her invite a friend to the wedding, and him owing her a bunch of money. Dad tells her to fuck off and she leaves. \n\nThen my dad got mad at my stepmom for being gone so long, accused her of either \"being a baby\" for crying or of lying and cheating on him. So she sat down on the fringes and tried to not cry and also remain visible to my dad for the next several hours. \n\nThey may have been dating for 10 years, but the marriage only lasted 6 months.",
            "I've catered many weddings, and there have been some memorable ones.. Fights between guests, wedding cakes falling over, red wine spilt on wedding dresses.. The lot.\n\nThe one I'll never forget - an all day do, small ceremony (a few close friends and family) and a big reception filled with a huge buffet, every type of food you could imagine and a free bar. All in the same venue. \n\nThey had booked and paid for 250 evening guests. But 30 guests turned up, at most. My heart broke for this couple. A massive beautiful converted barn, loads of food and drinks, great music - but no guests.\n\nAt about 10pm (the venue was licensed until 11pm) the buffet food had barely been touched (the few who were there ate - but it hardly made a dent as it was planned for soooo many more people), I asked the mother of the bride if she wanted me to cover and refrigerate the untouched food so the new couple could take it home and her response of \"Oh no, there are still alot of people coming\" was the most awkward I've ever felt in my life. \n\nNo more guests showed. \n\nThere was a flash of car headlights in the distance about 10:30pm and the bride BEAMED when she thought it was late comers arriving.\n\nBut no, it was just taxi's arriving to pick up the few who were there.\n\nIt's the only event I have ever done where we didn't have to kick people out of the venue. At 11pm, the place was empty.\n\nIn a nutshell, brides parents paid for the day and the happy couple had zero control over their guest list. Her parents invited all their 'friends' to the evening function but in reality, it was just associates they wanted to flex on - resulting in no one giving a shit about an invite to a wedding where they didn't know the bride or groom. It was basically just a networking event for the brides parents.\n\nEdit, for those asking: I believe the guests did rsvp.. But instead of a handful of guests thinking 'fuck it, we don't know them, they won't notice we're not there' - it was the majority of them",
            "I used to do catering work, and this one time my boss sent me to a remote location in the woods on a beautiful river. I found out while we were loading the truck that the boss wouldn't be going and that I was essentially in charge. My boss promised that everything was taken care of, set up, etc. \n\nSo, you can imagine my surprise when I arrived to this remote location and literally--nothing--was set up. We were only about an hour early so I frantically started trying to get the tent in order, we needed extension cords to run the coffee and tea--there were none. We needed tables to set up the food--there were none. \n\nI somehow whipped up impromptu everything for the missing things, and just as the bride and groom are arriving, we blow the fuse for our only power source and the place is plunged into darkness. We reset the breaker, I move some stuff around. Blow the fuse again.\n\nThis delicate dance went on for the entire evening. Through speeches, first dance, the works.\n\nI think the worst part of the entire experience was when we went to rinse our dishes before boxing them up and found out that when we blew the fuses the water pump for the place stopped working and needed to be primed again. At that point I said--forget about it, we'll take them back dirty and the crew and I spent several more hours after the long ride home doing them. That was the day I worked a 15 hour shift without a break--and still ruined the wedding. \n\nNeedless to say, I quit that job.",
            "I was best man at my sister in laws wedding (stepped in for the brother of the groom, that\u2019s another story entirely). \n\nFor a whole year of planning all the bride (SIL) wanted was a dove release while they said handwritten vows to each other. Very small, non denominational (most of the family are atheist anyway) wedding.\n\nDay arrives (early summer) and something is off with the bird handlers. They show up a bit late and are sourcing help from the wedding party to get everything in line. When the time comes to say their vows I help the handler carry the chest with the doves in it over to what is to be the altar where the bride and groom are standing. \n\nVows are just about wrapping up and the handler gives ME the signal to open the chest. I open it and see 20-30 DEAD DOVES IN THE CRATE!!!! I immediately close it to try and limit who knows what happened. Too late. The look of horror on her face was all that was needed. We spent the next few hours trying to cheer everyone up but by the end of the reception the entire wedding party had organized and filed animal cruelty complaints on the handler.

            "I was studying photography and used to act as an assistant to a well known wedding photographer. Went to a couple's wedding. He shot digital and I shot black and white film. Spent all day with the couple from 9am through till 2am the next morning when we left. I could see how genuinely in love they were. It was only a day but I got to know them quite well and really liked them both. \n\nThe next morning, I get a call from the photographer and his voice was shaky. He explained that the groom had been murdered that night after the reception party. Three guys had broken into their bungalow to steal wedding gifts. The groom got out of bed to stop them and they executed him in front of the bride. I was in shock for about two weeks. This story was in South Africa if that helps explain how or why this happened. The next weekend, the photographer and I went to the bride's house to present her with the photos. We'd worked together to get the job massively accelerated so she had the photos of her husband. We did it at our own expense and didn't charge her a penny for the day or all the prints and album. Sort of the least we could do. Because my photos didn't matter as much, I'd been able to simply capture those natural moments between them, rather than staged wedding photos. So they had the normal album pics but also about 150 snaps of just them being a couple. She was in tears from the moment we arrived till we left a few hours later. \n\nShe was a shadow of the women I'd met only a week earlier. That shit still haunts me.\n\nEdit: I didn't expect this story to get the attention it has. I'm sorry for any upset this has caused anyone reading this but I believe it's an important reality check. I loved south Africa in a lot of ways, but it's a very troubled place with insane murder and rape rates. My story is by no means unique or even particularly shocking by south African standards. I also have worse stories like this from friends and neighbours. I have CPTSD from my time living there and the things I'd endured. I've got friends who were diagnosed with PTSD stemming from their time there too. Also, for anyone wanting to read the news article about this event : https://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/bride-mourns-as-robbers-kill-man-at-resort-351744\n\nI hope this dissuades a few people from visiting South Africa, and in doing so perhaps I save a few lives.",

You could barely move without bumping into someone else and in the heat that was extra miserable.\n\nI guess the air conditioning problem had also affected the refrigeration or something because most of the food was spoiled.

So everyone's outside, no umbrellas, no ezups. \n\nThe next problem, and probably the worst, was the golf cart incident. The bride and groom wanted to \"ride into the sunset\" on one of our golf carts. Drive around a little bit on the golf course. To be fair, it is beautiful on the course during sunset. However the cart had somehow gotten a nail in the tire, tire went flat, battery on the cart went crazy and the cart ended up freaking out. It came to an complete stop from 15mph to zero. The wheels and mechanisms locked up, almost seizing. Both the bride and groom (fairly overweight mind you) both fell out and rolled over a few times. They were totally okay, just a few bruises and perhaps a bruised ego or two. So retrieving that cart was fun. \n\nAnd last but not least, the power inside the clubhouse went out to do the high winds. There was no after party available. Only the cake was cut, hardly any food was given out. Yeah, not a great day to cover for someone on your day off.",
            "This was one I worked at. After the ceremony, right at the start of the reception - photographer was taking \u2018jumping\u2019 photos of the bride and bridesmaids, so they were all jumping in the air while wearing heels. Bride landed and dislocated her knee, then passed out and kept going in and out of consciousness. We called an ambulance who turned up and fixed her knee etc, but she wanted to continue with the wedding. She then had the first course of the meal and threw up down her dress, and had to sit with her mum in another room while everyone else danced etc. Felt so bad for her as she spent the rest of the evening crying.",
            "I went to a wedding where the bride and groom bought the wedding package on Groupon. Which is fine, why spend a fortune for one day? But I guess the venue thought they could cut some corners. So they stuck us in a room that smelled so strongly of cat urine some people immediately left. The only drinks were those from a vending machine. It was next to an airport so every time a plane took off the ceremony had to be paused because you couldn\u2019t hear anything. And the day after the event, every single one of us had food poisoning.\n\nEdit: bonus story because even though it didn\u2019t ruin the wedding for the couple, it ruined it for the bridal party. I was a bridesmaid for my friend. Flew across the world for over 10 hours to be there. Had to do the set up of the venue, assign people to rooms, put signs on doors, finish the seating chart, transport food, redo her bouquet because she didn\u2019t like it... etc. etc. The whole time she\u2019s rude and tells everyone within earshot that \u201cthe bridesmaids aren\u2019t helping.\u201d Her maid of honor was absolutely bending over backwards trying to keep her happy and instead of being grateful she instead told her sister \u201cI should have asked you to be my maid of honor instead.\u201d She was pretty cold to me and kept asking if I\u2019d lost weight. I said yes because I had been ill but didn\u2019t think much of it. At the reception her new husband takes the opportunity to read the speech she clearly wrote for him to say to me \u201cwe are so glad you fit into your dress.\u201d In front of over 100 people. I don\u2019t speak to her anymore and neither does her maid of honor or other bridesmaid.",

They came up to our table and said do you have any friends in (city, we lived an hour away)?  They had all this food for 100 people but only 30 guests.  They were willing to have complete strangers come down just so their money and food wouldnt go to waste.

He held that last note for a good 10 seconds before he finally yelled \u201cMOTHERFUCKERS!!\u201d, threw the mic down and ran to go fight the fireworks guy.

The ceremony was great, the flower girl did her thing, the vows got everyone choked up. Everything seemed to be going well. Not even 15 minutes into the reception the mothers of the bride and groom getting into a full out brawl, hair pulling, red wine being thrown. Their sons jump in to defend their honor, chairs start being throw, tables are flipped, parents are grabbing children and running for their lives. The bride and groom are horrified and leave immediately and head back their honeymoon suite. My fianc\u00e9 and I left after this as well but we herd from some other friends that most people ended up staying and getting wasted at the open bar on the bride and grooms dime. Apparently the fight started because one of the groom\u2019s sister complemented the bride\u2019s grandmother\u2019s dress. The bride\u2019s mom though she was being sarcastic and called her a bitch, then the drama ensued. Mind you they had all been pregaming the wedding pretty hard.",
            "I've been to a few, but this is the most... soap opera-y one.\n\nI did a dessert table for a terrible (not) wedding at my old country club job once. As I'm setting up people start shuffling in (keep in mind, the actual marriage ceremony is supposed to be going on at that moment, so nothing is fully set up.) Couple's nowhere to be found. It felt more like a funeral than anything else, just people talking quietly amongst themselves. I track down the wedding photographer, since I know he'll probably have details, and find him chatting with a bridesmaid. \n\nApparently the couple was super christian/conservative and young (like 19/20.) The groom got sent to a pray away the gay camp as a high schooler after getting caught dating his best friend. There for like a year. he comes back, meets this girl, and they decide to get married. Ran into the guy he got caught with like two months before the wedding, decides he misses their friendship, so they start hanging out again. As the wedding gets closer he realizes 'what the fuck am I doing?' starts freaking out, and the night before the wedding goes to this guys house, realizes he still is gay and wants to be with him. He calls the bride and she refuses to accept that he's not showing. So she goes through the whole mess of getting ready, takes pictures, goes to the venue... and he doesn't show up, like he said he wouldn't. She loses her damn mind on speaker phone with him at the church where everyone can hear, while he's yelling 'I'm gay! I like men! I love him, and my parents can't force me anymore! this isn't about you and you'll thank me in the long run!'",

My same friend who had to avoid the fight had an ex at the wedding who was now dating one of his friends.  She loudly announced that she still loved him.  I mean, it was one thing after another.  I felt so bad for the happy couple.\n\nThe grooms uncle went up to him right before the ceremony and said that he left his car outside with the keys in the ignition, a passport and $2K in the glove box in case he changed his mind.",
            "Not as funny as some of these stories but...Power went out. Vicar started going on about rings and putting Vaseline on them which we all started hysterically laughing about in the church pews, because we are immature children. \n\nOne best man left really early because he hated the new wife, the other one got so drunk that after breaking shit and standing on tables, he got kicked out by the police. (after loudly telling everyone the groom shouldn\u2019t have married her). \n\nIt was an absolute MESS. No one thought they should\u2019ve married. \n\nWe had a fab time. Got annihilated drunk.\n\nThey\u2019re divorced now.",
            "My mother was a church organist, and attended many weddings. \n\nI suppose the story that stands out was of the bride who when asked \"Do you take this man..?\" broke down and said \"No, I can't - I don't love him\" - and ran out of the church.\n\nIt was a smallish town, people found out that she had met somebody new, fallen hopelessly in love with him.",

A LOT happened in the preceding ~ 3 days and their venue canceled about 24 hours prior.\n\nBride was devastated, but the groom and the brother of the bride, along with the bridal party (2 dogs), pulled an all nighter and the ceremony went on in the happy couple's backyard.

            "Big wedding. Around 500 people. All the future wife's doing. She wanted the huge, $70,000 wedding. I was a groomsman. Pre-wedding, he's nervous as hell. All these people, has to be perfect, this is her dream wedding, Yada Yada. So, at some point the whiskey gets pulled out. It went from a calm the nerves few shots, to he's just about finished the bottle. We give him water, get him in the shower, and redressed. It's go time. \n\nMidway through her vows, he pukes all down the front of her dress. \n\n\nIt was horrible, but it was great. They're going on eight years strong.",
            "The mother of the bride passed out on stage while lighting a candle, leading to a fist fight, on stage, at the church. \n\nThe parents of the bride were very against the marriage because the groom was 58 and the bride as his 23 year old employee. He had also been her kung fu instructor when she was a teen and her dad's kung fu instructor. They were disinvited from the wedding the day before, then reinvited the day of, and the mother was part of the ceremonial lighting of candles. She walked up on stage with a face like it was a funeral, and mid-lighting passed out, leading to the groom yelling at her passed out body that she was trying to sabotage the wedding, which led to her husband storming up and punching him and let's just say Luke beat Yoda in this kung fu church stage fight. I was just a date at this wedding, thank goodness.",
            "I play in wedding bands and I kinda have two:\n\n\\-Father of the bride drops dead at the ceremony.

I guess that one's not too bad\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-Father of the bride is doing the dance with the bride, in a very, very seductive and gross way.  Like, WTF gross.

            "Oh boy. A friend of mine went to attend a wedding in Italy. Everyone was flown out for it a few days before, and the plan was to have a sort of joint bachelor/bachelorette party where the groom and bride would split up then reconnect back at the hotel. So the bride goes out to party with her friends, and it comes to about midnight when she returns to the hotel. She heads up to the hotel room she was sharing with her husband-to-be, puts the card in the door, and walks in\u2026 to find her husband sitting on the edge of their bed, suckling on his own mother\u2019s breast. \n\nApparently it was a nervous habit he\u2019s had since he was a child, where he suckles on his mother\u2019s nipple whenever he\u2019s extremely anxious; I imagine from not being properly weaned off breastfeeding. The wife had no idea about this habit, obviously. Apparently he had been very nervous about the wedding, so his mother had decided to \u201ccomfort\u201d him in their room.\n\nThe bride went apeshit. Stormed out the room, screaming and crying, told everyone she came across that the wedding was off and exactly what she\u2019d just seen. By the next morning, the damage was done and the wedding was called off, everyone got flights home. Husband didn\u2019t show his face around anyone for a long time after. \n\nI know this reads like that \u2018bitty\u2019 sketch from Little Britain, but both my friend and his partner confirm it to be absolutely true. Probably the most mental story I ever heard.",

            "I went to a really weird wedding last year. The bridal party had different, fancier meals than the guests and were drinking free champagne, while we had to pay for beer and wine with drink tickets, cash-only, no ATM. There weren\u2019t enough tables to sit at (I guess the goal was to mingle and stand to eat?) and there was definitely not enough food. People were hogging the buffet stations and going back for thirds before some people had eaten at all.\n\nThe bride and groom (friends of my partner\u2019s) were really stand-offish and just took photos with their photographer all night. Then I guess a fight among the two families broke out in the parking lot, the cops were called, we decided to leave, order a pizza and get drunk in a park, and when we went back to our hotel room, someone was passed out in our bed.\n\nAh, New Jersey.\n\nEDIT TO ADD: The passed-out person was my partner's college buddy, whom I didn't know but he did. No one knows how he got in, and the room was locked. Name's Tom. Good dude. Bought us some very nice craft beer and Taylor ham breakfast sandwiches the next day.",
            "I worked at a hotel. Groom and maid of honor get caught fucking on the roof. They leave in the limo that was supposed to be for the bride and groom. \n\nWould-be bride was inconsolable and sat in the lobby in her wedding dress and sobbed. Could not be moved or consoled. She just sat there and cried for hours.\n\n\nEDIT: Since so many people have responded, I'll share a bonus story from a friend of mine who also used to work in hotels. TL;DR - Bride and groom both punch cops and spend their first night of wedded bliss in jail. \n\nBig wedding, open bar with lots of booze, most of the attendees (including the wedding party) are apparently gussied up white trash. Ceremony itself goes off without any issue. Reception become a big beer and booze soaked party. It then starts to run late so the catering manager tells the father of the bride that they've exceeded their time and they need to start shutting down. This leads to an argument involving several members of the wedding party \"Blah blah blah! Do you know how much I paid?! blah blah!\" They eventually comply but it stirs the inner white trash. \n\nThe party then spills out to the hotel bar where people keep drinking. Members of the wedding party are still stewing about the reception getting shut down and tempers are short. Finally something triggers the groom and he takes a swing at someone. He swings back. Groomsmen start swinging. Now it's a full on donnybrook. \n\nHotel staff manages to get them out of the bar and the fight spills out the front entrance of the hotel. Police show up and start trying to break things up. The groom at some point takes a swing at a cop and proceeds to get the shit beat out of him. The bride, who at this point was just standing on the sidelines screaming and talking shit (\"Kick his ass, baby!\") finally decides \"Well, I guess we're doing this.\" and walks up to a female cop and takes a swing at her. She chose the wrong female cop because this woman was apparently way more yoked than she appeared and takes the bride to the ground, brides faces hits a planter on the way down and busts her nose. She's now bleeding all over her wedding dress. \n\nBy this point the police wagon shows up. Several people are handcuffed and loaded up, including the bride and groom. They're all hauled off to jail.",

            "I\u2019ve told this story on here before, but I saw a bride ruin her own wedding. I was an evening guest and a bunch of us turned up expecting the speeches to be over and for the dancing to begin. But something was wrong - nobody had even eaten yet. \n\nIt turned out the venue had brought the wrong meal out, and the bride *insisted* they recook the correct meal from scratch for about *80* people. \n\nAfter much to and fro, they hotel agreed and began to bring meals out as they were ready to speed things along. This meant that by the time we arrived - hours after the main guests had sat down - some people had eaten their meal, some had just been served, and others were *still waiting*. No speeches had been made. \n\nThe evening guests spent the rest of the night in the bar, occasionally poking a head round the door into the banquet hall to see what was happening. There was *just* time to get all the speeches in, plus I think the bride and groom waltz, before everyone packed up and went home. \n\nThat marriage didn\u2019t last.",
            "I was a groomsman at a wedding where the maid of honor was so drunk she kept knocking over a lit candle during the ceremony. While the bride and groom were signing the marriage certificate, she knocked the candle over, setting the brides dress on fire. Luckily it was small and no one was hurt. The bride wanted to keep going with the ceremony but then the maid of honor knocked over a DIFFERENT candle. I walked across the the front of the ceremony and blew out every candle that she could possibly reach and then set the maid of honor on a stool. Start to finish this was about two minutes Some friendships were strengthened that day while others were ruined.",
            "Worked as a wedding videographer, with a partner doing photo. Big family wedding. Seemed like everyone knew each other.\n\nThe day went really well. Brief announcement asking for prayers prior to dinner for granny who wasn\u2019t there because she was in the hospital.\n\nAs dinner wrapped up, the DJ announced in his best DJ voice that the festivities were about to begin. He was amping up the music and being lively. At that time I noticed that the F/MOTB, and a few others were MIA. Then the Bride disappeared. The DJ continued his lively banter.\n\nThen everything just stopped. The Bride reappeared and then the Maid of Honor approached the DJ. He looked excited until his face just fell. He handed the microphone over and then cut the music.\n\nMOH announced that granny had passed during dinner.\n\nThe reception just stopped. The DJ had just the most lost look on his face. Like What the Hell am I supposed to do now?\n\nAfter a brief amount of time, everyone kinda returned to the reception. Bottle of alcohol were procured and everyone did a shot to honor granny. Apparently the lady liked a shot of whiskey occasionally.\n\nThe DJ kinda led the guests through everything. He actually did an amazing job of matching the energy in all the moments and then leading through the usual reception moments and ending with a high energy fun evening.",
            "Super weird and this will probably get lost, but I was working as a bartender at a wedding.  Usual affair, everyone had helped themselves to the complimentary drinks and were working their way through the bar supplies.  \n\nAfter about 3 or 4 hours of fairly mediocre music and atmosphere, the bride, her mother, her sister, and a few kids and started doing a rowing boat dance where they sit on the floor and pretend to row.  Many other people joined in, and they did this for about 30 seconds until the wife's brother, who, unbeknownst to anyone at the time, was on a concoction of drugs, stood up and began to violently kick the people in the rowing train.\n\nNow these weren't little love taps or playful kicks, he was Ronaldo free kicking them in the face, arm, head, anywhere he could find.  He broke his sister's (the bride's) arm, he broke his own mother's jaw, and he gave a kid a concussion.\n\nHe was grabbed by about 4 staff members including myself and about 8 male attendees and roughly escorted off the premises.  He suffered a broken arm and multiple serious bruises as some of the attendees were less than happy.\n\nHe was later arrested and I recently learned he went to prison for 2 years for drug abuse and assault.  Safe to say the wedding finished very quickly afterwards.  Multiple ambulances and police arrived at the hotel and questioned us.  I even had a police officer come to my house to ask me questions the next week.  At least us workers managed to get out before finish.\n\nTL;DR I was working at a wedding, the bride's brother that was off his head on drugs started kicking the shit out of people, including the bride and his own mum, got arrested and ruined probably not only the night, but the whole family dynamic forever.",
            "I went to the wedding of a friend of my girlfriend, we sat waiting for 35 minutes before we was told it was off.  Turned  out the best man and the groom were caught in a rather risky position. Turns out the groom was only getting married to please his Catholic family.  Girlfriend friend was so embarrassed she left the country and we have not heard from her since. The groom and the best man are now married and run a bnb in the Lake District I think.\n\nUpdate - Wow alot of votes on this one, tried to reply to as many as I can. To put people at ease I will see if I can dig around some friends of ours and get an update to see if anyone knows where the bride is these days and post a small update as soon as I hear anything.",
            "The groom got completely drunk at the reception and became obsessed with how the breast of one of the bridesmaids looked in her dress.  She was pregnant at the time and was very, very, very busty. Bigger than anything I'd ever seen outside of porn.  She still looked classy but it was hard to not notice.  I was just a guest and I noticed.  My wife noticed.  \n\nIn his drunken stupor the groom starts making comments about the size of her chest.  It starts out as jokes but he just keeps going.  Pretty soon he's telling everyone that he'd love to suck her tits and he's focusing on how big he thinks her nipples are and how much milk does she make.  Then it got into more and more sexual detail of what he wanted to do with her breast.  He was verbally jerking off.  \n  His brother tried to haul him away to sober him up in a backroom somewhere but he wouldn't listen.  He was absolutely blitzed.  His bride, who was overhearing everything, was crying.  He then decided to try and dance with the bridesmaid. He very publicly asked her to tittyfuck him and let him cum on her breast.  There was a lot of gestures as he mimed what he wanted to do to her.  This was all in front of his inlaws and everyone else within earshot. The bridesmaid handled it very well and immediately left with her date.  The entire reception ended soon after.  I think the stress of the wedding combined with excessive alcohol took the filter off and he was just exposing some sort of fetish he had buried in his mind.  There was a lot about breast feeding talk and sex acts in his drunken rambling.\n\n  They got divorced by the end of the first year.",
            "I used to be a caterer, and worked at least one wedding a week for about a year and a half. That entire time, there was really only one wedding that I had completely screech to a halt. It happened when the bride\u2019s young daughter started choking on a decorative light that she had put in her mouth while chasing around some of the other kids at the wedding. Suddenly everyone was gathered around her, frantically trying to get her to spit up the object. Meanwhile, we were calling 911 and the DJ had disappeared leaving his music playing on full blast. I walked over to try to turn it off so that this poor girl didn\u2019t die with the Cupid Shuffle playing in the background, which seemed to summon him from his hiding place just in time for him to lose his shit because I dared touch his precious equipment. \n\nThankfully the girl spit up the light after one of the guests performed the Heimlich maneuver for what seemed like a very long time, and was okay. Understandably, the bride was extremely upset from the ordeal and decided to end the party. \n\nSide note: brush up on the Heimlich Maneuver if you haven\u2019t thought about it for a while. You never know when you\u2019re going to be in a situation where someone starts choking, especially if you\u2019re around kids often. I have a friend who used it to save his girlfriend\u2019s life during breakfast one morning, so you\u2019ve just got to be ready.",
            "Bride and Groom decided to \"go get a few pictures\" right after the ceremony. They disappeared for about 5 hours. We all waited at the venue. Since no one got any word from them, the buffet wasn't set and the DJ didn't play any music. After 2 hours most guests decided to collect some cash and we talked the manager of the venue to get out the buffet and the DJ to play music. So we basically started the party without the wedding couple. When they finally got back, they were in shock because basically all food was gone, people were drunken and happily dancing and everybode forgot that this was their wedding...\n\nSo the wedding itself wasn't ruined but everythign around it...well...us guests had a great time after all when we took things in our own hands.<  \n\n\nUpdate: since everyone is asking: they actually took pictures during that time. The photographer did his best but tbh: the couple wasn't that good looking but pretty vain and thought the photo guy could simply work some voodoo magic on the spot to make them look good. He was pissed to say the least and actually tried to talk them into going back.",
            "Wedding itself was fine I guess but everyone on the buffet line was very openly taking bets on how soon the bride would start having affairs. I said 6 months and I was four months over. The marriage lasted a year.",
            "The groom was arrested for CSA five minutes before the wedding. The guests were confused because they didn\u2019t know what was going on. The bride decided to have the wedding anyway without him and had a mock wedding with his son (on the groom\u2019s behalf) to symbolically marry the groom anyway. And then everyone danced and had a great time. \n\nI kid you not.",
            "Think I missed the boat here, but I worked at a catering hall after college and a night I call Chaos at the Dais will forever be in my mind.\n\nNight time, wedding, everything is going as planned. \n\nAs Captain, I took my \u201cpost\u201d outside the kitchen doors during best man/maid of honor speeches. Best man comes up and starts giving his speech and begins talking about how the bride really stepped up and changed her ways in order to land the groom. He acknowledged that it took a lot from her to get to where she needed to be. Thought it was weird, but the speech ended, the dancing started, I got back in the kitchen, and we began getting dinner served.\n\nI came out and see a HUGE crowd at the dais. I\u2019m wondering what\u2019s going on when I start to see fists getting thrown, with the best man as the center point. My manager and a few guests picked him up and dragged him out the doors to the lobby while his attackers were pulled back from family members.\n\n15 minutes later, the groom took the mic on the dance floor, holding his wife\u2019s hand, and said that it was inevitable. Apparently the best man wasn\u2019t a fan of the bride because she had a history of sleeping around. The groom had his uncle, a reverend, come up and say a blessing/perform an exorcism (\u201cDEVIL LEAVE THIS WEDDING IN PEACE! I COMMAND YOU, DEVIL!\u201d) which was wild.\n\nThe bride told the maitre\u2019d to serve cake and wrap it up 2 hours early. The staff was pumped to get out so early, but fuck I felt so bad for the bride. That night is ruined, those relationships are ruined, this special moment is forever ruined.\n\nWeeks later, I met a guy from my other job who happens to frequent the restaurant bar attached to the catering hall. He goes, \u201cHey, what happened a few weeks ago? It was like Friday night and I\u2019m pulling in and there were like 5 people in wedding attire in the middle of the road trying to calm some tall guy down.\u201d",
            "I was working on the bar at the venue at the time but there was a wedding on where the bride was a girl I recognised from school. We weren't friends or anything but in the same year and recognised each other. The ceremony was nice enough, the bride looked lovely and the food smelled good. As the day progressed, they had to turn the room where they ate into an evening room, and this is where it went downhill. \n\nThe people were buying the bride a few drinks, as you'd expect, but the bride was knocking them back quickly. Rose wine mainly which isn't too hard, but when you're necking a 175ml glass and people are cheering you on... well, suffice to say, she didn't last much longer. She was paraletic by the time the evening room had been finished. She got so hammered she missed the cake cutting and the first dance. Apparently the brides mum was livid and saying her daughter ruined her own wedding. \n\nFor me, the best part was the day after I told someone about this who followed her on Instagram, and she posted a picture with the caption something like 'best day ever'!! I guess the day was good but she definitely wasn't referring to the night!!!",
            "My friend the groom got married and the service was normal. The reception afterwards was where it all kicked off. \n\nI think he was quite stressed about it all as he had a very over bearing mother who did not approve of his wife. I guess he decided to just get drunk on straight scotch to try and forget the predicament he was in. After the first hour, groom decided it was a great idea to start Greek dancing (Zeibekiko which if you know, is usually towards the end of the night) with a bottle of scotch in his hand while everyone else was eating their starters. Not to be left by himself, his mother got up and danced with him while his wife had her head in her hands. \n\nThe dancing lasted about about 20 minutes until he walked towards the exit, threw up before he made it outside and collapsed. Paramedics arrived and there was a fight between his mother and wife on who should accompany him to the hospital. The wife finally mustered some courage and shouted \"I'm his wife now\" got in the back of the ambulance. The night ended straight after that.",
            "I was in the wedding party and the bride\u2019s family are a little bit country. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that, for the entire weekend they were the most fun. The wedding was outdoors at the groom\u2019s family\u2019s country club. \nThe brother of the bride gave her away. He was plastered before 10am and during the vows he decided he couldn\u2019t wait until the ceremony was over to relieve himself. He thought he was ducking behind the mountain of flowers at the alter, but didn\u2019t go far enough. \n\nMy favorite wedding photo is the bride saying her vows laughing and in the background is her brother\u2019s bare buttcheeks as he\u2019s relieving himself.",
            "I was at a family wedding where my cousin's daughter was subbing in for the bride to trick the groom into pulling off her garter belt with his teeth and other guys volunteered too.

            "Didn't happen to me, but I work in the wedding industry out in New England.

            "A lot of stories involve alcohol.. lol.  I went to a wedding where the maid of honor made it through the wedding but she spent the whole reception passed out on the floor in the bathroom.  At my own big Italian wedding open bar, shots etc. When we received our wedding video  the videographer said he made a separate video for us with all the outtakes... they all involved drunk people and funny stories that were inappropriate for the official video. My college age kids watch it and love it.",
            "The wedding was for my childhood best friend\u2019s parents. They were only getting married because they thought it might \u201csave\u201d the relationship (groom had been cheating on the bride for a good few months before this). So yeah, already not good.\n\n\nThe flowers weren\u2019t ready until half an hour before the wedding was due to start and we managed to get them to the venue with barely five minutes until wedding time. The person who was supposed to be making the cake wasn\u2019t replying to any calls so my mum had to make one the night before. My best friend\u2019s younger sister\u2019s bridesmaid dress ripped and needed sewing the morning of the wedding.\n\n\nThe evening wedding meal was shit and a good handful of the guests got food poisoning. Then one of my best friend\u2019s cousins (he was 14, I was 10) attempted to perv on me and stick his hand up my dress skirt but luckily he got stopped. Then, to top it all off, the relative who agreed to babysit my best friend and her little sister got drunk and left so they ended up having to stay at my house for the night.\n\n\nThey divorced three months later.\n\n\n(ETA: This wedding took place nearly 10 years ago. The childhood best friend and I aren\u2019t friends any more due to various incidents in high school. Friend\u2019s cousin is currently in prison for fraud iirc. Both the bride and groom are remarried to different people-I attended neither wedding, though my mum went to the bride\u2019s 2nd wedding and said it was equally as shit as the first.)",
            "Ok, my time to shine. When I was 8 years-old my father married again, and I was in the wedding. My dad had custody so I was excited I was getting a mom again. I was the ring bearer, and as I walked down the aisle, I had the most intense scowl on my face to keep myself from laughing or crying from the attention. I kept that face for all wedding photos.\n\nTHEN, at the reception, I shit myself with diarrhea in my tuxedo in the middle of the wedding party announcements as my new step mom walked in. It was LOUD and really foul. I then vomited and some of it got on the hem of her dress as we stood in front of all the guests. The best part is it\u2019s on video. \n\nSpeaking of which, the video (and my reputation as the spewing diarrhea kid) has outlasted that marriage.",
            "When I was seventeen my Aunt got married. She had 8 bridesmaids, only 5 made it to the wedding because they came down with severe food poisoning the night before. \n\nSo the wedding itself took place on this rooftop garden but the reception took place in this hotel in The Rocks that should\u2019ve been a 30 minute car ride away but somehow nobody remembered it was the middle of the city on a Saturday so was closer to 50-60 minutes. \n\nSo the reception took place in the ballroom on the 3rd floor & the stairs were actually incredibly steep so you had to be super careful coming up and down them. Most women took the approach of taking off their heels if they had to use the stairs.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that my other Aunt (the bride\u2019s older sister) is a plus-sized women & gets drunk very quickly. Like black out drunk. So the party\u2019s wrapping up around 2am, the happy couple having already left around 11pm. Two of the bridesmaids & the only sober groomsmen decide to help my aunt down the stairs because she\u2019s so drunk she\u2019s barely standing & can\u2019t even keep her eyes open. I didn\u2019t it happen but was later told that about halfway down the first set of stairs my Aunt just passed out. Out like a light. Everyone goes tumbling. The first bridesmaid somehow stays on the landing, unconscious after hitting her head but the other two keep going. The groomsman breaks his wrist somewhere along the way & the second bridesmaid knocks out her front teeth, blood everywhere.\n\nBecause it\u2019s the middle of Sydney at 2am it takes the ambulances 35 minutes to get there through the crowds. Despite the fact that we were all adamant about not contacting the happy couple, someone obviously didn\u2019t see why they shouldn\u2019t call them & they showed up about 10 minutes after the ambulance. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of screaming, mostly from my Aunt, her new husband finding the whole thing hilarious which turns her rage onto him. Then they have to deal with the manager of the hotel. & honestly, I never spoke to him personally but I really hated that guy. All he kept saying was \u201cyou can\u2019t sue. You signed papers.\u201d Apparently the stairs were a safety risk, who know? They weren\u2019t even trying to blame him, my aunt was in full agreement that the whole accident was her sister\u2019s fault but the manager just kept reminding everyone that the hotel was not to blame. I was starting to think maybe it was their fault how much he was going on about it. \n\nThe last of the guests finally left while the sun was rising.

            "Couple of good ones of weddings I\u2019ve been to. Not me, but really livened things up.\n\n\nFirst one. Friends mums wedding. She must have been early 50s. Second marriage. Her previous partner had sadly passed away maybe 10 years before. They had a kid together. Anywho the father of the bride in his speech announced that it was great news that the two family\u2019s were being brought together, \u201chis family name, and the name of the deceased partner\u2019s family\u201d. Super awkward... took me a few seconds to clock what he happened, people were in shock.\n\nSecond one, in a big old echoey British church, the mother of the brides sister (aunt) put an alarm on at the exact point to remind her when the wedding was. Obviously said alarm went off mid wedding, reverberating around the church. The mother of the bride shot her sister daggers. Naturally the aunt had no idea how to turn it off in her panic. So the best man had to pick it up, walk the whole way down this long aisle with this phone ringing away.",
            "A wedding at a family members property.  Ceremony in an open field, reception followed in a very nice barn.  Property owners didn't want smoking in the barn and didn't want cigarette butts scattered all across the property so set up a nice smoking area next to the barn under a big tree.  Tables, chairs, ash trays, lots of shade and a nice breeze through the area.  The brides entire family spent the whole evening in the smoking area chain smoking whining about not being able to smoke in the barn.  When the father daughter dance was announced and the bride was standing in the middle of the dance floor Dad was nowhere to be found.  She ended up having to go out to the smoking area and drag him inside to have the dance.",

            "Im close with this family and it was so tense from the day this woman met her boyfriend/husband.  \n\nBride\u2019s father hated the groom from day one because he was a \u201cthug,\u201d but tolerated him because he didn\u2019t want to lose his daughter. He tried to calmly talk her out of seeing this guy and eventually marrying him, but she was \u201cso in love.\u201d\n\nFather refuses to go to the wedding. She cries and pleads with her father and he reluctantly agrees to go. \n\nBeing more of a traditionalist type of church, the minister still asks if anyone has objections. A moment of silence goes by and the father stands up. I\u2019ll never forget the look of fear on the bride\u2019s face. She was mortified before he even spoke. The groom, who was justifiably a thuggy piece of shit, had daggers in his eyes. \n\nThe bride\u2019s father calmly says, \u201cI\u2019m not stopping the wedding, but the groom is an asshole. Carry on.\u201d  And he sits down. The crowd gasps, the groom\u2019s father starts yelling across the church calling the bride\u2019s father names. The bride\u2019s father sits silently and doesn\u2019t react at all. Well, I was behind him, so if he reacted, I didn\u2019t see it, but it he didn\u2019t say anything. \n\nThe minister finally calmed everything down. The bride was crying. The groom was seething. Everything went forward and at the reception, the bride\u2019s father just stood in the corner drinking screwdrivers all night. Lots of people talked to him and he looked emotionless.  Basically, he showed no emotion, but you could see he was just depressed. \n\nIn the end, after her sweet husband couldn\u2019t hold a job for more than five minutes (he never could) and he got picked up for dealing drugs for the umpteenth time, he went to jail for a long stretch. She divorced him and he threatened to kill her when he got out. He did it on a prison phone, she made a complaint, he got more time.  She met a guy fresh out of the service, he went to college, and eventually became an optometrist. Nice guy. I\u2019m still friends with the family and he\u2019s my optometrist. They\u2019ve got 5 kids and everyone seems super happy, even the bride\u2019s father who doesn\u2019t have to worry about his daughter being married to a drug dealing jailbird anymore. \n\nThis happened about 20 years ago.  According to the department of corrections website, he was released in 2017. I can\u2019t find anything about him. It doesn\u2019t look like he has any kind of internet presence. \n\nAnyway, that was a fun wedding. Could have cut the tension with a knife.\n\nEdit: Typo repair",
            "It didn't ruin the wedding or marriage, but it came close. \n\nAn English guy marrying an Irish girl in Ireland. The wedding guests are comprised mostly of her family, including family from Northern Ireland (the nationalist, republican parts); and his English friends and family.\n\nThe wedding part goes off fine. Very romantic. Nice ceremony. But then at the reception, the time comes for speeches. Specifically the best man speech. The best man is a particularly red-faced, brexit-voting English man. He proceeds to make the most insensitive offensive speech, filled with 'jokes' about recolonizing Ireland one woman at a time; about how the stag party had been a Good Friday, but the hangover was so bad it led to a Bloody Sunday. You get the idea. He winds up the speech by making a comment about how the speeches have gone on so long that it's like the guests are on hunger strike\n\nThroughout all of this, the English groom and his friends and family were laughing. They thought it was funny. Her Irish family were all fuming. I was there as the plus-one of one of the brides cousins. It was aggressively awkward, and a lot of her cousins and uncles just refused to mingle with the grooms family at all.\n\nI'm no longer in touch with the guy who took me, so I don't know how the marriage is going. The bride was very kind, and despite his best man's speech, the groom seemed like a nice enough guy.",

            "Not the most outrageous story in this thread but I went to a wedding once that felt like a three ringed circus. The mother of the groom was wasted and thought everyone was there for her. She \u201cwalked\u201ddown the isle saying hi and waving to everybody. (which at the time was comical but she ultimately passed away from substance abuse so in the big picture it wasn\u2019t really that funny). The flower girl was WAAAYYY too intense and dramatic about her job. She didn\u2019t just drop petals on the ground she tossed them up in the air like she was leading a parade. There were children EVERYWHERE and not one person was controlling them. During the entire ceremony they were running around the auditorium screaming and tackling each other. Also everyone there was talking during the entire thing. It was like the wedding was interrupting a party at a bar. It was the craziest wedding I had ever been to. If I had been the bride I would have locked myself in the bathroom and sobbed until everyone left.\n\nEdit: typo\n\nEdit 2: correction: I had typed \u201cmother of the bride\u201d but it was actually the \u201cmother of the groom\u201d",

I later bonded with a stranger over fear of spiders when some ran across the table (we were packed in tight, couldn\u2019t escape and made a scene).\n\nThe generator broke down after sunset so the lighting cut out and music stopped.

Everything went really good until some time in the evening, other friends (artsy, bohemian ppl) of the bride wanted to release lots of japanese floating lanterns. You know, those paper ones where you put in a tea candle and release them to get carried away by the breeze. It was mid summer, right in the wildfire season. In fact, the glow and smoke from a nearby fire over the next hill were in sight. And the wind was blowing from the sea into the land. \n\nBy that point I probably had some drinks in me and I didn't realize I was ruining the moment until later. I just pointed out that I didn't think it was a good idea to release lots of candles in the air when there were people fighting a raging fire a few kilometers away.\n\n and for a brief moment I felt myself at the center of a group of like 20 people silently staring dead at me, bride and groom included.\n\nThankfully, they had lots of other activities planned and we went on to the next one.\n\nIt's one of those raaaaare situations of life that I feel proud and mortified of at the same time.

My mom was concerned that he would make a fuss but couldn't call him back because everything was silent.

            "I was outside for a smoke at the reception and saw the groom's dad sitting in the back of his SUV drinking Knob Creek from the bottle. I was friends with the groom's family and knew the father well, so I went up and asked him what was going on. We all knew the bride was an entitled, spoiled brat, but she cranked it up to 11 that night. Everything about the reception was wrong. The food, the centerpieces, the decor, the DJ...everything. even though everything was exactly what she wanted. Not surprising, her whole extended family was a bunch of entitled, spoiled brats too, so they all gladly jumped on the bandwagon. The groom's family was slipping out the nearest door while the bride's family was berating every person they made eye contact with. I think the only reason dad was still there was in case his son had an epiphany and ran for it. He was poised to play get away driver. I ended up sitting with dad, smoking cigars and downing bourbon until it was over. No way in hell I was walking back into that shit show. My wife and their daughter were close friends (how we knew the family) and had a front row seat. Daughter was drunk as balls and ready to throw hands. Mom was too. Wife basically became their wrangler, with a couple other level headed females associated with the groom's family, to keep them from kicking the bride's ass. These are all upper middle class folks on both sides BTW. Not some redneck, mossy oak tuxedo affair. Wife was decidedly pissed at me, but after I explained I was keeping dad company and giving him an outlet, she backed off. Definitely one of the more entertaining evenings I've experienced.",

She thinks she's above them and she acts like royalty.\n\nThe wedding was a bit awkward but nothing too bad.\n\nThen finally we got to the part where Ron gave a speech. He rambled on about how great his wife is and thanked her for everything. Then he said he wanted to thank someone else and went on for ages about how this person (using female pronouns) was so great and he owes her so much etc etc and everyone assumed he was talking about his mother. Then he named the matron of honour and ended his speech.

            "A few years back, one of my best friends hated her wedding so much that she ended up divorcing her husband not even two days later, left in the middle of their honeymoon, moved to a new state to start her life over, dropped out of college, and will not talk to any of us anymore. \n\nThis has been difficult for me to process because I really miss her and wanted so badly to understand and everything seemed fine... until the day of the wedding.\n\nIt was the most uncomfortable, unnatural wedding I have ever been to. Nothing inherently \u201cbad\u201d happened at the wedding, but the vibes were WAY off. All the guests from her side were extremely cheerful and excited for her, but her husbands side of the family...creepy. Just creepy. Stone cold expressions. Very unwilling to speak with anyone but their side of the family and disapproving looks towards anyone dancing and having a good time. They just sat there, didn\u2019t drink, and then eventually left the outdoor reception early because they could smell weed in the distance. And of course they made a huge fit over it.\n\nBut...I tried to ignore it. Until my friend (the bride) started giving our other friends and I glances with expressions that clearly were meaning \u201chelp me\u201d and \u201coh god, what am I doing here\u201d - even during the ceremony. I tried multiple times to get her to tell me what was up, but she just kept saying \u201cnothing, I\u2019m just sad\u201d and other excuses along those lines.\n\nAnyway, fast forward to about 1.5 days later and I see that she had taken down her marriage status on social media, removed all pictures with her husband in them, and deleted all pictures from the wedding and posts about getting married. Clearly something was wrong since they should\u2019ve been on their honeymoon, so I called her and she just tells me that she\u2019s divorcing him and starting over. That she hated her wedding and she realized she didn\u2019t love him. Would not give me an explanation. Her husband seemed equally distraught and confused because he was even calling me for answers as to why she was leaving him. \n\nThat day was the last day I had a conversation with her. By the next day, she had announced her plans to start her life over and move to a new state and find new people and a new career. And she did. She never returned our calls again and eventually deleted all of us from social media. I reached out to her mom and her mom says she\u2019s doing great, and I\u2019ve looked her name up from time to time as well. She really did start her life over completely. New friends and all. We\u2019re basically dead to her now. \n\nI don\u2019t know what the hell happened. She had been dating her husband for almost 5 years before they got married and they both were amazing people. I know his family was super religious, but neither of them were, and she frequently hung out with his parents despite their clashing religious beliefs. She had even told me numerous times that it has no effect on their relationship and she loved the family. That wedding was the turning point, and all of us felt the discomfort there, but I will never know what really happened.",

It was grand, and one of the biggest parties, I had waited on so far.  \n\n\nAfter the main course, the Husband stood up, and held a speech. A long one.  \nHe started out reminiscing of when they had met. Their early life together, the hard times they had endured. He then talked at length about how he loved the children, she had birthed him. And told each of them how proud he was of them, their character, and accomplishments.\n\nSo far it was one of the better speeches I had ever heard. It was heartfelt, he had a lot of charisma. He was well spoken, and funny.  \n\n\nBut then he turned to his wife again. He told her that he had hated her for the last 4 years of their life together. That she was a toxic narcissistic cunt, that had made him feel miserable, and almost had driven him to suicide. \n\nHe told her, that he knew she had a lover. Pointed him out in the crowd, next to his wife and children. He had evidence and was suing for divorce, intending to take everything. He gave her the divorce papers right then and there.   \n\n\nThen he announced to everyone, that he had gotten, his own apartment.  That movers had moved all his stuff while they where at the party, and that he would be leaving shortly. but everything was already paid for, so they should stay and enjoy themselves.  \n\n\nIn the stunned silence that ensued, He tipped all staff. dishwashers, bosses, waiters, and busboys 200$ each and left.  \n\n\nneedless to say, all except family had left the party, within the hour.",

My uncle Dave and my cousin can be very flashy and my uncle wanted the best of everything for his little princess as did my cousin. The wongs wanted something  a bit more  simple and rustic and at better value but uncle Dave insisted (so i heard). Everything was as top shelf as it could be, the venue, the meals, the number of guests. I thought it was all a bit much but if uncle Dave is paying for it, I suppose it's okay. Then dave gets up for his father of bride speech and starts thinking it's comedy hour for racist jokes. One after another, it was honestly impressive how many there were, I remember looking over at my auntie (who I am biologically related to) and she had her head buried in her hands. Honestly, I was the same. I don't remember many jokes because i was trying to focus on anything else, pretending to inspect the chandelier, the cornaces, the cieling rose, fucking anything. I just remember at one point Dave saying, \n\n\"and the most important thing to remember in marriage, is 2 wongs dont make a w(h)ite...\"\n\n I looked over at the wong family and they were NOT impressed.\n\nThe room was on edge after that. Quan (the groom) stands up for his speech. And this is something I will never forget. He gets up and says, \n\n\"thank you to dave for the lovely planning of such a beautiful wedding, and more importantly, thank you to my father for paying for it all.\"\n\nYou could hear every one shuffle in their seats and cough in discomfort. Then he says,\n\n\"Thank you to my groomsmen, especailly my best man Michael, who fucked my wife last night...Thank you everyone for coming, but I think this wedding is over. Feel free to enjoy the drinks package and have a great night.\"\n\nI met up with my parents, and we all got out of there as soon as possible, it honestly nearly turned into a war between 2 families.

I have other receptions gone wrong stories but this was the worst wedding disaster I ever saw.",
            "I work at a hotel and came in one night surprised the wedding, which was booked until 1 AM, was over before 10:40, which is when I got there. Yeah... big fight between the bride and groom at the reception and she left with mom and dad. I'm guessing that didn't last.",
            "My eldest kid managed to partially ruin my sisters wedding, for a couple hours at least. They'd set up a bouncy castle at the reception to keep all these kids amused(trust me, there were loads), but hired it off this proper dodgy bloke. Ten minutes later, someone comes up to me \" Kids had an accident\", I'm like, great, he's that age, he's probably got overexcited and had 'that' sort of accident. Step outside to screaming, blood everywhere, looked like someone had been stabbed. Nope. The guy who had set it up had left the pegs exposed, kiddo had slipped off the side of it and smacked his head right on top of one. \n\nCue one very long A&E trip, in the middle of summer. Luckily he'd only cut his eyebrow, didn't need stitches and was perfectly fine once he'd got over the shock. Managed to make it back a couple hour later but the bouncy castle had miraculously vanished. How convenient..",
            "Attended this wedding on an island a year years ago.  Smallish wedding and the island was tiny.  Only one option for lots of vendors, flowers, reception etc.  The day of the wedding the brides family got together at the airBnB they had rented to finish getting ready together at after they had finished hair and makeup at the salon.  The photographer was taking some nice pictures.  The idiot bride decided at that moment to show her niece a bidet, which she has never seen before.  Someone in the family had accidentally left the water on full blast so the bride to be got a bidet blast to the face, soaking her hair and ruining hundreds of dollars of makeup.  \n\nIt was me.  I was the idiot bride.",

            "Bride and groom get shit faced. Get into fight. Crying yelling screaming, running out into the courtyard. Best man goes to check on them. Finds them rolling on the ground, not in a sexy way. Best man throws bride out of the way, slams grooms head into the sidewalk, and pins him down. Bride starts kicking groom in the face. Best man pushes her away while sitting on top of groom. Bride storms off with brides maid. Best man lets groom up who begins kicking and punching trees and breaking the posts off a gazebo saying \"I'm gonna kill myself!\" Best man tells brides maid to go grab the police officer from inside for assistance. Police officer comes out and tries to help get groom to his room (wedding was at a fancy hotel) Groom proceeds to talk shit and be disrespectful with the officer and ends up getting arrested. Father of groom disowns him, yells at bride. Best man and his date end up taking care of bride and grooms child and staying in their honeymoon suite for the night. \n\nSource: I was the best man.\n\nEdit: I'll explain the \"slams head into sidewalk\" part. The groom was on his back on the ground, and the bride was on top of him. He's basically giving her a bear hug, while she's screaming and flailing. So as I come around the corner, all I see is a man holding a screaming woman, rolling around on the ground. I'm completely startled by what I'm seeing. Also, mind you it's dark out there. So when I threw her off of him, I was straddling his chest, and I put my palm on his forehead and pushed it to the sidewalk, maybe 3 inches. Just a quick reset button. I literally immediately said \"I'm sorry I hit you, are you ok man?\" He replied \"It's ok, I'm ok.\" All while still holding him.  Y'all are acting like I picked him up and dumped him straight on his head from 4 ft in the air lol. I was not trying to hurt him, or her for that matter, I was simply trying to end their physical confrontation. Hence why I stayed on top of him, tried to stop the kicks and pushed her away when she came back for more, and told her to leave, which is when we stormed off with the brides maid, that was the deescalation period. I wasn't holding him down so she could kick him. Now take my word for it or not, this guy would never hit her which is why I was so startled in the first place. Come to find out the groom was bear hugging her like that to prevent her from hitting him in the face any more, and they were on the ground because they were both hammered and tripped while she was hitting him. After I let him up he was basically realizing all the crazy bullshit that happened and was completely besides himself hence the punching of trees and the like. I couldn't control him any more which is why I asked for the officer, who was trying to help me get him into the hotel room up until the groom started yelling \"take me to jail! Take me to jail!\" In the middle of the lobby. You just can't reason with drunk people once they get going  So yes the story says \"slammed\" head into sidewalk which is true, but y'all's imaginations are going wild."

            "My parents' horse got loose, and somebody hit and killed it.  \n  \nThe horse disposal people wanted some relatively reasonable amount of money to come pick up the carcass, but my parents were like \"fuck that.  Hey, /u/hendergle - load that shit up on the flatbed and find somewhere to dump it.\"  \n  \nMe: \"OK.  Sure, pops.\"  \n  \n[calls stoner friend] \n\nMe: \"Hey, want to go dump a horse somewhere?\"  \n  \nStoner Friend: \"Sure.  I have nachos.\"  \n  \nMe: \"Cool\"  \n  \nStoner Friend:  \"Cool\"  \n  \nSo Stoner Friend and I got even more stoned than usual and took my parents' flatbed truck out and tried to winch the horse up onto it.  Turns out you really can't winch a dead horse onto a flatbed.  It's not the winching that's the problem so much as the 5ft lift up to the edge.  We fucked up a lot of that horse trying, though.  \n  \nAttempt #2:  We went home and built a big-ass ramp out of plywood and 4x4s.  It took most of a day and half a dime bag of weed.  We argued a lot about whether or not we should bevel the part of the 4x4s that touched the ground.  Final decision: neither of us knew how to do that, so we opted for no bevel.  \n  \nBack at the horse, we wrapped the winch line around the head this time.  Fun fact: Steel cable looped around a horse head in a slipknot arrangement is a good way to re-enact a famous scene from The Godfather.  We didn't quite decapitate Mr. Gooseberry (long may he gallop in the heavenly fields).  But it wasn't pretty.  Nothing about a dead horse is pretty, but that bit in particular was remarkably not pretty.  \n  \nWe decided to go with our original idea: lash the front hooves together with rope.  Small problem:  We'd cut the rope at some point.  Neither of us could remember why, or who did it.  But nothing for it- we had to go home.  Finding more rope required smoking half a joint, which I think is quite reasonable given the task we were set to.  \n  \nBack at the horse again.  Our engineering marvel worked.  We had some initial worry that we would pull one or both of the horse's forelegs out of its socket, but apparently dead horse sinew has quite a bit of tensile strength.  \n  \nWe used tiedown straps to lash the horse and ramp to the flatbed, initiating a discussion about why we hadn't used those in place of rope, leading to an argument over whether or not that would have worked, leading to an awkward hostile silence as we drove around the ass end of South Dakota looking for a place where we could dump a dead horse.  \n  \nI'm sure there were many places one could dump a dead horse in the middle of rural South Dakota.  Strangely enough, though, we were both feeling a little paranoid.  Every car that passed us was a plainclothes cop car.  Every person standing out in their field was heading straight to their house to report us as soon as we went around the bend.  \n  \nFinally, we found a field in the Black Hills National Forest that looked like a good spot.  It had trees, which we thought the horse would like, and there was a nice parking area next to a snowmobile trailhead.  Goose had never liked snowmobiles, so the idea of his skeletal carcass scaring the shit out of some Ski-dooer coming off the trail seemed like something that would have appealed to the old fella.  \n  \nWe backed the truck a little ways into the ferns next to the trail.  Then we used a come-along to pull the dead horse off the flatbed.  \n  \nAbout a mile into the way home, Stoner Friend said \"Does your horse have tattoos?\"  \n  \nI was like \"it's a horse, not a fucking chief petty officer in the merchant marine.  Why would it have fucking tattoos?\"  \n  \nWell apparently some horses have tattoos, according to Stoner Friend.  It's how they identify them if they're stolen.  (Note: Subsequent research revealed that this was usually only something done with thoroughbreds, which our horse was definitely not.)  \n  \nBack at the horse again.  \"I think they put them on the lip, inside,\" says Stoner Friend.  Have you ever pulled back the lip of a dead horse to look for tattoos?  Worst never-have-I-ever ever.  There were no tattoos.

            "When I was a young teen, the boys from the neighborhood and I loved playing pinball and video games at our local bowling alley. Problem was we didn't have enough money to enjoy our new addiction. We decided to do something about that little problem. \n\nWe started with a very rudimentary system. We actually scotch taped a piece of thread to a quarter and were able to fish it up and down a couple times before the string would break, or the tape would give out. This worked fairly well, but we wanted and needed more. \n\nOur next plan was a little more professional. We somehow concocted a scheme to \"make\" quarters. A few lessons in science class had actually stuck, and we realized that we needed something to fool the coin mechanism in the pinball machine into thinking that whatever it was we made our quarters with was an actual quarter. We ended up deciding that lead would be our material of choice. We used lead for a couple of reasons. A couple of the guy's father was an avid hunter. He even reloaded his own shotgun shells. Because of this he had a burner setup in his shop to melt down lead. Another reason is that lead is not magnetic (science!). We made a mold out of plaster and used the burner to melt lead to make our quarters. But where to get more lead??\n\nOne of us came up with the brilliant thought that tire weights were made of lead! Carrying screwdrivers and pliers we scoured the parking lots of shopping centers. We would wander through and drop down out of sight between cars. Using the tools we had brought we would manage to get the tire weights off with little trouble. We were in business! \n\nOur production line was soon up and running. We would melt lead, pour it into our mold, cool it and then move on to finishing our new \"quarter\". The finishing process was crude, but effective. We would snip off the burr where the lead was poured. We would then file down the edge, making sure it stayed mostly round. Using steel wool and a polishing cloth we would then shine the quarters. Now came the trial run. \n\nWe went to the bowling alley with a few quarters to see if our harebrained scheme would actually work. In they went, and the pinball machine lit up and was ready to be played. Success! We intensified our production and soon we had bunches of quarters. We were thrilled! We could play video games any time we wanted! Every day after school you'd find us at the bowling alley, happily playing our games. But our downfall was soon to come. \n\nWe never thought of the fact that someone might notice a bunch of fake quarters being used in their video games and pinball machines. It literally never crossed our early teenaged minds. We just knew we were having a blast. One fateful day we went to the bowling alley as usual. We started playing games and soon some men approached us. They started questioning us and accusing us. We were scared to death! One of the guys yelled \"Run!\" and we took off as fast as we could. We made it to the doors and down the steps we went. We all lived on the same cul-de-sac and that's the direction we headed. Running as fast as we could, we briefly split up. The men that were chasing us only followed one of us kids. He made the colossal mistake of running straight to his house and through the front door. From there our crime spree ended. \n\nA few days later I was in class when I was called to the office. When I got there my father was sitting with a man I'd never seen before. He was wearing a black suit with a black tie. I had to go before the principal, my father and a member of the United States Secret Service! Although they take the counterfeiting of US currency very seriously, they understood that it was just a bunch of knucklehead kids making quarters to play video games. He actually told me that he was impressed with the quality of the quarters. He also said that they had recovered over $75 in fake quarters! We had made, and used, over 300 quarters! We had to make restitution for the money and the charge was placed on our juvenile records. It was explained to us that if we kept our noses clean the charge would be expunged. Luckily for me I learned my lesson and stayed on the straight and narrow for the rest of my young adult life. \n\nAnd that, fellow redditors is how I was charged with counterfeiting US currency. If that doesn't define the meaning of a crazy crime, I don't know what would.",

            "Back in the mid 90s, I lived in a shared rented house in the north of England with 4 ex schoolmates. It was a bit of a drugs den, right next to the bus station so everyone called in on their way into town for a cup of tea and a spliff, and same again on the way out. So it was always rammed, lots of acid and mushrooms on weekends, people crashing everywhere.\n\nOne morning, me and my girlfriend were woken up by the police coming into my bedroom room (illegally - they claimed to have pushed the door and it swung open) and telling us all to gather in the front room. I had my skinning up box next to the bed - I assumed the police were there for drugs or course, so I hid my stash before I came down.\n\nSo we're all sat in the lounge hungover and that, and the policeman says 'So, who knows about the credit card?' We all just went 'wha?' because it wasn't what we were expecting, except one of my housemates stands up and says 'no one else knows anything, it's me' and goes off with the police.\n\nTurns out, a bank card had been delivered for a previous tenant, and then shortly after a new pin. My housemate had taken it, and emptied the account of a load of cash. \n\nAnd what had he bought with his stolen cash? A gecko, in a big fancy glass cabinet. He was struggling to pay his rent - we all were - but here was this massive green mother sat sunning itself in our front room. All 6 or so of us just sat and looked at it as he was taken away.",
            "Mine is incredibly stupid but looking back reminds me of how actually crazy the whole situation was. When I was in the 6th grade my parents (Mom + Stepdad) got married and moved me to this very small, very religious, very tight-knit community. My life changed immeasurably that year and I absolutely hated my new school & all the people in it... So our morning routine was parents get up at 6, wake me at 6:30, both parents are out the door by 6:45 and I have to catch my bus at 7:15. Well 11 year old me figured out that I could just *not* catch my bus and my parents both working demanding jobs would not be home until 3 hours after I usually got home so they'd never know.\n\nThe first day I skipped school was easy. By week two I realized I'd have to go back for exams, especially the state exam which determined if you got to move to the next grade & obviously the school would want to know why I was absent. So I divised a plan, wherein I called the school pretending to be my mother and told them my poor daughter had Mono and would be in and out as she felt better and I asked them to please change my contact number to my home phone, that way I could intercept any phone calls. And thus began the 6 weeks where I went to school only ever on days that I had exams. Unbeknownst to me one of my teachers wrote a note with my report card (that were mailed to our house) that said she was so proud of me for keeping up with my school work despite being sick and out of class so often. \n\nI was in 3rd period when I got called to the office to find my vice principal, principal, 2 very very angry parents, and a Truancy Officer waiting for me. I had to go to court because I had missed so many days and was given Community service as punishment. I was also sent to in-school suspension (ISS) for the remainder of the year. It's still on my \"criminal record\" although since I was underage when it occured the details are sealed but I was 100% convicted of Truancy.",

She had seen them blow them up and deflate them for days, so she knew what the deflated ones looked like. One day she was leaving work and one of these deflated mascot thingies was right behind her car.  My sister-in-law has never stolen anything in her entire life, but at that moment she decided out of the blue that she wanted that blow-up. She plopped it in the back and drove home.

            "I'm late to this party, but I have a fun one. \n\nIn the later half of the 18th Century, the French and British used Native Americans to supplement their own forces in the struggle for North America. I have ancestors who had a farm in upstate New York when that was the frontier. The parents were killed by a Huron war party, and their son \u2014who was just a child at the time\u2014 was taken by the Hurons and raised as one of their own.\n\nYears passed, and a time of relative peace settled between the French-backed Hurons and the British. Word trickled down to York (now Toronto) that there was a young white man running around the woods with Indians to the north. The British garrison at Fort York sent an officer and a trooper on an embassy through Huron Country, going from village to village to investigate. They found the young man (my many times great-grandfather) and persuaded him to come with them back to British territory. He didn't remember his name, so they gave him the first name of the officer and the last name of the trooper for the sake of giving him some identity as an Englishman.\n\nThen the American Revolution broke out. The young man joined one of the ranger units the British Army fielded, because he knew how to fight in forests and live off the land. Obviously the British lost the war, but anyone who fought for them was given land in Canada at the end of hostilities. He was granted land on the north shore of Lake Ontario. One of the conditions of getting the free land was you had to clear a certain portion of it and make a certain amount of communal road along one edge of your property in a given amount of time. All the new settlers in the area worked together to get this done, and one older neighbour recognized my many times great-grandfather from when he was a boy. \"Your name's not so-and-so. It's such-and-such! You're the spitting image of your father!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Says my many times great-grandfather. He then wrote to the British authorities, \"To whom it may concern: I fought in the most recent war against the Americans. My name is such-and-such. Here is my former commander's name and address. He will vouch for me. I believe I am entitled to free land? As luck would have it, I own a farm, and the lot behind me is unclaimed. Could I have that one?\"\n\nAnd they gave it to him. Two hundred and some odd years later, the records of that petition and land grant still exist. He used his real name to defraud the British Government out of a second land grant for the same military service.\n\nI've always thought that was a cool story.\n\nAddendum: I don't think /r/AskReddit has a problem with identifying by name someone who has been dead for the better part of two centuries? [I went Googling my ancestor and came across this document](http://www.uelac.org/Loyalist-Info/extras/Gaffield-Nathaniel/Nathaniel-A-Gaffield-by-Roger-Reid.pdf) about him. Some of the details are not quite as I remember them, but the gist of it is correct. Anyone interested in reading more, enjoy!",

            "So before I was born my parents were apparently going through some tough financial issues and were facing eviction if they couldn\u2019t come up with a certain amount of money by a certain date.\n\nMy father decided the best way to handle this situation would be to rob a bank.\n\nSo the story as I was told it goes like this... my father walked into a small bank with a ski mask on and his hand in his pocket. He went up to a teller and handed her a bag, telling her he was robbing the place, he had a gun and exactly how much money he wanted, which turned out to be exactly the amount he needed to avoid eviction.\n\nHe got the money, apologized to the teller and then left. He was never caught.\n\nThe next part of the story is a little weird and even I have a hard time believing it but I know my dad, he is no liar. Apparently a year or two later my dad went back to the same bank he robbed every day until he found the teller he robbed previously. He walked up without a mask and handed her an envelope and immediately left the area. In the envelope was the exact amount of money he stole and a note saying that the money was for the teller, a gift and how incredibly sorry he was for scaring her when he robbed the place. Again, he was never caught.\n\nMy father is a very honourable man who was raised in poverty on a Indian reservation. Because of the abuse he went through, both at home and at school (Residential schools have a bit of a history to them) he vowed that his kids would never have to go through what he did. I truly believe that robbing that bank was a result of that vow but emotionally hurting that woman at the bank really ate away at him so he risked getting arrested to try and make it right.\n\nEdit: Guess I should have said this but he didn\u2019t actually have a gun, he just told the teller he did. In reality his pocket was empty.",

The cops got out and started waving guns around, but me and the other kids decided it was better to book it into the woods on our bikes than get taken home in a cop car.  \n  \nWe knew those woods like the backs of our hands, and the cops were on foot.  So we all got away scot free.  The next day, the story was in the newspaper, and my dad spent fifteen minutes railing on about how parents didn't bring their kids up right these days and if it was MY kid, I'd beat his ass until it shined like a new penny.  \n  \nI listened attentively and agreed with assessment of the day's youth.",
            "My dad, mom, and I test drove a Nissan when I was a kid (around 6 years old.) Back then, you didn't have to have someone accompany you in the test drives and from what my dad said they didn't even make a copy of your driver's license. Well, we lived in Ohio at the time and there was a lot of snow on the ground since it was winter. The Nissan they test drove was a two-seater. My dad was driving, and I was in my moms lap. My dad wanted to \"play around,\" and he did donuts in the snow like normal him. Well this time, this little Nissan was too fast for him to control in the snow. So when he did that, he lost control and hit a light pole. My parents and I got out of the car and walked back to the dealership. My mom and I waited a little bit further down the road. My dad got our family car and picked us up. A lot of years went by and I asked my parents did they ever pay for that and/or had to deal with a lawsuit. My dad told me \"No, I didn't even go inside the dealership. We just never went back to them again.\" So I guess I'm sorta an accomplice to stealing a car and wrecking it...",

            "Was going to say my family's pretty straight, but I just thought of one - my great-grandmother smuggled cameras out of Nazi Germany. This was when Jews could still leave if they got a visa, and she managed to get one to the US. But they were only allowed to take a very strict list of personal possessions, and they had to pack in front of the police and then have the suitcases sealed as approved. She decided to smuggle some cameras out to sell and have some money to live on. So she got the officers drunk and bribed them. All good, she gets on the train with her approved suitcase, but then the country she had to travel through to get to her ship wouldn't let the train through! It was just like when those Syrian refugees got stuck on the way to Germany. There was a whole crisis and eventually all the refugees got sent back to Germany. She had given away all her worldly possessions and moved out of her house and had nothing to go back to, but worst of all her sealed suitcase would be reopened. So instead she located a distant cousin in the neighboring country and left the suitcase with him. When she eventually successfully managed to get to the US, he shipped the suitcase to her, and the cameras were gone - some customs agent had stolen them along the way. \n\nBefore getting her real visa, she also begged and bribed someone at the embassy to get a fake visa to get her husband released from a camp (early on when that still worked)."

It was simple lardons (a fattier version of bacon, cut in small strips), fried in a pan, with a few sunny-side up eggs cracked on top, so that the fat and the crisp of the pork would embed in the eggs; a bit of salt, a generous crack of pepper and a good grating of nutmeg. In another pan, she's fry potatoes cut in tiny cubes with some rosemary, all of which was picked from the garden the morning of by my grandpa. And finally, a hefty serving of spinach from the same garden, cooked at low heat with a good spoonful of cream, shallot and garlic. It was perfect: just decadent enough to enjoy the guilt, but enough spinach to ward off early onset diabetes. She'd usually cook it on a Wednesday, when we didn't have school in the afternoon and so, after lunch we would loiter around the dining table, playing robbers' rummy with her, or we'd go to the living room and help her untangle her skeins of wool, with some low-budget detective show on the television in the background - usually Inspector Derrick, a German show with such a slow pace it would make the afternoon stretch out for days, so that we'd always have time for one more card game.",

Mom's is just potato, mayo, salt, pepper, probably garlic powder, and if I'm lucky hard boiled egg slices and celery. It's just simple and straightforward.\n\nI mean to be fair, most of what my mom cooks is overly simple and straightforward. That's probably her biggest issue as a cook.

We get to a restaurant and he asks in English how much it would cost for all you can eat tacos. The guy at the door said it\u2019s $15. His friend next to him said to the guy in Spanish, \u201cI thought it\u2019s $12?\u201d And the first guy responded, \u201cYeah, but they don\u2019t know that.\u201d My husband of course understood everything.

My buddy was in a different section of the store and found something he liked. He asked the shop keep how much it was, the shop keep said, in Korean \"well, you're an American, so $65\" (translation and currency exchange provided for ease of reference). I looked over, and saw a sign on the wall that said the exact item he wanted was $40.  I approached the shop keep and asked him, in Korean, how much it cost, to which he replied $40. So I responded, in Korean, \"Why are you charging him $65?\". He got rather embarrassed and apologetic, offered to sell the item for $35, and gave us each a soft drink for free.",

She invited me for a beer with her and her friend.

It was a lot of fun for a while, I'll give them that.

No problem. I'd go and let other high schoolers practice their English with me and do carnival games and stuff.\n\nHowever, the guy apparently did not get the message that I spoke Japanese and proceeded to introduce me to all his friends as his girlfriend. I let him have his moment for the night (without leading him on), but on the train ride back to his home, he was talking to his friend in Japanese and I joined in on the conversation.

While loading the machine a school down the street must have just let out and a whole group of teenagers came in, all speaking Spanish talking about teenager things. Well a few of them noticed the $5k in fives I had in my hand and started loudly talking to his friend how that was the most money he\u2019s every seen. Now I get this reaction a lot so I was going to ignore the kid but right after that his friend started talking about going home to get his Dad\u2019s pistol to put 2 in the back of my head, steal the money, then use it to buy a bunch of weed and video games. \n\nOf course these kids don\u2019t think I understand them at all (white guy in a Hispanic neighborhood, most don\u2019t think I understand their language in my experience).  So I calmly lock everything up while they continue making plans to kill me and rob me, finish with the machine, then turn to them with my hand resting on my gun and tell them in Spanish to go home and don\u2019t talk about murdering and robbing a person right in front of said person. It\u2019s quiet rude and could possibly get them killed in the process. They nearly shit themselves and I walked out of the store laughing about it. ",

That is what she used, and in a very mocking tone as well). So I very calmly validated my ticket, and as I was walking away I reply, also in greek. \"It's a girl. And it speaks greek as well.\"\n\nHer face was hilarious. She just made a mortified \"Ah\" sound and didn't utter another word until she got off a few stops later. I love this story, but it kind of terrifies me as well. I avoid talking about other people, but I do tend to have very personal conversations with my greek friends in public places, confident that nobody understands, even after being myself proof that it's not very safe.\n\n\n\nEDIT: thanks for the silver guys!!!!",

However the first train that arrived at the station and that was going to the airport was a UL (Upplands Lokaltrafik, different company) train which I did not buy a ticket for.

The controller asks me in Swedish the see the ticket. So I hand it to him and he looks at me and says in Swedish:''Wrong ticket''. So I decide to do the dumb tourist and I pointed to my passport and said in bad French accent: ''Sorry, I don't speak Swedish'' and I explained that I thought this ticket was the right one to go to the airport.\n\nHe immediately gave me my ticket back and said that it was ok, but to check next time to buy the right ticket with the right company (In English).

So I thought; English people. Off we went!\n\n10 minutes into the game drive I hear them speak in Flemish, and not only that, IN MY OWN DIALECT. Side note; every Flemish town has a dialect, we can hear what region/province other Flemish people are from, and if from the same region, we can often even pinpoint the exact little town or community they are from.\n\nOooh I was going to have fun with these folks! Found a few nice animal sightings, spoke English all the time, but then one sentence to the next, switched to their exact dialect. I thought; now they're going to be surprised! But nope... we all kept chatting in Flemish now. Only 20 minutes later, the daughter, maybe 10 years old, goes \"wait a minute; he speaks Flemish!\"\n\nAfter all had a good laugh, I asked them where they were from.

And I haven't had a negative experience in maybe five years or so, and work at an office where I only use English (international clients), so it's not all bad. *But* I am moving out of the country soon.",

I looked like a pretty typical tourist, shades and a bunch of touristy stuff like a hat with a cross between the Spanish and the Kenyan flag on it and these tacky huge sunglasses. I basically screamed that I was a tourist.\n\nAs I was standing in line, a couple of Spanish guys came in, maybe in their 30s, and gave me a warm smile before queuing behind me.

Why the hell are they in our country, bloody animals\"\n\nThis went on for a few minutes until I ended up managing to order my food. What they didn't know though was that I had mandatory Spanish classes as a kid (had to choose between French, Mandarin and Spanish and I chose Spanish) and loved the language and ended up studying it all through high school and plan to continue in college. I'm almost entirely fluent in the language.\n\nRather than confronting them, upon getting my food, I simply said, in perfect Spanish, \"Come on now, we're not all bad, you know.\" I smiled and walked off.\n\nThey were mortified, the looks on their faces were absolutely priceless.

In a small village with no English speakers, you learn quickly. \nI went on vacation to a small beach town, not a tourist trap, and had lunch in a tiny beach restaurant, only 4 tables. A group of elderly men came in and sat at the next table. Immediately, they started gossiping about me in rather loud voices, commenting about how I was a foreigner and could eat sashimi.

This is important to note because I had to wear skimpy booth babe uniforms to work each day.\n\nThe maids came in one morning as I was finishing up getting ready and I told them to come in and do their thing, I was just about to leave. Two women came in and started wiping down surfaces as I was lacing up my heels to go out the door. I guess one woman noticed my ring tattoo and said in Spanish that she couldn\u2019t believe my husband let me go out looking like this. She had no clue how any self respecting wife would be in a place like this and how my husband must be so ashamed of me, that she\u2019d kill her husband if she found videos of someone like me on his computer.

I don't particularly look Mexican or at least I look too \"white-washed\" to know Spanish, though it's my first language and my first name should be a clue.  But it's always interesting to hear what people say when they don't think you understand. \n\nI was selling some rims and tires, OEM take-offs from my truck, and the guy came with his entire family (wife, kid, and grandma). He initially approached speaking English, so I reciprocated in English. The asking price was more than reasonable, I just wanted them out of my garage and not necessarily trying to make a profit. They discuss amongst themselves in Spanish. They basically said something to the tune of, \"Don't pay this fucking *gringo* more than x.\" Which was 50% of what I was asking. So, when the guy turned around to talk to me, I responded in Spanish. The wife turned red and fled, and the grandma started apologizing profusely. \n\nI wasn't necessarily insulted, but it's interesting how people's attitudes change when they consider you an \"outsider\" to their particular niche in society. Moral of the story, don't assume who people are and treat people with the respect and dignity you expect to be treated."

            "That my parents \"had\" to get married. They always told us they got married in 1961, but it was 1962, 3 months before my sister was born. \n\nWhat's amusing is that my father was an accountant who was insanely fast with math. Whenever he was asked how many years they'd been married, he'd be off by one. My mother would correct him through clenched teeth and then my father would nod and agree.",
            "When my paternal grandfather died the federal govt reached out to do a state funeral. He'd been career army and a colonel, so we didn't question it. Then the funeral came and they went ALL OUT! Huge procession, people showing up who are really big names, like heads of dept's, senators, retired senators, people from the CIA and State Dept, it was nuts and we were all super confused. Turns out he was a key dude in the OSI during WWII and when the OSI splintered into the CIA and Secret Service, he went the Secret Service route. He wasn't on White House detail, but instead worked in a covert office that dealt with counterfeiting and currency. He went blind when I was a toddler and retired from 'the Army.' For whatever reason, he told no one about all his covert work with the OSI and Secret Service and the only person who knew (my grandmother) was sworn to secrecy and never told anyone. My father grew up thinking he was just a colonel working on base. Only after his death were we given all sorts of cool shit like publications by him, lectures given by him, and all kinds of things from various things he did and was known for. All I knew him as was a blind old man who was perpetually smoking, drinking and being a crotchety bastard. Turns out he was a bad motherfucker and all but none of us knew.",

So, everyone assumed my grandmother had an affair and got pregnant with my dad.

            "After my mom died I found out the real story behind my parent's marriage. She came to my father's country to visit some of her relatives. Met my father and after just one week she asked him to marry her so she could stay in the country. My father accepted because he had noone else and his parents were pressing him to get married already.\n\nBut the highlight of the story is that over some time, the two of them fell in love with each other. Their love only grew over the time and they were really happy together. My mother spent her last days very ill, and she would accept only my father by her bedside. He swears to this day that she was an angel sent from god to take care of him. I am shocked that they got married just like that, out of the blue and ended up loving each other so so so deeply. I can only hope to have as good and loving marriage as they had.\n\nEdit: I had no idea my parents little secret would touch so many people! Thank you all, it means a lot!",

            "My uncle served in Vietnam. While over there his troop found a baby that had been orphaned or abandoned, they aren't sure. My uncle was shipping back to Australia soon and wanted to adopt him, but my aunt said no (they'd only been married about 4 months when he was drafted, so while I don't agree with my aunt's actions and generally don't like her as a person, I can understand why she said no). My uncle's troop found a family to raise the baby, and that's the story the whole family knows.\n\nThe secret is that my uncle and some other guys from his troop stayed in contact with the family and the kid, sending them money every month to help raise him and then to help him go to university and eventually helped him and his adoptive family move to Australia in the last 90s. My aunt and the rest of my family had no idea all this time, it only came out when my aunt and uncle divorced in 2017 and she had a forensic accountant go through their bank records. She worked at a bank for like 40 years and always noticed the money missing, but his reasons were always justified.\n\nSince we all know now, my uncle has introduced some of us to the guy and his family. They're all really lovely people.\n\nEdit to clarify as to why my aunt is a bad person in this instance:\n\nI was half asleep when I posted this and realised I left out a pretty important detail to explain why I don't like my aunt for this *facepalm*\n\nTo preface, I'm childfree and if my husband was in this situation, I'd say no as well. It's not the fact she said no to adopting the kid that makes me dislike her for this, it's her reason.\n\nAunt is very racist against Asian people. Doesn't matter what part of Asia, she hates them. She's the kind of person who will yell \"go back to your own country!\" at random strangers who even vaguely look like they may have Asian ancestry. She also cut contact with my cousin, her daughter, because my cousin's husband is half Japanese.\n\nShe's said, in front of my family with no shame, that if the kid hadn't been Asian, she would have said yes to adopting him.",

            "When I was 28, I found out that my dad was not my biological father. The news came out via the following: my dad was battling depression and was suicidal, so I had just flown home to try to take care of him and rescue him from my mom's wrath. My mom had verbally and emotionally abused him during their entire relationship. He loved her so much, and he tolerated it.\n\nWell, during a solemn walk w/ my dad, as I tried to help him out, he confided that he's not my biological dad, and he went on to tell me he knew this all along but my mom lied to him and tried to convince him that he was my biological father. He knew he wasn't, but he wanted to play the role. When I was 10 years old, my mom finally confessed this to him, and he was worried that upon hearing the news, officially, he'd somehow let this affect his relationship with me. So, when I was 28 years old, during this walk w/ my dad, as he pours out this story to me, he frames it by telling me that his two most proud items in his life are: (1) how I turned out / his raising me; (2) that he had completely forgot about the news my mom told him earlier in that day (when I was 10), about him not being my biological father, and that it was only upon tucking me in at night (when I was 10), that it briefly crossed his mind. It was at that point that he knew nothing would ever come between us and our father-son relationship would be as awesome as ever.\n\nHe also confided that my mom did hard drugs while pregnant with me, and this broke his heart to witness firsthand. They were very poor. My dad grew up in a foster home without parents. My mom grew up w/ 6 siblings and ill-equipped parents. She dropped out of 9th grade, whereas all of her other siblings dropped out earlier -- many of them are barely literate.\n\nI'm now mid-30s, and tragically, my dad committed suicide mid-March 2020, right as COVID was hitting. I was out of the country at the time but immediately flew 30 hours (30-min layover) and made it in time for his funeral. I do everything in his honor.\n\n**[UPDATE:]**\nWow, this thread blew up overnight! My most popular comment by 2 orders of magnitude, and it's about my sorrow. I'm just glad so many of you read about how amazing my dad was, and I truly appreciate the outpour of kind, thoughtful words and wishes. It warms my heart. I could go on and on with countless examples about how amazing he was. After graduating from the orphanage at age 18, he moved up to Atlanta by himself and taught himself woodworking. He was incredible and would build fine-furniture pieces for renowned interior decorators, and his items would be in magazines all the time. He was a starving artist -- we always struggled to get by. Yet, I felt like a spoiled kid on my street, as I had life easier than everyone else (the other kids on my street lived in trailer-homes and had very chaotic households), and it was clear that both of my parents loved me immensely and I felt very well-provided for and supported.\n\nI was very lucky to have him in my life. I still think about him daily, and I'm trying to improve emotionally.\n\nI appreciate everyone sharing your own similar stories, and it provides a sense of camaraderie. Hearing the shared pain and empathy, and seeing that this resonated with so many people, it motivates me to finally write a Short Stories book that would include snippets from my relationship with him. For those interested in reading more about him:\n\n**[EXERPT FROM MY EULOGY TO HIM, WHICH I WROTE WHEN FLYING TO HIS FUNERAL]**\n\n**2. His hard work**\nFor my entire upbringing, he worked every single day in his shop, for long hours \u2013 didn\u2019t even take a day off for Christmas or his birthday. As a kid, I witnessed his work ethic and it forever left an impression on me. Importantly, he didn\u2019t appear as if he was working for someone else; he was working for himself. He found what he loved \u2013 woodworking \u2013 and he completely immersed himself into and dedicated his life to making perfectly crafted items because he wanted to. He had passion, a pursuit of perfection, and an unlimited tank of dedication to fuel it. He didn\u2019t just make items. He didn\u2019t just work. He made masterpieces. \n\nWhen I was 18 and left home to go to college, I aspired to be like my dad. He set the example. I was trying to make something of myself, and to really give it my all just like he did. His work ethic was ingrained in me. I would get 4-5 hours of sleep many nights every week. For years. It was hard, but I always thought about how much harder my dad worked. I would recall memories of him working in his shop late at night: I\u2019d hear the saws spinning; The compressor running; memories of huge sawdust piles under his table-saw. He did so much to provide for our family. He always provided. I remember being a kid, hanging out with him in his shop, admiring his dedication to the craft and strive for perfection.\n\nSo, when I was 18, starting college, I was trying to make him proud, and I was also trying to do everything I could so that I\u2019d have the opportunity to do anything I want in this world. Not just for myself, but on behalf of my dad. A part of me felt that whatever opportunity I gained, whatever success I had, it was in hopes that he too would somehow benefit. That he could vicariously get what he deserved. He deserved the world, and I\u2019ve just been trying to channel his hard work and do my part. Anything I\u2019ve accomplished, it\u2019s because of my dad.\n\n**3. His creative problem solving abilities**\nNot only did my dad work relentlessly hard, but he masterfully found creative solutions to everything. He truly dedicated his life to solving problems and designing furniture for others. There is no physical item he could not figure out. His ability to do so was way beyond anything I\u2019ve ever witnessed. None of my colleagues at MIT, Harvard, Brown, or whatever fancy place I've worked at could remotely come close to having my dad\u2019s unique ability to creatively make things work. Whatever the problem, my dad could find a solution.\n\nWhen he was 12, he was excited once he learned that you could repair some radios just by replacing the diodes. When I was a kid, he made me an incredible tree house with its own electricity line. When I was a teenager, there was a large ice storm in Georgia that caused half a million homes to lose power for up to a week, our house included. My dad had an old portable black and white TV. He grabbed his car battery, and rigged it up so that we could watch TV for days, despite not having power. His vehicles over the years had so many contraptions and workarounds, they were often like modern day Flintstones cars. This was how he did things his entire life.\n\n**5. His strength and character**\nHis perseverance was unmatched. He handled so much adversity over the years, especially the past 10 years when he was in so much pain. He was the strongest person I\u2019ve ever met. Hands down. In recent years, he experienced and recovered from Stevens-Johnsons syndrome, a rare, horrific, deadly skin disorder that covers the entire body. He was resilient beyond belief, and he endured so many personal obstacles that were thrown his way. His strength wasn\u2019t just in his ability to endure, but in his bravery. I have many stories from my childhood where he stepped us to save the day in crises. He was fearless. Not only was he courageous in his character, but he was also physically strong as an ox. It was uncanny. In his 60s, he could often lift more than I could in my 30s, despite my being really into weightlifting, but I\u2019ll spare you the fun, humbling details.\n\n**6. Vulnerability and gentleness**\nOnce I became an adult, he was strong enough to admit to me tough moments in his life. He was willing to confide in me painful times that he endured. He was willing to call on me for help, and to tell me when he felt he wasn\u2019t strong enough. We all feel this way at times. He was vulnerable to cry. He showed me that one\u2019s willingness to show vulnerability is in fact a product of strength and bravery.\n\n**11. Closing**\nAs I close, I want to mention one of my favorite artists, Alanis Morissette, who has a stanza that challenges us by asking: \u201cHow \u2019bout remembering your divinity? How \u2019bout unabashedly bawling your eyes out? How \u2019bout not equating death with stopping?\u201d To this effect, I know that my dad will continue to inspire me and influence me for the rest of my life, without question.\n\nI am who I am because of him. I\u2019ve always aspired to uphold the principles and he stood for. And I hope that others see in me his virtues and pieces of his personality. I want to continue his legacy. Thus, he hasn\u2019t \u2019stopped.\u2019 Further, I challenge all of you to do the same in never equate death with stopping. That is, we can do better than just remembering someone; we can do better than just remembering my dad. We can continue to learn from what he\u2019s taught us, the elements I\u2019ve mentioned today:\n\n1. When you find something you love, whether it\u2019s work or a hobby, put everything you have\ninto it.\n\n2. Be willing to think creatively to solve problems.\n\n3. Take the time to enjoy the so-called minutia in life. the alleged trivial details. make it\nsignificant.\n\n4. Be willing to play and be silly; don\u2019t take yourself too seriously.\n\n5. Be brave. Be strong. Be so strong, that you\u2019re willing to be vulnerable.\n\n6. Be a teacher, and be a lifelong student.\n\n7. Mean everything you say and speak earnestly.\n\n8. Connect with others; form a community. And be there for others. We could all benefit from the help of others, so be unafraid to rely on others for support. I would do anything to have my dad with us here today. In his own words, which he often told me: \u201cit\u2019s not what happens to you, but how you handle it.\u201d So again, I urge you all to *handle* this tragedy by staying strong, connecting with community and the support of others, and continuing to learn from my dad.\n\nThank you all for being here. It means the world to me, and I know it means the world to my dad.",

We were visiting my aunt and uncle, grandma lived with them. They had Bit-O-Honey at the local store, which I could no longer get at home. But no one would take me to the store. \n\nFinally I said I'd just ask grandma, and my cousin chimes in with, \"Grandma can't drive.\"\n\n\"Oh you bet your sweet ass I can drive. They just don't let me!\" Grandma had overheard and she was in high dudgeon.\n\nBut that's all that was said about it, and my aunt finally took me to the store, so I forgot about it. \n\nYears later, when I'd just gotten my license, I asked my mom what was up with Grandma not driving.\n\nShe explained that during prohibition grandma boot-legged alcohol for moonshiners. She was very successful at it. She was so successful at it that when the moonshiners were finally busted, even though the revenuers never caught my grandma, her license was suspended by the state \"to never be reissued.\"\n\nLater in life she was told she could petition for it back but it came with an admission of guilt or some such.

            "My mother had a child when she was a teenager, and she had given him up for adoption to a family. After this, she went to college, got her degree, married my father, and gave birth to my 4 siblings and myself. ~30 years after giving her child up for adoption, I remember her getting a phone call and immediately locking herself in her room. I was about 12 at the time. I remember feeling scared because I could hear my mom crying, but she didn\u2019t want to see anybody or talk about why she was crying. \n\nOn an evening later that week, my parents sat each of us kids down and told us about my mom\u2019s past and explained that my half-brother had reached out to my mom wanting to meet her and get to know her. My dad had known ever since he and mom were dating in college, and I believe my oldest sister had been told  previous to this point. But the rest of my siblings and myself and all of the in-laws on my dad side (my grandma, aunts, and uncles etc.) didn\u2019t know about this part of her past. We are fairly religious/conservative, so it was really shocking at first. \n\nMy mom then flew out to the state where my half brother lived with her sisters and met him. Both my mom and my half brother were both very nervous about the whole thing, but by the end of their trip meeting each other, they got to rebuild a relationship. After a bit of time, we (my siblings and I) got to meet him too. \n\nFast forwarding to now, he\u2019s since moved to our same state and we see him much more frequently. He\u2019s in all of our family pictures, we see him occasionally for holidays and birthdays, and we all see him as part of our family. We\u2019re a very close-knit and extroverted family, while he is much shyer, so at times he\u2019s can be a bit more distant than we would like, but we give him his space. I know my mom stays in close touch with him, and we love it when he\u2019s able to make it for family dinners and whatnot. \n\nBack then, I was the youngest and (up til then) the only boy in my family, so I loved learning that I had an older brother. Now that I\u2019m an adult, I sometimes get his old clothes because were roughly the same size. He\u2019s got good taste too so I really lucked out haha. I love that this family secret was spilled and that we were able to welcome my brother into our family and have him in our lives.",
            "My Mom cheating on my dad with my now stepfather. My Parents divorced when I was really young (about 1 year old), so I don't remember anything about that. When I would ask as a curious kid why they split up both said that they just fell out of love. I already had a feeling that this was not true because through my grandma i knew the divorce was in 1996, but my Mom and stepfather started dating in 1995. On my 18th Birthday my stepfather confessed to me in private that they had an affair all that time ago and he still feels awful, because he feels like he broke Up that family. I told hin that all is fine, because everyone is happy now and i already kinda new it. Some years later my stepmother told me that my mom actually kicked out my dad without telling him why. She just \"needed a break\" (remember she just had a newborn and my dad could barely see me at the beginning). My dad later found out through the landlord that my stepfather had moved in. In the house my dad rented with his wife where his newborn daughter was living with a Stranger. To this day i don't know how my dad managed to overcome this without starting a huge fight. I never talked with my parents about it. Just once when my mom was having a rant about a neighbour who left her husband for another man, I told her to stop throwing rocks while sitting in a glas house.

            "I started having problems with my teeth. Spontaneous abscess that resulted in multiple root canals. My dentist did some looking into what the cause might be and found some really odd abnormalities with my incisors roots and nerves ( the teeth that had been afflicting me)...so he sent out requests for help to a couple of professors he knew in the field. When my next appointment came up he was really quiet for a bit before  verbally stumbling about... It turns out that what was happening with my teeth was a classic sign of inbreeding and he was super uncomfortable giving me the news. I brought it up to my mom and she just was like: \"Oh well yeah, didn't you know?\" WTF!? of course I didn't know!!! Turns out that not very far back in the family tree, several of my relatives decided that it was a good idea to get married to one another....and no one bothered to mention it...ever. The small town where I live is 85% my relatives, no joke. I hadn't even met all of them, that's how many there are.  \n Edited for clarification: \nI had made a big point of going far away from my hometown to meet my husband ( married 12 years this june)  because I was afraid of having children with someone that might be my cousin. Only to find out 5 years after we had been married that I was in fact a product of inbreeding. My husband and I are not related at all.\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:**   \nI did not expect this to blow up, I honestly thought that It would just get lost.   \nThank you for the awards!  \n ***I will try to answer some questions here....***  \n \\- my teeth look normal. nothing special about them, no crowding, nicely spaced. Pretty normal teeth.  I didn't take what the dentist said really all that seriously and figured that what the proff said was maybe just a theory rather than fact. Maybe just correlation rather than causation. Then I told my mom....  \n\\- All of my lower incisors have split roots with split nerves. The nerves are in a V shape instead of just straight. There are cavities in my chin around the nerves, so if I get a slight bump on the chin the inflammation can cause an infection...I pretty much end up looking like a sexy female version of  Brian Mulroney !   \n\\- I found out about this after I had been married for around 5 years.   \n\\- I am from Ontario Canada. I won't say where because you might be my cousin.   \n\\- both my mother's side and my father's side came from small towns where the population was predominantly family. i.e. the families had lived there since the town had been settled. So there is a good chance that there had been some inter cousin shenanigan's on both sides, though no names from my mothers side showed up in my fathers family tree.    \n\\- so far 23andme says that  I have a little over 1500 relatives scattered  across Canada and the USA and only 17 in the UK.

My uncle, who farmed the land, burst out laughing and told us that it must\u2019ve been not long after that he was at that property and obviously noticed the burned grass and askew hose.

My great-grandma died first then he followed about a year later. Their only living child was the executor of their estate and she noticed a lot of names (like 20) listed as specifically discluded from their estate. All of them had to be notified by the executor. They died very wealthy and had taken in foster children when my great aunt was young, so she recognized almost all of the names. They discluded the foster children because they didn't want them entitled to any of their belongings. The name she didn't recognize turned out to be my great-grandpa's son from an affair.\n\nAfter doing some research, she was able to locate his mother and notify her that he was discluded from their estate. My great-aunt figured that the son didn't know that they were half-siblings, and she didn't want to be the one to tell him. It turned out she was right and the mother never told her son. Apparently, he still believes that his (now deceased) step-father was his biological father. The craziest part? The illegitimate son had two daughters that ended up going to high school with my brother.\n\nEdit: I want to apologize for the use of the word \"disclude\", I genuinely thought it was an actual word.

Her dad was a military officer and this was in the 1940s so it was considered really shameful (thus the cover up). My mom had no clue because no one knew, the ones who knew didn't tell her, and her birth certificate was falsified. How did this all come to light? In 8th grade, I had to do a family history project. My mom called some of her relatives to help me out. One of her cousins, who is much older, accidentally let some information slip, which led to my mom suspecting the circumstances of her birth/identity. My mom confronted her bio mom (who I knew as my aunt) and it was upsetting for them both. Her bio mom was shamed and told to keep quiet about the whole situation by her parents, while my mom was raised by parents who treated her horribly (my mom always said that growing up, she felt like she was unwanted). Now, my mom feels relieved because her childhood makes a lot more sense now.

During this time he had two children with this woman and they never told anyone about. She pretended that those two children were that of her husband despite them not looking anything like him.\n\nHow we found out was rather interesting. A couple years ago I had gotten one of the 23andMe DNA kits to figure out what my ethnic background looked like. My aunt and uncle had done the same about a year ago as well. Once you get your results from 23andMe, it also will show you any DNA matches you have with relatives.\n\nA couple days after Christmas, a woman had reached out to my aunt and uncle asking to speak with them because 23andMe was telling her that they were her half siblings and that I was showing up as her nephew. Coming from a very strict Catholic family, this was very confusing and concerning to her. They ended up meeting and pieced together everything and then approached their parents about it who at first denied it, then came clean about the affair. \n\nIt's been pretty hard on the family.

            "My father, now slowly succumbing to Alzheimer\u2019s, has always been considered a \u2018hard case\u2019 as people called it growing up in New Zealand. He has many quirks, and in the 90\u2019s as I grew up people didn\u2019t have words to describe to me why how was different. It was known that he had epilepsy, a fairly short temper, and an incredibly literal take on things. He is, in short, a hard man to know at times. \n\nIt was only in the last decade have we begun to unravel his story. \n\nDue to living in the South Island without a lot of money, we didn\u2019t see our extended family much growing up, so there wasn\u2019t much of an opportunity to ask questions as I became a teenager. \n\nOriginally, it was claimed that dad had been out in the sun too long as a child and had serious sun stroke that triggered a change in him. Before that time, he\u2019s been a fairly normal child. But over the years, another story came out: dad had dived into a swimming pool and hit his head hard, causing a change. \n\nBut finally, about a decade ago, after my step-grandmother passed, the truth floated to the surface. \n\nMy grandfather was a man deeply affected by WWII. He had served in the infantry in Egypt, and the experience changed him. My memories of him are of a jolly man with a temper when he was pushed, growing grumpier each time I saw him. Anyway, he had returned from the war an angry man, working as a labourer best I can tell, marrying my grandmother, who passed when my dad was 12. When my dad was a teenager, after years of tough upbringing, did something that made my grandfather snap - dad has always been a smart-ass, and knows how to needle people. \nIn response, my grandfather beat the shit out of him. Blood was coming out of his ears. \n\nAnd that was how he changed. Recently we\u2019ve established he\u2019s unlikely to be on the spectrum, but his behaviour is consistent with a traumatic brain injury. His whole life has been affected by the actions of his father. For my part, I\u2019ve resolved to not repeat my father and grandfather\u2019s patterns of anger for my children - and now I reflect on how the legacy of WWII affected my father through his father. \n\nThat ends with me.",

I's gonna be long.\n\nMy father died when I was seven years old, after a super bitter and contentious divorce from my mother. We never went to his funeral. To this day (I'm 36 now), I've never even visited my father's grave, but that's something I will fix soon, I hope. My siblings and I were told by my mother that we were abused and unwanted by my dad and his new wife, so just before he died he sent us away so he could enjoy his life without us and with his new wife and son, my step brother who was just a baby at the time. I bitterly hated my father for decades for doing this to us - cruelly sending us away to be impoverished and abused by my mother. My mom told us stories about how he would leave us outside during the winter if we did anything wrong and only fed us a small can of beans or a hot dog for all three of us kids, while giving his other son all the best food and toys and stuff. I couldn't remember anything, so I took her word for it. It was ironic in hindsight, she talked about how abusive he was and then she would turn around and leave us alone for months on end to fend for ourselves while she was vacationing with friends, or beat us with tree branches and pipes, or tell us we were her biggest regret in life. Thank God for my older sister, without her I'd be dead right now. Anyways.\n\nFive years ago I was getting married, and wanted to bury the hatchet with my little brother. So I found him on Facebook and started talking with him, and we all reconciled. None of it was his fault after all, he was only a baby. \n\nWhen he flew out to see us, we started talking with him about our abusive jerk of a father, and he was sincerely confused. As it turns out, after the divorce, my mother (for lack of a better term) seduced a very expensive lawyer into suing my father for custody of us, essentially legally kidnapping us through the system. My father was a very poor southern man and couldn't afford any high-powered attorneys. We found out that not only was everything we knew about my father a lie, but he fought tooth and nail until the day he died trying to get us back, or to at least see us again. We didn't attend his funeral because (of course) they didn't want my mother there. My paternal grandparents and my step mother (who is a very kind and wonderful woman, by the way) tried to get us kids to attend it, but my mother wouldn't let us. She told us my dad said in his will he didn't want us there, which is absurd in hindsight. He died suddenly of a heart attack and had no time to write a will banning his kids from his funeral. Anyway, we found out my dad tried to send us mail, gifts, voicemails... and none of it ever got to us because my mom intercepted and destroyed it all. My dad loved and missed us intensely, up until the moment he died. My step mom kept court documents, photos, letters, home movies... all proof of his devotion to us in the hopes that one day we could reconcile.\n\nSometimes I think about it, like what must have been going through his head when he was dying. Did he think about us? Did he see me specifically? Did he feel like he failed by not getting us back and now he'll never see us grow up? Did he die so young of a heart attack because of the stress my mom put him through by taking us away? If he knew the horrible things we thought about him, he would have been crushed. I spent so much time being manipulated into hating my father that I don't even really miss him. It feels good to know my dad loved me, but it doesn't change anything now. I can't call him when I need advice. I can't talk to him about marriage problems or repairing my car. It's the same as its ever been. I'm just numb to it, and I think that's the saddest thing.\n\nI don't know if there is a heaven or afterlife or whatever, but I hope somehow he knows I'm sorry for thinking that way about him and that I would give anything to be able to talk to him a little bit, or feel what his hug is like.",

            "This comment will get buried but here goes... \n\nWe were always told that my uncle was a liar and a conman. Per the family, he was out there swindling people by faking expertise/degrees and getting engineering contracts that he had no means to deliver on. They told us he was an awkward loser that left home around 18 because he didn\u2019t fit in with the family for vague reasons, generally centered on being crippled by insecurity about his looks and/or career prospects. \n\nAs it turns out, he was gay. He left because the family treated him awfully because of it. He wasn\u2019t conning people, rather he had opened a successful gay bar in another city.

            "My grandma has been a miserable insufferable bitch as long as I've been alive. I recently found out why:  \nWhen she was a teenager her father was continually raping her younger sister. She eventually got pregnant as a teenager and so he poisoned her to kill the baby but gave her too much. My grandma held her in her arms as she frothy at the mouth and died while her dad refused to get help.   \nHer brother had enough of his abuse a few months later and met him at the front door with a shotgun and killed him.

            "I got a list. \n\nGrandma was a lesbian. Older family member spilled the beans about the real reason for her \"sudden divorce\"  in a conversation the night my mom died (but I'd had suspicions before that, she shared a bedroom with the same woman from the time she divorced til the day she died...).   \nHad also been told her ex-husband was a huge liar, had never served in any military ever other than as a volunteer bus driver for the VA in the '90s. Found a bunch of telegrams clearing out stuff after Dad died, they were from various European locations via the US Army to my grandma, talking about missing her and when he'd be back stateside. \nWas also told great-grandfather (same side) was a \"giant of a man\" and towered over the rest of the family... his immigration papers (found around the same time as the telegrams, and dated at least a decade later than we'd always thought he came to the US) put him squarely at 5'7.... his wife was a 6' tall woman (according to various hospital paperwork we found, both were sadly long gone before I came along). \n\nMom wrote a suicide note some time in the mid '80s, I found it about a month after the previous ones. I'm the only one that knows about this one (in the family), and honestly see no reason and have no desire to tell any of the rest. She obviously changed her mind, and showing/reading it to literally anyone else mentioned would bring harm to them and no peace to me. \n\nAnd one I knew about most of my life that no one else still living did: My mom was pregnant 9 times. She only had 2 kids, but had they all lived/been carried to term, we would have been \\#2 and \\#10 of them all (cause one was apparently twins).

            "well i only did it once because i used to have a YouTube channel where i would post videos of my first cockatiel but one day she passed away and i was just telling the people who would watch my videos why i would not be posting and than i broke down and started crying",
            "My cousin did this.\n\nHe was going through depression and had underlying mental issues he never properly addressed as a child. It wasn\u2019t for attention, it was his way of screaming for help.",
            "I\u2019ve done this in the past. it was because I was really sad and alone and wanted someone to comfort me. I didn\u2019t have anyone I could personally reach out to. \n\npeople are like, \u2018why would record yourself crying and post it? that\u2019s so attention seeking\u2019 but then when someone commits suicide it\u2019s \u2018why didn\u2019t they tell anyone they were struggling?\u2019",
            "I personally don't do it, but a former friend explained to me why. \n\nYes, it is an attention thing. But atleast for her, it wasn't in a douchey kind of way - she didn't have the nicest upbringing and was shamed for trying to seek help from her family when it came to emotional hardships. It was a real \"toughen up\" kind of household, which made her wary about seeking out help. Instead, she let the help seek her out by drawing attention to her bad emotional state without actually having to tell somebody \"Hey, I feel horrible, I need someone to talk to and be there for me\". \n\nIt's actually really sad and I hate to admit that this is part of the reason she is a former friend. While I felt for her, this behaviour took the control away from me. I couldn't tell her that I feel bad myself and she's crossing a boundary by dumping her emotions on me, since she didn't specifically target me. Sometimes I feel bad for that, but in the end I gotta take care of myself, too.\n\nEdit: spelling",
            "I guess since everybody else is just going to reply with anecdotes and talk about how much better they are then that, I\u2019ll bite.\n\nI did that once. \n\nWhy? Like a lot of people suggested, attention. I was fourteen, I was alone, I was hurting. I wanted someone to tell me I would be okay, and I wasn\u2019t getting that IRL. So I went online and recorded myself crying and trying to talk about what was upsetting me. I got a lot of assholes responding, because people seemed so excited to tear down a sad little girl. But I did get kind responses too, and when I felt better I thanked the people who were kind and deleted the video. \n\nSometimes people just need a few nice words, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019re bad for that.",

            "ETA: this was truly years ago, and I am good and quite stable now. Our baby (now 6) ended up having a tongue tie that we got revised and it made a huge difference. Someone reported this for fear of self harm I guess, so I wanted to clarify. >>> Years ago I posted a raw photo of myself crying to Instagram. I was 2 months post-partum, having a horrible time breastfeeding, and wanted to show other mothers that they were not alone in the raw struggle of motherhood. That every moment is not scripted and that it\u2019s ok to be real on social media even when the world seems to value a fake facade.",
            "Even if people are looking for attention doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t doing it for a reason? My parents beat and neglected me. I was their adopted slave to work their farm and collect the check the state. I was screaming for attention in all sorts of abnormal ways crying to social\nMedia always felt like a last ditched effort to find someone who actually cares about me for once. Never worked and I learned from it. Some people are growing and I apologize for my ignorance",
            "Dunno, I was crying over a movie so I put a picture on my Instagram story and said that the movie I was crying over was so fucking sad but worth the watch, I cry over a lot of things",
            "When you're feeling down and out -  \nFull of worry, full of doubt -  \nWhen you're filled with deep despairs -  \nWhen you're sad and no one cares -   \n\nWhen you're bleak and broken, blue -  \nI shall tell you what to do.  \n\nListen closely.  \n\nDon't forget.\n\n*Put it on the internet.*",
            "Since nobody seems to be actually answering the question I guess I will. I'm mentally ill and wanted someone to ask me if I was okay/what was going on. People always say that if you're struggling you should \"talk to somebody\" but it's very hard to actually start that conversation. Yes, I wanted attention. I wanted support. I wanted someone to reach out and show me that they cared. A lot of you seem to think that makes me a horrible person, but maybe try and look at things from a different perspective. Yes I've done shit before to seek attention, but that doesn't make me not ill, nor a bad person. If somebody is so desparate for attention than perhaps they actually need it. (Disclaimer: I know that this isn't healthy behaviour and I don't do it anymore but as a younger teenager I did so I thought I would offer the perspective that OP actually asked for rather than just saying \"because they're attention seeking idiots with no life\")",

            "I'm related to someone who does this. Basically they want sympathy and don't have people close by who can give it to them. There are plenty of people online who will tell you it's going to be okay.",
            "People want to be seen and understood.",
            "Most people don't make a big spectacle of themselves crying in public, unless they're looking for attention. And *all* of social media is looking for attention, so that goes 1000 times more there.\n\nObviously there are going to be times when something horrible happens in public which makes you cry on the spot, and of course that's fine...But if you go out of your way to make a scene, out of proportion to the drama, it's a ploy for attention.",
            "I wanted people to ask me if I was okay, and I wanted people to know I was hurting.",
            "Most of the comments here are taking the negative view that people who do this are looking for attention or even need/crave attention. And that some of those people are trying to spin it into profit.  While that may be true for many or even most people, I think something is being missed here: documentation.  The proliferation of phones and recording devices has made it easier to document everything.  And there\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting to do that - even if it\u2019s traumatic, grief, etc.  Not only is there nothing inherently wrong or \u201cself-promoting\u201d about documenting, there are many positives to it, including helping those facing similar trials and taboo circumstances.  One that comes to mind is miscarriages.  It\u2019s something that typical hasnt been talked about openly.  Parents often have to keep that in and face mental health and emotional issues alone.  It can also be educational to document authentic emotional experiences.  I\u2019d be willing to bet there are other positive reasons for doing it.   If I filmed and produced a documentary on grief, and filmed myself and others experiencing it, I don\u2019t think this sub would be full of the comments this thread has.  Even if I profited from it. \n\nI know it\u2019s good for my head to make a practice out of considering positive and outlying issues instead of knee-jerk-reacting to something and jumping to conclusions about people\u2019s character.",
            "Nobody around them cares about them being sad and they are so desperate to find somebody to care about them they have to reach out to a larger audience in hopes there is somebody out there.",

            "Because they are sad and want support?",
            "I saw a Tik Tok of a woman crying because the baby sitter had given her baby benadryl and the child OD'd but all I could think about was why would you set up a camera during that phone call. I don't understand it either.",
            "It's disturbing how many people in this thread think saying somebody is \"desperate for attention\" is an indictment of their character, rather than something warranting sympathy.",
            "Why do redditors ask the most passive aggressive questions here knowing full well they won't get a legitimate answer",
            "I don't post anything on social media really, so this doesn't apply to me. In fact, I didn't know posting yourself crying \"was a thing\" until this post. However, the other day I was listening to music on YouTube made by someone in her room, and one song started with her crying while some text explained how lonely and depressed she was when writing the song.\n\nIt stopped me in my tracks. People crying make me very uncomfortable. Maybe it's because I'd get the \"I'll give you a reason to cry\" followed by a smack to the face for crying when I was a kid. Maybe it's because men aren't supposed to cry. I'm sure there are a lot of reasons why crying makes me so uncomfortable. \n\nSo back to the question. I've never seen someone cry on my social feeds, but I hope it wouldn't make me as angry as all the commenters here seem to get. I'd hope it'd make me stop in my tracks again and feel empathy for the person. Just take a moment to realize how hard life can be. Have you ever watched the Pixar movie Inside Out? Remember, the point of the Sadness character was to alert people in the girl's life that she needed support or comforting. Maybe these crying videos are just a modern take on someone reaching out for support or comforting?\n\nAlso, if it's ok to post videos of yourself laughing or smiling, shouldn't it be the same for crying? Crying isn't a bad thing, so why is everyone acting like it is? I imagine in a healthier society people could express a fuller range of emotions without any stigma.",
            "I've only done this if I've been overwhelmed by emotion when I was going to post something anyway. Once I was unboxing something I bought, and I got very nostalgic, and then once  I was just very overwhelmed with the kindness of others. Also, I am a crier in offline life.",

            "I've never posted a crying video before, but people on this thread seem to be demonizing this action. I don't think it's usually a \"ploy\" to get \"likes and attention\" (sometimes it is). I honestly believe it's a natural reaction to gain empathy from one's peers when they are in desperate need for consolation. It's a cry for help, not some evil plan to gain internet points.",
            "I can't do it but I wish I did.\n\nI'd love someone to console me. I'd love a bit of attention. It just feels so empty when you realise how much some things hurt but others will never realise.",
            "HEY MODS!!! Maybe do the copypasta Suicide help sticky comment on this one. I'm sure there are plenty of folks that are not having the greatest emotional response to this question.",
            "More importantly why the hell are people such dicks about what other people do on the internet?  If they aren't hurting you who gives a shit?",
            "The whole point of crying, would seem to be to bring attention to ones self, learned from childhood right, cry and someone comes. So in the social media age crying then posting to social media seems like a natural extension of this instinct.",
            "This thread has me thinking about the ways we perceive emotions, and how we judge others for expressing \u201cnegative\u201d emotions. \n\nPeople post things of themselves looking happy and smiling, laughing, posing to look sexy and so on but because we see those as \u201cpositive\u201d emotional experiences we don\u2019t judge it the same way. \n\nIs sadness inherently something that needs to be experienced in solitude? Why, other than the fact that we were socialized to process it that way?",
            "Sometimes you gotta be vulnerable to talk about stuff online, we can pretend all day that the internet isn't reality and that we can all be happy and emotion is just for clicks. But like.... its people who post things, its people who are hurt or scared, its people who cry. To say anyone admitting or posting their emotions are narcissists (like many are) is to say that we cannot display all aspects of ourselves genuinely simply because of the format, and thats clearly absurd.",
            "Whenever I\u2019ve done it, it was because I had no one to talk to. I\u2019m not close to my family, I don\u2019t have a lot of friends and it\u2019s hard not having anyone to turn to. I also know I\u2019m not the only one in that situation so, not only am I reaching out because I need it, but I also want people in similar situations to know they\u2019re not alone. The most popular video I ever posted is a video where I\u2019m crying and discussing how it feels not to have many friends and the loneliness that comes along with always being the one left out or cancelled on. I still have people message me to this day about that video and how much it helped them knowing other people out there can relate.",
            "because sometimes everyone has abandoned them in life.  All of their friends don't care about them anymore, not even enough to check in or ask how they're doing.  We feel isolated and alone and desperately want social interaction.  the crying then posting is a final cry for help",

I posted on social media asking for well wishing but broke down half way through. He did make it. :)",
            " I took a picture of myself when my beloved companion passed. I only showed it to people that helped me through the process and were important to me. \nNot for attention. I wanted to share my vulnerability with the people I trust. Vulnerability is not a state I am in often, sharing this moment with the right people made our bond stronger.",
            "To normalise it as in its ok to cry and feel shit.",
            "Honestly, have wondered this myself. I have had those moments where I have cried and felt REAL lonely. But could never get myself to record it all. BUT, I also have friends who have posted videos of them crying, and sometimes it has helped me tell myself that I am not alone. So even if I can't do it, I am actually thankful that someone did because it did tell me I was not alone. Even if I knew it without the video, somehow the video helped.",

When I was about 15, we got a call from a man whose wife and infant baby had been murdered in cold blood. \n\nThere were very few clues. It made headlines. Cops set up surveillance at the viewing. It was heartbreaking, as the mother was holding the baby in her arms. \n\nI was asked to take the flower cards and periodically get the husband and ask if he recognized the names. I then photocopied them and put them back. I did it because I was a \u201ckid,\u201d people knew me, and I was unobtrusive. \n\nI talked to the husband quite a bit. He seemed devastated and shaken. \n\nThe cops told me they had an eyewitness to someone leaving the house the day of the murder. \n\nThe witness was a three year old girl. She recognized the man leaving. It was the husbands best friend. \n\nTurns out that the friend and the husband had made a pact to kill each other\u2019s families and run off with their secretaries.

He and his accomplice, a 70 year old woman called Annah, used to drug and kill young women who came to the shop. Eventually one of the victims' parents traced her movements to the shop, and after the remains of 36 mutilated corpses were discovered nearby Mesfewi and Annah were questioned - and tortured.\n\nAnnah didn't survive, but Mesfewi confessed to murdering them, usually for a tiny amount of money. His initial sentence was crucifixion - a very unusual punishment even then. However there were many protests from powerful foreign embassies, and Morocco couldn't do much against them. Instead he was sentenced to beheading, a more common punishment. However the mood in Marrakech was that this was far too lenient, so they settled on immurement - being walled up alive.\n\nA special cell was constructed in the wall of the bazaar, about 2 X 2 X 6 feet. Chains were attached to one wall to ensure he would be kept standing. Mesfewi wasn't told of his fate until the morning of his execution - when he was led, screaming, in chains and slowly bricked up inside. Once the last course had been laid the crowd would fall silent until he started screaming, when they would cheer.\n\nHe screamed nearly constantly for two days. On the third day he fell silent.",
            "James Bulger.\n\nHe was just 2 years old and with his mom running errands. She let go of his hand to pay the cashier, and he wandered away. Two ten year old boys spotted him, lured him toward them, took him by the hands and led him away. They took him to a remote location, pushing and kicking at him the whole time. Some people questioned the two kids with the crying toddler, but they lied saying he was their brother and nobody intervened further. They took him to a secluded spot and tortured him. I don't want to recount the torture details, it's just too gruesome. They left his body on some railroad tracks hoping that being run over by a train would make it look like an accident. He was found days later, his body severed in half by a train.\n\nThe boys were caught and became the youngest convicted murderers in British history. Security footage from the day they took James shows them watching children, picking out a target. And they were just kids themselves. They were released at 18. One of them is back in jail for possessing child abuse photos on his computer. \n\nThe most terrifying thing about this for me is that my own son is only 2 now, and James's murderers were just children, too. It was premeditated and intentional and entirely random. Just a momentary lapse in attention and he became a target of two murderous children. *Children*. To think that *children* younger than my step son are capable of such a thing... ugh. Everything about this case is just horrifying.",

            "The scariest true story I know is my own.  I grew up with a very mentally ill and abusive father. The summer I was 16 and my younger brother was 13, my father shot my brother with a shot gun at almost point blank range in our basement. Thankfully, it missed his heart by two inches and he is still alive today. I came home that evening to find my stepmother cleaning the blood off the tile floor like there was nothing to see. It was the most terrifying and surreal thing I\u2019ve ever experienced. \nOne would believe attempted murder would be enough to terminate custody rights, but alas the police chalked it up to accidental and my brother and I were too frightened of our father to say otherwise. At 18 and 15, respectively, my brother and I packed up and left the state never to speak to our father again. To this day, little bits of shrapnel still surface in my brother\u2019s chest.\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone who took time to read, comment and up vote.

Her mother had abandoned her when she was 14 years old and left for the USA. When she was 15-16 years old, she was sent from Lithuania by an older man who pretended to be her boyfriend. He promised her a job as a berry picker in Sweden and gave her a fake passport. When she arrived in Sweden, a man welcomed her and locked her in an apartment in Malm\u00f6. He said she had to pay him 20,000 kronor for her passport and the transportation from Lithuania to Sweden. She soon understood she would be working as a prostitute.\n\nRasalait\u0117 was forced to work as a prostitute for two weeks before she escaped the apartment she was imprisoned in. On 7 January 2000, she jumped off a bridge in\u00a0Malm\u00f6\u00a0after escaping from the apartment and getting raped by a group of men who pretended they would help her. She died three days later at a hospital. Her case stirred much debate on human trafficking.",
            "I had a guy tell me a story a couple decades ago about how he was hiking in an area in South America and wandered away from other hikers in the area. The ground was wet and without warning it gave away and he got sucked into a fast moving underground river- pitch black, completely submerged, and at the mercy of the current as it buffeted him against the sides of the tunnel. After some time the current subsided and he realized he was in a larger pocket, still pitch black and submerged. He said that even as he struggled to hold his breath, he didn\u2019t panic and realized that the water had to keep moving *somewhere*, so he moved around until he found another tunnel that sucked him in. At one point he began to see light so he punched upwards, broke through the ground and pulled himself out, soaking wet, gasping for air, and a bit of a distance from the other dry hikers, who were somewhat bewildered when they saw him straggling up to them.",

He was immediately sober and ran over to the driver\u2019s side, tried to pull his wife out. It tore her wound up and we had to drag him out. He then proceeded to the passenger side and tried to pry the caved door open. \n\nWe left the scene then and let the police handled the aftermath. Saw it on the news that afternoon.",

            "Personal story.\n\nWhen I was 10, I regularly attended a choir club for kids. One day, I was picked up by my dad to drive me home. I was confused about it, as it was always my mum who did, but did not think much on it until half-way through the drive. My dad began to mumble about how sorry he was, and how I would never see him again. More than a bit frightened and confused at that point, I kept asking what he meant, but he wouldn't say. Until we were home, but he did not leave the car, and instead urged me to get out. Finally, he told me I would not see him again because he will be dead very soon for what he did, and that the police would answer me.\n\nAfter he practically kicked me out of the car I rushed home, but no one was there. But I found the door open, and a puddle of blood on the floor.\n\nThe police was nearby and explained what had happened:\n\nMy dad was obsessively jealous and had found a pack of old condoms in the cupboard, so he drew the conclusion that my mum must have cheated on him. Never mind the fact that we only recently moved into this apartment, and they could have been left by previous tenants, or the fact that he controlled my mum's very step and never let her go anywhere alone. The police took me to the hospital, where my mum, luckily alive, was being treated.\n\nMy dad had smashed her skull in with a full wine bottle. The only reason she survived was because my little brother, 7 at the time, intervened. If it weren't for him, my dad would have killed my mum in a fit of jealousy.\n\nWhen he said that I would not see him again, he meant that he had planned on killing himself shortly after dropping me off. He did not succeed, and police managed to get him into a mental ward.\n\nThis, to this date, is the scariest thing that had ever happened to me, but I keep thinking of my brother all the time. To witness your own mum being beaten half-dead by your dad. We both suffered extreme mental trauma from this event later down the line, but somehow turned into decent people. I never really told him how grateful I am he was there, but I think that I really, really should.\n\nEdit: Despite what my mum went through, she is the most cheerful and sweetest woman I have ever known. It takes real strength to come out of such an abusive marriage and continue to live your life in such a positive way, and also raise her two children alone.",

            "The Franklin Expedition. Somewhere in the neighborhood of 150 British sailors and military personnel on two ships embarked on a mission to find the Northwest Passage from the Atlantic across to the Pacific through arctic waters. The ships, named HMS Erebus and HMS Terror (two former warships reclassified as ice breakers thanks to their sturdier builds) departed British waters in the 1845 and were never seen again. In subsequent rescue attempts and investigations it was discovered that quite possibly everything that could\u2019ve gone wrong on the expedition did so. \n\nThe weight of the ships with their reinforced hulls and decks designed to fire mortars and cannons off of worked against them as much of the waters crossed were shallow and filled with rocks and icebergs. The the time chosen to launch the expedition occurred at one of the coldest Arctic periods in  recent history, meaning the polar ice and (particularly the pack ice) didn\u2019t melt like usual as the ships became locked in the frozen water and essentially experienced an endless winter for over 4 years. \n\nThe food they stored which was supposed to last for years thanks to the revolutionary new process of canning was bought at the lowest bidder. Much of the food was improperly sealed and spoiled leading to food poisoning and even the ones that were properly sealed and kept intact were riddled with lead thanks to the soldering used to keep the food inside fresh; In conjunction with the lead pipes in the ships the men would\u2019ve been drinking out of for years meant the entire crews of both ships was slowly being infected with all manner of diseases (namely botulism, scurvy and heavy lead poisoning which also affects the mind leading to memory loss, heavy paranoia and general mental deterioration) combined with already present tuberculosis that killed a small number of the crew before departing to the Arctic. \n\nAfter about 2-3 years stuck in the ice, the captain in charge of the voyage John Franklin and many other crew members died in unknown circumstances and the remainder decided to abandon ships and try and hike out together to the nearest trading outpost and Back Fish river in Canada, hundreds of miles away, by loading up their rowboats with supplies and fixing them on sleds to be pulled. All remaining crew perished on that journey. Their remains discovered by local Inuits/Netsilik tribes, who described desolate campsites of skeleton-like corpses with hazily built, half-open tents and even human body parts in cook pots, heavily implying that the men resorted to cannibalism in their last desperate hours.",

            "*The Blue Hole is a 100-meter-deep sinkhole on the coast of the Red Sea, five miles north of Dahab, Egypt. Its nickname is the \u201cdivers\u2019 cemetery\u201d. Divers in Dahab say 200 died in recent years. Many of those who died were attempting to swim under the arch...*\n\nMany certified scuba divers think they are capable of just going a little deeper, but they don\u2019t know that there are special gas mixtures, buoyancy equipment and training required for just another few meters of depth.\n\nImagine this: you take your PADI open water diving course and you learn your dive charts, buy all your own gear and become familiar with it. Compared to the average person on the street, you\u2019re an expert now. You go diving on coral reefs, a few shipwrecks and even catch lobster in New England. You go to visit a deep spot like this and you\u2019re having a great time. You see something just in front of you - this beautiful cave with sunlight streaming through - and you decide to swim just a little closer. You\u2019re not going to go inside it, you know better than that, but you just want a closer look. If your dive computer starts beeping, you\u2019ll head back up.\n\nSo you swim a little closer and it\u2019s breathtaking. You are enjoying the view and just floating there taking it all in. You hear a clanging sound - it\u2019s your dive master rapping the butt of his knife on his tank to get someone\u2019s attention. You look up to see what he wants, but after staring into the darkness for the last minute, the sunlight streaming down is blinding. You turn away and reach to check your dive computer, but it\u2019s a little awkward for some reason, and you twist your shoulder and pull it towards you. It\u2019s beeping and the screen is flashing GO UP. You stare at it for a few seconds, trying to make out the depth and tank level between the flashing words. The numbers won\u2019t stay still. It\u2019s really annoying, and your brain isn\u2019t getting the info you want at a glance. So you let it fall back to your left shoulder, turn towards the light and head up.\n\n*The problem is that the blue hole is bigger than anything you\u2019ve ever dove before, and the crystal clear water provides a visibility that is 10x what you\u2019re used to in the dark waters of St Lawrence where you usually dive. What you don\u2019t realize is that when you swam down a little farther to get a closer look, thinking it was just 30 or 40 feet more, you actually swam almost twice that because the vast scale of things messed up your sense of distance. And while you were looking at the archway you didn\u2019t have any nearby reference point in your vision. More depth = more pressure, and your BCD, the air-filled jacket that you use to control your buoyancy, was compressed a little. You were slowly sinking and had no idea. That\u2019s when the dive master began banging his tank and you looked up. This only served to blind you for a moment and distract your sense of motion and position even more. Your dive computer wasn\u2019t sticking out on your chest below your shoulder when you reached for it because your BCD was shrinking. You turned your body sideways while twisting and reaching for it. The ten seconds spent fumbling for it and staring at the screen brought you deeper and you began to accelerate with your jacket continuing to shrink. The reason that you didn\u2019t hear the beeping at first and that it took so long to make out the depth between the flashing words was the nitrogen narcosis. You have been getting depth drunk. And the numbers wouldn\u2019t stay still because* ***you are still sinking***\\*.\\*\n\nYou swim towards the light but the current is pulling you sideways. Your brain is hurting, straining for no reason, and the blue hole seems like it\u2019s gotten narrower, and the light rays above you are going at a funny angle. You kick harder just to keep going up, toward the light, despite this damn current that wants to push you into the wall. Your computer is beeping incessantly and it feels like you\u2019re swimming through mud. Fuck this, you grab the fill button on your jacket and squeeze it. You\u2019re not supposed to use your jacket to ascend, as you know that it will expand as the pressure drops and you will need to carefully bleed off air to avoid shooting up to the surface, but you don\u2019t care about that anymore. Shooting up to the surface is exactly what you want right now, and you\u2019ll deal with bleeding air off and making depth stops when you\u2019re back up with the rest of your group.\n\nThe sound of air rushing into your BCD fills your ears, but nothing\u2019s happening. Something doesn\u2019t sound right, like the air isn\u2019t filling fast enough. You look down at your jacket, searching for whatever the trouble might be when *FWUNK* you bump right into the side of the giant sinkhole. What the hell?? Why is the current pulling me sideways? Why is there even a current in an empty hole in the middle of the ocean?? You keep holding the button. INFLATE! GODDAM IT INFLATE!!\n\nYour computer is now making a frantic screeching sound that you\u2019ve never heard before. You notice that you\u2019ve been breathing heavily - it\u2019s a sign of stress - and the sound of air rushing into your jacket is getting weaker.\n\n*Every 10m of water adds another 1 atmosphere of pressure. Your tank has enough air for you to spend an hour at 10m (2atm) and to refill your BCD more than a hundred times. Each additional 20m of depth cuts this time in half. This assumes that you are calm, controlling your breathing, and using your muscles slowly with intention. If you panic, begin breathing quickly and move rapidly, this cuts your time in half again. You\u2019re certified to 20m, and you\u2019ve gone briefly down to 30m on some shipwrecks before. So you were comfortable swimming to 25m to look at the arch. While you were looking at it, you sank to 40m, and while you messed around looking for your dive master and then the computer, you sank to 60m. 6 atmospheres of pressure. You have only 10 minutes of air at this depth. When you swam for the surface, you had become disoriented from twisting around and then looking at your gear and you were now right in front of the archway. You swam into the archway thinking it was the surface, that\u2019s why the Blue Hole looked smaller now. There is no current pulling you sideways, you are continuing to sink to the bottom of the arch. When you hit the bottom and started to inflate your BCD, you were now over 90m. You will go through a full tank of air in only a couple of minutes at this depth. Panicking like this, you\u2019re down to seconds. There\u2019s enough air to inflate your BCD, but it will take over a minute to fill, and it doesn\u2019t matter, because that would only pull you into to the top of the arch, and you will drown before you get there.*\n\nHolding the inflate button you kick as hard as you can for the light. Your muscles are screaming, your brain is screaming, and it\u2019s getting harder and harder to suck each panicked breath out of your regulator. In a final fit of rage and frustration you scream into your useless reg, darkness squeezing into the corners of your vision.\n\n*4 minutes. That\u2019s how long your dive lasted. You died in clear water on a sunny day in only 4 minutes.*\n\n\\[credit to [https://www.reddit.com/user/\\_Neoshade\\_/](https://www.reddit.com/user/_Neoshade_/) for this awesome and terrifying write-up about the Blue Hole -- it's something I'll never forget\\]",

And let me tell you there\u2019s only so much morphine they can give you without killing you and the body is capable of dishing out a LOT of pain that pain meds can\u2019t fix. There is also a particularly cruel type of cancer that affects the pain regions of your brain. \n\nReally there is a reason people advocate for compassionate death when one is suffering from terminal illness. Death is natural. Sometimes turning off the machines is the right thing. But when your next of kin feels sad about the idea of you dying sometimes something that should have taken a few days will be dragged out for years to come. These patients aren\u2019t happy or enjoying their last few days. They are suffering. \n\nThey beg for more pain killers when they\u2019ve already reached maximum dosage.

            "The Fritzl case: a man named Josef Fritzl who lived  in a small town called Amstetten in Austria fakes the disappearance of her daughter Elisabeth. In reality, he keeps her captive for 24 years in a hidden room in the basement of his house he had been working in as a \"nuclear shelter\". During this period of time he assaulted his daughter several times and had several children with her who grew older over time in this room. When one of Elisabeth's children died shortly after being born, he just took the body from her and incinerated it. He also regularly punished them by cutting the electricity or not bringing them food. Josef wanted to take care of the children with his wife (Elisabeth's mother, who wasn't aware of the events in her basement), so he'd make Elisabeth write fake letters and then he would pretend he found the babies in their porch.

It's just disturbing to me.\n\nEdit: Appearently there is a Japanese historian that argues that the *intentions* of these killings may not always be for merely testing blades and that a more common reason might be robbery, but regardless of the circumstances surrounding it, what is known for certain is that innocent passer-bys are being slain from the shadows by an untouchable elite class during the Sengoku.

            "Not as bad as most of what\u2019s here, but an interesting deep-sea study was conducted last year that has some frightening implications.\n\nMarine biologists took three alligator carcasses and dropped them 6,600 feet into the Gulf of Mexico. This is deep enough that there is no natural light, therefore no plants. Without plants, the ecosystem must sustain itself on marine snow, which is usually scraps of dead animals that were partially eaten nearer to the surface, but the less desirable pieces weren\u2019t touched and sank. The ecosystem this deep is basically all scavengers, with a few small predators.\n\nThe first of the three gators was fully consumed after less than 24 hours, by giant amphipods, large deep-sea invertebrates the size of a a grapefruit.\n\nThe second was consumed more slowly, after 51 days only bones were left. Interestingly, a new species of bone-eating worm was found on the remains.\n\nThe third carcass is the one that gives me chills. When the scientists sent their probe down to look at it, it was gone. Not a trace. There were drag marks on the seabed and the ropes used to hold it in place had been torn apart, but other than that, it was gone.\n\nIn waters this deep, most animals are the size of a cat or smaller. They stay small because food is so scarce. To be big enough to tear through rope, pick up an 80 pound gator, and leave with it, whatever took it must have been an order of magnitude larger than anything that lives that deep. It\u2019s possible it was a shark, but sharks of the estimated size required don\u2019t often live so deep. We still don\u2019t know what took that gator.\n\nEDIT: there\u2019s been a lot of discussion in the comments about different possible culprits. While it\u2019s impossible to say for sure, the most likely species is the sixgill shark, one of the handful of truly large species that lives this deep. Other possible options include the Greenland shark and Magnapinna squid.",

            "This is a personal story, but I think it does illustrate a greater point. I've told the story before, and I'll try to keep it brief.\n\nI used to live and work in South Africa with a charity organization and while there I became friends with a man originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo, who was now in SA working with our group.\n\nEventually I ended up moving back to Canada, but we still kept in touch sporadically over Facebook. A couple of years went by, and he stopped updating his profile. It was sad, but people move on, and when you are half way around the world friendships can fade. \n\nHowever a couple of years after that I was back in South Africa on holidays, and I asked some mutual friends if they knew where he was so that maybe we could all meet up and catch up on old time. Unfortunately all they knew was that he had moved away around the time he stopped updating his profile and no one knew where he ended up. Another friend and I decided to try and track him down. We ended up getting ahold of his family who were in Kinshasa DRC. They knew that he had planed to go to Angola for a job opportunity but they too had not heard from him in well over a year.\n\nSadly I couldn't stay and continue on the search, but my other friend did. He found that he did indeed make it to Luanda in Angola, and was heading towards a town called Luau near to the Angola/DRC border. However this is where the trail went cold, and he disappeared off the face of the earth.\n\nNo one knows what happened to him. Maybe he fell ill and died and was quickly buried somewhere with no one being informed, maybe he fell victim to foul play, maybe in the vast wilderness he got lost or hurt or whatever. We will never know. We informed his family of what we found, and they were grateful, but they too have reached closure in feeling that he is dead. Unfortunately that is the fate that could befall many itinerant workers, and in many areas of developing countries, there is few resources or will available to make more than a cursory search, if that.\n\nThe point is, it is possible for people to disappear even in this day and age. Usually it is the less fortunate, or itinerant people, or those in areas too remote or undeveloped to have proper social safety nets to help them. We rarely think of the possibly until it effects us or someone we know, but it isn't that hard for us or a loved one to go missing and the ones left behind to never know what happened, and that is a scary thought.",
            "What radiation poisoning does to you if you're not **lucky** enough to die quickly. The worst case that I can think of outside of the Chernobyl incident was the case of Hisashi Ouchi, a Japanese plant worker who was exposed to fatal amounts of radiation but thanks to his family and the doctors he was kept alive against his will for 83 goddamn days. \n\nA week into the hospital he said: \u201cI can\u2019t take it anymore[\u2026]. I am not a guinea pig\", yet the doctors continued on. When he died all of his skin had fallen off, all of the skin grafts had fallen off, he'd lost multiple limbs, and he was suffering heart attacks multiple times a day. There are pictures of him on his hospital bed that if you've been around the internet long enough you'll know as part of the original \"shocking images\" collection. It looks like it came straight out of a torture porn movie. \n\nI sometimes work on the grounds of a nuclear power plant and always said that if the worst happened and I was exposed to a lethal amount of radiation that I would just kill myself rather than suffer something like that.",

            "The survival story of Geoffrey Prescott. The only place I can find it is in an old book I have, the 1988 Reader's Digest book Facts & Fallacies, in the Fortune and Misfortune chapter. All credit goes to this book, although I paraphrased almost all of what you are about to read. I don't know if this really counts as scary, but here we go.\n\nGeoffrey Prescott was on a hike across the Marra Mountains with two others, Noel Smith and Mik Iadt. While walking along the edge of an extinct volcano, Prescott fell an unknown amount of feet into the crater of the volcano. He laid there unconscious while his companions trekked down to him. Smith and Iadt decided to go for help at a nearby village, but it would take them a week minimum, which Prescott knew was far too long. \n\nWith the temperatures exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit and having only a few pints of water, Prescott was certain he would perish before the others returned. During the time he was waiting, a small fire burned up his medical supplies and food, with Prescott having to drag himself away from the blaze. He remained there for two days and nights, and dragged himself further down the crater area, hoping he could find water there. \n\nAt about 10 AM on the 4th day, Iadt miraculously arrived with some medical experts. He had reached the village in only 3 days, and had returned almost immediately via horseback and a Jeep. Prescott was immensely relieved, and drank two quarts of water before being driven to a hospital in a stretcher. At the hospital, they discovered that his injuries consisted of a cracked skull, a broken wrist, several smashed vertebrae, and torn ligaments in his knee, and he had survived all that while on the road to the hospital.\n\nPrescott was inspired to study nursing after this ordeal, and as he said, his own miraculous survival had convinced him to help others to face, and defeat, death.",

The beginnings I suspect of many future discoveries as public pressure is beginning to mount on the federal gov and the church to finally start funding and investigating the real extent of the brutality of indian residential schools across the country. As somebody born and raised in Canada, my knowledge of the residential school system, which operated up until the late 60's (edit. Last Residential school closed in the 90s) was minimal and its history was only made aware to me as an adult, and even then, it was hard to fathom some of the first hand stories told about these schools through articles and the truth and reconciliation investigations. This discovery and the many more to come will  put these atrocities front and center for every Canadian and person of the world to come to grips, with a reality that was far darker than was ever made aware through previous attempts from survivors and their kin. Hopefully truthful historic accounts finally gets written into the mainstream, and integrated into our education system for all to understand and reflect.",

Basically a bad case of road burn.  \n\nFrom all the adrenaline I hadn't even felt it. \nThey called someone to come and get me from the mountains (I wasn't allowed to continue) and one of the other riders saw my leg and decided they wanted to stop too .\n\nI just went to a pharmacy, grabbed some wipes and bandages then we got a drink whilst we waited for everyone else to finish.",

No, it wasn\u2019t on my face, I wasn\u2019t quite that stupid. But I was holding the cloth and cutting with the knife, the knife slipped and went straight into my pinky finger. I had to actually pull the knife out. It went right beside my joint and stabbed straight through the flesh on my pinky. \n\nI pulled the knife out and blood was just pouring out of me, which was weird to me at the time. I didn\u2019t realize a pinky would bleed that much. The worst part is, I was home alone. It didn\u2019t really hurt that badly, strange as it may seem. It was honestly no worse than a regular cut, pain wise. \n\nAnyway the blood was coming out at a rate which I had never before seen. I went to the bathroom and wrapped like 7 band aids around it and then took some masking tape and wrapped that around all the band aids. I was like, surely that\u2019ll stop the bleeding. I said fuck the ninja mask and sat on my couch watching tv for a bit, then noticed the tape was starting to slide off. I\u2019d bled through it and all the band aids in maybe 5 minutes max. So I got some paper towels and decided to hold pressure on it but the cut wasn\u2019t very symmetrical. I couldn\u2019t figure out how to get the skin back together. I did the best I could and bled through a bunch of paper towels and finally was like, fuck I think I\u2019m gonna have to call 911.\n\nSo I called 911.

Fell face forward and when I tried to straighten my leg it was incredibly painful. I sat on hands and knees for a couple minutes then decided that I had no other option: gritted my teeth and straightened my leg. There was a loud pop, a very notable shifting of bones, and quite the feeling of crepitus but two seconds later I was continuing down the hill and forgetting about it. Well, it happened again... repeatedly. And every time I would just pop my knee back into place and keep going. It really freaked out people when it happened during soccer games. One time it even happened while having sex. Fortunately she had seen me pop it back in before so she wasn\u2019t as freaked out. Eventually had surgery and found out that I had torn my lateral meniscus (cartilage in the knee) and a flap was lodging itself between the bones. \n\nAlso when younger, I hurt my ankle jumping off a big snow mound (was strictly prohibited by school). I figured it was just sprained and while it hurt, I hobbled around for a while. Even played two soccer games on it with a significant amount of ACE bandage securing it.

Blood starts pouring down my face making it seem really awful. One of my coworkers took me to the doctor's office where my parents worked.\n\nI go into a room with a doctor and he tells me \"You need stitches. I can't do anything with this.\" I said \"Doc, my band has a gig later and I can't wait around in the ER all night. Ya gotta do something.\"\n\nI held my scalp together while he reluctantly shaved around the cut with $0.79 bic and super glued & butterfly bandaged my head back together. I put on a hat & we blew the doors off the gig that night. You can still see the scar when I shave my head.",

            "Oh boy, this is the first AskReddit post that I actually feel qualified to answer. A lifetime of playing sports has unfortunately resulted in several bad injuries:\n1) Tore my quad in the first period of a hockey game when I was 17. I thought it was just a Charlie horse, plus it was a playoff game, so I played the rest of the game and overtime. Weeks went by and it was getting worse and worse, got it looked at; quad tear that had started to calcify. I now have a weird divot in my right leg.\n2) My left thumb came off playing basketball when I was 21 and had to be re-attached. Went to the hospital super calm, thumb and hand all wrapped together in a towel awaiting the surgeon. The ladies at the reception area were surprised I was even in the hospital for anything because I was chill, until I showed them the bone sticking out of my hand.\n3) Took a baseball bat to the head in a game. Required 6 stitches. Soaked the blood with a sweater driving to the hospital, told the triage my pain was a 2/10 (like an idiot, because then I had to wait 5 hours to get stitched up).\n\nThat\u2019s probably the top 3. Sadly there are more; I think my body is held together by duct tape and superglue at this point.",

            "When I was 16 my friend (now my husband) and I decided to learn how to swing dance. His dad was a Bishop at the local church and had the keys, so we went to the church to use their recreational room to practice. We played swing music on the speakers, looked up YouTube videos of how to do the cool flips and tricks, and gave it a try. 10 minutes in we try this move where he throws me up over his head and I (am supposed to) land on my feet on the other side, but I freaked out and leaned forward, and fell hands first with my arms outstretched. I couldn\u2019t actually move my arms, but it didn\u2019t really hurt so I was like \u201cEh, let\u2019s try again tomorrow. We can go back to your house and watch a movie.\u201d Which we did. And by that point I guess the shock had worn off and I was in SO MUCH PAIN so we went home where my dad told me he didn\u2019t want to take me to the emergency room since it was so expensive. So I sat alone on my couch the whole night, in too much pain to sleep, listening to the mice run around in the ceiling, until the morning when he took me to an urgent care and we found out I broke both my elbows. My friend thought I was never going to talk to him again, but a week later we started dating, four months after that we got engaged, and we\u2019ve now been married for almost 6 years. \n\nTL;DR: Tried to learn swing dancing, broke both my elbows, had no idea until the shock wore off, but it worked out cause I married the guy and we have a great life together.",
            "About eight years ago I experienced the most painful injury of my life. I had an accident with hot oil and my left hand in which I basically fried about 90% of my hand and a bit of my wrist. \n\nNeedless to say, this is not my \u201cTis but a scratch\u201d moment. The moment actually happened during my recovery. About a month after getting switched to outpatient care I had stepped out to smoke a cigarette but was not made aware of the shattered glass all over the porch that my roommates friends hadn\u2019t cleaned up yet. I stepped outside barefoot, lit up and just stood there smoking. \n\nAfter a couple minutes I realized everyone was quietly staring at me and I asked \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d One of them pointed at my foot and said \u201cuhh you\u2019re bleed dude...\u201d I looked down and didn\u2019t really see anything so I lifted up on of my feet to find a shard of glass about the size of a spoon stuck in my foot. I just quietly pulled it out of my foot, tossed it in the trash can we used as an ash tray and put my foot back down. Finished my cigarette and went back inside to clean up the wound. Never made a peep during the whole event and was later told I freaked out everyone that saw the whole thing because I never flinched or really seemed to acknowledge that it even happened.\n\nGranted, my hand still hurt A LOT so most other pain just never really registered in my head anymore. I have closer to normal reactions now but it\u2019s hard to react to pain the same after the whole deep fried hand thing.",

I'd say he is an advanced skier though and can go down pretty much any run.  That being said he is ripping down this blue(intermediate run) when he catches an edge and eats it.

I had the brief thought \u201cthis is it\u201d before I tried jumping to roll over the hood, but the car was too tall and it wasn\u2019t enough time. I got tossed 6 feet into the intersection and in the air I knew I was gonna be ok.

            "\u2022 In 98 during the ice storm that hit Montr\u00e9al hard, i was running around our glass living room table with the dog. My mother told me to stop, but I didn't. I eventually slipped and hit my face on the table.\n\nMy brother rushed outside and smashed some ice off our building and came back in to give it to my mother.\n\nThere was blood everywhere and the only thing that ended up being hurt was that part of skin on you upper gum that connects to your lip.\n\nI don't have that anymore ahha.\n\n\u2022When I was around 7 or 8 I stepped on a 3 inch rusted nail. Went straight into my heel but didn't hit bone. Was brought to the hospital where it was removed cold turkey, they cleaned it, cautorised it and gave me a tetanus shot.\n\n\n\u2022 Around that same age, caught my finger in the car door when going to burgerking with mom, only noticed when I felt my hand holding me back. You know, the kind of car back then that you had to go in the driver door to unlock the back doors..\n\nLost my nail, first phalange of my finger was dislocated and put back in place by a Dr that was actually in the drive-through and still have a scar on my right index to this day.\n\n\n\u2022I also sprained 3 fingers playing basketball in high-school. Just badly caught a rebound and voil\u00e0.\n\n\n\u2022 Had a bad scooter accident when I was 14 and tore up my left arm real bad, my left hip and thigh as well. Should have gotten stitches but I refused and put on a strong girl face in front of my parents.\n\nCleaned the horrible wound, we could see visible bone in my elbow. Took out the rocks, although I didn't do it quite well as I can still feel some 14 years later haha. Ended up putting a badadge on it and went to the local fair. When I arrived, it was soaked in blood, as the paramedics on site for a new bandage and they put it on for me.\n\nOnce I got home that night, I wanted to change the bandage BUT, my skin had started healing over the bandage.\n\nI soaked my arm for what seemed like for ever and my brother held me down while my mom tried to gently rip the bandage out/off. \n\n\u2022 Around the age of 15-16 i used to climb on the roof of closed stores with my friend in winter and we would jump down into a snowbank and repeat.

Proceeded to cut the fatty part under my right thumb..\n\nBlood everywhere, I was lightheaded and could see the fat as well. \n\nSat in the bathroom with a towel wrapped tight around my hand for a while, hand over my head to try and slow the bleeding.\n\nIt disn't work. Ended up calling the ambulance and asked for skin glue that they have due to a gnarly cut. \n\nThey cleaned the still bleeding wound, glued it and put a bandadge on.\n\nThey took my vitals and gave me a waiver to sing as I didn't want to go to the hospital.\n\n\n\u2022 Last one for the road. Was during my mechanic apprenticeship. I was trying to unwedge the bolts stuck in rust that were preventing me from changing the suspension that was overdue on the car. \n\nAfter going at it for a while, with wd40, a torch it eventually came loose.\n\nBUT I was NOT expecting that, forcing as hard as I could. My right shoulder, upper arm were badly cut by the nasty rusty sharp frame and my knuckles hit the front par of the NON-EXISTENT wheel-hub. \n\nNothing broken, just oozing blood and had to get an other tetanus shot as my previous one was overdue.\n\n\nVoil\u00e0, a few moments from my weird and clumsy life.",

He claimed to have super powers: teleportation, DBZ like energy creation and what not. All the girls said he would he just stare at them if they had class with him. He hung around us freshmen and did his best to \"flirt\" with the girls. For an example of his \"flirting\" he once told a girl that while astral projecting, he saw her face on Jupiter.

He looked liked he belonged in 3rd grade (he never got any taller). It didn't help that he always wore a child's goosebumps jacket, that made people start calling him goosebumps. He was even more \"convinced\" of his powers than his brother, but at least he was less sexually creepy, but that's all he had going for him. One memorable day i was in math class, and he started shaking violently, people ignored him, so he started flapping his arms around. Wondering if this was an actual seizure the girl next to him put her hand on him and asked if he's ok, he growled back \"take your hand off me, this power is too much to contain!\" She started yelling at him for faking a seizure and he went back to normal death stare foward grumbling about his powers.",

He gets about halfway through the song before one of the teachers realises it isn't a joke and gets up on stage to drag him out. \n\nEveryone is just sitting there going wtf- half the kids don't know the song and the other half is wondering why he chose it to ask someone out. \n\nTurns out the girl he was asking wasn't even in the auditorium yet so didn't hear his little number. He got detention for a week for being 'disruptive' but since then we just call him Jumper as a joke but then it stuck and I don't think anyone in our friend group has used his name since then.

Now, this girl was odd, she wore all black clothes that were clearly not washed very well. She had bright ginger hair and would hair HUGE spiky plastic jewelry that was usually bright orange. Like big spiky plastic necklaces or bracelets. She would pick her nose aggressively in class kind of girl.\n\nAnyway.. I asked some of the other girls if they knew what the tally in her notebook was about, and they said that she was counting the amount of times she had successfully taken a piss while standing up. I don't know about you, but i found this fascinating, I started casually following her one day on our field trip in Spain and sure enough.. she would find somewhere she thought was discreet.. (it wasn't discreet i saw everything).. she would take her pants fully off then take a mean piss standing up, the whole time with a demonic smile on her face, shit was scary. Then shed put her pants back on, get out her notebook to add another tally mark, then saunter off into the Spanish wilderness to do more Geology. It was almost as disgusting as it was mesmerizing.\n\nSo.. one day we had a day off to relax and do what we wanted, so everyone agreed we would go to Madrid for the day, so we all get on a big coach and set off. The drive is like two hours. 30mins in, she starts mumbling to herself about needing the toilet, everyone around her going quiet as she became more agitated. Eventually she jumped up and waddled down the isle to ask the driver to stop. After a bit of arguing and Spanish shouting from the driver, we pull over. \n\nThe bus doors open, she walks back up the isle and gets off using the door half way down the bus. She takes three steps away from the door and starts digging a hole like a fucking badger in heat. Now at this point I think deep down I knew what was about to happen, she's about to take a massive piss right here in front of everyone as the ultimate win/fuck you to her classmates she clearly hated.. but boy I was wrong. \n\nShe finished digging her hole, it was quite impressive given how dry the ground was.. she turned herself away from the bus, dropped her trousers and took a squat over the hole.. what is this, I thought? Maybe she's too shy for a stand up piss.. nope. Out comes the most horrific shit from her pasty white asshole. Like gallons of it, I've never seen so much. The hole she dug, whilst impressive was not sufficient for the brown mass that spewed forth. She finished, wiped her ass with a small piece of tissue she had in her pocket and got back on the bus.. with the same maniacal grin I saw her have with the wild piss.\n\nEveryone was silent, our professors just staring at each other, clearly thinking \"what the fuck just happened, Jim. Did that girl seriously just unleash a turd tsunami in front of 40 people\". The rest of the journey was just silence, I think we were all in shock. We get to Madrid and everyone slowly gets off the bus, shit girl starts saying again that she needs the toilet and everyone turns to look at her. Her bright orange trousers are soaking wet.. like shed been swimming. One of the other students said \"Jesus Christ, what the hell happened?\" \n\nAnd casually as anything.. she turns to him and says \"The bus ride was too long, I pissed myself\" ... \"a few times\".. \n\nAt this point Im losing my mind, what the fuck lady. You stopped the bus so you could decimate the landscape, you couldn't have pissed then? you might as well have, I mean everyone saw your massive dump i don't think a quick piss would have bothered anyone. Seriously. \n\nAnyway, two girls took pity and carted her off to a public toilet. the rest of us went to a few museums and had a great day but, it was hard to enjoy to be quite honest. Madrid's Natural History Museum didn't have the same jovial atmosphere after watching a grown woman shit and piss herself.",

The weird kid was this kid with a thick accent who constantly talked about his favorite porn and always had a tab of hentai open on his phone at all times. So this weird kid got mad at the annoying kid because he stole his phone and texted his mom a bunch of sexual things, which resulted in the weird kid stealing the annoying kids ipad pro and emailing a bunch of hentai pages and curse words to his mom. Except, it wasn't his mom. It was his mom's boss, client, and coworker. Both these kids spent a whole day yelling at eachother and flat out breaking down in the lunchroom.

            "I went to 7th grade (roughly age 11/12) with a kid called Josh who was always a little different from the rest of us. \n\nThere were a lot of bullies at that school, and since Josh was a ginger, sometimes he got singled out. But instead of withdrawing and hiding like I did, he did crazy shit. \n\nHe would fold his upper lip down so his front row of teeth stuck out, then bug out his eyes and speak in a high chipmunk voice. He once chased me around the room with a pair of scissors trying to cut my hair. He was obsessed with Itchy and Scratchy and would quote them all the time. He wrote \u201cShut Up\u201d on his eyelids with a pen and blinked at all the teachers. When we dissected a frog, our teacher made the mistake of telling us that the eyes would bounce. Everyone looked immediately at Josh, who grinned, bounced an eye off the table, and ate it. \n\nBut his most infamous trick was Bear Bear Kill Kill. I don\u2019t know where the phrase came from, but it was one of those things he said whenever he wasn\u2019t getting enough attention, and it meant something crazy was about to happen. \n\nOne day, probably the scissor chase day, we were winding down for the end of the day. Josh had been oddly quiet, so we hadn\u2019t really been paying any attention to him. Then one of the kids screamed, and we turned around to see blood dripping off his arm. He had taken a pair of (blunt) school scissors and had painstakingly carved \u201cBear Bear Kill Kill\u201d into his forearm without any of us noticing. I don\u2019t remember what the teacher did, which also disturbs me as this incident should have set off a flurry of activity. After that, the incident was never mentioned again. Josh showed up with a bandage the next day, and things continued. \n\nAfter that year, I was moved to a different school for unrelated reasons, and I never saw Josh again. A year later, I heard that he had moved to Kentucky to live with his much older brother. His mom had died when he was born, so it was just his dad taking care of him. His dad was a doctor and worked all the time, so Josh rarely saw him. One day, his dad didn\u2019t show up or call in to work. No one could get him on the phone. His office called the police, and when they arrived, they found Josh still asleep. In their infinite wisdom, they decided to make Josh go into his dad\u2019d bedroom to check on him. Josh walked in to discover his father in bed, dead of a surprise heart attack. \n\nI remember we all talked about Josh in hushed tones like he was some kind of legend. It wasn\u2019t until I was older that I started to wonder whether his craziness was just his way of dealing with a chaotic and lonely life. I try to look him up on Facebook periodically, but I\u2019ve yet to find him. \n\nHope you\u2019re okay, Josh.",
            "Ok, so in elementary school there was this guy called Eduardo, he was a funny mexican guy and we called him lalo.\nLalo always had a bad breath, but a particular smell that I still can remember, it was sour and not as disgusting as you may think, but it was unpleasant.\n\nThe kids in my group used to reffer to him as \"sour mouth\" because of this.\nMaybe it was his diet or God knows what kind of buccal infection he had, but he was known for that.\n\nLast time I checked him on facebook and now he is a bodybuilder, good for him I guess.\nI wonder if he managed to solve his breath problem.",
            "So this involved two. The first we'll call \"Rodger\" and the second we'll call \"Nathan\". Rodger had a tendency to wear a trench coat to school every day and a fedora. He would even wear shorts with his trench coat and never seemed to understand how that could make him look like a flasher. Nathan on the other hand grew his hair out very long and never washed it. One day in band Rodger (trumpet) was behind Nathan (trombone) and kept loudly trumpeting next to Nathan's ear. Nathan yelled at Rodger to stop which prompted Rodger to blow as loud as he could in Nathan's ear. Nathan wheeled around and struck Rodger with his trombone. Rodger leapt (trench coat and all) over a chair and wielding his trumpet proceeded to clash with Nathan's trombone.  This swashbuckling scene of musical violence continued for a minute or two while they screamed at each other and the band teacher yelled at them to stop. Eventually they calmed down after one of their mutual friends yelled at them that they might be kicked out of the after school Yugio club.",

It was sort of a line dance where one group would line up in a row and pretend like they were playing pinball, and another would come up behind them and pretend to stab them in the back.\n\nIt was performed at a school dance, right in front of the stage while the kid's father, a teacher at the school, was chaperoning. I didn't see it happen unfortunately. \n\nThe stabber's name was Lance--which is kind of funny if you think about it.",

            "So one of the more grave things that happened in my school  (from 6 years to 12 years).  \n(not english, so bear with me)\n\nBecause our school was mixed and to keep things fair, boys couldn't put off their T-shirts, even when it was blazing hot.       \nBut one day, a certain kid named Jimmy Cavalier that didn't care much for rules, decided that he wasn't going to wear that bloody t-shirt when he was playing soccer under the hot sun.  \nSo he went naked.  \n\n\nMarie, the overseer to the playground, spotted this.     \nShe was known for being very strict with the rules and yelling at kids for not obeying her \"rule of terror\".     She also had a whistle, which she would vehemently use in her quest for rule and order.  \nSo, as she does, she started blowing that thing and caught the attention of the whole playground to this specific situation with Jimmy.  \n\n\nThese two were complete antipoles and had butted heads before on many occasions.  \nBut in this occasion it was quite clear that Jimmy didn't want to take no crap from Marie.  \n\n\nIn defiance he ran away shirtless into the buildings of the school, cartoonishly followed by Marie who shouted he needed to come to her.     \n\n\nNow, you have to know that our school hallway had windows that provided a view from the playground.  \nSo we could see run Jimmy towards his class.   Marie lagged behind maybe 10 to 15 metres.  \nWe were not sure what was going to happen, but then Jimmy checked his book bag for something we couldn't notice.     \n\n\nSeconds later we saw Marie making a quick 180 and running away followed by a fuming Jimmy, that had apparantly reached for his box full of marbles.     \n\n\nNow, most kids had glass marbles, but not Jimmy.    Because his dad was in mechanics pretty much his entire collection consisted of metal bearing balls ...    \nAnd you'd think they were probably small ones.  \nBut not Jimmy's ...    \n\n\nLong story short, Jimmy got suspended for life, later got into drugdealing and got killed in a bad deal several years later.  \nThat guy was crazy talented.   He could draw an entire landscape in perfect detail by just looking at it for a few minutes.      \nBut he just did not comply.      \nA contrarian amongst contrarians.  \n\n\nSometimes I think that guy could have been the greatest artist of our little country, but I found out later his situation at home was really crappy.  \nAnd that day he went completely over the edge.      \n\n\nI'll never forget this.    It's a tragic start to the downfall of Jimmy, who was actually a good friend of me at that time.    A GREAT mind.  \nHe told me stuff I didn't understand for years to come.\n\nRIP Jimmy",

Couldn't tell it was a bear until it stood up and the motion light turned on. It was standing over 6 foot tall between us and the cabin. It fell forward onto it's front feet, huffing. It made a noise like a dinosaur. Who shit my pants??\n\nWithout a sound, my lazy shit dog launched an attack from behind the bear. \n\nI'm tearing up thinking about it. I ran the kids into the cabin, grabbed the rifle and spent the next five minutes running through dark woods, trying to follow the sounds of my growling dog and a furious bear. The growling stopped and I could hear the bear running off through the woods.\n\nMy dogs name is Daisy. She's an English bull terrier. She was 15 years old at the time. It took two hours to find Daisy after the bear ran off. She had what looked like road rash along her sides, her hip was broken and her leg was crushed. She was curled next to a tree with her tail thumping the ground. Her white fur all shades of red and pink.\n\nThis dog is afraid of the Swiffer. I love her so much. \n\nI owe Daisy 3 lives, fuck 5 years.",

My time is over, I gave my years to you so that you might enjoy life, I don't want them back. \n\nThis is how I think dogs would look at it if given the chance.

            "When I was a teenager, my family lived in a big 115 year old brick house. Plenty of creepy stuff happened but one night I was heading to bed when the door between the first floor kitchen and the basement stairs absolutely *SLAMMMMMMED* shut. It had a unique sound that I recognized immediately as the kitchen/basement door. \n\nThere were no windows open that could've caused a draft. Our dog was asleep on the second floor. I was on the second floor. My parents were both asleep in the third floor attic (had been converted to a master bedroom). \n\nNone of us could've shut the door. \n\nFuckin terrified, I worked up the courage to go investigate, carrying my hilariously teeny pocket knife for protection. As I went downstairs I turned on every light. \n\nWhen I reached the kitchen, the door was wide open.\n\nEven more freaked out I ran back up to bed (leaving the lights on). \n\nA minute or two later, I heard a definite \"sssshhhh ok ok\" from downstairs. \n\nI laid in bed and was ready to accept my demise. \n\nEventually I somehow feel asleep and in the morning I was there first downstairs (I woke up before my parents and dog) and found that the lights were all off and the basement door had been shut again.",
            "Weird but happy.  About 5 years ago in November we lost our family dog to cancer.  She was the dog my children grew up with, loved by all.  At the next Christmas, at the end of the day of gifts, food and family,  as I was picking up, I found a tiny pewter dog figurine sitting on the mantel.   I asked everyone who had been at the house that day if they left it.    No one had. Okay, weird, but took it as a good omen.  When my eldest went back to college at the end of that Christmas break, he asked if he could take the little figurine, to remember his dog.  Of course, I said yes.  A week or two later, picking up around the house, there was the figurine again!   I called my son, and said, \u201cYou forgot the dog figurine!\u201d He said, \u201cNo I didn\u2019t, it\u2019s right in front of me on my desk!\u201d  I had now found a second figurine!!  Again, no one claimed any knowledge of it.  No idea how....but I still have the two of them tucked away on a shelf to this day.",

            "I used to have a recurring dream as a teenager every night for months.\n\nI was sitting at a table on the patio of a restaurant, I was out there alone, waiting for my food. A homeless man comes up to the other side of the patio and asks for change. I'm digging in my wallet for a couple dollars and then I hear tires screech and look up to see a crash in an intersection near the restaurant. I run out there to see if I can help and as I run out into the road I get hit by a car and wake up at the impact.\n\nAfter a while the dream stopped and I put it out of my mind. Fast forward to me being 28 and sitting at an On The Border, on the patio waiting for my food. A homeless guy comes walking past the restaurant but doesn't stop and ask for change. It makes me think about that dream though and I start to feel uneasy. Shortly after, I hear the tires screech and I see a wreck happen in the intersection near the restaurant. I begin to run out there but stop at the sidewalk and look out towards incoming traffic and there is an SUV not slowing down. She was on her phone and blew through the intersection completely unaware of what had just happened. Ran out and checked on the people. Everyone was fine.",
            "This happened around 1991. It's the middle of the night. I'm standing in my sister's living room and it must be a full moon, because even though it's around 1am and the lights are off, I can see clearly. There's a mixing bowl with popcorn kernels in the bottom on the floor in front of the tv and some rental VHS in a pile nearby. I hear a noise and turn around to see my sister's normally very friendly labrador retriever looking like Cujo. Fangs bared, snarling, hackles raised. Suddenly there's a bright flash of light and I wake up like I hit the bed from a great height. I think \"That was a weird dream.\" Eventually, I fall back to sleep and in the morning I call my sister,  planning to tell her the story, but she preempts me by telling me about the weird thing that happened in the night. \n\nThey woke up to the sound of the dog snarling at about 1am. Her husband thought there was a prowler in the house, got a gun and went to find the dog. She was standing in the living room snarling at the middle of the room. He couldn't see anyone, so he flipped on the light. No one was there, the dog instantly stopped snarling and walked to her bed like nothing had happened. He checked the property and went back to bed.\n\nWe talked a bit and I found out they watched some rental movies and \"Of course we had popcorn, why?\" My sister is a little woowoo at times, so I decided not to tell her about my night.  She lived about 450 miles away by the way.\n\nEdit: punctuation.",
            "I wouldn\u2019t say that this was creepy, but it\u2019s definitely one of the most quaintly surreal things I\u2019ve ever experienced:\n\nSo, back in 2016, I was injured at work and for about six months my life consisted of going to physical therapy and being confined to bed until I could walk again. With that in mind, I had a lot of time to read books. One of the books that I was reading was \u201cEx-Heroes\u201d, by Peter Clines.\n\nNow I don\u2019t know about anyone else, but when I read a book I like to \u201ccast\u201d the characters in my head, coming up with how they look. One of the minor characters in this book was named Ilya and, because I know someone named Ilya, and because the book is set in Los Angeles where I live, the Ilya in the book became the Ilya that I knew in my imagination. But then, something strange started to happen. The Ilya in the book made specific references to movies like \u201cAliens\u201d, a movie which the Ilya I know is a huge fan of. The Ilya in the book was a big fan of firearms, as the Ilya that I know is. Put into words, these details seem slim, but there was something so strange about the character in this book that I eventually reached out to the Ilya that I knew to ask about it.\n\nTurns out that Ilya knows the author, Peter Clines, who had put him in the book! What are the odds that I would choose to buy a random book, with a story that takes place essentially on my street in Los Angeles, and features *someone I know in real life* as a minor character? That blew my mind, and it\u2019s easily one of the most surreal experiences I\u2019ve had.",
            "I\u2019ve told this story before. \n\n3 years ago my childhood dog died very suddenly and unexpectedly. She was sick for a few days,  but turned it around and got better before dying very quickly and painfully, in my dads arms. \n\nI live out of state so I wasn\u2019t able to be there for any of it. (It\u2019s a 6 hour drive) and I felt very very guilty about her passing without me there. I had a very deep connection to her and she had been my best friend for 12 years. \n\nI was devastated by her death, I couldn\u2019t work or eat or do much of anything.  I was constantly bursting into tears....it was just awful. My heart just ached and I found myself apologizing to her for not being there....I just felt so guilty. \n\nOne night I had a dream about her. I dreamt I was in this empty space and Charli came running up to me, whimpering excitedly. She was licking my face and generally just freaking out and I was sobbing. I knew she was dead and I knew she was visiting me in my dream. I was very aware of it all. I kept hugging her and crying and apologizing and she just kept licking my face and being affectionate. \n\nI woke up with tears streaming down my face and sat up in bed. I could still smell her distinctive smell and on my sleeve I pulled off one of her hairs. She had never been to my apartment and I hadn\u2019t seen her recently. It wasn\u2019t a cat hair either as Charli was a collie mix and their fur pattern is very distinctive. \n\nIt may all be coincidence but it was SO vivid and real. I like to think she was visiting to let me know everything is okay and to not worry. I haven\u2019t had a dream like that since.",
            "Not my story, but my Grandpa's. So he served in the Navy and hadn't come home for five years. He finally got to go home, and on his way, he saw his old friend, let's call him Wally. Wally was getting on his normal bus, and my Grandpa shouted \"Hi!\" To him. But Wally didn't respond. But he didn't think much of it, seeing how Wally didn't have the best hearing. Wally got on his bus, and looked my Grandpa in the eye as the bus drove away. Later, after he got home and was talking to his dad, he asked him how Wally was doing and told his dad about how he saw him earlier. His dad was silent for a minute, and asked him if he was *sure* he saw Wally. My grandpa said yes, and his dad replied,\n\n\"Wally died six months ago.\"",

            "This summer I bought my girlfriend a last-minute birthday trip to go kayaking around the San Juan Islands off the Washington state coast. After a long drive and ferry trip, we found the tour group of about 20 people and were then shuffled into a shuttle van for a ride to the beach.\n\nNow, my girlfriend has a unique name similar to the name of a famous painter. Let's say it's Rebecca Warhol just for fun (it's not). She's a little ray of sunshine, and started chatting with the middle aged woman sitting next to her on the shuttle as we waited to leave. The woman noted that she had always loved the name Rebecca, as it was her mother's name. They made pleasant small talk in the van until the tour guide passed around the sign-in sheet for all of us to fill out. That's when things got strange.\n\nMy girlfriend wrote her full name on the sheet and passed it on to the woman, who immediately shouted \"Oh my God,\" and started crying. After a few minutes of total confusion, she told us \"Rebecca Warhol was my mother's full name, and these islands were her favorite place in the world. She passed away this summer from cancer and we've traveled hundreds of miles to spread her ashes here.\" We were STUNNED. I literally picked a random date, time, and tour company, and THEN we were split into the same group as this woman AND my girlfriend was sitting right next to her on the shuttle. What the hell? She continued by saying, \"My daughter told us that Nana Rebecca would be with us on this trip, and I didn't believe it until now.\" It was the most unbelievable coincidence we had ever experienced, and has totally convinced me that there's more to this world than we think. As my brother later said, the Universe winked at us that day.",

            "I shared this a few years ago when this question was asked last time, and didn't really realize how \"glitchy in the matrix\" it was until people started commenting haha!\n\nIn college, I took a hard news/soft news journalism class where one of the assignments was to write an obituary for one of my grandparents. The professor told us to write it on a deceased grandparent, but if all of your grandparents were still alive we had to choose one. In my case, all of my grandparents were alive. I procrastinated actually doing the assignment until the night before it was due because it seemed like a morbid assignment (especially once all of my grandparents were still alive).\n\nScramming for an easy grandparent to write about, I gave my mom a call and asked her for some basic biographical information about my maternal grandfather. As we were talking about my grandpa's career, my mom couldn't recall the name of one of the companies he worked at. She lectured me about waiting until the last minute to write the assignment because it was late -- 10:30pm my grandpa's time. However, she said she would give him a call to see if he was still awake and be able to answer that question once my assignment was due the following morning.\n\nWhen my mom called my grandpa, my grandma answered the phone in a panic. My grandma frantically explained that the paramedics had just arrived and were performing CPR on my grandpa because he had stopped breathing and lost consciousness. My mom was able to stay on the phone with my grandma until they took my grandpa to the hospital, where he was declared dead.\n\nIn the time my mom and I had been talking on the phone about my grandpa's \"obituary,\" he was dying. (His death was entirely unexpected at that. Although he was in his eighties, he was the healthiest of my grandparents at the time. We ended up using the obituary I wrote for that writing assignment as his actual obituary. Still freaks me out when I think about the timing.",
            "About two years ago, I went to collect my husband from the ferry after work. My husband got into the car and as I was driving very slowly out of the car park we both noticed two people standing a few metres in front of our car. It looked as though they were strangers, older looking professionals, both walking to their separate cars in different areas of the car park. The man was reaching into his side bag and the lady was further ahead than the man, with her head turned to the right. I know the exact positions they were in because they were completely frozen on the spot! My husband and I sat there watching the frozen strangers, not saying anything to each other and then all of a sudden it was like someone pressed play and the two strangers just continued on like nothing had happened. My husband and I promised to each other that we would never forget how weird the experience was. I can't remember exactly how long they stayed frozen like that but it was long enough to freak us both out!",
            "1985. My ex wife and I were sleeping. There was a small sliver of light coming in through the window from a streetlight, so the room and bed were dimly visible. Our black Pomeranian was at the end of the bed asleep. \n\nI dreamt that I woke up, reached down to pet him, and he turned into a glossy black bivalve/oyster thing which opened up to reveal rows of gleaming glass teeth. I woke up to my ex backpedalling up the bed over the pillows towards the wall. \n\nI asked \"what's wrong??\" She said, \"what is that shiny black clam thing with the teeth at the end of the bed??

            "Every night I go to bed about two hours before my husband. I always wake up when he comes into the room. One night he was gaming with a friend and it was hours later I heard him sneak into the room and crawl across the floor so he could pop up and scare me. I felt the floor kind of shake and felt him bump clumsily against the side of the bed in the dark. I held out my hand and asked him not to scare me, I was already scared enough and begged him to just take my hand and come to bed. I couldn\u2019t see anything in the room, but knew he was there and just waited for him to jump up so I could move on and go back to sleep. That\u2019s when I heard him talking to his friend in the other room. I was frozen. I know there\u2019s sleep paralysis or lucid dreaming or something that explains this, but I would have sworn on my sons life that someone had crawled across the floor and jostled the bed. \n\nEventually I worked out of the fear enough to grab my phone and text my husband to come in and turn on the lights and check under the bed. But holy shit, it boggles me how real it felt.\n\nETA: thank you for the silver! It\u2019s my first. \n\nThank you to everyone who\u2019s confirmed sleep paralysis, kind of comforting to have that as the answer, maybe if it happens again that knowledge will help. \n\nAlso, it was likely inspired by watching Markiplier play Don\u2019t Open Your Eyes.

We all crash in the basement.\n\nR (friend who came with me) and I got up at the same time. Not like one after eachother, we both got up at the same time after being asleep for a few hours and rushed to the bathroom.\n\nR was more athletic than me (probably still is) and beat me there. I ran upstairs, barely getting my head over the toilet before puking my guts out. R was doing the same thing in the basement. I was wearing a wooden cross my grandmother mailed me from Romania (I'm not religious but I appreciated the gift as I had never met her at that point). Cross somehow became detached from the cord, fell on the tile and broke into two pieces. \n\nSo we both call our respective mothers and get picked up. By now it's like 3-4am.\n\nFelt sick up until we left the house. Once I was in the car and a few blocks away, felt perfectly fine.\n\nR reported the same thing to me that day over MSN Messenger. Felt perfectly fine after a few blocks.\n\n\nGot the pictures developed a few weeks later. Theres a picture of us on the couch rocking some Halo and the whole room looks like it's filled with mist. Super spooky. I've been looking for the pic for a long time and I can't seem to find it anymore, but every few years my sister and I search my mom's photo albums for it.",
            "Two things. Each was witnessed by at least one other person and both were while driving. Once at a stop sign in a neighborhood. All of these little sparkles started swirling around in mid air roughly 3-4 ft off the ground out of nowhere. The group of them were roughly 2 ft wide by 3-4 ft tall. It lasted 3-5 seconds and then they were gone. No one was around and when I asked my passenger if he saw it too he breathed a sigh of relief and said yes. We spoke about it a little more but there is no reasonable explanation. The second happened when myself and 3 friends were driving down an empty country road. Very straight stretch. A man on a bike appeared. Someone said to watch out for him, so not to hit him and then he disappeared. Our minds were blown to say the least. Just \u201cpoof\u201d and he\u2019s gone.",

Through the stairs there was an elevator shaft that had these wide bars where you could stick your arm in them, typical old elevator design. So one night, they decided to go to the basement to do another ouija session, and I decided to drop a cup of glass through the shaft, just to scare them off. I let go of the cup, saw it vanish into the darkness, and I never heard the cup hit the ground.\n\nI stood there, confused. Next day, I went downstairs at the basement with one of my friends, and the cup was there, placed in the middle of the elevator shaft floor. The cup was upright, and intact. I was seriously freaked out by that, because it would be impossible to someone enter the elevator shaft and place the cup there like that. The cup should have broken into pieces since I threw it from the 10th floor against a cement floor.",

I see it approaching and decided to watch it for a bit.  It was quickly getting closer, and it was about to pass right by me.  However, there was a large SUV waiting to turn out of the parking lot and onto the road, blocking a few meters of the road from my view.  The ambulance passed behind the SUV, probably about 50 feet away from me at most, and I vividly remember the siren becoming completely silent in that instant.  The ambulance had vanished entirely as it passed behind that SUV.\n\nI was so confused.  The road did not have many cars on it at the time, and it was broad daylight. I did a triple-take and made sure that I didn\u2019t just miss it. I had a clear view of the road going both directions, and there was no more ambulance to be seen. No more siren either.

            "So, this might be hard to explain. I was probably 12, and lived in a big log cabin. One day while my parents were at work, I got in a fight with my brother (18) who had some anger issues. He chased me through the house and I ran out one door, around our porch and in through another door. I was going to lock it behind me but didn't have time because he was too close behind me. So, I slammed the door behind me and kept running. When I glanced back to see if he had made it through the door yet, he was banging on the window of said door and yelling for me to unlock it. The door was locked and there was no he had locked it, because the door could only be locked from the outside with a key (of course), and our parents never gave us keys. There was also no way the door could have accidentally locked when I slammed it behind me, because it needed to be fully turned to lock, and usually required some finagling at the end to make it actually lock. I stood there dumbfounded for a few seconds and then ran to a bathroom and locked myself in there. Definitely feel that saved me that day.\n\nEdit: The door only had a deadbolt, which could only be locked from the outside with a key, but from the inside you had to turn the knob. Suppose I worded that in a confusing way.",
            "This didn't happen to me, but to my mother and aunt when they were younger, and to this day is the creepiest thing I've ever heard.\n\nSo one day when they were around 16 years old they were alone in the house for a couple of hours while their mother was out working. I don't remember exactly which one of them noticed this but one of them walked into the kitchen and was shocked to find that the stove had somehow been ripped open all the way into the oven. My mother described it as is someone had stabbed the top of the oven, slashed it, and then pulled that slash open with their hands.\n\nBoth of them saw it and when I asked my aunt about this story she gave me the same description. Also, this was definitely not a visual hallucination because they swear they reached with their hand from inside the oven to the top through the hole.  They both swear they were sober at the time and I believe them because they were raised in an extremely religious environment so it's impossible they were drunk or high.\n\nWhen my grandmother got home they naturally went to show her the slash, only to find it was completely gone. The stove was completely normal and there was no sign of a hole ever being there.\n\nThis experience is probably the only reason why I'm not completely sceptical about the supernatural. I've got other personal experiences of this sort but they all can be explained rationally one way or another in a way that makes complete sense, but this story is way beyond me.",

            "When I was 14 (1995) during the eerie calm before a summer lightning storm, my dog Daisy, (Chow Lab Mix) started barking at the corner of the basement. There was nothing to bark at. Just stone fireplace and a tile floor. Suddenly a lamp set above the fireplace had the lightbulb explode and a painting hung next to it shattering as it flew off the wall at an almost 90 degree trajectory, landing ten feet from the wall. My brother and I have theorized for years what it was. Our best guess is that lightning hit the chimney and that's what did the damage. We've never been able to figure out how our dog knew it was about to happen...",

I looked up and didn't see anything, so I shrugged it off as just my imagination. I turn back to the street and take a few steps forward when I hear something smash into the place that I had been standing. I turn back and see a huge icicle shattered on the ground, the type that could have been used as a club. There were no icicles hanging from the roof when I looked up before. I have another experience kind of like this, I will comment it under this.",

            "A minor one but why not.\n\nMy wife and I are space nerds, so we follow pretty much all news regarding space travel. Of course, we're all hyped AF (if skeptical) about the whole Starship thing. And the glitch is exactly about that thing.\n\nAbout 3 years ago, SpaceX YT channel posted [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qo78R_yYFA) vid, showcasing the first iteration of their Mars craft. I watched it on like day 2, with my wife sitting behind me, eyes wide and in absolute awe. We finished watching, I turn back - and see that incredilous look on her face.\n\n\"But we already watched this... Some three weeks ago\"\n\nI look at the posting date - nope, nada, it was definitely 2 day ago. I do a quick search in YT  and Chrome history, going all the way to the beginning of the year - obviously, no trace. I even check the internet and ITS (as Starship was called back then) was not even revealed 3 weeks prior, at least not in any video published by SpaceX or any other official site.\n\nThen she starts going through things I apparently said back then, during that previous watching, up to quoting my exact words - some of which sound pretty similar to what I thought while watching the vid (but definitely didn't speak aloud, as I was too stunned and awe-struck).\n\nAt this point I recall that at 2:40 timemark, she had said something along the lines of \"Look, now it's going to deploy panels, it looks so funny\" - and the scene happens then, a few seconds after her remark. So either she actually saw the vid before me, or guessed the moment, based on what was being shown in the vid.\n\nWe chalked that up to either her watching it a day prior, just after it got uploaded, and forgetting about it, or an actual harmless glitch (I actually believe in glitches, kinda in a Pratchettesque manner of 'things just happen - what the hell').",
            "This just happened today.\n\nMy daughter (4) was playing in her room on the second story. I was two rooms away, playing my guitar. Very loudly, I heard my daughter screaming \"daddy come to the guest bedroom, I want to show you something!\" This immediately seemed off. We have an extra bedroom, but I had never heard her call it that before. While she also has pretty good speech, this was amazingly clear.\n\nWhen I walked around the corner, into the bedroom to see what she wanted, I saw two little legs sliding out the window. I jumped across the room, and grabbed my daughter by her ankle before she could fall out.\n\nAfter a not great moment where I yelled at her, then hugged her, then yelled again, then apologized for yelling and hugged her, I finally calmed down. We had a talk about why we don't play in windows. While I was putting the window back together (she had pushed and popped out the storm and screen window from the bottom) I asked her what she wanted to show me. \n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"What do you want to show me? You asked me to come see something\"\n\n\"No I didn't daddy.\"\n\n\"Are you sure? You told me to come to the guest bedroom.\"\n\n(A little whiny now, and annoyed) \"No I didn't daddy!\"\n\n\"You didn't ask me to come to the 'guest bedroom' to see something?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Okay...\"",

            "I was a young boy of 5-6, I think, maybe 7, at summer camp. The supervisors took the kids to a swimming pool and we were all swimming there. One of the supervisors was throwing kids into the pool, we'd splash around, climb out, and get tossed in again, which was great fun. It was my turn to get thrown in, except I forgot to take a breath before I hit the water and went under pretty deep. Now I was underwater and I really had to take a breath and was fighting the urge to breathe. I lost and inhaled. I swear to fucking god, I'm not making this up but I somehow breathed air. I felt calmer and my lungs and body relaxed, just like I had taken a gulp of fresh air. I swam around underwater for a bit, just because it was so weird, but then I had the thought that maybe I shouldn't test or take for granted this thing that just happened, I should just count my blessings so I went up and surfaced. The rest of the day was normal and I never told anybody.\n\nI should mention that as a very young child, age 2-4, that I hallucinated a few times. Once I was walking down a hall in my house and I started floating in mid-air. If I thought about it, or questioned it, I'd start sinking, but if I just relaxed and accepted it, I could float again. That only happened to me once, but I would have dreams where the same dynamic would happen for many years. Those stopped around the time I hit puberty, I think.\n\nAnyway, I don't know what happened that day in the pool. My first thought at the time was that it was another hallucination, but the part I don't understand is why I so desperately needed to breathe \\*before\\* the hallucination happened, and why I was so relaxed and calm and not panicky as if I had actually breathed afterward. I even stayed underwater for a bit. It was pretty surreal.",

            "Almost 5 years ago, my husband passed away very suddenly. I slept on the couch for a few weeks because I couldn\u2019t bear to go into the bedroom. One day my best friend called and said she\u2019d had a dream about him. In it, he asked her if I found the letter. She asked me what that meant and I said I didn\u2019t know. That week I decided to reclaim my bedroom and pack up some of his things. He was a mess to live with and had piles of clothes all over his side of the bed. As I bagged them up, a small folded piece of paper with my name on it caught my eye. I unfolded it and sure as shit, it was a letter from him. It was written specifically for me to read after he died and in it, he apologized for leaving me the way he did. Here\u2019s the kicker; his death wasn\u2019t suicide, he was a healthy 28 year old man and died in a way no one could\u2019ve predicted. I have many more stories of things that have happened around me since his passing and if anyone\u2019s interested I\u2019m happy to share.",
            "I've two that tie together.\n\nFirst when I was like 6 on an Easter Sunday I was at my grandparents Catholic Church and the priest would always have kind of a story time on the holidays with the kids. He'd have us come and sit all around the front of the church. Now I have a less popular biblical name (I think it is at least) and had never heard it said in Church before. So I'm playing with a plant on the side of the altar, with empty pews in front of me barely listening. When a lady I hadn't seen and didn't know says \"M\" listen to Father he's talking about the saint you're named after. Afterwards my grandmother was all excited and asked if I'd heard Father's lesson involving the saint. I told her \"yea the nice lady on that side of the altar told me he was talking about my name do we know her?\"  Everyone in the family laughed and said those pews were empty for the entire mass.\n\nStory two \n\n8 years later I'm getting ready to go stay at the same grandma's house. I left on my bike, with headphones and my cd player turned all the way up, to get books from the library and about a half mile from the house I hear a voice that's familiar but different tell me \"M you need your helmet on this journey.\" I listened and rode back to grab my helmet. \n\nAlmost to the library I went to cross a small side road and looked back at the same time a car started to turn into the road. I slammed my brakes and went over the bars landing on my helmet and the car stopping a foot away from me being underneath. Vehicle behind him was an off duty EMT that called the squad cause he didn't see my helmet when I went over. It took 45 minutes for my dad to get there through the massive traffic jam I caused but the officers and EMTs all agreed that had I not been wearing that helmet I would not have survived that impact with only scrapes and a shattered wrist. \n\nI'm convinced that those voices both times were the same entity. I don't know what she is but I'm glad as hell she was there. I've never heard it again but I know I'd be dead or significantly changed if not for that.",
            "I\u2019ve posted about this experience a few times now; about two years ago I was driving up a short hill in the overtaking lane.  I was attempting to overtake a particularly slow car.  I was going far too fast, I absolutely knew this but was somehow fine with it.  Then I had a burst of adrenaline and decided to accelerate even harder to overtake the car, before the overtaking lane merged back into one lane.  Sometimes I don't think I was successful.  I think after I crested the hill I was two abreast in the now single lane.  A truck was in the opposite lane starting to come up to the hill and I think I hit it at the right hand side (the truck drivers left side) straight on, at considerable speed.\n\nI remember looking at the truck and thinking I'm going to hit it but feeling that that's ok, everything is going to be fine.  I think I saw the front of the truck hit and crumple the left side of my car, saw it come right up to my face then, for a second, nothing but black.  A moment later I was parked by a small factory type building about half a mile down the road.  I remember my skin feeling prickly and tingly and I felt the adrenaline whoosh out of my body.  I cut my journey short and just went home.\n\nNow, on occasion things just feel left of centre, the world just feels a little more gray and cold and I mean that literally and figuratively.  My family and friends seem absolutely the same and I'm very happy in my life but some things in the world just seem off.  \n\nThis seems absolutely ridiculous to say but sometimes I'll be in a place and I'll get an odd, uncomfortable feeling and then the place seems to flash to warmth and sunlight and happiness, it then goes back to this slightly off, grayer place.  I see the same physical place but for a while it seems much more beautiful.  I'll read an article or listen to the radio and I'll think that that's not how it's supposed to be, so I'll google it and sure enough I was wrong.  It's not all the time and it doesn't worry me, as I said my personal life is the same and I'm happy, it's the outside world that sometimes feels so off and so wrong.",

He gets on the bus and takes his seat. I wait for the bus to move, but it doesn't. The delay makes me curious so I look out to see if there is a reason. And I look out and see the kid walk from his front door, to the end of the driveway and wait for the driver to signal, wearing a navy blue jacket with purple stripes down the sleeves, he walks across, boards the bus, and takes the exact same seat.\n\nEvery single detail between the two moments were identical. the car in the driveway was in the exact same position, Clouds in the sky, the car who stopped for the bus, everything.\n\nThat family only has one kid...",

            "I've posted this before.\n\nI was living for three summers in a big old house that served as the Rectory (Church house) for a church where I was working. The Minister was in-and-out all summer, and I was also there to housesit while he was on vacation.\n\nAt the time I was really into sleep tracking apps, and particularly sleep-noise-recording apps to see if I could hear myself talking in my sleep.\n\nI ran it almost every night and never heard a single interesting thing. I barely snore, so I would hear the odd siren outside, the bed creaking as I rolled over, breathing, a fart, etc.\n\nOne morning when I was alone in the house (Minister on vacation)  and I opened the app to playback noises from the night before - all the usual stuff until the second to last recording.\n\nThe recording was from around 3:30/4 in the morning. You can clearly hear me breathing and that I am not rolling around or moving much. If I had rolled or gotten up the app would have recorded it as it was an old and creaky bed.\n\nSuddenly, as you hear me breathing, there comes the noise of three very distinct and unmistakable raps of knuckles on wood, followed by a two second pause, and the snapping of fingers.\n\n**tap...tap...tap......snap**\n\nIt was super unnerving especially because there was no evidence that it was me doing it.\n\nIt bothered me enough that I set the phone back down on the night stand and tried to recreate the noise from anywhere that I could reach while laying on the bed - the frame, the bedside table, the nearby bookcase, but I could never get it exactly or figure out what wood was being tapped on. Whatever the case, the noise was distant enough that it could not have come from anywhere that I could have reached while lying in the bed.\n\nI have never been prone to sleep walking, talking, or even getting up in the night to go to the bathroom, so I am quite certain it wasn't me.\n\nThis is something that has stuck with me and for which I have no answer.",
            "When I was around 4-8 years old, my older brother had a huge, white stuffed tiger. It must have been at least twice the size of me. For reasons probably related to this incident, I became scared of it one day and would never want to be near it. I would make my brother hide it in the closet at night so I could sleep.\n\nAnyway, one day the tiger was on the floor in my parents room. I walked through my parents doorway, and immediately spotted the tiger on the right. I stared at it for a few seconds, when suddenly the tiger's tail came to life and waved around in the air before patting the floor a few times. It then returned to the spot it was in. It looked exactly how a cat moves their tail. Of course I ran away, screaming, crying, etc. \n\nMy family insisted I was seeing things, but at the time I had never had a cat and had no idea cats move their tail like that. I have no doubt that tiger moved.",

            "I lived in a shared house while at university, and it was a freaking odd place. Things would go missing in plain sight and then reappear moments later. Not just small things like lighters but big things, jackets, plates, text books. We got so used to it we ended up accepting it. Everyone would leave the room for a minute and when you came back in whatever was missing would be right back wherever it last was.\n\nThe living room had a sliding door that gave access to the hallway. We were poor students so all the radiators in the hallways were always turned off and we only heated the bedrooms and communal lounge, so that door was always closed. Most nights the door would have a good rattle. We were all inner city kids and just put it down to passing busses. Until someone pointed out that we were out that we lived on a residential street, no busses, no trucks and the underground tube trains came nowhere near the place. \n\nThe neighbours came around one evening and very politely asked us to stop banging up and down the stairs late at night. That caused a uncomfortable moment when we apologised but mentioned we thought it was them banging up their staircase.\n\nThe weirdest moment was me in bed one night sleeping, waiting for my girlfriend to get back from a night out with her girlfriends. The bedroom door opened, and I felt the bed \u201cbow\u201d as she climbed in. I could feel the warmth of someone beside me but it didn\u2019t feel like A, I rolled over and there was no one there.

            "Around 2012, I traveled to a conference for work from Sacramento to Los Angeles with a co-worker for a couple days. We had some time to kill before boarding our flight back to Sac when I decided to roam the terminal for something to eat. After walking back and forth, I resorted to a random little counter for a pre made sandwich or something. I paid, and as the woman at the counter handed me the receipt she said \"Thanks, [my name]\"..\n\nThis moment seemed like an eternity, and I still remember the feeling of standing there stunned, but also questioning my intuition.

I looked in my hands to see if I was holding a debit card (did I pay with card? Nah...). I also scanned the damn receipt for my name. The words \"How do you know my name?\" were paralyzed on my tongue and nothing came out. That particular day was a hard day for me, as it was in memoriam to my father's sudden passing in 2005. \n\nI grabbed my sandwich and sat down next to my coworker and was like \"so something weird just happened.\" I explained it to her, as well as the importance of this day because of my father, and she had no doubt - a quirky lady - and said \"oh, I love that stuff. I believe it.\"\n\nI still try to cast doubt on myself to this day that something must have informed this stranger of my name. It just doesn't add up, right? Ultimately, though, what I trust is the sensational feeling of standing frozen stiff because of something unfolding  before me, no matter how little sense it makes. I think we've all had that feeling and have confidence in it more than we want to.",
            "I went to school with this kid who was raised Jewish but was definitely questioning his religion. One day in class he's telling everyone about the plot to this obscure Jewish movie and how ridiculous it was. I remembered him telling this to us verbatim, so I asked why he was telling us the same story he told us yesterday. He said he just watched it last night, so how could he have told us yesterday. I told him he did and finished the end of his story. He was pissed and said \"thanks for ruining my story, dick.\" And everyone agreed they hadn't heard it and I was an asshole. I just sat there confused, I know I hadn't watched an obscure religious themed film as I'm an atheist and my parents were non practicing Catholics. The only other person in my school who was Jewish was in the room and claimed to have watched it with him for the first time the previous evening, so he couldn't have told me about it.

            "There have been sooo many times that I\u2019ve had a dream and it turned out to be true. It happened when I broke my arm, the first day of middle school, and even simple things like when I saw a friend at a coffee shop were exactly like my dream. It\u2019s super freaky",
            "So this happened to me, when i was younger - about 17 or so - and to this day i still dont really understand what happened.\n\nSo there were four of us - we went to one of our friends place, where him and his family lived - they werent home. They lived in this old blacksmith, which was very nice, but also kind of .. dark, and.. well, a blacksmith but with the touch of a family living there.\n\nWe were up in his room, which was in the attic, smoking alot of weed. At one point i had too much, and i was like \"I need to ehr..\" and i just went down - had to get away.\n\nSo after trolling around the house aimlessly, getting more and more paranoid, i stumbled on alot of VHS tapes next to their tv ( yes, im old ) - i scanned through them and there it was.\n\nBack to the future 4. Yes, 4. The one that does not exist. Now, remember this was way back - there was no internet, i didnt know if it existed - how would i? I had seen the third one, but.. oh well - i put it in, and sat on the couch and watched it. I still today remember scenes from it ; they are not from the 1st, 2nd or third. After watching it, i still felt super stoned, and very paranoid - and i remember the movie not making alot of sense to me, which also heightened my state of paranoia. I had to get out, just get away.\n\nSo i walked outside the house; A small path led from their front lawn, out into a very dark, very lonely road. The road went left, or right. I remember walking up there, and knowing i had to choose a path. After what felt like a million years, i went right. I walked, and i just remember walking further into darkness, leaving it all behind (it was out in the country side) - and i walked and walked, until everything was dark.\n\nI could slowly feel the paranoia go away - my heart pounding less alarmingly for each step - and then, i saw it; a a dimly lit road up ahead, with a small house.\n\nAs i approached the house, i realised it was his house, and i was coming in from the left.\n\nI dont remember anything else from that point onward, at all.",
            "This is a long (not too long) one, tldr at the bottom \n\n\nSo I was cycling to work at about 8 am and there was quite a lot of traffic on the road. I stopped for a break in a bus shelter since it was raining and just sat there watching the traffic slowly moving and eventually I got bored and I couldn't leave since the wind had gotten worse and I would have been blown off the bicycle.\n\nI stayed there for what must have been about 15 minutes and the entire street just went silent. I looked around for a cause but there was none. Then the weather suddenly became clear and I don't mean the clouds went away to another place, they just stopped being there. In the space of 3 or 4 seconds, they just vanished.\n\nI looked back down and the f*cking traffic had disappeared. At this point I thought I had been unconcerned or something so I called an ambulance rather than risk this happening while I'm cycling. I got to the hospital and they checked me out and said I had nothing obviously wrong but they wanted to keep me under observation for a while. I was amazingly bored there so I checked my chart and it said it was Saturday f*cking Saturday. I was at the bus stop on Monday. 6 days of my life just disappeared.\n\n\n\nTL:DR 6 days of my life never happened.",
            "Outside my apartment window, there's a street in the near distance, with a pretty little house that stands out amidst the sea of unremarkable buildings. A house that's a very distinct, vivid, gorgeous yellow. The yellow you see in old Technicolor movies; the yellow of the Yellow Brick Road in the Wizard of Oz.\n\nOne day, I decided to walk down the street that the yellow house is on, to get a closer look\u2014only to see a vacant lot where it once was. But when I got back to my apartment and looked out the window, *the yellow house was still there,* in the exact same spot as the vacant lot.\n\nI was very intrigued by this phenomenon, which had to be some sort of optical illusion. Perhaps another street coincidentally had nearly identical buildings, and I had been misled down the wrong street. Or perhaps the yellow house was actually on a street *behind* the vacant lot, and only appeared to be built on the same street as the other buildings.\n\nOn a different day, I thoroughly checked all the streets in the general area\u2014only to find nothing. And of course, when I got back to my apartment and looked out the window, there it was, yet again: a vivid yellow house, that somehow only existed when viewed from my window.\n\nMy final conclusion was that it was literally some trick of the light\u2014perhaps it was a house with some kind of pearlescent paint, that only appeared as bright yellow when viewed from certain angles, such as the angle from my apartment window. I wasn't entirely satisfied with that explanation, but it seemed plausible enough, so I left it at that.\n\nUntil several years later.\n\nI happened to be walking down the street with the vacant lot, only to see it was no longer vacant. Construction was starting on a new building. I became worried that this new building would block the non-existent yellow house from my view, and it would then become *truly* non-existent\u2014at least as far as I would ever be able to tell. The prettiest building I could see would be gone from view, and the mystery would never be solved.\n\nBut my fears were unfounded. The construction site wasn't visible from my window. The yellow house still appeared to somehow be in the exact same place that the construction site actually was.\n\nI made a mental note to check on the progress of the construction site. When I did so sometime later, *what I saw left me frozen with fear.*\n\nWas I in a coma? Was I in a matrix simulation that had a severe glitch? Was I simply completely and utterly insane?\n\nI didn't know. I still don't.\n\nAll I knew was that I was now looking at a brand-new house.\n\nA brand-new house, that I had been looking at for years.\n\nA brand-new house, with a brand-new coat of paint: a very distinct, vivid, gorgeous yellow. The yellow of the Yellow Brick Road.",

            "You know, I never believed in ghosts, not really. I mean, sure, I was *open* to it, but I'm the kind of guy who likes proof. I annoyed my teachers and parents to death by always asking \"but why?\" I want a good, solid reason to believe something. But then I moved to Southeast Missouri and saw some shit. \n\nTwo things stand out. The first was my roommate having scratches in groups of three appear all over her when there was no one upstairs but her and I, and neither of our hands were anywhere near her back where they were appearing. The house was *definitely* an unsettling place to live and turns out the original owner, a sick fuck who molested a female relative (niece or daughter, record were unclear) was buried in the basement. He kept the girl in a closet and was very territorial of the house. I don't know how to explain it. That house has not had a steady occupant in a long time, though, and the owner has great difficulty renting it despite a cheap price and great location. It gives off such an unsettling vibe. Always feel like you're being watched. Lot of weird shit went down there, but that's the worst experience I had. I moved out shortly after. Fuck that noise.\n\nThe other was this blind curve on a backroad going to my MIL's house. Late night, tons of fog, deer and stupid drivers are common so I'm going slow. All of a sudden, off to my right, there's this swinging yellowish light. About the right height off the ground for someone to be standing there holding it. Problem is, no one was there. I pulled up level with it and in an instant, it was gone. Nothing to reflect my lights was there, and nothing to mimic the movement. I got out, searched, nothing. I even went back up the road a bit and drove down again to see if I could recreate it. Nothing.\n\nTurns out, two sisters died there. A rather well to do family owned land in the area in the boonies. Big estate, lots of acreage, nothing else around at the time. They took the curve too hard one night in their carriage and crashed. One sister died on impact. The other survived long enough to walk up and down the road, waving her lantern for anyone to see. They found her footprints all over in the morning, and her clutching the lantern. She was dead too. Locals have been known to see her lantern, but not her. Just that light, going back and forth. Sent chills down my spine when I heard that.",
            "Three things have happened to me I can't explain.\n\nLooked for two weeks for a phone number for a friend of mine in Germany who I hadn't spoken to for over a year.  Finally found the number, ran downstairs to call him.  No dial tone on the phone.  I said \"Hello?\" and my friend said \"Hello? I've been trying to call you for two weeks but I couldn't find your number until just now.\"  So he'd called me and I picked up the phone between the time the line connected and the phone rang for the first time.\n\nSomeone figure the odds on this one for me.\n\nWe were in Maui for about 2 weeks.  During that time we drove down to Hana, just driving around exploring.  We found an avocado tree which was dropping fruit everywhere, including on the road.  We picked up about a dozen of them and ate them as we went along our travels.  Before leaving the islands, we knew we had to go through agricultural inspection and we had one avocado left.  On the rental van shuttle we decided to offer the remaining avocado to the driver.  He said, and I quote \"Oh, thank you!  My tutu (grandma) said you'd be bringing me this avocado from her tree.\"  We asked him where his grandma lived, and he described the exact tree and the exact spot we'd picked it up.  We asked \"Is that your grandma's house?\"  He replied \"It was, but she died 20 years ago.  She told me in a dream last night you'd be bringing me the avocado from her tree.\"\n\nHow the hell do I explain that?  I'm a skeptic, but this shit is just beyond me.\n\nI grew up on a farm 10 miles west of the middle of nowhere, northern Wisconsin.  A flatbed truck from the 1930's - in pristine condition - pulled on the yard.  A gentleman in vintage 1930's garb hopped out of the cab and frantically said \"The mail lady just crashed into the bridge down the road and she needs help!\"  I ran inside, called 911, then took my ATV down to the bridge.  Sure enough, the mail lady was pinned inside her Chrysler K-car, which had crumpled up like tissue paper.  I learned the power of adrenaline, as I had the strength to rip the driver's seat (which was pinning her legs) right off the tracks.  Once the paramedics got there I went back to the farm.  I asked everyone if they'd seen the flatbed, but no one had.  My grandpa finally told me \"That sounds like old Bill - he died in a flatbed truck when he crashed in that exact same spot about 50 years ago.\"  He described Bill down to the ratty old hat, suspenders, and pin-striped shirt.\n\nMmm hmm.",

His surviving younger brother was P. About a month after D passed I adopted E because P was not doing well as an only cat. \n\nE is light orange. P is grey. \n\nWoke up in the middle of the night. P was asleep in the cat tree. E was in the saucer chair. \n\n......and D was on the end of the bed where he always slept. \n\nChecked to make sure I was awake. Looked at the clocks.

Pills and some whiskey on the dresser, ready to go, a note next to it signed and everything. \n\nBut then I saw Benvolio. \n\nHe was sitting next to an empty food bowl and was staring at me apparently hungry and waiting for the person he loved and trusted most to feed and play with him. So I got up real quick, fed him, and then sat back down to stare at what I planned to kill myself with. \n\nAnd then I just couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I cried. I cried a lot thinking about what would happen to him when I was gone and  how confused he would be when I didn\u2019t wake back up to feed him the next morning. So I didn\u2019t do it. \n\nI got black out drunk instead.

There were many times I imagined killing myself and one night I was set on doing it. Came home drunk and sad and started cutting myself, which was one of my methods for dealing with my emotions. \n\nI sat in my bed crying, trying to find the courage to cut deeper and end it. Then my dog Snoopy hopped up on the bed and put his head on my lap. Thanks to him doing that I realized that I just couldn't do that to him or to my parents and friends. He saved my life that night. \n\nThe next day I decided to open up to my parents and ask them to help me find some help, which was a huge step forward. Starting seeing a therapist and she really helped me work through a lot of things. Still struggle a bit sometimes, but I'm able to manage thanks to the help I received and I credit that little loveable mutt for me being around today.\n\n\nEdit: Snoopy was there by my side for almost 17 years.

I really hope anyone who will read this will take a moment to check on their friends, so many people don't and even if they want you to or not, it will make them feel more loved in the long run.\n\nPotential trigger warnings below, so just be warned. PS I love you, even if you don't love you.\n\n>!I have been suicidal for 12 years. The last 2-3 years I have been doing much much better and I don't really consider myself suicidal anymore, but for the sake of this I will include this year in the tally because I had a bad month a few months back.!<\n\n>!There have been 3 very distinct times in my life where I almost killed myself. First was when I was in high school, I started drinking every day and blacking out all the time, I did drugs and drank every day. I hated life and just wanted to feel something else. One night I was extremely wasted and decided to go walk around town. I was standing next to the road and was waiting to just jump in front of a bust or large truck. While waiting I was thinking about the reasons I didn't want to be alive. After an hour of thinking all the bad things, I started thinking about reasons I might want to be alive... This first time was because I promised myself that I wouldn't make my mom bury another child (my sister died before I was born).!<\n\n>!The second time I was 8 months out of HS, same scenario as above with all the drugs and all. This time I had a gun to my head, I was going to pull the trigger, but when I did my finger wouldn't move.  I put the gun down and cried. This time I remembered that I wanted to move away some day and see new places, I couldn't die before I left my hometown and had new experiences.!<\n\n>!The third time was my closest time. I was in college and my entire life fell apart. GF left me, lost my job, had to drop out of school, one of my pets died, I lost a good friend, my life literally collapsed around me. I took an entire bottle of pain killers, mixed an entire bottle of vodka with it and then went to sleep. I woke up 30 minutes later with the worst pain of my life. I could have just took the pain, but once I felt that, once I felt something that made me actually feel alive I called my friend. He knew I was suicidal and knew that I would probably try something soon. He was on call for me 24/7. He picked me up, forced me to throw up and then rushed me to the ER to get my stomach pumped. I decided to fight it because I actually realized that I WANT TO BE ALIVE, I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO LIVE.!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>!From that day on, I have tried my best to be happy, its been 3 years now, and I have only been in a slump where I was slightly suicidal for 6 days out of 3 years. My depression tried killing me, I didn't try to kill me. That is how I think about it.

The brutal and frank discussion of how common it was to fail really stuck with me after my first attempt had failed, and stopped me from going through with my second attempt.

            "I just gotta say my religion. I know it's a touchy thing for some people and Reddit is known for hating on it, but I truly believe it's the thing that saved my life from me. My depression and self-hate stemmed from two things: the people around (both family and classmates) just making me feel like crap and a disappointment and myself since I thought I was worthless and just couldn't help seeing myself as less than everyone else, like something that was expendable.\n\nI didn't care that I would die and I believed no one else would, but what ultimately stopped was trying to see stuff from God's perspective. My relationship was God was never that \"I better do what he says or else I'll go to hell\" type of thing. It was more of \"he made, cares, and wants the best\" type of relationship (like a healthy parent-child type of thing) because that was how my church taught it. And for what it's worth, and you guys may think this is cliche or something, but just the thought that I was made with a purpose for my life but I was going to waste it by killing myself really put things in perspective for me. And, like how a kid doesn't like to disappoint his parents, I just didn't want to make God sad by ending myself like that. \n\nObviously, my depression and problems didn't just go away right then and there, but just that moment of truth really helped me finally set the building blocks down for me to reconstruct my life and finally feel like I deserved to live.\n\nLike I said earlier, I know to a lot of you religion probably doesn't mean anything and is something that our society would be better off if it didn't exist (not shaming or blaming, just pointing out the rhetoric I usually see here), but it was a lifesaver for me.

            "Antidepressants. I was hospitalized as a sophomore in college, and they put me on a low dose, but still enough to feel it. I'd been wanting to kill myself since middle school - self harm, eating disorders, reckless behavior, the whole nine yards. Things just kept spiraling until I could feel myself gravitating toward the sleeping pills I had in my desk. I texted someone, crying, alone, with the bottle in my hand. He game and got me. I went into a psych ward for a few days. Its funny - when I called my dad, he said, \"I'm surprised its taken you this long\" and told me about when he got institutionalized his sophomore year in college. Runs in the family. We laughed about it. \n\nAnyway, antidepressants WORK and taking them doesn't make you weak and it doesn't mean that you weren't strong enough to heal on our own. Once I got back to school, a week or so into the meds, I started waking up, and hear me out, happy. It was wild. When I went to bed, I cared that I woke up. It was the first time I hadn't at least kinda wanted to die in seven years. \n\nNow, I have a good job, a great dog, and the best partner anyone could ask for. Those years in the dark really make me appreciate this time now. One downside - I used to write award winning poetry.

Then they didn't follow the menu they were required by law to have but fed garbage like canned fish of some kind that wasn't seasoned, cooked cabbage and beans. Every once in the while I would get chicken and other palatable foods, I can't remember. There was never any hot water for me took take a shower. The staff cursed me out if I asked for anything or when I reminded them I had a doctors appoitment because they forgot about. I couldn't watch TV during the day because the staff would watch  thier soaps. They would give me my bed time meds, including sleeping pills at 6:00pm because the third shift didn't have the authority to hand out meds. The cook didn't know how to use the dishwasher so she washed the dishes by hand using only warm water. Her liscence required her to provide me with activities to keep me occupied, such a games, books, puzzels, etc. But I never got any.

I had his ashes added to the ink and tattooed his paw print on my shoulder where his paw would rest. If you know boxers they stand on their hind legs and use their arms for everything. His paws would rest on my clavicles when hugging me. To this day I believe that dog has saved many more people. I worked as an EMT. Every suicidal patient I'd show them the tattoo and tell them about Oscar. It always worked. I'll miss him til I finally die."

            "Polar bears are the only bear species that actively hunt and kill humans for food. There\u2019s a rhyme that everyone living where bears live needs to know, and *why* the rhyme is so important;\n\nIf it\u2019s brown, lie down. Brown or grizzly bears will leave you alone if you play dead. Climbing up a tall tree works with adult brown bears, since they can\u2019t climb trees. \n\nIf it\u2019s black, fight back. Black bears will back off when they realize you\u2019re more of a threat than they realize, but DO NOT climb a tree to escape. Both cubs and adult black bears can climb trees. \n\nIf it\u2019s white, say goodnight. Polar bears are not only the largest bears, but they are ambush predators. If one manages to sneak up on you, you\u2019re as good as dead. The best you can do to escape is either run and drop your clothes (fortunately for you, they have very short attention spans and they\u2019ll stop momentarily to sniff at your clothes because it\u2019s not normal for their food to suddenly drop something like that), or start praying to whatever deity you believe or don\u2019t believe in.\n\nEdit: this is all advice for if the bear decides to try and kill/eat you. Generally speaking, if you *do* come across a bear,  you never, **ever** run away. Stand your ground, make yourself look big and be *loud*. If the bear stands on its hind legs, it\u2019s just checking you out; it\u2019s curious and has likely never seen a human before. The best option is to back away slowly while maintaining eye contact, still being loud. If the bear decides to charge, use an air horn or bear spray, which will likely cause to run off. I would to if I just got maced. However, as a last resort, use a gun or other weapon if it becomes aggressive or starts mauling.",

I am unable to respond to everything, but I appreciate knowing that so many people have felt and thought strongly enough about this to want to participate in changing it.\n\nSecondly: if this has moved you, I encourage you to ask along your networks about ways you can become involved in ECD feeding schemes.

After a bit longer, you start to learn how long people generally have left - even down to a few hours.\nI always went with honesty, I felt it was my job to support the patients' families as well as the patients, so if they asked how long I thought they had left I would answer honestly (obviously with the disclaimer that I wasn't a doctor and I could only base it on my previous experiences).\n\nThe wife of one of my patients told me that their children (adults) were visiting the following weekend to say their goodbyes.

In those cases, you had to not say anything.

What tended to happen was the symptoms they already presented would worsen, beyond the point that their medication could alleviate it. They would lose energy, ultimately being bed-bound. The biggest giveaway was when they no longer wanted to drink water, that was usually a 72 hour warning. When they were very close, their skin would start to mottle and go pink/purple. I'm not 100% sure why it happened but I think it was because the heart was struggling to get the blood around and it would settle.\nHowever, generally you could just tell that the person you'd been seeing for days, weeks, months or even years just wasn't the same as they were a few days before. Changes could be gradual or sudden.!<\n\nI went to work with the philosophy that death comes for everybody, if it were me being cared for then I would want to be cared for in a certain way - the way I tried to care for everybody whose homes I entered.",

Don\u2019t workout until complete exhaustion. Set a reachable goal and then increase it as the days and weeks go by. \n\n6. People at the gym are nice. If you ask them a question they\u2019ll probably answer you. Now, don\u2019t mistake them for your personal trainer, but don\u2019t be scared of them. However, don\u2019t interrupt anyone while they are lifting or holding weights. Wait until they\u2019re resting.\n\n7. If you can afford it. Get a personal trainer for a week or two. Most gyms offer a special when signing up. If you are going to lift free weights, it\u2019s important that you do so with the correct form. Forget about how much you can lift. It doesn\u2019t matter. You aren\u2019t joining a gym to become Mr. Universe. You are joining to get in shape. Nothing will set you back on your new path like getting an injury. Lifting weights can be dangerous if not done properly. \n\n8. Drink water. Drink lots of water. \n\n9. Wash your gym clothes after each use. If you worked out properly, they are disgusting and need to be washed.\n\n10. Keep notes. Did you do a mile on the treadmill today? Write it down on a notebook with the date. Tomorrow you can do 1.05 miles. This will help you keep track of your progress and will act as positive reinforcement of your progress.\n\n11. Know what you want to do. Do you want to lose 10 pounds? Do you want a six pack? Do you want to be strong enough to lift a toilet seat?  Make sure your initial goals are achievable. Don\u2019t set the bar too high. You can always create new goals when you achieve old one.\n\nAs an avid gym goer for ten years, I can say we\u2019re happy that your trying to get healthier. We won\u2019t say as much to you unsolicited but we\u2019re proud of you. Stick with it and you\u2019ll be happy you did.\n\nP.S. I better not catch any of you doing curls in the squat rack so help me god.\n\nEdited: grammar fix\n\nThanks for the gold and awards. I do hope this helps people going to the gym for the first time.",
            "Here are a few that a lot of new lifters usually make the mistake of doing or not doing:\n\nRerack your weights and people won\u2019t hate you \n\nDon\u2019t do circuit training in the free weight area of taking up 5 machines or 5 sets of dumbbells, that how you make no friends fast.\n\nMost machines have diagrams on how to do the exercise on them.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to ask the front desk for a spot if you aren\u2019t confident doing free weights, better safe than sorry.  The amount of times I have seen newer lifters pin themselves squatting or benching more weight than they can handle is insane.\n\nForm over ego, no one cares if you curl 50 lbs but your back will the next day if you swing the crap out of it to just get it up.  Good form = quicker gains with less injury and that is the quickest way to get people to make fun of you.  It\u2019s not right but it will happen.\n\nResearch is key, look up some beginner programs and YouTube the exercises.  Having a game plan when you walk in is the difference in looking the same in a month and making progress.  Doing chest and arms 5 days a week isn\u2019t a program, work the whole body especially your core.  \n\nAsk someone if you can work in or how many sets they have left if they are on a machine you want.  Be prepared for a no and find another machine that is similar or a free weight version. \n\nDon\u2019t waste time on a machine watching TV, talking on the phone or texting excessively.  People could be waiting for you to finish so do your lifts and keep it moving.\n\n\nOverall, no one cares if someone is working out as long as they clean up after them selves, don\u2019t showboat and are just nice to others.  Anyone that makes the effort to walk in the door has my respect for taking the first step.",

            "Short novel incoming. But if you are new, fucking read it!\n\nI've been a consistent gym goer for about fifteen years now. There is one big thing I see happen every year. This is the best advice I can give anyone getting started. \n\nPICK A TIME TO GO TO THE GYM THAT FITS YOUR LIFE STYLE AND THAT YOU CAN BE CONSISTENT WITH\n\nI go to the gym at a weird time. I am an uber night owl. I typically go to the gym around 230-3 a.m. every day. I love that the gym is empty at that time. It is my time to decompress from the world. To forget everything else exists. It's me time. The time I focus solely on my self.\n\nBecause I'm a nut job, I am consistently there and leaving the gym every day between 5 and 6 a.m. Every year, after January 1 I see the same damn thing. Loads of fresh faces start walking in at the time. Dragging their feet, looking half dead, angry that they are awake, and not even wanting to be there. \n\nYOU ARE ALREADY MAKING A DRASTIC LIFE CHANGE, WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU SET YOURSELF UP FOR FAILURE?\n\nThe most important part of working out is consistency. If you fucking hate the mornings, but decided to change your life and force yourself to wake up and go, you've already lost. Sure maybe the first week you force yourself to wake up, and that next Monday too. But then Tuesday your alarm goes off and you go, \"fuck, I've been good, I'll take a day off\". You tell yourself you'll go tomorrow and you do! But then Thursday and Friday it happens again. \n\nSurely you'll get back to it next week. The start is hard, but you'll get it. But it happens again and you only make it two days that third week, then one the forth. And by mid February, you are paying a subscription service for something you no longer do. But you don't want to cancel your membership because that would be quitting. Giving up on yourself. \n\nSo you have to find a time that works for you. The gym is always a zoo at 5:00 p.m., and it's even worse at the start of the year. If you hate people, DO NOT GO BETWEEN 5-6 P.M. Go at 9 p.m. shower then hop in bed. We all know you're full of shit when you say you go to bed early and then watch The Office for 3 hours. Or go at dinner time, when less people are there. Maybe it'll help your diet too since you won't be cramming your face from 7-9 p.m.\n\nOn the other side, if you need the motivation of others, go when people can be there with you. If you are a morning person, trying to go at night will crush you. \n\nThe time you choose is as important as anything else. It's more important than what you do there. Because consistency is what matters. Walking in the doors of the gym everyday is the hardest obstacle in fitness. Don't set yourself up for failure before you even begin.",
            "A lot of gyms offer complimentary training sessions when you sign up for a new membership. Take them up on their offer! Their trainer can show you how to use the equipment and give you a \"how to work out\" tutorial. My gym offered 3 free training sessions, the first one I used has a how to and the next 2 were intense work outs to see if I wanted to keep using a trainer.",
            "Please don't use the weightlifting benches as a place to put your stuff while you work out. There aren't usually many benches in a gym, and it grinds my gears when I see people using the benches to hold their water bottles/keys/wallets/phones while they do routines that never once have them use the bench.",
            "There's a couple that really come to mind.\n\n1. Nobody cares what you look like. Just do what you came to do.\n\n2. Put your stuff back where you found it. I can't tell you how many times I've had to walk around the whole gym looking for the plates or dumbbells I need.\n\n3. It's okay to use machines and conversely, it's okay to use free weights. There a tons of people who got where you want to be using the method you aren't using. Figure out what you like to use and use it.\n\n4. Wipe the seats/benches before and after you use it. Some people don't wipe after and it can lead to ringworm and other nastiness. If the person before you didn't wipe, then you're at risk. If you don't wipe, then the person after you is at risk.\n\n5. Have fun. Don't make the gym boring as shit. Discipline will only take you so far. If you're bored or you hate it, you'll stop going. Improvements in your body are made from consistency first. But,\n\n6. It's okay to miss a day here and there. Just because you miss your Tuesday workout doesn't mean you have to wait until next week so your week can be perfect. Miss your day and get back at it.\n\n7. Don't trust Instagram bodies. Enough said.",

Most people overestimate what they can achieve in a couple of months, hence why yhey stop.\n- Diet is THE most important thing, arguably more important than the exercise\n- Don\u2019t see going to the gym as a chore. You have to enjoy it.\n- Drink all the water in existence.\n- Get a solid amount of sleep (not you sitting in bed on reddit, actual sleep) 8 hours is a good place to start and is easily achievable.\n\nIf you are targeting muscle building:\n- Form > weight any day of the week. For information about good exercises and form, [Athlean- X ](https://www.youtube.com/user/JDCav24) is the best.\n\nIf you are targeting fat loss:\n- Diet is very important, MAKE SURE YOU\u2019RE EATING ACTUAL FOOD, people just eat salad and fast all the time, this will demotivate you and you\u2019ll have no energy. Salad is fine but make sure you\u2019re eating a high protein and fibre diet, try to really cut back on carbs. Chicken and fish are really good sources of protein, along with eggs (these are a bit higher in fat though).\n- I would recommend bikes and rowing machines over treadmills as you can push yourself a lot more.\n\nAnymore questions feel free to ask :)",

            "Personal trainer here, few tips and annoying things to keep in mind, some of it may repeat what's been said:\n\n1) Rerack weights.  Fucking rerack your weights. \n\n\n2) Music belongs in your headphones.  Don't sing along (unless it's Frank Sinatra's My Way), don't rap along, and don't play it out on your phone.  Chicks and dudes, this is not karaoke and you look fucking weird.\n\n\n3) similar to 1, put back your towels and equipment and hell, wipe down your sweat when you're done.  Especially if you're new, there no excuse, versus someone on a specific set timing (and really they should still do it too).\n\n\n4) ask a trainer for help, we will keep you looking like you know what's going on and prevent injuries. have prevented problems and warned about injuries that happened after I was ignored.  We do actually care that you stay healthy and keep coming back.    If your gym has trainers that only help when it's a paid session, they're assholes.  Bring a friend, but understand they only know what a magazine or friend or coach from 6 years ago has shown them.\n\n\n5) Lift light, slow, and controlled for the first few weeks.  Even when it feels silly, practice the form on light weight first.  There are a bunch of biological considerations for why beginners should start light, but let's just summarize with diminishing returns and injury.  I recommend Yessis 1x20 programming for the first 3-6 months.\n\n\n6) Weights first, cardio second.  Light stretch and warm up are fine, but cardio is energetically far less complex than weights, so save the bulk of it for last.  Eventually you'll learn to do cardio with weights, which is fun.\n\n\n7) Eat and rest.  You will need more food for more activity.  Don't start playing with energy cutting when you're starting a new program, unless it's cutting out extreme behaviors, and even then taper as you go.  \n\n\n8) Don't over do it.  If you're sore from anything for more than 2 days, you went too hard or heavy.  If you're starting from 0, try 1.5hrs a week, and increase from there to 5 hrs MAX.\n\n\n9) Do something everyday.  Get your mind right.  Bring gym equipment, meal prep, and even if it's walking the treadmill for 5 min when you would normally do nothing, you are making a difference mentally.  Abs aren't made from pure exercise for most people, they come from daily habits that are difficult to break without daily concern.\n\n\n\nTL;DR Put the weights and equipment the way you want to find them, take your time in and out of the gym, and be not afraid to ask questions or back off.  \n\nGood luck, and may you look good naked.",

            "I have a friend who is very sucked into the \u201cgirl boss\u201d subculture that has her working all hours on a business that makes no money, then doing \u201cself care\u201d in the form of spending the little money she makes on manicures or expensive beauty products that other people have told her are self care. Self care and self love is sometimes admitting that you need to stop perusing something that isn\u2019t working and is making you miserable, even if it\u2019s what you thought you wanted and even if everyone is telling you to keep going and not to give up.\n\nEdit: she\u2019s not in an mlm (although they\u2019re awful and I wish they were banned), she\u2019s in the fashion industry making amazing handmade one offs - extremely talented. She enjoyed it when it was a hobby or something she did on the side and enjoys when she gets to work on community projects, but when she has commissions she puts them off until the last minute due to depression then tries to fit in to the hustle culture by staying up all night finishing things. It\u2019s a horrible cycle to be in. I also wanted to clarify that I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s a bad thing to treat yourself as part of self care, but she largely buys into this as part of that kind of Instagram culture, putting photos of her nails up as #selfcare etc. I love her and as a therapist it\u2019s hard to see her go through this without any help. She\u2019s been largely failed by our mental healthcare system who\u2019ve lied to her about her missing appointments they never told her about etc.",

This  phenomenon is called Parasocial Interactions and was first described by [Horton & Wohl](http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/short/horton_and_wohl_1956.html) in 1956. Lots of newer papers cite them.  Enjoy! ",
            "Put on a song that gets you going. Then exercise and you'll feel better. I've had days where I cried my weight in tears, got pissed that I was crying so much and started lifting weights to some solid music. Eventually, I felt better because my muscles were having a good time. Then I cleaned myself up and went for a run. Felt way better when I got back. ",
            "Remind yourself that your thinking can't be trusted in that moment, that things are better and you're better than how your mind would have you believe. Force yourself into the first step of whatever will distract you or make you feel happy, even if it's a temporary fix, because each next step gets easier as you move. Think about your loved ones and what you can do for them to make their lives happier, and it'll help you to get outside of your head.",
            "After landing myself in the hospital for mental health (and physical health, autoimmune shit) I got a pug. Now I have four rescue dogs, and I\u2019m always covered in big and small lumps of unconditional love and I\u2019m the happiest goddamn person ever. They are 100% the reason I was able to beat depression. ",

            "Clinical psychologist here - the best known treatment approach for depression is behavioral activation. Put simply, BA involves getting out and doing the things you used to enjoy. Try to schedule in activities that give you pleasure and fulfillment. During depression this can be a lot harder than it sounds so try to plan things out and come up with solutions to any internal or environmental barriers. ",

            "I use daylio. I've been bad almost every day for a little over a month. But today I made my first \"good\" entries since Jan 1.\n\nI cleaned the kitchen. I got my haircut. I got a manipedi. I had a delicious salad. Then I walked around the mall and bought some skin care and underwear that makes me feel sexy.\n\nAll of that is self care and helps fight back against depression. But what really kicks it where it hurts is addressing what's the underlying issue.\n\nI was assaulted in December so obviously I have some situational things to go through. A big break came recently when I realized I can't rush healing. It's been a month. Of course I'm still upset. But I'm making huge strides too. **We need to give ourselves credit where it's due.** Stop beating ourselves up and demanding more. \n\nI watched Queer Eye on Netflix and Tan said he was once dumped because he was no longer making an effort in himself. He was on the couch all day, he didn't groom himself, didn't eat well. I decided I should make an effort in myself FOR myself *because I'm worth it*. I'm worth that haircut. I'm worth that manipedi. I'm worth that sexy thong. And whether it's a long day like mine or just getting out of bed, you need to tell yourself you're worth it too.\n\n**So in short** : track your mood, be productive, be easy on yourself, don't try to rush healing or force yourself better, give yourself credit even for small things - especially for small things (you need to practice your carrot giving after all), repeat to yourself that you are worth it, you deserve more and you deserve better, and Google CPT worksheets see if those don't help you.",

There were billions of girls, billions of basements, and streets, and towns... and somehow I could choose what happened in my head. The only things that were real were real existed outside of me. ",

            "This isn't something that can be intentionally implemented I just wanted to share it. About a week ago I was walking around my block at night, kinda going down that mental spiral/negative feedback loop. Just dissing myself and putting myself down, thinking and overblowing all the crappy things I've done over the past few years. It was getting pretty bad but it was still at that *intentional* stage of negative feedback. I was actively thinking about these things. I hadn't done it long enough where it becomes a general mood.\n\nSo about 1 minute from my door, all miserable, I see out of the top corner of my eye a bright flash and look up to see an absolutely incredibly bright, beautiful, blue shooting star streak across the sky. It was one of the brightest I'd seen, and it kind of flared up to it's brightest point just after I looked up and it was this cosmic blueish color as it shot across a few inches of my sky and fizzled out.\n\nI was left stunned and it was such a stark reminder that the world holds so many beautiful, wonderful things. I had no business being miserable, I had a whole world of wonders, a whole kaleidoscope of knowledge and skills I could learn, a giant interlocking, shifting sea of people to meet, and only one time to experience this strange paradise, this surreal dream to be poked and prodded and explored. Yes I'm very aware of the many dark things in the world, and a lot of people suck to be around. But in that moment I was so happy, it was such perfect timing, in such a awe-inspiring fashion, to be reminded of the wonders out there to behold as a living thing. And that I wouldn't always be there or be capable to experience it as readily as I can in this era of my life.\n\nGo out there and shape your life to the dream you want. If you want it bad enough.",
