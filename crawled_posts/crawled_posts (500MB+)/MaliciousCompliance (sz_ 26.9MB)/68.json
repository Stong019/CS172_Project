        "selftext": "Many years ago I was an elected union president at a Fortune 500 company, but I was only in charge of one contracted group. As such the bargaining power of the main company was much higher than my own, but even they couldn\u2019t intervene too much. My groups contract switched from company A to company B in 2012, but the contract remained unchanged. Company B inherited all of the contract requirements of company A and agreed to meet them, but opted to fight me on several minor clauses when it came down to it. Most were solved without much conflict, but the major sticking point was in regard to uniforms. \n\nOur contract ensured that we were given an allowance to pay for new uniforms and vouchers for steel toe boots every year. When it came time for our new vouchers, they refused, citing that they\u2019d given us a slight raise which should offset the cost of boots. I informed them that a cost of living raise didn\u2019t void the portion of the contract requiring them to provide vouchers for shoes, to which they responded they just hadn\u2019t figured out how to provide vouchers yet. After assurances they would provide the vouchers as soon as they could work it out, I dropped the issue. \n\nUnsurprisingly, months later they still hadn\u2019t provided vouchers for replacement shoes. It should be noted that this was a very large campus and many of us walked several miles a day in these shoes, and the shoes were caked with chemicals and dirt and started to look pretty vile within a year. We had to wear the same work shoes in office areas and we had started to get complaints. I decided to lean in to this. This is where malicious compliance begins.\n\nNo new shoes? Fine. I\u2019ll rig them up to last longer. I went out and bought several rolls of the flashiest and most obnoxious duct tape I could find. I began to \u201crepair\u201d holes in my shoes with duct tape and extra fabric to the point that my hot pink shoes became easily recognizable. The safety team for the main company was so amused they gifted me hot pink safety glasses and gloves to match. I also lent out my gaudy duct tape collection to any employee needing to \u201cupgrade\u201d their shoes. \n\nSuddenly the complaints about our dirty shoes were replaced by complaints about obviously duct taped shoes. Whenever we were asked we\u2019d tell both union and non union coworkers that it was a small protest against the refusal to honor the shoe vouchers in the contract. \n\nThe next year rolls around and still no shoe vouchers, but suddenly our uniform allowance was increased ~$150 to allow for new steel toed shoes to be purchased. After speaking to the union members, I agreed to allow that in place of the vouchers.\n\nI kept my duct tape collection permanently on display as a threat and would use it any time safety equipment wasn\u2019t being replaced and required \u201crepair\u201d.",

Got told repeatedly there's none in my size\".\n\nIt should be noted that in my country, companies are required to have a stock of all needed safety equipment in all sizes at all time, so they can replace broken ones.

We were working with steel in a rough environment and against health and safety standards to meet deadlines we climbed all over the place as well as kicking large pieces of steel into place. \n\nBy the time your boots wore in enough to not be distracting, that steel was already exposed and we should have asked for replacements. What would you go for? Safer boots? or boots you can walk in? Because every one of us opted for ones we could walk in. Which must have saved the company anywhere from 50%-66% on boots.

        "selftext": "This happened to me a few years ago and I just remembered it recently.\n\n\nI was working at a restaurant waiting tables in a very affluent area on the Jersey Shore.\u00a0 We had our fair share of entitled people who were under the impression that if you throw enough money around you can do whatever you want and treat people however you want.\u00a0 And when your income depends on their tips, you kind of just have to deal with it.\n\n\nThe restaurant had an outdoor dining and bar area that overlooked the ocean with an amazing view.\u00a0 During the summer this was pretty much where everyone wanted to sit rather than our indoor dining area.\u00a0 And for anyone who works someplace with outdoor dining, you know the one monkey wrench that can ruin a very profitable dinner shift: the weather.\u00a0 No matter how accurate the forecast says it\u2019s going to be, you can never know for sure.\u00a0 For the most part we never had an issue, because if it started to abruptly rain there would usually be more than enough room inside for all the people who were sitting outside to move it.\u00a0 It\u2019s usually a clusterfuck to keep track of which table moved where, but we always handled it without any issue.\u00a0 Until that one day.\n\n\nWe had a large party booked one day in our indoor area that took up more than half our tables.\u00a0 (a 50th birthday I believe)\u00a0 So our indoor capacity was limited.\u00a0 And even on top of the party, there were customers who were weary about the weather so they decided to sit inside also.\u00a0 And then more and more people started sitting outside.\u00a0 My manager did a quick assessment and realized that if it started raining, we would barely have enough room inside to accommodate everyone who was sitting outside.\u00a0 He told us we had to stop seating our outdoor area and to start recommending to our outdoor tables to move inside because of the impending weather to be on the safe side.\u00a0 (Everyone's weather app was saying there was a downpour coming up the coast).\u00a0 Everyone was okay with it, except\u2026..\n\n\nI had a table of nine people who seemed fairly middle-aged and very wealthy.\u00a0 (Margarita\u2019s with top-top shelf tequila, gaudy looking jewelry etc etc.)\u00a0 Each end of the table seemed to be in their own conversation not paying attention to the other.\u00a0 Upon hearing about the incoming rain, I go to the woman whom I thought was in charge (she had the fakest tan of them all), and I tell her (Lets call her Karen) \u201cMa\u2019am I\u2019m really sorry, but because of the weather coming in and our limited seating inside, I\u2019m going to have to move you folks inside so you don\u2019t get caught in the rain.\u201d\u00a0 This Karen is so entrenched in her conversation she doesn\u2019t even register that I, a lowly waiter, was talking to her.\u00a0 So I try again, \u201cMa\u2019am I\u2019m sorry for interrupting, but-.\u201d\u00a0 She cuts me off exasperated, \u201cWhat? What are you saying?\u201d\u00a0 I begin again.\u00a0 \u201cMa\u2019am I\u2019m sorry because of the weather coming and our inside filling up, we need to move you inside.\u00a0 We have a table ready for you, I can move all your drinks and everything for you\u201d\u00a0 She snaps back with \u201cThe only reason we came here was to sit outside. We\u2019ll deal with the weather\u201d.\u00a0 I realize she doesn\u2019t grasp what I\u2019m saying so I try again.\u00a0 \u201cMa\u2019am just in case the-\u201d And then she goes from zero to a hundred and yells \u201cWe\u2019ll fucking deal with it!\u201d\u00a0 She yelled so loudly that the people on the other half of her table heard.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t hear our prior exchange but only heard her outburst and went back to their conversation, assuming this must be normal behavior for her.\u00a0 She wants to deal with it on her own?\u00a0 You got it.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So I began to take their order.\u00a0 Filet Mignons.\u00a0 A few lobster tails.\u00a0 Expensive shit.\u00a0 I put the order in and I look back and all the other tables had moved inside (because they all were rational human beings) and my table of nine entitled jerks were the only ones out there.\u00a0 I heard the leathery-looking Karen say to the rest of the table \u201cWow we have the entire patio to ourselves, what luxury\u201d.\u00a0 After a while I looked inside and saw that the table I had held for them was taken by another party that had just walked in (the last available table).\u00a0 And just as the last butt hit the seat, I felt the best feeling I possibly could have felt at that moment.\u00a0 A glorious rain drop tapped on the top of my head.\u00a0 Oh sweet glory.\u00a0 Within seconds it went from beautiful blue skies to torrential downpour.\u00a0 Everyone at the table grabbed their drinks (a little watered down at this point) and ran inside.\u00a0 After they shook themselves dry, they looked around and realized there was nowhere for them to sit.\u00a0 Most of them looked dumbfounded, like a lost child in a supermarket.\u00a0 Karen makes a b-line to me and screams \u201cWe need a table!\u201d.\u00a0 I reply, \u201cI\u2019m sorry ma\u2019am, we\u2019re fully seated and on a wait for our indoor seating.\u201d\u00a0 (Maybe one table on the waiting list, but a list is a list)\u00a0 \u201cWell what are we supposed to do now?\u201d\u00a0 she hawked back at me which led to me so eloquently saying \u201cMa\u2019am as you said you would, you \u2018fucking deal with it\u2019\u201d.\u00a0 I airquoted the \u2018fucking dealing it\u2019 to really emphasize that that was her response and as I said that everyone else at the table realized that was our interaction earlier and Karen had dug their graves.\u00a0 I felt bad for most of them because if they had all known the circumstances they probably would have convinced Karen to move in.\u00a0 But after she raised her voice and cursed at me, all bets were off.\u00a0 And as serendipity would have it, at that moment their food came out and we handed it to them.\u00a0 There they were.\u00a0 Nine people in damp clothes holding a cosmo in one hand and Filet Mignon in another with nowhere to sit to eat.\u00a0 The rest of her party convinced her just to get some boxes for their food and pay their check and leave. \u00a0 As I hand Karen the check, she smugly says \u201cWell this will be reflected in your tip\u201d to which I replied \u201cMa\u2019am we implement a 20% tip on parties of eight or more.\u00a0 It\u2019s our policy, and it\u2019s clearly stated in our menu\u201d\u00a0 She paid and then they left with their boxed up food leaving behind their half-full drinks.\u00a0 Best $60 I ever made.\n\nEDIT:  I definitely got the numbers wrong with how much they tipped and what not.

Within the 2 minutes I was inside picking up food, the weather went from normal to feeling like we were inside a tornado. The umbrellas were still open.

One took off across the parking lot as a waitress chased it, she gave up as it went over the train tracks across the street and into the houses. Another umbrella must have had a hit out on me because as I was leaving, I'm halfway across the parking lot when another waitress screamed.

Because they were trying to avoid killing the local civilians they had orders expressly prohibiting them from shooting back (maybe just at night?), and the guerrillas knew about it. So every single night the guerrillas would climb up on rooftops in the village and take pot shots at my father's group.\n\nNow, because the guerrillas were effectively using the civilians as a shield, the men weren't allowed to shoot back. They were, however, allowed to launch a flare, which would light things up enough that the guerrillas didn't feel safe continuing to shoot at them. But the shooting would start back up again the next night.\n\nOne night my father had had enough, and he had a devious idea. When a sniper started taking pot shots that night, he immediately launched a flare. Horizontally. Right at the sniper.\n\nHis commanding officer reamed him for it, but after that the night-time pot shots stopped.\n\n(Edit: for clarity)",

That meant that sometimes they didn\u2019t get to their desk until after 9am, however nearly everyone worked back without being asked to deliver on deadlines. \n\nManagement didn\u2019t care because they knew the work was being done and everyone always went over and above. \n\nEnter new HR manager, we had never really had one before but were growing so needed one. Within her first few weeks she sent out an email saying that everyone needed to be seated and ready to go at 9am and that we needed to stop having social chats and getting ready at work, or if we did, do it earlier. She never acknowledged the fact that everyone put in unpaid overtime. \n\nCue mass malicious compliance. Everyone would start at 9am as per email and then leave at 5pm. Projects started running behind and clients started getting pissed off because their product was not being delivered on time. \n\nNew HR manager was confused as to why work was not being delivered on time anymore, people were starting on time! She made sure of it! \n\nNeedless to say, upper management removed the rule and she quit shortly after. \n\nWe all went back to our normal ways and would you know it! Projects were back on track. \n\nDon\u2019t walk into a new company and try to change something that isn\u2019t broken. The people will revolt.\n\nEdit: this was my first post and I didn\u2019t think anyone would see it! \nI want to clarify that OT was never expected or forced upon us but due to awesome management, cool projects and great perks we didn\u2019t mind when we did do it.\n\nEdit: I see a lot of people confused about why HR would be involved with such matters. In smaller companies in Australia, HR oversees a lot more than the usual. It depends on the company really, and this company was approx 50 people.",

The good leaders always come in and observe for a time, only changing things that are blatantly wrong, against policy, or negatively impacting performance.

            "I worked for a big company that was run like a start up.  There was a huge emphasis on our customers and supporting them, and doing what was needed to make sure those customers were successful.  \n\nIt was high pressure but paid really well, was filled with scary smart people and was usually a fun place to work.  We did what was needed with few barriers, and it wasn't unusual for a VP to get a call from a front line worker trying to fix a problem.\n\nThat all changed when they brought in a HR director from an old style telecom company.  She instituted rigid processes that could not be bypassed and things that could previously be resolved with a single call required following the chain of command.  That chain of command routinely refused to deal with problems and things that could previously be fixed in a week simply never got fixed.\n\nWithin months the entire company took on the characteristics of a stodgy old telecom, and although the pay remained the same the pressure increased, the fun evaporated and it became a difficult and frustrating place to work.\n\nI wish I could say the HR director was forced out, but that didn't happen.  Instead people left in droves and the place is a shadow of what it once was.",
            "I worked for a very small company that had an unlimited vacation and sick time policy. If you wanted or needed time for anything, you just told the boss and took it. The company had like 8 people and we all really loved our work and worked overtime more or less constantly and didn't take much time off (I don't think I took a sick day the entire time I worked there - I could work from home so if I had a cold I'd just sit at my desk at home and work), so this really wasn't a problem. I'm sure the boss would have made the policy more strict if there was a problem.\n\nAfter 3 years with the company, during which time I'd only taken a day or two off around thanksgiving and christmas, I took a 2 week vacation (with my boss's approval), during which time I took my close friend of 30 years on a 4 day trip to Las Vegas, spent a week with my aunt (who I hadn't seen for about 15 years) in San Francisco, and attended my best friend's funeral. (That wasn't planned, he died of a heart attack while I was in SF.)\n\nThe HR guy was \\*not pleased\\* that I'd been away for so long. He immediately emailed everyone a policy that all time off had to be approved a month in advance by him and specifying a rate of accruing time off so we'd have a limited number of days off per year.\n\nEveryone  said \"yeah right!\" and ignored him. He discovered the hard way that he actually had no power over anyone.",

It was always around 11 o'clock and we still had at least four hours left in our work day. He would walk out for a few minutes and then walk back in his office and walk out with his bag. So this meant that if we were caught up on our projects or were at a point that they could be done by 10 o'clock on the following Tuesday, we would get an early start but all we would have to do is give him a 30 minute head start and one by one, we could leave.

Followed by a discussion on what they can do to improve their attendance and therefore improve their performance. \n\nI managed this way for about 3 years until I got a new boss. Now, the book was our guide to make sure no one claimed we were being \u201cunfair.\u201d Mind you, in these three years I only ever had ONE person claim I was unfair - and it was someone who fell asleep first day on the job and was therefore fired. Not anyone I actually worked with and developed a work relationship where it was clear the better the performance the looser the oversight. I ended up having MORE complaints when I brought out the rule book for EVERY SINGLE THING.\n\nIn our store, 5 absences without sick time to cover and you get a write up. I had one woman who EXCEEDED expectations on attendance for years, but nevertheless had to write up when she had health issues complicate her attendance. \n\nHowever, the DM\u2019s MOM (DM being my bosses boss\u2019s) worked for us. She missed 13 shifts without coverage and I was told not to write her up. This direction wasn\u2019t by the DM, it was my boss.

In my observation, when HR stuck strictly to the legalities, its impact was more or less positive. When HR was permitted to roam far and wide and take upon itself (as in this noxious case) bogus authority, bad things ensued. This happens, I think, because a) some HR are drawn to HR because they see it as a shortcut to power (i.e. without having to prove themselves and work their way up), and b) certain (NOT all, but some) top- and executive-managements, being essentially cowards and lazy entitled fuck-offs to boot, are happy to hand over to HR the authority to enforce bogus by-the-book nonsense without regard to the bigger more strategic picture that they (i.e. top- and executive-managements) are at least in theory responsible for.",

He thought he had set up some good new owners for the store that would really help keep things going strong, and so everyone got to meet the new owners who said they weren't planning any changes since we were doing so well and even managed to be profitable during the pandemic, they went so far as to say they would be joining us on the team for the couple weeks before the changeover so they could see first hand how things worked and how we did things.   \n\n\nOver those couple weeks, one of the new owners showed up almost every day, in uniform, and just sat on her phone or brought her laptop and worked on it. She never spoke to any of the staff, only the old owner, and never did anything with the workers to see how we did things. During this time we only got one single opportunity to talk to the new owners one on one, where they just said the same things they said at the group meeting and more or less ignored everything we tried to tell them about the store and just kept repeating \"We'll see how things go.\" The only issue they listened to us about at all was the fact we were understaffed.   \n\n\nCut to the first day of the new owners taking over, they got some additional help from the corporate office for the first week, and proceeded to change damn near everything overnight. Our understaffing issue got worse due to how they \"managed\" different tasks by splitting the remaining staff up even more and interfering in our work constantly to make sure we were doing it the \"new, improved\" way and proceeded to not just ignore complaints, but outright tell the workers that we didn't know what we were talking about and that clearly corporate knew more than us. Needless to say, I quit by the end of that first week, followed by pretty much every remaining staff member, managers included.   \n\n\nFor additional fun, why don't I mention that the new owners also brought with them a price hike on every product, except the ones that weren't selling which they began pushing hard on customers. They also changed how most of the products were prepared and made, causing complaints and confusion from customers. Again, this was during the pandemic.

For nearly all customers its a simple process, either they call for deliveries, or they have agreed to automatic deliveries.  When I show up, I hook the truck up to the fill pipe and start pumping and either listen at the vent or hook up to an installed alarm in order to know when the holding tank is full.\n\nThis particular customer had their holding tank installed in a small utility room next to their living room and didn't install a vent to the outside, and refused to allow us to install an alarm because they didn't want us to put the 1/4 inch hole in the wall to run the alarm wire.  Solution?  They call when they need 2000 gallons of water and we show up and pump exactly 2000 gallons of water.\n\nThis procedure worked without flaw for over a decade.  Literally hundreds of deliveries with no issue.  Que owner deciding to sell.  We are contacted by the new owners and set them up as a new account and head over for our first delivery and meeting.  We especially go over the issue with us being totally unable to tell when the tank is full.  We offered to install the alarm again for free, but they declined.  So we let them know when they call for water they MUST be sure they have enough room in the tank for 2000 gal.  Or to let us know how much water they have room for.  We went over this several times and they laughed saying they understood and would be calling when they were below the 2000 gallon mark. \n\nTwo weeks go by, and we receive a message on our answering machine from the new customer,  no gallon amount is specified.  This set off a warning bell though because it was a household of two, and its only been two weeks since we filled them last.  Thats HIGHLY abnormal.  We expected more like five weeks.  So we call back just to double check.  No answer so we leave a message asking for confirmation.  Couple hours later we try again.  By the next day we had left four messages asking to confirm that they were ready for a full load.  No reply.  Well, they did call so boss sends me out.  I nock on door as a last attempt, still no answer so I hook up, start the pump and set the timer so I don't over pump while reading my book.\n\n15 minutes later I hop out to check the water meter, 1700 gallons. I'll watch for the next couple minutes and shut it down.  Thats when I hear the front door burst open and the woman who bought the house and had called us in yesterday is SCREAMING to shut the water down.  There is water everywhere!  What the hell are we doing!  This woman has been ignoring our calls and even ignored me at her door and now she is screaming at me.\n\nApparently she had called when the tank was half full instead of down below the mark showing where the 2000 gallons is.  And just disregarded all our messages and didn't feel like talking to me when I nocked.  So now she has 700+ gallons of water in her living room. Boss was called out so she could scream at him.  Husband came home from work so he too could scream at us... for reasons I guess.  They made a lot of demands about how we were going to pay to fix it... nope.  Boss laid down how we saw the situation: you can keep the water free of charge just don't call us for water anymore.  Yall are too stupid to work with.\n\nNever heard from them again.

        "selftext": "This is a story my father-in-law (F) told me about his mother-in-law (MIL) who had money but was notoriously cheap with it. Dinner at her place could be a bit of an ordeal. Food was the cheapest available, the portions were so tiny you'd be hungrier when you finished than before you started and she would do things like buy a super value no-frills supermarket own brand pack of mini bite size pies or chicken Kiev intended for parties and serve one per person as a main dish. She also watered down sauces, soups and drinks mercilessly. \n\nOne year the extended family were getting together as usual for Christmas dinner at MIL's house. This comprised several nuclear family groups, each of which traditionally provided one course and this year it was MIL's turn to provide the wine. \n\nWhen MIL sent F to the kitchen to fetch the wine, all he could see was a single bottle of the cheapest substance you could possibly call wine. It had a plain white label with no text other than \"value sweet dessert wine\" and the supermarket's logo. F said he wouldn't even have risked cooking with the stuff. Even if it were higher quality, sweet dessert wine would probably not have been a pleasant accompaniment for the main course.\n\nFortunately, F had a trick up his sleeve.\n\nReturning to the dining room, he asked MIL as discreetly as he could if she didn't have anything a bit nicer for Christmas dinner. Her response was, \"No. I prefer this. It's my favourite, you'll like it just fine.\"\n\nSo F went back and opened MIL's crappy cheap dessert wine and also a bottle of really nice wine he'd brought with him, which he hid behind his back as he poured MIL's glass of plonk. When she saw the other bottle she started yelling about having some respect for his mother-in-law. All he said in response was, \"You said you preferred this one, so I made sure you got your favourite. What's the problem here?\"\n\nEveryone else really enjoyed the nice wine.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: I may have inadvertently made my father-in-law come across as a wine snob. He definitely isn't a wine snob, but by all accounts this stuff was so poor quality it was pretty much undrinkable (it was also too sweet to go with the food). The stuff he brought wouldn't have been show-off expensive, just nice. He doesn't drink wine often.",

We weren\u2019t in a great place, but I was blindsided. I was also served with a protection order that stated I could not come home without prior written permission, I had to go through my wife to see the kids etc. and it was in effect for 90 days. I was devastated. \n\nA relative connected me with a bulldog of a lawyer. This lady was brilliant and no-nonsense. She filed a rebuttal to the protection order, but told me these things take time and we were unlikely to see a judge before the 90 days were up. She was VERY clear that I must follow the court order to the letter. If there was ANY evidence otherwise, I\u2019d be in an uphill battle if/when my wife renewed it. \n\nIt only took one day before my now ex needed me to take the kids. I had crashed at a friend\u2019s house, so I had no place to take them. So we agreed I\u2019d watch them at home. I waited a few blocks away while waiting for an email. Ex called me and I reminded her of the details of the order and that I wouldn\u2019t come until I had permission. This happened twice more that I waited down the street within the first week. So I told her I wouldn\u2019t leave where I was staying until I had the email.  It was about 20 minutes away. I texted her to remind her. \n\nThe very next day she again didn\u2019t email. We were planning on me picking up the kids to take them to school since their school was only a few minutes from my work. However, because I had not received written permission, I ran out of time to drive to pick up the kids and then make it to their school and work. \n\nShe called furious that I wasn\u2019t there. I reminded her about the permission, and that I was out of time. She ended up being VERY late to work that day. \n\nShe then wanted to write me blanket permission to come and go \u201cas needed,\u201d but my lawyer advised against it. Follow the order. \n\nThe culmination of this was a few weeks later when she again forgot to send permission. Her boyfriend was staying over, but didn\u2019t have his car with him. They both had to get to work, and that was the day I learned that he was her direct supervisor. Ex had to call a friend from work to pick up kids and take them to school, and the friend found out. Of course it got out at their work. Within a week of that, the boyfriend was fired over their relationship and my ex was suspended. \n\nBy this time, I had my own place, so the kids ended up staying with me most days. \n\nI later learned that the protection order was the boyfriend\u2019s idea.  Ex was quite mad about it as it  turned into evidence that I wasn\u2019t a threat to her or the family, and the judge was quite harsh with her over it when we settled for support and parenting time. She called it \u201cintentional and harmful parental alienation.\u201d",

            "This is the second part that was removed from pro revenge. I\u2019ll maybe fix it later there. This is the second half of a decade long tale that is currently resolving in a delightful way.  \n\nA decade ago my then-wife (now ex-wife) began a relationship with a guy and kicked me out of my house. The boyfriend was instrumental in blindsiding me and planning on how to keep me from my own kids. Ever since, I\u2019ve kinda hated him. \n\nI\u2019ve always been polite and respectful with Boyfriend because he\u2019d become my kids step dad. But if swore if ever I had the chance I\u2019d get back at him. I figured it would be something petty, but then he gift wrapped my revenge and I\u2019ve been running with it for ALMOST 3 WEEKS NOW.\n\nMy kids are mostly grown now. Some in university some in grades 11-12. The uni kids live with me while the high school still go back and forth with their mom. I\u2019m also remarried now. \n\nMy wife and I each have our own vehicles, but my wife owns and insures a minivan for when we all are going somewhere together. The kids are free to use it too as only one has a car. We only have one set of keys, so I put and AirTag on it. It\u2019s a little transponder that tracks its location. I put it on there in case the keys were lost. \n\nAbout 3 weeks ago, one of my older kids took the van out for the night, but ended up staying at his mom\u2019s on the couch. Around 7am the next day, another kid asked to use the van. I pinged the AirTag only to find out it was hours away in an industrial section of another town. I was quite concerned why my kid was out there. \n\nI called him up, and he was at his moms where he said he\u2019d be. He had no idea the van was missing. I called the police and gave them the location of the van. Within 20 minutes they had stopped the van and the driver said he had permission to use it. Lo and behold, it\u2019s my ex wife\u2019s Boyfriend. \n\nThe police weren\u2019t very interested in detaining him as it would be easier for him to just drive the van back to our town and we could sort it out here. However, it wasn\u2019t my van nor was he listed on the insurance to drive it. I asked that it be impounded. In Canada we can\u2019t \u201cpress charges\u201d but I was adamant that this was theft and that I wasn\u2019t going to let it go. Since the guy was out of town with no ride, the police did end up detaining him probably because it was easier. \n\nI was given info for the yard where the van was impounded. Since we had the next day off, my wife and I drove out to the yard to pick it up. When we got there, I first checked for damage since it was sitting a little low. Nothing outside. When I checked inside, I found that it was was LOADED with industrial fasteners and cable. Think seismic mitigation. Turns out Boyfriend used my wife\u2019s van to pick up stuff for work. \n\nMy wife turns on her heels and walks to the office. I had to jog to keep up. She asks who has access to the van? They have the only set of keys, so my wife is assured only her or me. At this point I get where she\u2019s going with this. I instruct them that NO ONE access the van but us. I had $35 with me, so I gave it to them as a tip. They promised me that no one would get in there, and they actually moved the van into a secured area within the yard.  Then we went home without the van. \n\nWe weren\u2019t even home from the long drive when I got the first text from Boyfriend about getting the equipment. I explain that we left the van as there were expenses we were not going to pay. Towing, impounding fees, daily storage. I told him that he\u2019d have to pay for them BEFORE I pick up the van. He was super mad and swore he\u2019ll pay me back. I said no way. \n\nWithin an hour I got a call from his boss. They need the equipment ASAP for a time sensitive job. I explain that it was impounded and that I won\u2019t have time to get it until next week now. And it has to be paid in advance. Boss swears up and down at me. I calmly explain that I didn\u2019t steal a vehicle to transport his stuff. Boss was having none of that so I said I won\u2019t tolerates that abuse and hung up. Then I blocked him and his company on every platform I\u2019m reachable on. \n\nAnd that was three weeks ago. Since then I\u2019ve been able to make excuses every single time Boyfriend tries to arrange picking up the van. Often because the kids don\u2019t have the van so I have to drive them. Boss has gotten through a few times using other numbers and sent a ton of emails that I ignore, but I did reply and explain that both my wife and I need about 4 hours to do the round trip and that it needs to be paid for ahead of time. And it\u2019s added up. $25 a day for secure storage plus towing and impound fees, etc. Plus I wanted to be paid for the fuel BF used as well as our travel. Boyfriend and I  agreed on the standard $0.58 per km, and so the boss e-transferred us for the total cost of our driving. By now the van has made 1 trip and our car has done 2. It came to almost $600. \n\nSo on Friday it finally happened. My wife and I drove out and picked up the van. It was prepaid and ready to be released. I dropped off a dozen beer at the office when I picked up the keys and went to grab the van. However, I wasn\u2019t going to transport boss and Boyfriend\u2019s stuff so I arranged for it to be held at the yard at the same rate as a vehicle, unloaded it and left right before it closed for the weekend. I got a call from Boyfriend asking when he can come by with a work truck to get the stuff. I told him it\u2019s still at the impound almost 2 hours away and the office opens Monday at 9. There was only silence on the other end, so I hung up after about 10 seconds. \n\nThrough this I\u2019ve been getting vague updates from my ex, who I\u2019ve got a good relationship with now. She was livid with Boyfriend and was clear with me that any and all consequences were squarely on him. He\u2019s kept his job, but is missing the next pay increase and is not getting his year end bonus. Ex said they\u2019re way to short staffed to let him go, but he\u2019s in the dog house at home and at work. No word on criminal charges for taking the van, but crown handles that, and I\u2019m not suing in civil court.",

This is also early 2000s where the term \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d wasn\u2019t coined so seeing a grown man openly sobbing at his desk like this really threw people off.\n\nwhen asked by coworkers and people passing by what happened, i told everyone what happened to my dog AND that i didn\u2019t even have a chance to take care of her body so she was lying in my bed dead wrapped in my blanket until i could get home and figure out her cremation/burial stuff. when they asked why i was even at work, i very loudly stated that my manager didn\u2019t think it was an acceptable excuse to miss work. \n\nneedless to say, she looked like a monster and i was told by her boss i\u2019d have 2 days paid to mourn and take care of my dog and i shouldn\u2019t have had to come in.\n\nEDIT: didn\u2019t realize this post would get so much attention. also love all the people sharing their stories. this has been an uncharacteristically uplifting post on this sub with mostly warm comments and only one toxic/troll comment that i\u2019ve counted haha.",

It always begins the same way- see things plainly for what they are, understand the natures of the things involved, and respond reasonably and virtuously to the reality around us.\n\nEvery day I care for my animals, keeping them happy, keeping them safe, shepherding them through their day with joy, and without harm. When they get old and approach death, nothing changes. As crazy as it sounds, the day I take them to the vet to be put down is the day that I have been working for all this time - I have successfully taken them the whole way. They did not get lost, they were not unhappy, they got to live their whole natural lives the way I wanted them to live it. We made it. We got there together.\n\nWhen they are gone, my feelings for them don't change. Their bodies are taken but my feelings are my own; I still love them, I am still happy to think of them, my heart is still open.\n\nWhat has changed is that I have a space for another thing to love, and the cycle continues again, when I'm ready to start anew.\n\nTheir bodies, our bodies, everything external to us will always change and always come and go. Our love, our care, our joy belongs to us, and we apply it to what we have and to what is new.",

And while our boss was later forced to apologize, you could tell he was doing so \"because of some bullshit HR thing,\" with the speed-reading speech and eye rolling. I am so glad I don't work for that guy anymore.\n\nI haven't had a cat since I was a kid, but if someone said that about one of my dogs? I would really had to suppress some of my baser instincts to correct my boss' behavior permanently, and would probably just walk out of the building without another word.

I don't get the machismo some people have \"getting over it.\"  I can't conceive of what horrible childhood someone must have had.\n\nBut then again, I have seen actual documented work policies about funeral leave that confuse me.  One place I worked at said you could take at maximum 3 days of bereavement for a parent, sibling, or biological child, but only one for a grandparent, step parent, step child, adopted child (!), or half-sibling, and only with prior manager's authorization.

He looked like a miniature black panther, had a fitting personality too and when you looked in his eyes you could've gotten lost in them. Anyways, the other two died of old age with 17 and 18 respectively. Say what you want, we take good care of them, that's a pretty decent age, especially since one of them was a stray who lived on the street for quite a while before we got her. But yeah, I dealt with that same loss.  \nI would ALWAYS give someone paid leave for several days, until they took care of everything and were at least somewhat stable again. Sure, One can't expect to get weeks off, but a few days should always be the case for something like this. I have to assume OP's boss never had pets, or else they would be able to understand. A shame, really.",

Right onto the highway and got hit by a pickup truck. I knew the truck and the owner. He didn\u2019t stop just kept going. The bus was right behind him and if we missed that bus our mom would kill us!! So we had to get on the bus all of us crying our eyes out. I was in high school and I balled my eyes out for the 1 st 3 periods of classes. Then comes 4th period. NJROTC! I walk in and put my books down. I overhear one of the instructors GUNNY talking about how he needs to take his truck and get it cleaned so he can assess the damage at lunch period which was next. I walk in and look at that man with all the anger, hurt, and disgust I felt and said \u201cyeah since you ran over our damn dog and just kept going!\u201d I was just sooo mad and hurt. He turned bright red and mumbled an apology and then walked off. My mom came and checked me out before then end of class. My baby brother who was in kindergarten was having issues so the teacher called her. When she got there he told her what happened so checked all of out of school. I thought it was so we could mourn nope!! She made us go get the carcass and carry it home and bury her. Mind you we lived about half a mile or so from the busstop that on the hwy.

The idea behind property guardians is that disused buildings are far more secure if they are occupied, so owners of empty properties will allow people to live there temporarily for incredibly cheap price. So the guardian gets to live in a (usually quite interesting) disused building incredibly cheaply, the owner makes a small additional bit of income and has someone keeping their eye on the place. This arrangement is usually done through a 3rd party Guardian company, who act as the intermediary.\n\nThis particular advert was for a pub that had recently closed, my interest piqued so I went along to a viewing.

We all picked our rooms, I got the bar area - a huge room with en suite ladies and gents toilets, a big fireplace and cosy pub decor. We also had full use of the sizeable pub kitchen, beer cellar, dish washing room, double garage, car park and a massive garden with a BBQ area.\n\nFor the most part, it was a great gig. I got to live in a pub, have all the space I wanted, and as the building was due to be destroyed, we could pretty much do what we liked with the internals. I put up curtains and temporary walls and made it my cosy home for the next couple of years. Other guardians moved in and out over the months, but myself and a couple of others were there for the long term. Aside from the odd dodgy person coming and going (I had two of my tyres slashed at one point, but that's another story), all was pretty cushy.\n\nThe owner of the Guardian company, and thus the person I paid my rent to, was a large red faced man who was quite full of himself. He tended to be quite bossy and sometimes aggressive, but I stayed out of his way. As long as I paid my rent and didn't cause him trouble, he left me alone. All until the end of the \"tenancy\". I had moved out, returned my keys and I was awaiting the return of my security deposit.\n\nAt some point, a car had been dumped on the property. I hadn't noticed, because one of the previous guardians, who I will call Rob, had pushed it round to the back of the property and had been working on it. I just assumed it was his car. The first of the emails from The Guardian Company read:\n\n>The Volvo dumped in the car park was not reported to us and must be removed from the site. Rob has declined to take responsibility of the vehicle and has alleged it was reported to the police and yet none of you have reported to us on such a serious issue. I would suggest that it be placed on the public highway and then the police will deal with whomever owns the vehicle.\n\nWait... did you just incite us to commit fly tipping?\n\nI emailed back and said the car wasn't my responsibility, and thus I won't be moving it. Things went back and forth like this for a while, withe the owner insisting that we were all responsible. (Emphasis here means it's important later.)\n\n>Stop arguing as I don't care and if it's not gone then you will all be accountable to the issue. Rob was contacted and has said its not his and now **the burden falls on all of you** that knew about the car and failed to report it.\n\nAt this point, I mentioned small claims court as an idle threat to see what would happen...\n\n>You have failed to report an incident that is something that is detrimental to the property. You are in breach of the license for failing to do so. Happy to see you in court and explaining that **you were put into the building to act as security by occupation** and while there you failed to report a dumped car.\n\nRight. It's on. I pulled out the contract and went back over it with a fine tooth comb. At this point, another email came through...\n\n>Dear All,  \n>  \n>Please be aware that you were all under license at the property and not tenants and had no tenancy rights as is clearly stated in the license that you all agreed to and signed. Under the license **you act as security for the property** and were responsible for reporting any incidents and also were responsible for keeping the property safe, secure and as stated any items left will be charged for removal. The items left were dumped outside and certainly were not there throughout your time on site and must have been placed there by one or more of you.\n\nThis was accompanied by photographs of even more stuff that other guardians had left in the property, furniture etc. But I wasn't going to be responsible for any of their stuff. This guy thought he could bully us out of our money because we didn't have a legal tenancy and were therefore not covered by UK laws protecting tenants. I wasn't going down without a fight.\n\nWe may not be covered by tenants rights, so everything would fall back to basic contract law. I found the interesting parts of the occupation licence agreement that I had with the Guardian company:\n\n>\"Damage Security Payment' means the amount payable by the guardian \\[...\\] to cover the cost of any damages caused by the guardian.\n\nBut not anybody else... and since this contract is between myself and The Guardian Company with no \"jointly and severally liable\" clause, I can't be held responsible for anyone else's mess. Great. But there's more... this one is interesting:\n\n>\"3.1 The Guardian Company provide services to property owners to, among other benefits, secure premises against trespassers and protect such premises from damage. The Guardian Company has agreed to provide such services to the owner in respect of the property.\"\n\nSo WE don't provide security, that's the responsibility of The Guardian Company, which we're not a part of. But wait, there's more:\n\n>The Guardian will:  \n>  \n>10.1.10 Not remove anything from the property, other than things that s/he brought there\n\nBOOM. Gotcha.\n\nI fired back an email:\n\n>Please see Section 3.1 of the Licence Agreement signed by myself and The Guardian Company owner. It stipulates that You, The Guardian Company, provide security. Not us, the guardians.  \n>  \n>Please also see Section 10.1.10. Given that I did not bring either the car or the furniture onto the property, it would in fact be a breach of your own licence agreement for me to remove it. In this case, I will be complying with your contract and thus will not remove the items that I did not bring on to the property.  \n>  \n>Please return my security deposit within 3 working days, or I will be forced to take legal action.\n\nTheir response:\n\n>At this point we are happy to see you in court and please do not contact us unless via your solicitor as we will be charging for our time to deal with such matters. If you can demonstrate who is responsible for leaving the items for us to deal with we will look at this. But as stated previously these items were not there previously and have dumped them outside. All of you failed to report the car.\n\nSounds like he was shaken up a little and probably hoped I was bluffing. Unfortunately for him, I wasn't. I filed the court papers after three working days.\n\nHe caved as soon as he received the court papers, and realised that I wasn't bluffing. He repaid our deposits, along with my court fees the very next day.\n\nVictory.  \n\n\n*Edit: Formatting, and re-worded the ending because people were getting confused.*",

        "selftext": "The software company I worked for got acquired.  Some people were let go, some were added, and some teams and functions were restructured.  Prior to acquisition, we had a \"multiple hats\" situation where you basically did whatever was in your capacity, teams played to each other's strengths, and one person would generally take a client from the first demo right through the configuration, implementing, and training phases of the software.  Some of us had strengths in technical areas, others had a decade+ in the clients' subject matter.  Clients would give us some feedback or wish lists.  We'd talk amongst the team about how the functionality could be added or changed, make a functional mock-up, and then bring that to the Development team for polish and integration into the production code.  It worked wonderfully.  Like, 100% positive feedback and nothing broken when it went to production.  We had a good rapport with the Dev guys and some of us were able to write queries or code portions that would save them from having to ask a billion subject matter questions.  When we weren't dedicated to a task, we'd handle support calls.  Clients would call up, receptionist learned who to pass things to based on clients and the nature of issues, and resolution was typically instantaneous unless the problem required research.  Clients loved that and had the understanding that if we couldn't resolve their problem right away, it was because we needed to look into it.\n\nAfter the acquisition, the parent company reorganized things into a much more rigid \"you have one job\" type of scenario.  The trouble was, with the people they let go, I was the singular remaining source of a lot of the capacities we provided.  It left me working with the Sales, Product Improvement/Concept, Product Evangelism, Implementation, Development, Data Conversion, and Support teams.  Initially, I didn't mind.  Wasn't any different than my previous role.  Things started nicely enough with the company CEO genuinely asking, \"Would you mind helping X team with Y project?\", and he'd pick up my travel bar tabs and toss me a day off here and there.  It was a fair exchange and he treated it as though I was doing him a favor.  But at some point all these other departments expected then demanded my time.  Instead of people asking when I could help them on a project, I would just find time blocks added to my schedule for various things.  A couple of times I was supposed to be chairing these meetings and having things prepared and no one even bothered to tell me.  Around this same time, I noticed a lot of recommendations I made when asked for input were being overturned by people in new roles who had no idea what they were talking about.  As in literally had no exposure to the subject matter and had never even seen the software, plus no programming/logic or database experience.  So my input is demanded but also ignored.  And this was causing more demands on my time when things were broken or didn't meet client expectation.  Plus, the new Dev team I was working with made every excuse not to act unless someone went and confirmed and fetched everything they needed.  The external demands on my time had increased and I had coincidentally hit a few walls with my actual job in that clients were unresponsive and couldn't get me the data or access I needed to complete tasks.  But that didn't stop my boss from demanding documentation and results and documentation about the results.  There was no such thing as \"waiting\", it's your duty to call and harass the powerless client until whatever third party involved enables whatever we need.\n\nI was really unhappy in a job I had previously loved.  Every day was worse than the last.  And then I got my employee review.  It was top notch and yet I got the same \"cost of living\" raise as everyone else.  It particularly burned my ass that the Sales guys were getting commission on sales that I FUCKING MADE and I was just shafted.  At the original company, effort above and beyond was WELL-rewarded.  I doubled my starting salary in a few years' time for hard work.  Now, I was miserable, overdrawn, AND got nothing for it.  I was having daily arguments with my boss who was completely indifferent to all my commitments and refused to understand  that I couldn't compel third party companies to do my timely bidding to get client data or access.\n\nOut of nowhere I get a call from the head of the Data Conversions department.  He says a few of his people have noticed some high-level solutions to Dev or data problems in the Teams chats \"come out of some random guy from Implementations in no-time.\"  Then he was talking to a preexisting client about converting a set of financial data from a legacy system I had converted some Building, Code, Fire, Planning, and Police data from and they asked if they could have me do it specifically because my conversion of their other data was \"flawless\" and I granted them some change requests on the way through to make their lives easier(simple changes to record type names for easier identification, clip leading spaces or extra zeroes so they could put reports in Excel...stuff like that). He said the client, \"wouldn't stop fucking gushing\" about me and he was floored to hear that I had done the whole thing myself where his team typically breaks the responsibilities between 5 or more people.  He offered me a position on the spot and I told him I was interested and I'd think about it. He told me I could start doing some part time stuff with him a few hours a week if I wanted it that way.  Then he told me he \"saw the bullshit I was dealing with\" and said he'd \"get the other departments off my fucking plate.\"  I liked him right away.  My current boss then interrupted our call seeing me talking to that guy on our in-house phone app and demanded to know what I was wasting my time on.  Then she proceeded to berate me about open orders and my lack of documentation about their lack of progress.  \"You got time to bullshit with him but you can't call a client.\" I tried to tell her for the millionth time about all the expectations from the other departments, the obligations they leave beyond their allotted timeframes, the inability I have to force other companies do things for us no matter how many times I tell the client...  She told me, \"I'm done with your excuses.  Just do your job and shut up.\"  I called the Conversions head right back and asked how soon I could transfer to his Department full time.  He said, \"Fuckin....YESTERDAY, man, this is such good news!  I was just talking to [Assistant Department Manager] and he 'bout shit his pants when I said I think I got you part time!  Take the rest of the day off, have a beer to celebrate, I'll handle the transfer and we'll see you in the morning.\"  And that was that.\n\nI did as my new boss commanded and had a beer to celebrate.  A wave of relief came over me after months of tension.  The following day I told the vampire departments and my previous boss in no uncertain terms that I was done helping them.  It went unacknowledged and they continued adding things to my calendar.  So I deleted them, did MY job, and shut up.  THINGS. GOT. UGLY.  I'm not super-talented or anything but I was literally the only person they had for a lot of things and things went to shit.  Most of it requires institutional knowledge I had spent years acquiring so they couldn't even hire someone to do the things.  And rather than come ask me for help, people made demands and attacks!  And I got flat out beligerant about it.  In an email with the CEO cced, the Support manager asked why I \"couldn't be bothered\" to help them anymore.  I said, \"for the same reason you can't 'be bothered' to clean the toilets or recable the building.  Not my job.  [Previous Boss] told me to 'just do my job and shut up.'  Take it up with her.\"  The Sales/Evangelist guys tried to go over my head and asked my new boss if I could do some of their demos.  He said, \"sure, if you come over here and do some of his conversions.\"  Numbers tanked for the departments I was previously involved with.  Support in particular.  They went from a 2 hour avg resolution time to EIGHT DAYS.  Sales for my product line went down from 85% success to less than 25%(CEO reported that sales dropped over 60 percent from 85, don't know the exact).  Dev and product went from 100% customer satisfaction to 60%.  Implementations has been completely unable to install certain components which led to at least one contract cancellation and demand for a refund.\n\nAnd in true storybook fashion, my previous boss's boss, the one who gave me my previous employee review and who is a childhood friend of the CEO, told me privately that the CEO noticed, \"all the departments UnFocusMyChi stopped working for suddenly saw their worst numbers in company history...weird.\", and asked, \"anything in particular that pushed the guy over the edge?\"  Previous boss's boss explained that I was pissed about the review/raise having nothing to do with merit or effort, the demand from other departments, unrealistic and impossible expectations, and the idiotic requirement for documentation.  So, this year and going forward there are two criteria for yearly raises.  Individual output, and department output.  No raises for people with negative performance numbers.  Upon that announcement, some department heads up and quit and others changed positions internally.  Meanwhile, I have written a few utilities for my team that have saved THOUSANDS of hours of manual work.  Our numbers are SOARING where they were previously up and down and my new boss is \"driving the whole bus full of our laughing asses all the way to the bank.\"",

When it reaches the point where I have to spend 10% of my time writing down a description of what I was doing and why, it just becomes too much trouble to help someone with their issues quickly - they need to schedule a meeting so it can be documented and several tasks can be covered under that one umbrella.  Now when I see someplace wanting increased tracking, I start looking for someplace else to work.",
            "I love this whole story, but I keep coming back to the part where under the original owner, even the *receptionist* had picked up enough diagnostic knowledge to route the caller to the right person.  \n\n\nIt's not remarkable because receptionists are \"supposed\" to be dumb; it's remarkable because the workplace culture encouraged everyone to share what they knew in a way that organically enriched and optimized the entire workforce.  A particular employee might have some special skill, but the comprehension required to grasp that *this* call is best resolved by *this* skillholder might well be described as basic while also acknowledging that few people grasp the required basis.  No one schooled the receptionist; they picked it up by actually listening to callers, by talking to the employees they routed the calls to, by maybe initially just being curious how Joe Codeguy helped Jane Prodline stop the edges coming out square. The skill to route calls to the right person the first time around is as valuable as the grasp of a particular client's setup and needs.  \n\n\nThe second you start trying to quantify and mass produce that kind of magic, it evaporates.  If this were a romantic scenario we'd call it chemistry, and we'd all know why selling a kit that recreates everything from the place settings at the restaurant to the outfits a famously compatible couple were wearing on their first date could only strike that spark of connection in another couple by accident.  \n\n\nSince this is a business dealing in technology, people only see the technology and forget the people involved, and thus the \"winning formula\" is somehow consistently and tragically diminished in a way that can't possibly be anyone's *fault*, even if it is dumped on someone to fix.  \n\n\nI keep coming back to the receptionist because that sounds like someone on the front line of the chopping block when the company is acquired.  And if the acquiring CEO had bothered to ask why stuff was going wrong, the receptionist might also have been one of the people so \"low\" that their perspective might be considered objective in regard to why stuff wasn't working out.",

            "About 20 years ago, I started planning my exit after annual raises paid out equally regardless of merit, for the 2nd year in a row. I was pissed off. Me and a handful of other road warriors spent weeks and months onsite, sometimes on the other side of the country, only to get the same shitty raises as those who rarely worked on the road. Why should I/we spend so much time away from our families for no extra compensation. \"Atta boys\" don't read to my child. One of the office ladies had the audacity to say we were lucky to get to travel all over for free. Although I did do some sightseeing of cool places, I was usually too tired after working 7am to 9pm to do so. Except when we were on the road for 2-3 weeks straight and got Sundays off. 80+ hours per week on salary. I was gone in a few months and will never work like that again. My lovely wife was understanding but there were several divorces and the road time def had a part in it.",

The old system maximized the unique talents that worked there, and the benefits flowed from it.\n\nIn fact their \"just do your job\" attitude leads to overstaffing. Instead of having a data conversion wizard do that task when needed and be a superstar at it, they make data conversion a required duty for a bunch of people who aren't nowhere near as good at it. So it takes longer and has rework.\n\nI had a similar experience of working for a boss that just wanted the work done and didn't micromanage, dictate the \"how\" or pile on a bunch of processes that had no value. It was wonderful. He re-wrote our processes to be exceptionally vague and let us do it whatever way we thought best. Sometimes it blew up, but not often, and no process would have prevented it. But each of us got to contribute our best skills and contribute to great results for a while.\n\nHappy for you, OP!",
