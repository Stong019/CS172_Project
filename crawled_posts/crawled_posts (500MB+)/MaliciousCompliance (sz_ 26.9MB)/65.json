        "selftext": "The usual, TL;DR at bottom, on mobile yada yada.\n\nI am a social worker with a moderate sized nonprofit compared to the city we are in. We serve individuals with disabilities in a variety including on site and in the community.\n\nAbout a year and a half ago, our exec director retired after 15ish years. They were an awesome person, but due to age and some health problems, had kind of checked out or running the organization. The new director came from a much larger for profit organization, and seemed to feel that money is king, and the only way to be respected is to be feared. She was a Monster in every sense of the word.\n\nNow, being a nonprofit, our pay isn't fantastic, and the benefits aren't stellar, but the one thing they were good at was the vacation roll-over. We were allowed to keep 200 hours of roll-over, and while it took some time to build up, those of us that had been there a while tried keeping our hours somewhere around there (this is our vacation and sick time put together). New director decides that our entire vacation policy is too generous, and 1, cuts our accrual rate (I personally lost almost 2 full weeks a year), and the major kicker, tells us we can only keep 80 hours of roll-over.\n\nAgain, I get it, COVID hit us hard, everyone has to be expected to make some cuts somewhere, but see, the problem is, she told everyone this the first week of October, and we had to be down to 80 by January 1st. Anything over 80 just goes away. We tried negotiating, we tried offering alternatives, we asked for exemptions by a few months. She would absolutely not hear it, and finally said the next person who asked about our PTO policy would be walked out of the building. So, my coworkers and I came up with a plan.\n\nEnter the compliance. I will admit, this only worked because the rest of our administration team felt the director was horrible, and Also lost their PTO time too. We All put in for vacation at the same time. Even those that really didn't need to because they were closer to 80 hours anyway. We literally had 85% of our staff off for weeks at a time. We worked it out amongst ourselves that we had just enough staff to ensure work was done to keep us compliant with the state, but anything above and beyond that ground to a halt. I also need to clarify that we are Not an emergency service, so the clients we serve did not lose our on essential supports.\n\nWell, our board meeting comes around in December, and the new director has to try and explain why there was such a drastic drop in revenue over the last month and a half. Apparently she didn't give a good enough answer, because the board started talking to the employees and SR management for the first time since the new director came on. Let me tell you, we did not hold back. After hearing the horror stories of some of the other stuff she was doing, the board promptly decided that having her in charge was (according to the all staff email that got sent out), \"Not going to lead us in a direction that would lead to long-term success and stability for our organization\", and kicked her ass to the curb.\n\nI am happy to say they found a new director who has already gone above and beyond what we could have hoped for, and our staff and most importantly our clients are hopefully on the path to many years of success.\n\nTL;DR Crazy new director fucks with vacation time, starts a path that eventually gets her canned.",

            "I had a job that let us accrue loads of PTO, but would guilt any of us for actually taking it. I cancelled a week-long vacation once because my boss demanded it; my time off had been approved prior, but then we had some dumb project I HAD to stay and work on. When I quit 6 months later, they had to pay me out nearly $3k in PTO hours and freaked out. My boss asked me why my final check was so large and I said \u201cguess it would have been cheaper to let me go on my damn vacation, huh?\u201d\n\nTLDR do not fuck with PTO unless you love destroying morale and losing $$",
            "Did your PTO accrual get bumped back up to where it should be? Nothing is going to replace being forced to take that vacation to a schedule you didn't want, but the cap and accrual should be reset to what they were.\n\nGlad the idiot got the chance to look for a new opportunity. Hope no other nonprofit is having to suffer...",
            "Similar situation a friend ran into a few years ago. They were given the option of having OT paid on their check, or banking it. My friend elected to bank it, and never booked any days off. He'd cash it in at the end of the year.  \n\nNew Policy: No cashing in your OT, you either book the time off by the end of the year, or you lose the PTO.  \n\nMy friend would start at 7am and most days would work until 4:30 or so. It was a small manufacturing outfit, and he worked material handling-shipping-receiving. He would receive shipments of raw materials, package outgoing shipments of completed product, and bring the raw to the machines and take away the finished pieces.  \n\nSo, in compliance with the directive, he went past his boss (a dick), and straight to HR, and booked all of December and most of November off. HR signed off on it, they had no choice.  \n\nHe was the ONLY licensed forklift driver on staff.  \n\nBoss tried to assign others to that role, but the Health and Safety Rep blocked it because they weren't certified Forklift Operators. Certification courses were looked at, but they were expensive, and in addition they would need Dangerous Goods certification as well.  \n\nIt was a complete shitshow. Boss had to bring in Temps, and spend most of his days directly supervising them, telling them in detail what needs to go where. Costly mistakes and delays by the dozens.",

            "Glad this worked out for you!\n\nWe had a newly appointed Director who was an absolute terror. So much so, our workplace engaged an organisational psychologist to speak with us to find out what was happening. Thank God she wasn't my line manager though we crossed swords more than once.\n\nI literally came in on whilst on leave to ensure I had my allocated 10 minute meeting. \n\nI walked out an hour later. I unloaded every reason why that workplace was a dysfunctional place. I gave examples of everything. In 26+ years in the Department, that has single handedly been the most dysfunctional unit I have ever been in and I shared this experience. A shed load of which was due to this one person. I literally had people ring me on my weekend crying as she was their line manager. WTF.\n\nI was assured the interview was going to be confidential.\n\nBull. Crap.\n\nAbout six months later, my line manager dropped into the conversation some of the comments I had made in that interview. \n\nLesson learned.\n\nI'm in a new area - role has its challenges but it's a great place. Same Department. I'd been looking elsewhere anyway.\n\nI liked the people I used to work with, but will never ever engage with organisational psychologists or consultants appointed to investigate anything ever again. If I ever get asked, my answer will be nope. If it's mandatory, my answer is still nope.\n\nGot tenure. Talk to my union.\n\nAnd yes, any chance I get I will casually white ant that management team. Even 5 years later.\n\nFunny thing is, that Director went to work elsewhere in our Department. Within three months, she was stood down for an investigation into her management style. She took a $30K pa pay cut to work there, so I suspect she was working towards getting an exec role. My Senior Director was even asked why he gave her a glowing reference.\n\nUmm. Can think of maybe one reason.\n\nOne of our other Directors had a quiet chat to her current line manager about her experience with this person.\n\nShe's still there. I don't really care as we are unlikely to ever work in the same team together again. But I think those potential dreams of an exec role are probably toasted. Door has closed where she used to work too.\n\nKarma.",
            "My first job told me that because I was part time I didn\u2019t get vacation time. Except I worked full time for parts of the year so it tracked my time anyways. I worked there for 2 years and then I moved stores to a new region and low and behold local laws required part time employees still get vacation/sick time and because my first store didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever be able to use them they let them roll over all the hours instead of just the 100 hours or w/e. Would have been great except no one told me for the first half the year I worked there. It was nov/dec when I got told hey you have a bunch of hours you have to use or you lose em. I checked my time and I had more than two full months of pay. So I started just calling out of shifts and using vacation as sick time. \n\nLuckily the stores had some leniency on policy and had me come in and move my hours around to not lose too many. I could deposit hours into my sick time that would roll over. Then they let me use hours to make my schedule 40 hours even though i was only working 20-30. Hoping that would stop me from calling out. I went into the new year with most of my hours and a lot more money. \n\n\nThen I actually needed some time off. Some of my managers hated me and were envious I had more experience than them so I had more pull in the company than them. (Basically jealous I got special treatment over my hours) so they denied my request. I realized that I hated my job because of my managers so I just called out for an entire month.  Best part is when I came back I told them I couldn\u2019t come back and needed to go seasonal. I ended up quitting a year later and they still had to pay me like 2 full weeks of work.",

            "Too many leaders, especially in non-profits, fail to understand that they are there to serve the employees as well as the constituents. Non-profit employees that are actually good could  EASILY make more somewhere else, they work in nonprofit because they want to for all sorts of reasons.\n\nIf you want to lead non profit orgs you need to understand that you need good employees, and if you want to retain good employees you have to have the attitude that THEY are your clients as much as the board or anyone else. That doesn't mean you never make hard decisions and ask them to toe the line sometimes, but make sure they are wise and fair.  Good employees will back good leaders.",
            "My wife was a mental health therapist for a non-profit for a while. Their benefits weren't great, and they were overworked, and then they were all told that they weren't getting raises because times were tough and they hadn't shown that they deserved them. This was the same year that the CEO made $2.5 million. In rural Indiana. And then they didn't understand why turnover was so high.",
            "This is why America needs more unions.",
            "This is why not-for-profits have to be careful about bringing in people from the profit center to run things.\n\nOne of my first jobs was as an employment librarian for a NFP.  We had a team of 8 people working to get people with disabilities employed, and had all been there from the beginning.  The pay was not great (I could have been making 25% more in the for profit world) but the perquisites were excellent for a guy who had a young family.  Flexible hours within reason, if the school called I could say \"I've got to go\" and there was no problem.  Vacation time was excellent, and could be banked for up to three years (which I was never able to do, my kids were in plague school which took a fair amount of vacation time).\n\nThe director over us moved on and they brought someone form the profit sector in to do the job, and she was fine for a month as she found out how everything worked.  Then, one day I came in late (there was a crisis in my daughters classroom and so the teaching assistant and I ran the classroom for an hour while the teacher dealt with the crisis).  Something I did on occasion because the TA wasn't very good at controlling a classroom, and the class had one kid who...was difficult.  Anyways, I left a voice mail for the director and got into work an hour and a half late.\n\nI was told I could not be late like that.  Then we had a team meeting where we were told we could not have so much vacation time banked because it put the program 'at risk'.  We explained to her that we were a team and responsible people and loved the program so there was no risk, and we'd be the only part of the organization that couldn't bank vacation.  Nope, didn't matter.\n\nSo we all tendered our resignations the following week, to the executive director.  He kind of panicked and started interviewing us.  At my interview I pointed out that I was paid 20-30% less than standard for a librarian (which is already the lowest paid profession), but I did it because of the flexibility they gave me so I could be the dad I wanted to be.  If she removes that flexibility, then I'm going elsewhere for the better money for the stricter hours.\n\nThe next day, she was clearing out her desk and raging at us.  I didn't feel bad, it was her own fault.",

That can never be sustainable because it always ends with employees running out or mangler thrown out or promoted away. \n\nIf the manager is a tyrant and personnel is saying yes and thank you to it\u2019s face is mouthing it off, mocking it and call it names etc. No nano particle of respect anywhere. \n\nBe good and kind to your personell, be straight and take no shit nor give it. That will earn you respect and goodwill from employees which is worth a lot especially in a nonprofit.",

            "The way PTO works needs to have Federal minimum standards at this point. If you earn it, it should be yours. They don't expire, the employer cannot take it away, and they must pay it out if employment is terminated for any reason.",
            "If employees are carrying forth 200 hours, that means they were working instead of being off for those 200 hours. Forcing them to use them the hours doesn't save any money at all; it just means 120 fewer productive hours. Oh the irony of forcing employees to take time off even they'd rather be working.",
            "Always check state law when it comes to vacation policy (especially when leaving a company).  I live in a border state & the company I left met minimum state guidelines: since accruing vacay is not mandatory, they did not pay unused vacation pay.  Of course it was not in the personnel guide so when I gave 2 weeks notice I basically had 2 weeks left to take or lose.  Took only about a week since I otherwise liked the company.\n\nNew employer is a government agency in a more liberal state.  You must be paid unused vacation.  The benefits of working for govt are 13-14 annual holidays with pay and can roll unused sick time (accrues at 6 days/yr) toward qualifying in their retirement pension.  Shitty job; great benefits.",

            "Good for you. My company has cut vacation time accrual rates twice in the 22 years I\u2019ve been with them. At 15 years, I earned 8 hours every 2 weeks. The rate was lowered the next year. When I got to 20 years, I was back to that rate. Guess what happened at the end of that year. At 22 years, I earn less time off than I did at 15 or 20.\n\nWhen they lowered the amount we can rollover, at least they paid us out the difference.\n\nThis year, they fumbled the paperwork for my government ID required to enter the workplace. Going on six weeks. Guess who shows up at noon because they can\u2019t find someone to escort them? I still leave work on time. Not my fault your incompetence delays my arrival.",

I'm not coming back for a very long time because I now gotta use all this PTO after my four months of baby leave is up. I don't even want to be gone from work for 7 months, but don't really have much other options, I already tried to work something out with HR.",
            "If it makes you feel any better, the company I work for used to have a similar policy. You could bank 200hrs to carry over and after that, they would pay you out. \n\nCame back from holiday break, and had a company meeting. Everything seemed normal, then at the end we were told the policy was that there is no more roll over. Oh, and the policy is retroactive to the beginning of the year. Anything we had banked would be paid out at retirement at our current (ie; not the rate we make when we retire) rate of pay. \n\nWe didn\u2019t do anything like you did (this was years ago, btw). We just bent over and took it. Good on your for hitting back!  This really needs to happen more, because people like us who roll over paves the way for greedy CEO\u2019s to try it on people like you.

            "That's really weird. \n\nI work in health care for a major non-profit hospital franchise for my state. We got a similar cut back on PTO thing, but this is how it's broken down.\n\nAs a Not For Profit, you can't have a bunch of \"Extra money\" laying around. If you do, that's considered profit. You need to spend what you get and can't accumulate wealth. A company has to have enough money on hand to pay out all PTO if used. Therefore, our companies have a bunch of money on the books which is bad because it looks like profit.\n\nThe thing with COVID shutting down the world is that no one wants to vacation. If no one vacations or takes time off, the PTO bank is getting bigger and bigger. My company is forcing everyone to spend a full week of PTO. In fact, they are making us do it all at the same time. So a state wide healthcare franchise is telling all non-emergency staff to take a week off at the same time. We've already done it twice last year and will do it at least once more this year. If your company can't handle that, I think your company needs to get its shit together. Our company is a shit show and is somehow able to manage it.\n\nNow, the fact they reduce the amount you accrue -- That's the weird part. You signed a contract when you were hired. Unless the contract said they can change it at will, I'd think that's illegal.",
            "The board sucks too, btw. The board almost *always* has to approve employee handbooks, which is a long discussion about things like PTO, dress code (how many shirts do we 'give' put, and what's the cost for replacement of a damaged one? Who's responsible for that cost? Do we keep the last paycheck for unreturned shirts? Is that legal in our state?), drug usage in \"legal\" states (some have a zero tolerance for marijuana use on personal time - which is legal bc weed isn't legal at a federal level), harassment policies, FMLA, bereavement leave, and a host of lots and lots of other tedious policies. \n\nA lot of it is standard, but get a bunch of people together in a room who think they're all brilliant leaders with great ideas, and it turns into a longer discussion. \n\nThat employee handbook, while most employees don't read it, takes up a lot of board time. It's a pretty important piece for non-profits. Even if there was little discussion about it, they approved this PTO policy. \n\nTldr; the board sucks too, and I hope they learned from this.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone. This is my first post on this sub, and this happened just now. This isn't that exciting compared to other posts but here we go. \n\nI work in a lab that employs a LOT of people nationwide, kind of irrelevant but whatever. We get a lot of cases from doctors and hospitals all across the country everyday to run tests they order. Because of the sheet amount of cases we get daily we have a lot of QC that needs to be done by the end of the week, and if it doesn't get done by Saturday night, we have to do a rotation every week to finish it. My actual supervisor said \"we have to stay 4-6 hours OR until everything is done\". \n\nThere's this cynical, old woman who works in my department. She's a massive pain in our ass and sends endless amounts of emails a day, about fixing things that aren't broken, doing something wrong even though we follow her directions, all while she's doing none of her own work. She also happens to be the \"lead\" of our department even though she never sees any of us because she's in the back office, not in the actual lab, she works third shift. \n\nToday is my rotation. It just so happens to be my birthday weekend (my birthday was Friday) and my coworker who I'm doing the rotation with brought breakfast burritos for the two of us. Thankfully there wasn't a lot of work last week and there was minimal QC to do. After we stayed for an hour and were 80% done with our work we took a paid 15 minute break. 16 minutes later we come back into the lab and she starts yelling at us because we went over our time, and she leaves the lab and calls our manager who basically said it doesn't matter since we're still getting the work done. Old Woman comes back and says that we can't leave until the work is done (even though she'll be leaving in about an hour)\n\nOkay then.  \n\nWe finish all of our work about 10 minutes after we came back from break, but since we're still on the clock we're deciding to stay for the entire 6 hours doing mindless work (cleaning already sanitized stations, deleting emails, dusting keyboards, changinf pens, etc) which will cost the company about $300 more (bc of OT pay) on our paychecks. All because we were one minute over. \n\nLike I said, this might not be as exciting as other posts on here, but this is the first time this overworked and underpaid oncology lab worker is doing something like this.",

For breaks, sometimes I'd return a few seconds past the 15 minute mark, and he'd write me up for it.\n\nAt the start of my shift, I would arrive at the office anywhere between 5 to 10 minutes early, depending on traffic, and I'd get my computer started, get some coffee and just lounge around for clock in time.\n\nNone of the write ups stuck, because it was unreasonable to be called \"late\" for returning 10 or so seconds after the minute had passed.\n\nOne day he sat me down and told me he expected perfect attendance or he would be writing me up every time I was late for anything.\n\nFine.\n\nThat same day we had a meeting at 4, and at 5 I got up and started walking out of the meeting room while the meeting was still ongoing. He calls out to me, and I simply tapped my watch-less wrist and said \"perfect attendance\" and left. The next morning, I walked into the office at 8:00 on the dot. He called out to me saying \"you are late\" and once again, I tapped my wrist, and shouted back \"8 o'clock on the dot. Perfect. Attendance\". I was in a call with a user, and at 5:00, I hung up and left. The next day I was asked about it by QA, and I told them my manager demanded perfect attendance or I'd be written up, and seeing I am in a 8-5 shift, and i'm paid per hour, I could not stay a minute after my shift.\n\nThey tried to tell me that the manager couldn't reasonably write me up for staying after my shift if I was on a call, but I refused to stay a minute past my shift and told them to talk to my manager.\n\nA week or so went by with me hanging up calls at the end of my shift. The next monday as I'm walking in, my manager intercepts me and takes me to HR, where he was told explicitly to be reasonable when checking attendance and tardiness, as being a few seconds late, or even a couple of minutes (with notice) late was not an issue at all.\n\nEventually he got fired for fingering a 19 year old girl in the restroom.",

My neice and nephews grandma was over my sisters while I was there as well (I was staying a week). \nTheir grandma was a sweet woman but very particular about only gifting things to 'her grandkids' but also expecting everyone to do anything she asked. I was raised to respect my elders and be helpful so I bit my tongue when she took the kids for ice cream but left me out. I was helpful and put away her dishes from lunch even when she came back with toys for them and still nothing for me. I kept telling myself not to expect anything from anyone because I'm not entitled to anything. I played with my neice and nephew for hours with their new toys and was so excited for them. I was glad they got spoiled for the day. \nWhen she started asking me if I liked parked and swings I got hopeful, they talked with my sister and BIL about taking the kids to the park the next day. My sister asked the grandma if she was gonna take me along since I had said I liked parked. She said 'oh of course not, shes not my family.'\nThat hurt. I knew it was true but it hurt. And I got mad. So the next morning when  she came for the kids and i was making my BIL coffee she asked me to put 2 sugars in hers. She never asked me to make her a cup so I just ignored it and brought my BIL his and sat down. She asked where mine was and I just told her \"oh I only make coffee for family.\" \nShe knew what I meant and tried to backtrack and say but we are family and that she hadnt meant what she said the night before. \nI just replied \"I'm sorry I dont talk to strangers\" and I walked out the room.

            "That's brilliant. I'm glad you got some revenge. \n\nI had to watch my grandparents pull this crap with me growing up. My own grandparents. I only had them on my mums side. They'd take my cousins out places, buy them expensive toys, tons of pokemon cards. When Christmas or their birthdays came along they were spoiled. Me, I asked why I couldn't have a present and was told I was a spoiled brat and they couldn't afford to get me anything. They'd laugh at me and would destroy their toys and they'd be replaced. I was good to my toys and over time accumulated a decent amount, because I didn't smash mine to pieces after a few weeks. My birthday was too close to Christmas so I couldn't have anything, mum said the same (ignoring the fact my cousins birthday was closer, just on the other side of christmas). Christmas would come and my cousins got gameboys, games, consoles, expensive toys, me, nothing. I was 10/11 when my grandad asked me what I wanted. I knew not to ask for anything big. I chose a \u00a310 toy, the digimorpher from Power Rangers in Space. I was mocked for wanting a babies toy because the safety warning for small parts said 3+ on it. They just wouldn't stop and that's the last time I asked for anything. \n\nWhen I was growing up I was a spoiled brat. That's what everyone called me because I was upset about not being treated fairly. I remember one time my cousin was asked to justify why he was being such a dick to me at school. He said it was because I was spoiled because I got \u00a35 a week pocket money (while he was bought way more then that by our grandparents). The other kid was like, wth, that's what I get, it's normal. I went from being laughed at for being spoiled, which I wasn't, they were, to being the poor kid. I had to work to afford a pc and the Internet at home. Kids thought it was hilarious and so did my cousins. Our grandparents paid for their Internet connection, their computers, by that point their cars. I couldn't have a car, I was expected to pay for it myself. It was a couple of thousand to insure myself so I never got one. Mum refused to put me on her insurance and let me pay her the difference so that's how I ended up with no car until a two years ago, I'm 30. \n\nAt least there's a good ending to the story. Last I heard both my cousins failed college (its where we go before uni, US college). I got into uni, move away from that crappy area. I have friends, a boyfriend, a decent life. My cousins were both still living with their mum, not working, no social lives, no partners. We were all abused by our relatives and while the scapegoat made it out, the golden children didn't. I would be sad for them, but they helped make my life hell growing up, so they got what they deserved. Hell, I haven't seen them in 12 years, they still blame me and a random kid we went to school with for their crappy lives. I barely had any interactions with my relatives, apart from my mum, once I turned 12, maybe 13. Hell, my grandparents even blanked me in the town center in front of a group of kids I was with. Man, that was awkward.",

It doesn\u2019t excuse not at least getting some kind of a token so that a kid doesn\u2019t feel left out, but not everyone is thoughtful.\n\nThen I saw that she took everyone out for ice cream, but wouldn\u2019t get you any, and I thought \u201coh hell no\u201d. I can\u2019t even imagine *deliberately* leaving a kid out like that in front of their face, I don\u2019t care what your financial situation is.\n\nBut the park really sent me over the edge. It doesn\u2019t even cost anything! This clearly had nothing to do with money, she probably had plenty. There must have been some kind of spite or resentment about the family that she took out on a 13-year-old. Pitiful.\n\nMy husband\u2018s family is huge. So many cousins and siblings and nieces and nephews, I could barely hope to remember half of their names. What i love though, is that everyone is family, regardless of how the bloodline flows. \n\nThere are plenty of blended second marriages that came in with kids, but we don\u2019t even acknowledge that the terms \u201chalf sister\u201d or \u201chalf brother\u201d exist.

            "I briefly had a temp job in a call center for a certain nationwide department store (that is currently circling the drain financially). I had the misfortune of having to call people, customers who had made either a repair appointment for their appliance purchased from said store, or an inspection of their heater or air conditioner if they had purchased a maintenance plan, and reschedule their appointment because we NEVER had enough techs on a given day to complete all the appointments. Never. They would still have been understaffed with techs if every one of them had reported for duty, but since there were always some people out, routes had to be reworked and some appointments had to be rescheduled. \n\nAnyway, you can just imagine that anyone getting this kind of call to reschedule, after they had taken a day off from work or had already been waiting for a broken appliance to be repaired, would NOT be happy about it. Most people were polite and rescheduled. Some people... well, politeness was apparently not in their vocabulary. I thought I had a pretty good grasp on how many swear words existed in the English language, but some of those people I called came up with some terms I hadn't encountered before. \n\nWe had been instructed that if someone would not stop being verbally abusive, we could end the call. There were a few times when I interrupted someone's tirade by saying, \"When you want to reschedule, please call 1-800-(store's customer service number).\" and hung up.\n\nSaid department store is still in existence (though for how much longer is anybody's guess). I still wince when I see one of their repair trucks with that 800 number written on it, almost 20 years later.",

            "Unless your employer has the same rules as yours but refuses to enforce them. \n\nMake years ago I worked for a company where I could review a clients 401k plan and assist them in taking 401k loans or hardship withdrawals.  Hence, it was the rule that we could only talk to the account holder of course. \n\nWe also used non-public info to verify the person on the phone was in fact the account holder, if we truly needed to. \n\nAnyway cue one day I get a call and it's like I dunno, I don't even remember now.  I think it was a lawyer or financial planner, someone like that, calling on behalf of the account holder.  Apparently the account holder was their client so they needed his account details for their records.  \n\nNo dice.  I explain in a nice way I don't care if you're a lawyer or whatever.  I'm only allowed to talk to the account holder.  I'm a measly customer service rep.  The account holder can call and obtain it, then give it to you.  \n\nWell, we can guess how this went over.  And my manager hears me over and over explaining I can't provide this information to the caller and comes over.  I explain to her the situation and she did nothing to help.  While she did back up the situation that I could not provide the caller any details, she did nothing to take over the call, and so I sat there for about 45 minutes pretty much on a loop of the caller saying anything they could think of, and my constantly repeating I can't help them.  I offered that I would call the account holder directly and conference them in and as long as I can verify them and they confirm on the line they know the caller and are authorizing the caller to hear what we're discussing, then that's the best I can do.  Oh no, that won't work, the account holder is out of the country.  Well, sorry then you can have him call when he's back.  After all that, eventually the caller hangs up on me, and I get written up at work for not being more helpful to the customer.   \n.",
            "I\u2019m a little confused by the situation; it seems to me that if you guys can only place orders through the account holder, being an important detail, you should probably mention that in the beginning of the call so that people don\u2019t waste their time.

        "selftext": "The entry level position at my old company is a revolving door. The pay is low, the work is unrewarding, and the expectations are unattainably high for the vast majority of the staff. The average time in that position is 6 months. \n\nThis is by design. It's a position that requires minimal training and there are plenty of applicants willing to work for minimum wage. It's actually a really great entry into the field and uses all of the industry standard practices and tools. Most people use it as a launching point for a successful career and move on to a higher paying job after half a year. \n\nOne of the cool things about the position is that they offer a great perk for paid time off. You get 1 hour of PTO for every 30 hours worked. There are no caps on accrual or limits on usage. \n\nIt's a great way to attract recent college grads to the position. They feel like they're getting a great benefit, and the company knows that they'll be gone in 6 months anyway, so they don't end up paying for a lot of time off. \n\nI took the job fully expecting to be gone within a year, but I ended up thriving in the position. My bosses were impressed, and they offered me raises if I would stay with the company and increase my scope of responsibility. Every time I started to think that my career was stagnating, they would make staying in that position worth it. \n\nAfter a couple of years, I had learned enough that I felt confident in my ability to take on a mid-level role, so I asked for consideration. The mid-level role comes with benefits and a salary, along with a title that would look great on my resume. The drawback was that this position has a cap of 4 days of PTO usage per year. Still, it would be a great stepping stone in my career, so I was eager to move up.\n\nThe only problem is that the mid-level position hires from a pool of candidates with an MBA, which I don't have. My boss told me that they would love to have me work on that team, and would give me a good raise, but I wouldn't get the title, salary, or benefits without an MBA. \n\nWorks for me. I know how to write a resume and present myself in an interview, so the title is meaningless as long as I'm doing the work of that role. The pay increase would be great leverage while I search for a new job. \n\nAnd I don't need the benefits. I don't need to be on the company's health care plan because I get free healthcare from the VA. I don't need their 401k plan because my wife's company has a better one. I don't need their student loan repayment benefits because the GI bill paid for my degree.\n\nSo I took the promotion, but I kept my original title. I don't think they realized that this means I also kept my original PTO structure, and at my new pay rate, giving me that much PTO would be kind of expensive. \n\nAfter about a year in that position, I was ready to move on. I told my boss I wanted to use all of my available PTO and he said, \"No problem! Enjoy your 4 days!\"\n\n\"No, you don't understand. I'm still a [entry level job title]. I'm off for the next 6 weeks.\"\n\nI actually did take a month off and had a great time. Then I started job hunting full-time and quickly got offers. When my PTO was over, I came back to the company with my two-weeks notice. \n\nThe timing was bad for the company because they didn't plan on spending that much on PTO that quarter. I hope they've revisited their decision to tell me that I was capable of doing a job but not qualified for the benefits of that job.",

        "selftext": "This happened today and my brother and I are still are laughing about it, except Gabrielle (said stepmother) and Dad (who is embarrassed).\n\nDad came into town to visit my brother (let's call him Mark) and me for a few days and brought Gabrielle with him. Gabrielle has her good traits...but she does have this one really nasty trait. She is notoriously picky/critical when it comes to food. You know the stereotypical snooty and rude French character in movies/books who always complains \"that is not how this is done in France\"? She's this way when it comes to food.\n\nGoing out to eat with her is embarrassing. She constantly sends back food, is insistent on food being made a certain way and always demands certain things done a certain way. One time, she asked the waiter to bring some mustard to the table...not 2 minutes later, she called him back because \"the mustard is old, bring us a new unopened bottle\". More than once, I've had to apologize to the wait staff on my family's behalf and told the manager that I will vouch for them should Gabrielle leave a bad review on their site.\n\nShe's made waiters and managers cry, she's \\*that\\* bad. Honestly, I have no idea why Dad puts up with her when she does that, even though I know he's just as embarrassed as Mark and I are. We can only chalk it up to Gabrielle having a magical hoo-ha.\n\nWhen they got here yesterday, for some reason, they insisted they wanted to go out to dinner. Dad recommended our new favorite new diner, which is known for its breakfasts at any time of the day. We live close to a major interstate and the saying about truckers knowing all the best diners and holes in the wall in all 50 states and then some is true.\n\nIt's a greasy spoon in every sense of the word. Right out of the 1950's, every leather booth filled with truckers or locals, waitresses who automatically know their regulars' orders by heart and don't put up with crap from anyone, a bustling kitchen and while spotless, is just worn enough to let you know many people have been there.\n\nIn other words; it has character.\n\nIt may not look like a 5 star restaurant, it has some of the best breakfasts you're ever going to eat.\n\nI was hesitant to take Gabrielle there if only because I didn't want to ruin the staff's day. Mark and I have been there enough times that the wait staff/cooks know us. However, Dad wanted Gabrielle to experience \"a true American classic\" and was offering to pay. So off we (reluctantly) went.\n\nLuckily, we got there during a not really busy time, so I told Dad to find a parking spot and I would go in to get us a table. The reason I did this was so I could warn the staff about Gabrielle and apologize in advance for anything she did. Fortunately, our usual waitress (let's call her Mary), thanked me for the warning and warned the rest of the staff.\n\nWe go in, get our booth...and Gabrielle tries pulling her usual stunts. I won't go into everything she did because we'll be here forever but I'll leave a highlight reel.\n\n1). Gabrielle sent Mary back three times with the coffee because (in order \"it was too cold\", \"it was too hot\" and \"not enough cream\". Finally Mary (who doesn't let anybody push her around) just slapped the coffee pot on the table along with the cream/sugar and told Gabrielle to make do because she wasn't going back to get her damn coffee. This made Mark and me chuckle and Gabrielle steam.\n\n2). While waiting (and probably still stewing from Mary's little come back with the coffee), Gabrielle decided to accost Stephanie, who had just started and tell her to get some fresh biscuits. Not ask. Tell. Poor Stephanie (who is understandably anxious about her job) does as told and then Gabrielle made a fuss about the packets of butter not being soft enough, despite Stephanie explaining that all the butter was kept cold for safety reasons. Gabrielle made a snide remark about how Stephanie couldn't wait five extra minutes to let the butter soften...which made Stephanie tear up and me about ready to tell Gabrielle to go fuck a French chef if food was that important to her.\n\n3). When our meals did arrive, Gabrielle was quiet during the meal, not making comments. I was unsure what was going to happen as a result. Either she really liked it (which I doubted, seeing as I've never seen her compliment anyone's cooking whenever we've gone out) or she was planning some nasty barb (which I feared). When Mary dropped off the bill, Gabrielle took it before Dad could and said she was paying. Because I was sitting next to her, Gabrielle left a big fat 0 in the tip line and left a note about \"It's cute that American chefs think they're good cooks when they've never stepped in a real kitchen before. Prove me wrong\" before closing the little book the receipt came in and hiding it so nobody else could see what she wrote.\n\nI was *pissed* when I read that note and was about ready to slap Gabrielle. I know the chefs/servers who work at this particular diner learned their skills on the job and, if you ask me, they have every right to be as proud of their work as someone who went to culinary school would be. While I'm looking at going to culinary school myself to become a pastry chef...I respect people who've learned by working in kitchens/on the floor because they have first hand experience.\n\nI took out $100 using the ATM at the diner and gave it to the staff as a tip along with an apology for her behavior, embarrassed and angry. Fortunately, they didn't hold it against us (except Gabrielle) and told me that Mark and I were always welcome back.\n\nI also decided I was going to get back at Gabrielle.\n\nThere was a benefit to this lockdown. During this time, bored out of our wits and wanting to better our skills, Mark and I have been binge watching recipe and cooking how to videos online along with practicing. And while I don't like bragging...I'd say we've become quite good. We know how to smoke our own bacon, cure corned beef, make creamy scrambled eggs and bake flaky croissants...and that's just a sampling.\n\nWhen we got home, I told Mark my plan and he was grinning ear to ear.\n\nThe next day, while Gabrielle and Dad still slept, Mark and I got up early and got right to work. We prepared scrambled eggs, home cured/smoked bacon, biscuits and a fruit salad. Dad woke up early and smelled the breakfast, waking up Gabrielle by saying that the kids were making breakfast.\n\nDad came downstairs first and Mark asked him to set the table. Gabrielle came down as we were finishing up and she sits down, not offering to help.\n\nWhile Gabrielle commented about how it smells just like a restaurant she went to in France and couldn't wait to taste everything, Mark and I served Dad and our plates before putting everything back. Gabrielle looked at us, confused.\n\nI looked at her, \"Oh, I thought you were going to a French cafe for breakfast\" I said. \"You did write on the receipt at the diner that you thought it was cute Americans think they're good cooks if they haven't set foot in a real kitchen and you wanted someone to prove you wrong.\"\n\nDad looked at Gabrielle, his eyes wide as all the color drained from Gabrielle's face. \"You wrote what?!\"\n\n\"Well, hop to it.\" I said, sitting down. \"Enjoy your French breakfast with your French chefs.\"\n\nGabrielle's face reddened before she left. I don't know if she was embarrassed or angry...but we were able to have a nice breakfast without any of Gabrielle's complaining.\n\nShe did come back after getting breakfast and has been nice and quiet all day. Hopefully she's learned her lesson and Dad grows a backbone.\n\nUPDATE: (Jan. 27th, 21) RIP my Inbox! Holy smokes! I'm glad most of you enjoyed my story and had their own stories to tell about Gabrielles in their lives. I'm so sorry you have to deal with people like her as well...they really are the worst and give both good French and stepparents a bad lesson.\n\nDad and Gabrielle were supposed to stay with us for a few days before I returned to work next week (all 4 of us got sick with the Bug at one point or another during the last 6 months and have remained symptom free, thank goodness so no need for us to quarantine once they arrived). They left this morning...but not before they had a vicious argument last night after my brother and I went to bed. And when I say vicious, I mean it was so loud we could hear every word. Thank God the neighbors couldn't hear otherwise we might've had the cops called on us.\n\nDad chewed Gabrielle out on what she wrote on the receipt and reminded her that she had promised him she'd be on her best behavior. After all, this restaurant was special to not just Mark and me but Dad as well. Gabrielle defended her actions, saying that it was not what she likes, etc...until she finally blew up and revealed the real reason she threw that tantrum in the restaurant.\n\nIt turned out Dad was planning on surprising Gabrielle on a trip to one of the best restaurants in town to celebrate the anniversary of their first date (which was yesterday). She had found the reservations by accident and thought they were going to it the night they arrived when he was planning on taking her tomorrow to make it a real surprise.\n\nSo us going to the greasy spoon instead of the super nice expensive restaurant really upset her and she thought he was catering to his kids instead of her. The argument finally ended when Dad took to the couch downstairs, fed up with her BS.\n\nSo they left this morning...Dad did tell me before they left that he was going to have a serious talk with Gabrielle about her behavior and that until she learned her manners, he was not going to take her out anymore, even to our place.\n\nHopefully that will be either the wakeup call to Gabrielle to behave...or to Dad that he should get out.\n\nOh and to those who said this story is fake (one person asking how we were able to smoke bacon, for your info, we have a pellet grill/smoker and we constantly are curing and smoking bacon because it's so good)....don't you guys have anything better to do?",

            "My wife and I lived in France at the beginning of our marriage. Here's a way to maybe open her eyes so she can see what a real Karen she's being.\n\nThere's the mistaken assumption that the French hate Americans - that is simply not true. However, American manners are *extremely* rude to the French, so culturally ignorant Americans (and your typical American tourist) will unknowingly offend the French, and so the French will be rude back. So that's where the misunderstanding comes from, let me illustrate it.\n\nSay that you walk into a bodega in NYC and just say \"hey, could I please get a #5 and a diet Coke?\", that's totally normal and not at all rude in the US - it's even appreciated to be so quick since Americans really value efficiency. However, in France you're expected to walk in and greet the owner - after all, you're stepping into their establishment and you're only a guest there. So, a typical interaction at a bakery might go something like \"good morning, how are you? ... I'm glad to hear it. Could I please have a coffee and a chocolatine?\" It's extremely rude if someone walks into *your* shop and doesn't even acknowledge you as a person and instead treats you like a servant who is only there for their convenience!\n\nSo, that's where a common cultural misunderstanding between the French and Americans comes from (there's actually a lot of cultural differences). However, as it relates to your stepmother, just let her know she's acting like an entitled American. If she acted that way in France, the wait staff wouldn't put up with her, so why does she do it here?\n\nAnyway, maybe present it that way to her, because she's being the very stereotype of rude Americans the French have.",

Not native in English, so apologies if something doesn't make sense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was just a customer, but hot damn.\n\nI had a hotel room booked for two nights, from a 5 star well known hotel chain, that rhymes with Boliday Finn. Room was smallest/cheapest, with 2 double-beds, probably even located below parking garage. That was about only room available, so it would have to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout a month later, I arrive with my buddy to basically drop our stuff in the room, so we can take off right away, while the sun is still up. In the lobby, there is about 200 person group shouting all at once to the two ladies manning(?) the desk. After making plans for few minutes to store our stuff elsewhere, the desk attendant notices us, as we clearly were not part of the huge group, so she waves us over, past the large group, and starts to handle our check-in.\n\nShe politely asks us to fill the traveler forms while she's looking up my reservation. I thank her and try to make pleasant conversation about this and that, complementing their uniforms and the hotel, trying to improve the sour atmosphere the angry mob has been generating all around.\n\nWhile we are filling the forms, angry man next to us, who was apparently the leader of the lobby-mob, keeps shouting, loud: \"I demand that you arrange us extra room with two double-size beds! We had late addition to our travel, and they need a room with two double-size beds! RIGHT. F\\*\\*\\*ING. NOW!\"\n\nApparently, the arguing has been taking a place for quite a while already. She tries to get a word in, but gets interrupted: \"I don't care if your stupid shit hotel is full, it's your job to give us place to sleep! Stupid woman. Get. Us. Another. Room! And double-size beds! Don't try anything else, I'm not interested of anything else! You idiot... I wonder how you can keep your job, if you can't even arrange a room for us.\"\n\nEvery time the main desk attendant tries to talk to the angry man, he rudely interrupts her, with more and more shouting. Only thing I can do, is to keep smiling at the ladies, sympathetically.\n\nShe: \"We don't have double-size beds available, but we do have---\"\n\nHim: \"I don't want to hear! Just do your job and press the buttons to make it happen. You must be mentally slow, don't you? Two double beds, or is that too difficult for you?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe clerks shares a tired look with each other, but suddenly both have this lamp lighting above their heads. They converse for a moment (using their native language) while pointing their screens and then proceeds to tell me: \"Our apologies, Sir, but unfortunately we don't have your room with two double-beds available for you, which you had booked for. As you see, we are a bit full today.\" while she is gesturing to the mob in the lobby.\n\nMy heart sinks a bit, until she continues: \"So, because we are fully booked, only room we can offer to you, is the executive suite at the 24th floor, obviously for no extra cost. Unfortunately, it doesn't have two double-size beds...\"\n\nShe takes eye contact with the angry man and continues: \"...but it has 4 king size beds. Each in their own en-suites.\"\n\nAngry man drops dead silent and is just staring at us. His mouth just moves like of a mouth of a fish, who is stranded on a dry land.\n\nWhile looking at me again, she continues: \"I hope you accept the free room upgrade, with our most sincere apologies in behalf of the hotel management. And of course all the room service is free, including the refreshments available in the suite kitchen and suite bar areas, and all hotel VIP facilities are in your disposal 24/7. Please do enjoy your stay and let us know if there is anything we can do to make your stay more comfortable.\"\n\nShe dings a small bell and piccolo takes our bags while gesturing towards the fancy separate elevator at the side. I'm so shocked that I can mutter only a little bit of thanks and follow the piccolo.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile we are making our way towards the elevator, the main-desk is explaining to the angry man: \"Sir, I'm happy to inform you that we were able to make arrangements to have single room with two double-size beds, available to accommodate your extra guests. That will be 199\u20ac added to your bill.\"\n\nMan snaps out of his trance-like state, and shouting resumes: \"What the f\\*\\*k!? I don't want some single room with double-size beds! I want free executive suite too! Why the f\\*\\*k does those f\\*\\*kers gets the f\\*\\*king suite and I get some shitty single room!? This is unacceptable! Why did you give my better room for those two f\\*\\*\\*\\*ts instead of to me?\"\n\nShe now has much more commanding tone, and she responds: \"Unfortunately, Sir, our 'free executive suite' is not available.

So I stayed quiet, and marvelled at the decor of the hotel and the general human activity going on around me. \n\nThe clerk excused himself and went to the back area. He came back and said that the check in was complete, and would we follow him please? \n\nHe led us to the to top floor where he opened the door to the Presidential Suite, which was actually two levels with massive windows overlooking this awesome city. It was a full-sized apartment - I couldn't believe it! All for the price of the discounted junior suite rate, lol. I guess the tour bus guests took their last rooms and shucks, all that was left for me was this opulent apartment.

Called my boss 3 timezones ahead of me, and he contacted the online travel service he used which shares its name with an old Microsoft CD-ROM travel guide product. Travel Guide calls the Stilton's front desk, and the clerk says they are all booked up. Travel Guide tries for nearly an hour to make a room appear magically out of thin air. Meanwhile, the other clerk calls around to other nearby lodging, much of which is similarly booked, but she did manage to find me a room in a fancier hotel about 6 blocks away. My erstwhile reservation at the Stilton had been pre-paid by my boss, and eventually Travel Guide refunded that payment. I, however, had to pay for 2 nights at this other hotel which shares its name with a large home-improvement store chain, at $220 per night (which was reimbursed to me).\n\nThe only thing I could ever figure out was that Travel Guide simply forgot to make the actual hotel reservation, even though I had confirmation numbers for everything, and tried to badger the Stilton for a room when they realized they screwed up. The poor Stilton clerks didn't succumb to Travel Guide's pleas, though, and once I returned home, I wrote a letter to the hotel praising the 2 clerks and thanking them for finding me alternate lodging while Travel Guide tried to force a room to appear.",

        "selftext": "This was a few years ago when I worked in a 4 star hotel chain that would be very well known and was part of a larger company that had hotels of varying status. I was about 24. There were a few of us who worked primarily in room service and the breakfast shift was always a solo shift.\n\nOne morning I started and as was customary I started doing my prep, folding napkins, setting up 5/6 trays with pastries etc. per the pre-ordered breakfast cards so I would only need to grab the correct tea/coffee and hot food later aswel as a few extra all purpose trays for the people who call for room service last minute.\n\nI just get finished with this when the Duty Manager (I can't remember his full name but nickname was Prem) bursts into the kitchen with a dirty plate in his hand and sees me in my area while putting it in the pile of dishes for the kitchen porter. He tells across the kitchen \"What are you doing? It's so crazy out there that I have to help clear tables and you are back here? Get out and help!\"\n\nI replied that I had not gone up and walked the halls to collect the trays left out overnight yet and he yelled some more and repeated that if he, a manager, is clearing tables, I better help regardless of if my job is actually in a different area.\n\nFor the record, Prem was a menace. I witnessed him yell in college girls faces until they cried several times. He would also routinely pick on anyone that was minimum wage floor staff.\n\nSo I walk into the restaurant and the supervisor (Jen) is at the door and sees me walk in. She covers for room service and has worked it in the past so she knows I should be collecting trays now so that the place doesn't look like a warzone upstairs. She asks if I've done this and I say no, Prem sent me in to help because it's so busy. She says it's not very busy at all, the don't need me and I should go upstairs and collect the dirty trays.\n\nI walk back into the kitchen and Prem is still standing there. \"What are you doing? I told you to go in and help!\"\n\n\"I went in and Jen said they don't need me and told me to collect the trays.\" \n\nHe then accuses me of going to her and asking can I go collect trays to get out of helping so I tell him he can in and ask her if she called me or if I approached her. This satisfies him that I'm at least not lying but he's still not happy.\n\nHe says \"I'm the duty manager. Manager. Jen is a supervisor. I'm higher up so you do what I tell you. Go in there and help clear tables. I don't want to see you going up to collect trays.\"\n\nI go back into the restaurant and Jen looks at me confused. I tell her that Prem insists that I help and won't let me go upstairs and says he out-ranks her so she says I should join the guys at station 1 and help their area.\n\nBreakfast passes and I pop out a few times to do my room services and come back with not much issue.\n\nMy shift is until 3PM and breakfast ended at 10:30AM. At this point nobody has been upstairs and housekeeping will have been putting out dirty trays. \n\nI get a call on the room service mobile from a housekeeping manager saying that floor 4 has a dozen or so trays in the hall.\n\n\"I'm sorry the duty manager has prioritised other areas at the moment and has said I cannot go up.\"\n\nI start doing my afternoon prep, polishing cutlery and the like. About 12PM I get another call, this time from the housekeepings top manager. She tells me there is trays everywhere and I politely apologise and explain that my duty manager has used the exact words \"I don't want to see you going up to collect trays.\" She accepts this without question and asks that I help when I can.\n\nAt 2PM I get a call from the hotels director of operations regarding the trays. At this point there are trays in the hallways on all 7 floors and the place looks filthy. Again , I politely explain what instructions I've received from Prem and this is accepted without further question and he says he will inquire into it.\n\n3PM arrives and I have not heard anything else nor have I cleaned up the pig-sty upstairs. My replacement arrives and I tell him what happened and apologise for the fact that he will have to collect these but tell him why. He laughs and decides to leave it until somebody else calls and informs him they are there.\n\nShortly after this Prem 'left' the company.\n\nTL;DR: A manager on a power trip told me not to do an important part of my job as I had to help somewhere I was not needed. I left that part of my job alone for my full shift and advised all his superiors that he had advised me not to do it when I was questioned about it. He 'left' the company shortly after.",

            "This was in 2019\n\nI worked security for a hotel. Whenever I did floor patrols, I'd pick up trays and set them up (bowls, plates, cups, etc separated and stacked together) near the employee elevator where the kitchen crew can grab and go. Sometimes I'd even have time to bring the stack down to the dishwasher station and continue on just cause I was bored and they had that breakfast rush which sucks. The room service supervisor is an acquaintance and the manager and I have hung out outside of work for beers a few times and they never said anything\n\nWell one day, a room service employee (not a manager, not a supervisor just an employee who'd been there for 5+ years, I had just three years) he sees me doing this and reams me for \"taking their job\" and demands I ***never*** pick up trays again\n\nOk!\n\nI left all the trays where they were in the hallways, and it just so happened to be San Diego Comic Con Weekend and for the cherry on top: he had been assigned mornings \ud83d\ude01\n\nSo for the week of SDCC, THE BIGGEST CONVENTION OF THE YEAR, this dude had to show up early in the morning, run through twelve floors of a hotel while the employee elevators were being clogged by housekeeping and other employees, then with only two others deliver food to those floors. \n\nA reminder, my nerd brethren spend a lot of money to go here and buy merch; not a lot left over for tips, which is the only reason I can think of for his anger, nevermind that I delivered the tray tips to the manager's cash box. I'd even gotten flak by a security coworker for **not** keeping the tips.

I guess this time it actually was more like clearing it by hand, since it was all frozen we were breaking off chunks of ice / snow with the shovel and then handing the chunks to someone else who started stacking them off to the side.\n\nThen another boss comes out and tells us to go inside. Then the first boss asks is why we are inside and to go back outside.

I dug out the biggest tray I could find, it was horrible big 3ftx2ft wooden piece of shit, and I used it to carry things like teaspoons and salt shakers to tables.\n\nI quit about two days later.

        "selftext": "A previous post reminds me of a situation a few years ago...  \n\nI was a Dispatcher for a Plumbing/HVAC/Basement Waterproofing company, but I was more of a coordinator. I handled customer bookings, scheduling, some parts ordering, dispatching, etc. As I used to say, \"I have more hats than a hat rack\".  \n\nNow my techs had their own tools, and I did my work on the computer. I kept bugging the boss for a better computer, and he never got me one, so I built a system at my own expense and brought it in to the office. My techs had \"personal tools\", so this was mine. As a matter of fact, 10 years later, it's the system I am typing on now. It has a 4-core processor, and a graphics card capable of supporting 4 monitors. To give you a better idea of how long ago this was, I paid $350 for a 60gig SSD. I used 1 monitor for the Dispatch software, one monitor for Google Maps with traffic overlay, one monitor for Outlook, and one monitor for QuickBooks to issue invoices and purchase orders.  \n\nWhen I gave notice, My Boss, The Owner and I agreed on 3 weeks notice as an exit strategy. Unknown to me, The Owner was convinced I was bluffing, and was just hunting for a raise. He refused to hire a replacement. My Boss was more of a Field Supervisor, The Owner handled the office and Admin.  \n\nFinally, the DAY BEFORE my last day, at 2pm, I was introduced to the new hire. Seriously? You intend to have me train a guy for a complicated pivotal role in a few hours?  \n\nI was on a 44-hour schedule, 10 hours Mon-Thurs, and Friday I was off at 11am. I said my goodbyes and at 11am, began dismantling my computer. First thing I did was format the hard drive, as I told them I was going to do. Fortunately for them, the data was all backed up on the server...except for what had transpired that morning, despite my repeated warnings to trigger a backup into the server at 11am.  \n\nThe Owner came out in a bit of a panic when he saw me taking apart the computer, as he had forgotten that it was me that owned it, and now his Dispatch station had no computer. He asked if I could leave the computer behind, and I declined. He set my replacement up on an unused antique computer in a cubicle. It had a fucking *CRT* monitor, was slow as molasses. The job was hard enough with 4 screens, I can't imagine doing it with one.  \n\nThis guy wasn't a dummy, but there's no way I could have trained him in a few hours. He had the bare-bones of the processes, and that's it.  \n\nBy noon I was out the door.  \n\nMy Boss spent the remainder of the day and most of the next week in the field, leaving The Owner to deal with the fallout, and it was legendary. Nobody could handle it. The replacement quit, just never showed up on the Tuesday, and nobody else in the office could do what I was doing. He dumped PO generation into Accounting, which pissed them off with the extra workload. He tried to handle Scheduling and Dispatching himself, and pissed off a lot of the techs. He stuck one of the CSRs into training for the role, and she wasn't the brightest bulb in the chandelier. The best part? I used to handle after-hours on-call, and since there was nobody with enough experience, The Owner had to answer his phone at all hours of the night, 7 days a week.  \n\nThat's when the exodus started. Over the next few weeks many of the good techs bailed, jobs were screwed up. I heard that he had 2 basement waterproofing jobs, each worth 5 figures, double-booked. The company hit the wall, hard.  \n\nHow do I know? About 3 years ago I reached out to My Boss on Linkedin, and he had moved on to another employer. He offered me a job, and I took it. We get along famously, and he has told me all kinds of stories about the shit that hit the fan when I left.  \n\n...and all they had to do was buy a new computer, and give me enough time to get the new guy in the groove.  \n\nTL;DR - I gave you my notice.

He was still in denial, no one got trained despite the fact that I had absorbed many jobs along the way.

She gave them her notice month before. Did they hire one so she can train them? \nNo, the last day she showed some basics. But none of us was ready to take care of that extra work. They hired one after few months later when everything has piled up. \n\nYou would think they learned from this, but no. Another employee with great experience left after giving them 2  weeks notice.

My boss said, 'great idea! could you expand it to describe how you do _all of the things you do_ so we can carry on while we figure out what to do about your role.' You want me to summarise 15 years of professional learning and experience into a Word doc???

            "I had a similar expierence at a job where among other things I ran a custom built database for the telemarketing department. The owner asked me to find a solution to the telemarketers calling the same # up to 5 times in a day so I slapped something together in Access.\n\nNow the owner here was also cheap when it came to anything other than pandering to the sales people, so he wouldn't go for any fancy solution. I went down to the local pc store and got a basic home desktop PC and installed MS SQL Server Expresss to act as my server. Then hacked together a database that would generate a telemarketing list compatible with uploading to their website and track the last time those numbers were output into a list for upload.\n\nIt also had the ability to handle do not call numbers with a front end form, but the telemarketers couldn't be bothered to use it so they would just send me an open office spreadsheet once a week that would have DNC numbers entered in whatever random format they felt like typing the number in that day. That ment every week I had to manually format those spreadsheets into a uniform style able to be imported to my database.\n\nNow as this was only built for me to use and as I'm by no means a professional database programmer, the admin side of it was not polished in any way. I had a decent form built for the telemarketing manager to use for generating lists but most of the admin work I did was just done directly in the tables or by importing spreadsheets.\n\nWhen I quit they finally sent over some random kid from the telemarketing department for me to \"train\" the day before my last day (I worked Tuesday-Sat). I don't think that poor kid had ever used excel before, much less an access database. Needless to say he basically sat there with the deer in the headlights look while I went over how my database worked for the whole half an hour they had sent him over for.\n\nSpoke with somebody from there a few months after I quit and was told that the owner wound up calling his IT company to try and figure the database out and the guy apparently spent 2 days trying to make it work. Best part is this IT company was the same company I once had to walk through setting up one managers personal godaddy POP3 email account because their technician didn't know how to set up any email other than an office 365 exchange email *sigh* lol.

It was more about being vaguely competent and not walking out after 6 months of grunt work than any actual skill in my part.

I made it to 22 months.\n\nHe was the sort of guy who bought himself a brand new BMW but wouldn\u2019t fit air conditioning to the office. Then he would wonder why staff where short tempered with customers at the end of a hot day and were quick to call in sick. When he wondered why he has mad a high staff turnover I suggested he start paying staff above average wages because the company was too small to offer company benefits.\n\nI was expected to take calls, monitor call waiting times, quality control staff, hire staff, train staff, write training material, answer emails, take escalated complaints and liaise with delivery crews. But I had no authority to actually do things like comp deliveries that were ridiculously late.\n\nI spotted a staff member a few months later who took great delight in telling me that they went through four replacements in the three months after I left.

            "I have met a few people with critical jobs who the business really relies on to keep going, and if they died, quit or got fired, things would be really hard for awhile.  I have met MANY more who erroneously believe that the business can't operate without them, to the point where they start messing around and causing problems because, \"They can't fire me.  I'm the hardest worker/best at this job/most reliable/the only one who knows how to do this, etc....\"  They are sadly mistaken.\n\nI worked with a couple of my friends in a factory after high school.  We were all weightlifters, heavy exercisers and worked really hard to get an extra workout in during work.  We volunteered for the hard jobs and busted our asses.  We were viewed as the best seasonal workers in the place, but my friends didn't think that they were getting paid enough(50 cents over minimum wage, but with a ton of overtime), so they decided to skip work without calling in one day to, \"make them appreciate us more\".  They were fired, and the business continued without missing a step.\n\nI knew a guy who used to sell newspapers on the street when he was in high school (he was an old guy when I knew him in the 90's).  He was the top salesman and outsold all of the other high school kids, and it started to go to his head.  He started showing up late, gave management attitude and started messing around.  He was very surprised when they fired him.  What, are people going to stop buying newspapers (at the time) just because you got fired? No, they'll just buy them from a different kid.\n\nOn the other hand, one of my co-workers, let's call her Christy, was threatened by the owner that the only people in the company who aren't replaceable are the field technicians.  She is the scheduler and does a really good job, even answering phones and setting up work orders outside of her official work hours.  She was understandably upset by this, and has started looking for other work, she is even considering starting her own answering/scheduling service for small businesses in her area.    Whenever she goes on vacation, the owner fills in for her and our routes get totally screwed up and the techs get pissed. Business has slowed down a bit over the past few years, and the owner is convinced that my co-worker is being lazy and is not answering the phone on purpose.  Dude, she gets paid a percentage of all the work orders that get completed, so yeah, she's answering the phones.  My last day with this company was a week ago, but I know that if Christy does quit, the company will be in real trouble, as the owner does a terrible job of scheduling, and it will take months to train a new scheduler to be proficient enough to get the job done.",
            "I once got let go because my boss decided the he could hire an immigrant from a \"foreign country\" with a \"much better work ethic\" and pay them much less.  He tried to get me to go to somewhere that offered software services, at less than half my salary, so that he could hire them for the more complicated stuff and get me to work on it through them at a cheaper rate, I didn't go for that.  He asked me to train my replacement in my last two weeks. I'm a software developer, the job was an online auction system, she had no programming background.  I did my best but it's impossible to teach someone programming in less than 2 weeks plus there was a language barrier.  Well one of the main things I taught her was whenever you need to do any kind of update on the database, DO A BACKUP FIRST (There was no auto backup, boss was cheap AF).  Then check your filters by running it as a search first. I explained the most common updates we had to do (update _ where X AND Y AND Z). Each time she tried to do it she would skip one of the filters and I would explain she absolutely needed to make sure she had it right and the logic behind it.  Right before I left I made sure to do a backup of the db, hand over all the passwords, deactivate my accounts etc.  The next working day I get a frantic call, she had overwritten ALL the bids in the database. He wanted me to fix it, I said just restore the backup she should have made before the query, she didn't make one. Afterwards she panicked and backed up the corrupted version over the one I'd made before I left.  They were screwed and I told him I couldn't help.

            "Or they could have valued you and your work, every time you said I have more hats than a hat rack, that was a hint to both of you.\n\nKaBOOM, not listening costs and is felt hard.\n\nThe owner should have canned the manager after the mess was recovered.",
            "I've had two long-term jobs that I ended up leaving on my terms. In both cases, they ended up hiring multiple people to replace me. That felt good to learn!",
            "Oh I feel that. Multi hat wearer myself. When I left I found out that they were looking at hiring someone full time for a role I did that took on average over a year about 3 hours out of my week to do.",
            "Nice.  Have a similar situation where I am.  We are all waiting for the chaos to hit like a cyclone.  Our bosses don\u2019t appreciate technical skills until it\u2019s too late.",
            "You could have sold that machine to him for like $20k at that point.",
            "That's why I **insist** my employees take vacations. It allows us all to handle handovers and see what issues come up. Also reminds them that they are not indispensable.",
            "Well the Lakers can\u2019t complain.",
            "Not really the point of the story, but that's gotta be a nice ego boost and validation of years of hard work. You left and the place fell apart. Glad you and your boss reconnected.",
            "It boggles the mind how a company puts that much responsibly on one employee",
            "Did they ever offer to pay you the come back and train the new guy?",
            "What was the malicious compliance though.  This is more petty revenge.",
            "Honestly, if they thought you were bluffing, they should have brought in a new hire to bluff you.  \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23",
            "I feel really sorry for the replacement.  I've been in situations like that, where you start a new job wanting to do well and walk into a living nightmare that is not your fault and expected to work at the same level as the person you're replacing without even having the right tools.  No surprise that he quit!",
            "Where is the Malicious Compliancenin this one? Sounds like some kind of (petty) revenge to me."
