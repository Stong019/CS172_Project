        "selftext": "The machine that takes in the bottles that have a deposit fee on them was broken. The machine couldn't scan the bottles, so the customers wouldn't get their money back. A customer told me about it, so i told my manager. He told me that i should take care of it because he was on break and the customers came to me. I told the customer that i couldn't help her and that she needed to come back some other time when it was fixed. My manager said that handling things in that way was also not acceptable. I started to get a little bit infuriated, so i decided to go back to the work i was supposed to do. Customers kept on coming to me with the same problem, so i went back to the manager who literally told me: ''you are at work, customers complain to you, it's your problem.'' \n\nI told my coworkers about it. They told me that i has happened before and that a mechanic was required to fix the problem. My manager got angry at me because i told him this. He told me that i needed to find a solution to the problem or i would get fired. I started thinking what i could do to fix it, but i couldn't figure it out, since i work at a grocery store as a 17 year old who has never fixed something like this.\n\nThen, my stubborn side took over, so i decided to fix the problem my way. I took a broom, and punched a hole in the seal that keeps the bottles from falling down. Then, i put a big plastic bag on the other side of the machine for the bottles to fall into. My manager lost it and told me i need to fix it in a better way right now. So i put the plastic bag in his hands and told the 12 customers that were waiting for the machine to work to give their bottles to my manager, and he would take care of it. The manager then sent me home as he was raging and yelling at everyone. \n\nThe next day i had to work again, and the mechanic was there to fix it. He told me that i made the situation with the machine worse, but that he had to laugh when he heard the story about my manager. I then heard that my manager got fired by his boss for losing his cool, and that i handled the situation very well. \n\nTo this day i still wonder what story was told to the boss, but i still have my job, and the manager is long gone.",

Unfortunately there was no screwdriver in any of the numerous toolboxes scattered throughout the store but shouldn't be a problem as we sell screwdrivers. The manager refused to authorise the \u00a31 needed to buy one and told me find something else to use. I suggested I could use the \"warehouse multitool\", complete with air quotes, but since it wasn't the correct tool for the job there might be some damage.

        "selftext": "so the year before covid hit the U.S I started working for one of the major airlines at my local airport as a baggage handler. I absolutely loved the job, i just enjoyed being around planes from the ground level. when i started there were no full time positions available so i was working part time 6 hour nights 5 times a week.\n\nThe way it usually works is each gate has a lead (the person with extra training to do the load planning and scanning and towing the planes to the runway as well as guiding them in) and a few baggage handlers. Now i had only been there a few months but i was working my ass off and showing that i was a team player.\n\nI decided i was gonna try to become a lead even though they usually want you to work a year or so as a handler first. I was confident and ended up passing the training course with ease. The problem was they had no availability for more leads so i was put into what was basically an on-call lead kind of thing where they could upgrade me for the day if they needed more leads.\n\nNow whenever they upgrade you to lead even if its for a single flight they have to pay you the extra 1.75$ hr leads get for your whole shift (remember i work 6 hour days so 10.50$ is the cost to make me a lead for my shift). now for a few months everything was great i was a part time baggage handler but i was working as a lead for my whole shift every shift and i was loving every second of it, something about towing huge planes full of people to the runway was just awesome to me.\n\nEnter everyones favorite virus good ol covid-19. Within months the airline industry is tanking pretty hard as nobody wants to travel and get stuck somewhere. Supervisors are being told to cut costs everywhere they can which makes sense given the circumstances. Cue up the night of my MC.\n\nIts maybe 11pm and im on till 1am, supervisors have sent a large chunk of workers home and those of us left are being sent all over the airport to cover the flights we do still have coming. i get a call from the office that assigns your flights and am told to go grab a box and a walkie (the stuff needed to plug into the plane to talk to the flight deck).\n\nThey tell me head to the gate the flights landing in 5 and to just put in my request for lead( when asked to be a lead you put it in on the company app and a supervisor approves your pay raise for the day). I get to my gate check the load coming off the plane brief the handlers on whats coming down and we all get to our spots to bring the plane in.\n\nI see the plane coming down the lane to my gate and at the same time my zones supervisor drives up to my gate and asks me to come over. He then tells me something along the lines of \"hey man we cant upgrade you to lead right now we just can swing that extra expense right now\" i respond with okay so whos going to bring this plane is nobody else on the gate is lead trained and supervisors are not allowed to do any of our work because of the union rules. he then tells me he is going to go find another lead to bring it in and to just assist him when he arrives. So im like sure whatever.\n\nNow its important to note that planes have very tight metrics for how long it can take to bring a flight in unload and reload for the next flight. The flight pulls up to the edge of my gate and comes to a stop as theres no lead there guiding them in so the flight just sits there waiting and the entire gate crew are also just standing around waiting. 20 minutes go by and my radio i still have on me goes off and the office is pissed.\n\nThey want to know why the hell im holding this flight short and not bringing it in, to which obviously i reply with \"what do you mean X supervisor told me they couldnt afford to pay me for lead work today and that he would find someone else\" he then asks me if i can please just bring it in for him and i said \"sorry but if your not willing to pay me to do the lead work then im only going to do the handler work im being paid for.\n\nAs it turns out they sent too many leads home this night and the ones they did have were all busy on flights already.

Four employees for the whole entire airport. One person checking in four flights at two separate companies, One person running the gate, and only two rampers. \n\nNeedless to say, everybody had blown connections and I made sure that it was all thrown on our management so that people got controllable delayed vouchers. I caught a bunch of heat from it but they knew that they could only shake their fist because if they lost me, then the next day would only be three people and even worse.\n\nBut it doesn't matter to the airlines because you got to travel and who else are you going to use.",

            "For those finding it hard to read the wall of text.\n\nso the year before covid hit the U.S I started working for one of the major airlines at my local airport as a baggage handler. I absolutely loved the job, i just enjoyed being around planes from the ground level. when i started there were no full time positions available so i was working part time 6 hour nights 5 times a week. \n\nThe way it usually works is each gate has a lead (the person with extra training to do the load planning and scanning and towing the planes to the runway as well as guiding them in) and a few baggage handlers. Now i had only been there a few months but i was working my ass off and showing that i was a team player. \n\nI decided i was gonna try to become a lead even though they usually want you to work a year or so as a handler first. I was confident and ended up passing the training course with ease. The problem was they had no availability for more leads so i was put into what was basically an on-call lead kind of thing where they could upgrade me for the day if they needed more leads. \n\nNow whenever they upgrade you to lead even if its for a single flight they have to pay you the extra 1.75$ hr leads get for your whole shift (remember i work 6 hour days so 10.50$ is the cost to make me a lead for my shift). now for a few months everything was great i was a part time baggage handler but i was working as a lead for my whole shift every shift and i was loving every second of it, something about towing huge planes full of people to the runway was just awesome to me. \n\nEnter everyones favorite virus good ol covid-19. Within months the airline industry is tanking pretty hard as nobody wants to travel and get stuck somewhere. Supervisors are being told to cut costs everywhere they can which makes sense given the circumstances. Queue up the night of my MC. \n\nIts maybe 11pm and im on till 1am, supervisors have sent a large chunk of workers home and those of us left are being sent all over the airport to cover the flights we do still have coming. i get a call from the office that assigns your flights and am told to go grab a box and a walkie (the stuff needed to plug into the plane to talk to the flight deck). \n\nThey tell me head to the gate the flights landing in 5 and to just put in my request for lead( when asked to be a lead you put it in on the company app and a supervisor approves your pay raise for the day). I get to my gate check the load coming off the plane brief the handlers on whats coming down and we all get to our spots to bring the plane in. \n\nI see the plane coming down the lane to my gate and at the same time my zones supervisor drives up to my gate and asks me to come over. He then tells me something along the lines of \"hey man we cant upgrade you to lead right now we just can swing that extra expense right now\" i respond with okay so whos going to bring this plane is nobody else on the gate is lead trained and supervisors are not aloud to do any of our work because of the union rules. he then tells me he is going to go find another lead to bring it in and to just assist him when he arrives. So im like sure whatever. \n\nNow its important to note that planes have very tight metrics for how long it can take to bring a flight in unload and reload for the next flight. The flight pulls up to the edge of my gate and comes to a stop as theres no lead there guiding them in so the flight just sits there waiting and the entire gate crew are also just standing around waiting. 20 minutes go by and my radio i still have on me goes off and the office is pissed. \n\nThey want to know why the hell im holding this flight short and not bringing it in, to which obviously i reply with \"what do you mean X supervisor told me they couldnt afford to pay me for lead work today and that he would find someone else\" he then asks me if i can please just bring it in for him and i said \"sorry but if your not willing to pay me to do the lead work then im only going to do the handler work im being paid for. \n\nAs it turns out they sent too many leads home this night and the ones they did have were all busy on flights already. After about 45 minutes a lead from 2 terminals over finally strolls up and were able to unload the plane as usual but that 45 minutes the plane sat idle at the gate cost thousands in extra fuel plus O.T for flight attendents forced into mandatory overtime from the situation, not to mention all the passengers who were pissed off from the extra wait who all were comped some credits with the airline for the trouble. \n\nI also come to find out the supervisors bonus were based on flight turn time and this 45 minutes short hold probably cost him his bonus and a write up.

I would regularly sit there and watch one plane sit just like OP is describing and it would block the movement of any number of other planes.

And he does not have patience for rude people.\n\nAnd on one typical military payday Friday(in towns next to military bases, all soldiers come in force on payday), we were slammed, and he was working register, when a lady orders one of our 12 piece buckets, biscuits and all.\n\n Now usually you can save some money by ordering them as a meal, gives you drinks as well. So as usual, he asks what drink she wants, intending to make it a meal automatically. She declines the drinks. He tries to explain: \"Ma'am, if we make it a meal, you'll-\"\n\nAnd she cuts him off, with \"I don't care, I don't need drinks.\"\n\nAs I said before, he hates rude people, so he immediately shuts up, smiles to me, says \"Sandsnake7, can I get a 12 piece family fill up, and don't worry about the drinks.\" Before turning to her and finishing the order, which took a moment as we couldn't simply press the combo button anymore, rather we had to ring up all items themselves.. He then had to ring up every single item individually, which racks up the price given the amount of items. And then finishes the order, which was well above what the normal price would be.\n\nIt initially went off without a hitch, but unfortunately for us at the time,(retelling a funny story later wasn't really a thought at the time, rather we just wanted to keep the line moving) the family behind her ordered another 12 piece family fill up, but they ordered the combo.\n\nAs Jay was finishing up the second family order, the first one stepped aside to check the bags for everything, then they hear the price. Jay rang the second family for almost half the price of theirs, and she storms over.\n\n\"How come theirs is so cheap, we ordered the same thing.\" She asks.\n\nTo which Jay replies, wearing the standard issue customer service smile: \"You said you didn't want no combo, ma'am, so I rang them up individually, ma'am, so you paid for them, not as a combo, but as the order you insisted on me making, ma'am.\" \n\nShe then asks for the manager, claiming we were scamming her, to which Jay responds by walking behind the wall, and coming back two seconds later wearing his manager vest. And Jay says, \"Hello, I heard we had a problem and I came to see what I can help with.\"\n\nShe grabs her food and leaves.",

Ringing those up would actually cost MORE than the special price if they grabbed another soda and a bag of popcorn, like by a dollar or more.\n\nI spent weeks trying to explain this to customers and having them, \"no thanks\" me and pay extra, until one day it dawned on me that I was going about this with the wrong approach. People appears assumed I was trying to upsell them and are conditioned to not even listen, so they just declined. We had an employee incentive to sell these, but they were in fact a really good deal, so I was not pushing them out of selfishness at all. \n\nInstead, I just started telling people, \"you have activated a special bonus reward for today with your purchase and you can grab another soda and a bag of popcorn for free.\"\n\nTelling people they get bonus free stuff for just being there is a much more effective tactic. I ended up crushing the employee incentive for our store and our region and all I ever did was *save* people money, effectively costing the company money, but they are the ones who made the incentive.

A lot of people genuinely don\u2019t want drinks, why should they have to pay more.

An ideal solution would have been to ring it up as a meal regardless of drinks. Customer\u2019s rudeness aside, this was not ideal.

Then when I went to pay the lady took my card without saying anything. When she handed me my receipt I noticed that it was 25 cents more expensive. After I pulled forward from the screen she changed my order to the combo and for whatever god awful terrible reason the combo was 25 cents more expensive than ordering them individually from the value menu. \n\nI got her attention and tried to explain the issue because she changed my order. She was instantly rude then messed with her screen for a second (I assume putting in the order to see if I was correct). Then she threw a quarter at me and slammed the window shut. The manager on duty just said sorry and that was it. \n\nI called the corporate number and complained and got a call from the franchise owner. He apologized and later mailed me 10 coupon things for free food. Then like a month later they raised the price of the mcdouble by 29 cents thus making the combo cheaper.",

A couple of times, I ordered a few items and noticed that there was something extra in the bag, like a hash brown.  I usually don't notice this until I've driven some distance from the Burger King.  I wondered if there was an error or something on the part of the cashier, but later I worked out that because of the set of items I was ordering, it was slightly cheaper to get it as a combo and include an extra item, so the cashier was doing me a favour.",

But the math doesn't work. How can it possibly be cheaper for more items? It shows two things. 1. Soda is dirt cheap. 2. Coca-cola and Pepsi must incentivize franchises to keep combos cheaper, effectively \"forcing\" people to buy their soda. It is like the company knows their product is addictive.",

My wife gave birth to our precious first daughter in September of 2021 and we have been dealing with taking the little one to the doctor (already had an emergency room visit yay!) and what not when we receive the bill for the L&D at the hospital from September. We were charged over 20,000 dollars for a straight forward, regular delivery with an epidural. Even though I do not like our insurance, it covered a huge chunk of the amount due. That being said, there was still over 2,000 left. Well, with my wife being a teacher and myself being a state government worker, our income isn't exactly low, but neither is it high either. 2,000 out of pocket would put us into major debt. The hospital was very patient (at first) with trying to get paid until recently. \n\nI had been in communication with the hospital trying to negotiate the cheapest amount possible to clear the account. The hospital still wanted close to half of the amount in order to close the account out. I countered with what we could legitimately offer and consigning myself to the addition of yet another auto debit coming out of our bank account because they weren't going to accept my offer...but then the account representative kept interrupting me during the phone call and was being outrageously rude. I understand that we have a debt, and I'm not trying to welch on it, but don't treat me like dirt because of this piss poor system that was charging my wife over 50 dollars for one frigging Advil amongst other insanity. \n\nThe account representative continued being nasty during the call and derisively suggested maybe I should go to the financial assistance program...so I did. I called the customer service line for that said program and in less than 10 minutes I was getting confirmation of the entire amount being forgiven. Apparently when you make less than 300% (my apologies. I previously had a multiplication sign when I meant percentage) the federal poverty rate and you go to most non profit hospitals, they will forgive the amount. The arrogant account representative tried to shame me into paying an outrageous price for services rendered and didn't want to accept my offer of paying some of the bill...so now they get absolutely nothing.\n\nDon't accept the medical bills that you receive. Fight tooth and nail to get it down, and if you're lucky like my wife and I, you just may get it all cleared away!",

            "Next time, offer the hospital 10% of the outstanding bill. That is, if you're will to pay them anything. If they decline, tell them you want a \"Utilization Review.\" Recommend researching it for your state to make sure you don't break any laws. What that does is trigger an investigation by a neutral 3rd party, at their expense, which compares the billed services against actual services rendered. It will knock down the $30 bill for two Advil down to a more reasonable price among other billed services. You can do this yourself if you're inclined. Or you can pay up front if you know it's going to be a routine procedure. Most hospitals will charge less than 10% of what you were charged for L&D. Take for what it's worth.",

Being that I travel a lot for seasonal work and require infused medicine every 2 months, these programs are a life saver for me with no medical insurance except my home state's medicaid, which thankfully covers out-of-state for the $10,000 dollar dose of medicine I get every 2 months.\n\nAs far as I am aware, these financial assistance programs are paid for through government grants / taxpayer programs. So yeah, the hospital still got your money - just, it was money you've already been paying this whole time for your whole life.\n\nI am glad to see the programs are helping other people! More people deserve to know it's an option. I used to be too petrified of medical debt until I was cursed with a chronic disease 1 1/2 years ago and forced to accrue debt and found out shortly after about the financial programs most hospitals have."

        "selftext": "In our mid twenties my husband & I purchased and moved into our rather modest first house with our infant daughter. I may a big effort to meet & befriend our neighbours and all of them warned me to be careful of one particular person \u2018Jane\u2019. \n\nJane had lived in the street for 3 years at this point and had earned herself the nickname \u201cBigFatJane\u201d as she was manipulating, intimidating and thoroughly awful. Jane ran a daycare from her house, but neighbours on both side reported hearing her scream at the children and leave them unsupervised in the garden. It\u2019s important to note that Jane\u2019s partner is a police officer, the neighbours were scared of retaliation if they reported her or stood up to her. It seemed Jane would use this to get away with her horrific behaviour.\n\nOur house had a driveway with a dropped curb big enough for 1 car but we could fit both if you blocked in the first and only used the second car. Parking on the street was very limited and we had double yellow lines outside our house (not allowed to stop/park there). During some essential roof work our driveway was taken up by scaffolding and a skip so we parked in the street & my husband parked outside BFJ\u2019s house. \n\nThe next day when he went to his car BFJ came running down her path shouting at him. She screamed about his \u201canti social parking, that his car would be towed and that he could expect it to be scratched up if he left it there any longer\u201d. My husband calmly explained it was a public road and she had not right to police the space. Her screeches at this point were loud enough that I (and several neighbour heard) and came to see the commotion. Her partner was perched at the door during all of this, saying and doing nothing. \n\nWhen she saw me on pavement with our daughter she pointed and screamed \u201cYou\u2019ll have the Social on you if you don\u2019t fck off! I\u2019ll scratch you right up!\u201d At this point I told my husband to come back and we were calling the police. She responded \u201cCall the polic! I Fcking dare you! He\u2019s (pointing at her partner) A police man! He\u2019ll F*cking sort You out! You won\u2019t know What hit you!\u201d At this point my husband looked at her husband and said \u201cis that right? And you\u2019re agreeing with what she\u2019s said!\u201d The partner nodded and said \u201cYou need to Move or accept the consequences, you call the police, it won\u2019t get you anywhere!\u201d \n\nFunnily when I then took out my phone and dialled the non police emergency number (on speakerphone) and made a police report both of them Looked a lot Less confident. BFJ stood there open mouthed then grabbed her partner and slammed the door. And we haven\u2019t heard from her since!\n\n Her partner was placed on suspension due to the allegation, and further allegations from our neighbours. He then returned to an admin role. After our confrontation BFJ was given a warning for a public order offence. However, due to a number of reports her daycare closed and she is no longer able to mind children. Their house is up for sale, however as she made a number of modifications without proper planning or works people it\u2019s price is significantly lower than they expected and they\u2019re in negative equity. All because of a parking space!\n\nEdit: Sorry for the initial lack of paragraphs!",

This is especially bad as my city is about half Asian, half white, including my neighborhood.  \n\nWe found out about it one day when an Asian friend parked here to visit us and we noticed the neighbor taking a picture and confronted her.  She made a casual racist comment, but then said \"Oh, she's your friend? I'll delete this picture then.\"\n\nNo revenge or anything, we just avoid the neighbor.",

My team consisted of me, a level 2 engineer and 3 managers - one for data, one for people and one overall manager.\n\nParking in town was either expensive or impossible and while management and supervisors got parking spaces in the huge multi-story next to the office, other staff members didn't get one and either had to pay the very expensive parking fees or park far away and walk. Being on a low entry-level salary, I opted to walk the 30 minutes into town (and often got sick due to bad weather). The level 2 guy lived a 5 minute walk from the office and didn't own a car.\n\nWhen any of the managers were off, they offered their parking space to me so that I wouldn't have to walk which was very nice of them and greatly appreciated as it was saving me money too. One day, I got called into HR because somebody saw me coming out of the multi-story and got jealous and asked why I get a space and they don't. This HR manager was INCREDIBLY condescending and talked to me like I was a literal child with lines like \"Back when I was your age, I thought the world owed me everything too\" which is absolutely not my attitude but sure, go off on one like you know me. She said it wasn't fair on the level 2 guy because he might want the space too, she wouldn't listen when I said he didn't drive and even said to me he didn't want it after I asked if he was okay with me using the space.\n\nAt the end of the day I went into the management office and we were chatting about the day as we usually did and I told them about the HR meeting and said they weren't allowed to let me use their space anymore. The data manager then had a genius MC suggestion. She was a very selfless soul who sacrificed much of her time to help other people and this situation rubbed her the wrong way and she wanted to do something out of spite. She said that whenever any of them were on holiday, they'd just tell me that their parking space will be empty for the duration, NOT specifically that I can use it which is what we were told not to do from HR.\n\nSo the next time they were on holiday, I parked in their space and after a few days, somebody else got jealous and taddled to HR again. I was dragged into a meeting and asked why I was still using their space. I said that I just took a chance on an empty space I found in the multi-story (they were rented, not pay and display). She went and asked the data manager when she was back in if she said I could use the space, to which she said \"No, I just said goodbye before I went on holiday for 2 weeks\". HR then told her I was in her space in her absence and asked her if she wanted to raise a complaint against me. She said \"No thanks, I wasn't using it anyway\". Their hands were tied and there was nothing they could do to prevent me from using the spaces as they're allocated privately to the individuals for use even outside of office hours and only reclaimed when they leave.\n\nTL;DR - My old data manager is a delightful human being and HR was a bitter old crow.\n\nEDIT - alright, this blew up a lot more than I'd expected so I'm going to address a few of the common questions/comments;\n\n*  Not in the US so I couldn't claim back parking as business expenses against taxes\n* Lot of people talking about not being able to get sick from bad weather (really, THATS the part you focus on?). It was by far my worst year of sickness, maybe it was the exposure to other people on my walk, idk I'm in IT not a doctor but it definitely had an effect.\n* Our contract stated that any perk (parking included) was not to be delegated to anybody else including friends, family or other staff members so yes HR had the power to question this and put a stop to it. Until we found a loophole of course.\n* I'm now well aware of how fucked it was to have 2 engineers and 3 managers but honestly didn't think much of it at the time because it was my first job and I had no idea how actual businesses were structured other than what I was taught in GCSE business studies",

        "selftext": "This story took place back in the mid-90s. My wife and I were newly married and our daughter was still an infant. My wife worked in health care as a home care nurse, travelling from house to house looking after people. However, after our daughter was born, she did not want a job that put her on the road so much and shifts in the evening. So, she applied to be a cleaner at the military base near our community. Two things about our situation that are noteworthy, one is that my wife is a visible minority and second, as a health care worker, she logs everything as a force of habit.\n\nThe company that hired her was a national company. The base office usually had five employees. One had recently quit because her husband was moving with his military job to another part of the country. So, the local boss hired my wife to replace her.\n\nThe four other workers were tight. Louise was the boss, who hired her best friend Donna, Donna\u2019s brother Dan, and Louise\u2019s niece Tracy. My wife was a true outsider.\n\nShe immediately saw things were not quite on the level. Even though my wife was paid from 4pm to midnight, she was home by 8pm every night. She was also excluded from cleaning the buildings that housed the engineering and tenancy offices. Occasionally, when she would clean those offices she saw her colleagues rifling through desks and filing cabinets, photocopying documents and other shady stuff. My wife also saw Louise threaten a soldier with extra duties for not opening doors fast enough (Louises husband was a senior NCO in the unit). But jobs were hard to find at the time so my wife was willing to accept a little discomfort to her ethics.\n\nHowever, after a few months, the racial epithets started. It started with a nickname. Then morphed into slurs and then rumours about her. They started telling racial jokes without trying to hide it. When my wife complained to the four of them that she was uncomfortable, she got called weak, and they threatened her employment. My wife told them that she would go to the head office.\n\nSo, she called the head office from work. Stuart, from HR, dressed down my wife over \u201cwomen\u2019s talk\u201d and she needed to thicken  her skin and not be too sensitive. My wife countered that she would go to the authorities. Stuart said \u201cno laws have been broken\u201d so she should \u201cgo to the authorities\u201d. Good luck. Later that shift, she was fired for attitude.\n\nSo, my wife went to the authorities. Just not the police. She went to the Human Rights Commission and to the military base headquarters.\n\nShe gave both photocopies of her logs. The Human Rights investigation determined that there was a work environment that tolerated racist behaviours. That garnered an apology and an acknowledgement from Stuart with a smug comment that they will henceforth include a clause about racial sensitivity in their employee paperwork. He even made a comment to my wife that essentially, this was \u201cnothing\u201d.\n\nHowever, behind the scenes, the base had been doing their own investigation:\n\n\\- some of the people whose desks had been rifled in the tenancy buildings had reported that they suspected they had been snooped through. The dates of some of their reports matched my wife\u2019s logs on the dates she was there\n\n\\- Louise threatening a soldier was followed up and it was discovered that Louise\u2019s husband had chastised the soldier and arranged for hime to do 2 weeks extra duties. A violation of an abuse of authority statute\n\n\\- the contract with the base requried 40 hours of service per day. The base pulled the security and key logs showing that work was always done by 8 pm. The base was paying for 40 hours per day and getting 20 hours service\n\n\\- there was a clause in the cleaning contract that stated that federal government human rights regulations needed to be followed. The results of the Commission\u2019s investiation determined that they were in violation\n\n\\- other bases were contacted to see what was going on with this company, and they found out others were having similar issues\n\nAs a result, the base broke the contract with cause. It was a 5 year contract broken after the 2nd year. Louise, Donna, Dan and Tracy were suddenly out of work.\n\nThe next cleaning company came in. All personnel had to undergo vetting for security. All cleaning was done during the day (preventing people from rifling desks), 40 hours was 40 hours, and cleaners were not authorised to engage soldiers beyond casual \u201chow are you\u201d conversations.\n\nMy wife went back to health care. However, every once in a while she wonders what Stuart thinks of \u201cwomen\u2019s talk\u201d now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit to clarify a few points:\n\nFirst, thanks for your comments. Makes me realise that even though I think the story is complete enough to tell, the odd detail could have been added to make the story more clear, yet not compromise identities of the people in the story.\n\nI am Canadian. I grew up in bilingual communities (French/English) and my various school systems I attended growing up has had an impact on my spellings (realise, behaviour, skeptical etc)\n\nThe desk snooping was in the base housing offices. The four cleaners all lived in base housing. So, they were looking up gossip worthy material on their neighbours and friends etc. They were also looking to see what major contracts were coming for house repairs (eg. window replacement). It was not classified material.\n\nWhile the four of them lost employment, they were not held accountable. The company that had the contract just laid them off. So, they were able to find work again shortly. However, just not as cleaners.\n\nCleaners had a reliability screening to work on the base even prior to this. However, it is as simple as a criminal record check, not much more. After this, the cleaners never worked in an area without supervision, and always during the same work day as the people in the offices.\n\nThe NCO who chastised the soldier was called to task for that. He ended up getting moved a year later, with a bit of a shadow following him. However, it did not last long and there was no permanent career mark left.\n\nFinally, we were very young. My wife and I are (and were) not the type to rock the boat. I was brand new in the military and did not want to be labelled as a problem soldier. So, we remained quiet for too long. After this, both of us grew or confidence and were able to move on. We don't stay quiet too long when something is not right.\n\nThanks",

        "selftext": "When I was a college sophomore, we had this professor, Mrs. Wang, in Religion Studies who would act like her subject should be our top priority. Although we came from different majors, Religion Studies is just a filler subject needed for students in this Catholic college. \n\nShe wanted us to come every meeting because attendance is a part of her grade (which was fine by me). But she would give us too many research assignments for so little time. This class is a T-TH one. So if she gives us three research assignments on Tuesday, the outputs are expected to be submitted on Thursday same week.\n\nThis started a problem on all of us since we also have a lot of things to do from major subjects. But it would be a hassle to fail a subject like this. Retaking a major subject is acceptable. Retaking a filler subject is annoying.\n\nOne Tuesday, she gave us an assignment. A 4000-word essay to be submitted on Thursday. 4000 is a lot for us given the timeframe. And that week was the week before midterms, so it gave us a hard time.\n\nBut the catch, she wanted it on a single sheet of short bondpaper. Which is literally impossible to fit the 4000-word essay.\n\nA classmate of mine, Nathan, asked Mrs. Wang about the single-page thing. Nathan asked if we could submit multiple pages of the essay to accomodate the 4000-word essay she was asking us.\n\n\u201cYou are all stubborn. 4000-word essay in a single page. That simple.\u201d\n\nMrs. Wang was already in her early-60s that time so I don\u2019t think she had an idea of what a compressed 4000-word in a single page would look like when printed.\n\nIn every subject, we have a FB group for announcements, discussions between classmates and note-sharing. In some subjects, the teacher was usually the admin of the group. But since Mrs. Wang is not too fond of FB, one of our classmates volunteered to create a group for us.\n\nThe night before the submission, we were having a problem with our outputs. Some classmates who were done with the essay tried to print their outputs. The font was too small, even though the margin was already adjusted.\n\nHere comes the malicious compliance.\n\nNathan, who was still a little pissed about the whole situation, posted a status on our group.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s give her what she wants. 4000 words in a single page.\u201d\n\nThe comments were blowing up. Some commented they were thinking of the same and others were laughing. That time, the \u201chahaha\u201d reaction button wasn\u2019t still a thing, so literal \u201chahaha\u201d were filling up the comments.\n\nThe next day, we were all excited about our plan. One by one, we placed our papers on her table. As she was scanning on some papers, she went ballistic.\n\n\u201cWhy are the words in these too small?!\u201d\n\nNathan raised his hand, \u201cMa\u2019am you were clear about a 4000-word essay on a single page. That\u2019s what it looks like.\u201d\n\nMrs. Wang couldn\u2019t contain her anger. She realized she was wrong. Instead of apologizing, she just told us to reprint our outputs and submit them on Tuesday next week.\n\nWe all agreed.\n\nTL-DR: Professor insists on a 4000-word essay on a single sheet of paper... students happily complied\n\n\nEDIT: To those who are curious about Mrs. Wang, here\u2019s a summary. Aside from giving multiple repetitive assignments every single week, Mrs. Wang was not the most pleasant professor. Her traditional outlook in life and style of teaching was...\n\nThere was one time, she saw my classmate who dyed her hair red (not totally red, but a natural-looking red) and commented that \u201cSatan likes to prey on people who color their hair.\u201d Another time she claimed that some religions are bogus and cults and they pray on the devil. \n\nAnd although she didn\u2019t really say it, I think she didn\u2019t like non-Catholics. She would emphasized on doing the sign-of-the-cross every time coz \u201cit wards off the devil around\u201d. My favorite line of hers was when she was late during one of our sessions, instead of apologizing, she just said \u201cbetter be late than never\u201d. But she would get annoyed if WE were late. \n\nSo yeah, it felt like a celebration outsmarting her one time.\n\nEDIT 2: Sorry about some of the wordings above. English is not my first language, forgive me. What I meant is that she had questionable beliefs about religion in general. And she treated us more like high schoolers. Thank you for correcting me on that.",

Had one of the similar filler classes that required a series of essays of a certain minimum length. Content was not that essential, and the length was the real challenge. The professor told us that he knows every single trick in the book and we should not try to artificially puff up the volume. Specifically, he said that the essays have to be single spaced, and the font has to be of a certain size. I was able to increase the volume by about 30% through setting the line spacing to 1.2 (still looks like single space), and using a wide font (Bookman) of the prescribed size. Worked perfectly.",
