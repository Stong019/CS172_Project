I was confused at first and started to walk him through the steps to change it himself. And he shouted angrily, \"No goddammit, just change it, write it down on a Post-It and give it to me.\" And hung up.\n\nSo I sat there for a minute and remembered I don't report to him at all. So I changed his password for him.\n\nI made it 18 characters long and it was a combination of I, l, 1, ! and | .\n\nHe was not happy. Especially after he mistyped enough times to lock his computer and he couldn't log in the rest of day. Because the support guy who had the access to do a hard password reset was out for the day.",

        "selftext": "Many years ago, I worked for a company that hired an incredibly obtuse financial department who took over when they first organized. It used to be a loose collection of managers, but the year after I started, they went for a more organized and separate structure.\n\nTo be fair, this is more about my boss than myself.\n\nWe had a travel team: a group of volunteers from sales and IT who would go, en masse, with equipment and techs to do setups, displays, and network at trade shows. We had a booth, some sales guys would be there, and networking would commence. There was always a set of volunteers from the IT department, because some of the shows would be in big cities, and you'd get to attend vendor events, parties, and hang out with the sales guys who were mostly gay alcoholics for some reason and super-fun. There was a kind of seniority to who got to volunteer, but nobody really complained, and everyone got rotated who got to go.  \"You got to go to DEFCON last year, it's my turn now.\"  \"Okay, fair.\"\n\nThe \"travel team lead\" was also a volunteer position, but commonly someone high up, like a manager. Their job was to orchestrate equipment, rentals, expenses, travel plans, convention center fees, and shipping. They also ended up getting a lot of free stuff, too, from sales and our partners, which they'd pass along to the travel team.\n\nIt was all kind of a \"perk,\" to be fair, for everyone involved.  But when the new Director of Finance started, she put in some new and strict policies. Some of their polices started with:\n\n1. Travel team is not allowed to get reimbursed without explicit approval, and nobody was approved post-event.\n2. Travel team does not get a credit card of their own, or even a company card.\n3. Travel team gets gift cards for a set amount (like $150), which was to be used for all expenses. Sadly, places we needed it for like airlines, rental agencies, hotel rooms, gas pumps, and toll booths do not accept gift cards. Finance denied these were \"gift cards\" and even specifically disallowed people in meetings to refer to them as such (\"pre-approved credit balances\" I think we had to say), but to the rest of the world? They were 100% exactly the same as gift cards with gift card restrictions.\n4. No matter how early you asked for it, often Finance waited until the very, very last minute (and usually after half a dozen reminders) to get anything approved, which incurred a lot of unneccesary costs, like expedited shipping, same-day rental penalties, or inflated air fares.\n5. If they forgot, it was your fault or your manager's fault for not \"reminding them enough.\"  Okay, you reminded them 4 times to buy the team airline tickets and it wasn't done? Should have reminded them 5 times, so, your fault.\n\nThis was ALL in response to the Director of Finance's claim it would \"reduce fraud,\" an issue that, as far as anyone could tell, had never happened. The director had this Dolores Umbridge  approach that somebody, somewhere, \"might get away with something.\" She was a patronizing git with a smug grin and this annoying head waggle when she \"down-splained\" something to you. So we'll call her Dolores.\n\nBefore her, the travel team would just submit receipts and get reimbursed. Dolores put an end to that, specifically saying the the previous lead of the travel team was \"just going to spend all the money on steaks and wine.\" He, understandably, told her to go fuck herself, and quit the company when the dust settled.  In his wake, Dolores used his \"free stuff from vendors\" as a shining example of stolen opulence and schwag hoarding that she put an end to.\n\nOh, behold the mighty on his throne of Airborne Express stress squishies and free Uline catalogs!\n\nThat left my manager to take over his duties, and he'd never done travel team, so he wasn't really sure how it all worked and didn't push back on Dolores at first until he was forced to travel with the team. He was surprised he didn't have an expense account or corporate card, and when he asked for one, he got the gift card. When he tried to use it, it was rejected pretty much everywhere he needed it except various restaurants. He paid for everything else on his personal American Express card, including stuff for the rest of the team, and was rejected for reimbursements because he didn't ask for it beforehand.  He was on the hook for $40k+ in various things from two week-long trips.\n\nOf course, he complained to the top management. Dolores threatened to quit if she wasn't allowed to do her job, and the top managers never had to deal with her before, and were kind of wishy washy about \"being the bad guy here.\" Like, \"well, she says she lets you use gift cards, so...\" and when my manager said they were rejected, Dolores said, \"he's not trying hard enough; he's afraid of confrontation. He needs to be a big boy and fight back.\"  But in the end, the top management reimbursed him under pressure from the legal department.\n\nAfter that happened, Dolores \"settled\" on having certain things \"pre-paid for,\" like hotel, travel, truck rentals, and shipping. But they waited so long to do them, that often they tried to get hotel rooms or truck rental the day of a popular event (sold out), or got the wrong hotel (Washington DC is not the same as Washington State), or waited so long for shipping, it cost $250 to send something overnight that would have cost $40 to send it a few weeks prior. They also didn't understand how much ANYTHING actually cost, and how we saved money by doing things ourselves.  And in some cases, Finance did everything wrong, so the team would arrive at the right hotel, and found out that Finance didn't submit an authorized approval for a card (for, say, incidentals, a requirement for most hotels for trade shows), and nobody could reach them, so again, people got dinged on their personal cards.\n\nAgain, Dolores said, \"they just can't accept what the hotel desk, convention center union, or dumb minimum wage bunny at the toll booth tells them, they have to fight back! We can't spoon feed and coddle these guys because they are too scared of conflict!\"  Ever fight with a Jersey Turnpike toll booth collector?  Yeah, neither had she.\n\nAfter two of these disasters, my manager said, \"Just stop. Stop volunteering for these events. I will not approve time off for it.\" He declined being travel lead for future trips because he just couldn't afford it. This was an unpopular move, at best, but he told us \"just wait. Let her do things her way.\"  He was a master at malicious compliance, and with no resistance, Dolores went into 5th gear with the smug grin, \"Now we're going to act like a REAL company.\"\n\nThat leads to the next issue: some of these travels were in major cities, like Chicago, New York City, Washington DC, etc. Dolores, again, said that people \"were just going to these events to get the company to pay for a drinking vacation.\" Management was like, \"uh, yeah? We wouldn't get volunteers, otherwise.\"  Well, Dolores didn't like THAT idea. So she decided that she would hold a \"staff lottery\" and you could enter your name, and she'd have a drawing on who got to go \"to be fair to everyone.\" This \"fairness\" seems awfully slanted on her own staff, by the way, which we'll get to shortly.\n\nThe point of these trade shows was NOT to take a vacation, something Dolores made absolutely sure to point out, but she didn't grasp the entire reason we went: to increase our business. It had to be IT folk for setup, and sales folk for the schmoozing, but that concept never got past her ears into her cognitive understanding. Well, since those IT and tech folk who already couldn't go didn't want to pay for it, we didn't volunteer. So the travel team ended up being other company staff who had no idea how to work, act, or deal with trade shows which was a horrific expense disaster.\n\nImagine the administrative assistant for Marketing on the 5th floor winning a ticket, only to find out she had to pay for everything. Plus, Dolores ALWAYS sent one of her own to keep \"an eye on everyone\" but none of them knew how trade shows worked, either. They only knew how to kowtow to Dolores and her control issues.\n\n*\"What is a union fee?  What is corkage?  No, we did not approve some union to give us power, you plug your booth stuff into an outlet or something.  They won't let you?  Who is THEY? Well, then stop using TV screens in the booth. You don't need them, we do not sell TVs, anyway.\"*\n\nDid you know that if you have a conflict with a event center union and declined their \"help\" they charge you anyway at max rate?  Yeah, Dolores and her team didn't know that, either. And let me tell you, paying those guys a few thousand bucks ahead of time is a LOT cheaper than just letting them charge you fines afterwards.  Oh, she tried to fight back, because she was \"not afraid of a little conflict,\" but lost heavily.\n\nIronically, despite Dolores stating otherwise, at great length, the non-IT-or-salespeople who went actually thought it WAS company paid vacation-ish, just like Dolores warned about, making it a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy. The fact they had to work was surprising at first. Then after that word got out, NOBODY would enter into the \"lottery,\" so now they had NO volunteers. So Dolores assigned them to interns. INTERNS. I could write and entire novel from that disaster alone. Imagine sending a bunch of college kids to Vegas, telling them they had to pay for things, and putting them in a job conflict situation where they were guaranteed to lose? I am sure many laws were broken.\n\nDolores then had to send along \"chaperones\" to manage it, who were more of her finance department flunkies, and our company ended up with massive fines for various issues, including paying bail for the interns.  Because the interns got into so much trouble, Delores started hiring room monitors for the hotels and fully legal adults had to go to the show, work the entire day at the show on their feet, then check back in to their room. She also put 4-6 people to a room, too. Like they were a high school band or something. She even had breathalyzers bought for it to make sure nobody was drinking. Adults. She treated adults like this.\n\nThis was brought up by the sales teams as a PR nightmare, and my boss said, \"just wait. Okay?  Let her hang herself.\"\n\nThe first year of this, the travel team's expenses increased by over 4000% You heard me, four THOUSAND percent. Trips that used to cost $3600 were now costing $144k or more, often because of late-minute fees and penalties.  The travel team expenses went from $110k annual on average to over 2-point-something million. Because shit was so badly mishandled, we lost a lot of our booths slots and booth renewals, so we lost half our trade shows, and looked like idiots to our clients. But the main reason we went to those trade shows in the FIRST PLACE was for networking, so there was literally no reason to go anymore.  This was pointed out to Dolores multiple times by the sales team, so she doubled down and \"canceled\" the travel team after just one year.\n\nFinally top management got involved, who actually fought with Dolores for a year until she \"retired for personal reasons/to dedicate herself to her family.\"  Then it took nearly two years to rebuild the travel team from scratch. People got corporate cards, travel team lead became an actual job, and when we hired one, she handled all the financial stuff for us, so it was much better, and saved the company a TON of money in her first year.\n\nAnd there was much rejoicing.  \n\n\n\\----  \n EDIT: So, some edits, based on some common questions:\n\nQ: You're really talking about \\[some name\\], aren't you? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA: There are a lot of \"Dolores Umbridges\" out there, apparently. Only three people, former coworkers, got it right. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ: Why was she not fired when the spending went from $110k to $2.1mil? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA: Several reasons, the biggest being she was Director of Finance. So I am sure when she gave her fiscal report, she downplayed the mistakes. We also had some really good years in the early 2000s, so if we made $2mil in profit the previous year, and $3mil the next, that loss would have gone unnoticed until someone realized we should have made $6mil instead. That's my theory, at any rate, based on the aftermath. Dolores was friends of two of the top managers, and supposedly had a \"come to Jesus\" meeting with them about the state of our company's financial standings, so that's why they hired her in the first place. By the second year, several directors had quit, including friends of top management who took them for drinks later and got the entire scoop. \"Dolores has got to go.\"  The trade show thing was only one of the cases she fucked things up: she also completely hosed one of our major supply chains by low-balling them, and making a few enemies that nearly destroyed the company and gave away some of our more lucrative contracts with vendors to competitors because that broke their anti-competitive clauses.  There were more issues, but that comes closer to identifying some people, which is a huge no-no here. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ: What happened to the Christmas party? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA: The Christmas Party wasn't nearly as interesting: she just didn't have one. This was near the tail end of the whole \"now we're going to run this like a REAL company\" fiasco, but once the budget for events was $2.1mil from $110k, the Christmas party was probably far down her list of worries. I don't even think she knew she was supposed to have one. Some people think she was funneling that money to cover up the massive expense increase for the trade show fiascos, but I can't imagine that those budgets were from the same pool. I think around November, people started asking, \"don't they have a Holiday Party every year?\" but nobody knew who was doing it.  Usually it the three people who were a huge part of it in previous years we no longer with the company (they had quit, mostly because of Dolores). But even they didn't run it, per se, they hired and catered it out at some fancy hotel locally. Our fiscal year was Jan-Dec, so December was huge for tying things up, and this was her first year running \"Fiscal Year End\" stuff (she came on board late in the previous year) and so the Finance would have been normally very occupied, anyway.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ: How was she let go? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA: She just gained too many enemies in the company. It took a while, but after she had been with us for a year and a half, she accumulated too much negative drag on her inertia to get things done because there started to be a very strong passive resistance. This caused her to spiral out of control, and try to start a coup which gained no traction and singled her out as being mildly unhinged to say the least. By the time her second anniversary came and went, she started taking \"sabbaticals\" until one of them became permanent. Her assistant took over, but then was let go, and they brought in some consultant group who started a new finacial team. They were the ones that suggested someone have the \"table team lead\" as an actual, separate, paid job. The woman who got hired and ran that was AMAZING.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ: Is it true she tried to sell keychains and pens? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA: No one asked this, but a former coworker reminded me that she was appalled we were just \"giving away\" some of our normal booth freebies like stickers, pens, shirts, and keychain flashlights. She demanded we charge at least a nominal fee for them, but IIRC, nobody followed that mandate. I only personally know she sent out a memo admonishing employees that a lot of the keychains went missing and she was seeing them on people's desks.  \"Those cost the company money,\" and wanted to charge employees $3.00 for them. But apparently she wanted to charge people at the booth as well.",

            "It floors me how in these cases upper management can't see that this person is subtracting value from the company.

You can't have anything shipped there, either, without going through their shipping service which is sold per the pallet weight or some such thing, so that shipping one padded envelope costs the same as a stack of 30 window air conditioners.\n\nWe also tried those \"gift cards\" and yeah, nobody would accept them.

            "Wow, brings back memories. I was an IT roadie for a computer vendor in the 1980s. My actual job was a pre/post sales analyst. This is a tough position in sales because the sales management never seemed to get the hang of what motivated people in those positions. My first experience was an exhibition that we held in a hotel. Based on what the company saw from that, I had a new unofficial role.\n\nThis was the era of the large tech trade shows like NCC and Comdex. You had to experience Comdex to believe it. The amount of work that goes on before the show opens is staggering\n\nIt is a little hard to wrap my head around why the upper management was so slow to respond to Delores. In my experience, most of them came up through sales. They should have had a clear understanding of why the company was participating and what the goals and expectations were from each trade show. Sometimes it was a show the flag effort. Other times it was to launch product. It was always an opportunity to connect with present and future customers. For us techies, we scoped out the competition.\n\nThe cost of a booth at a major trade show in those days was comparable to what it takes per square foot to build a house. This is for a period of roughly the week that it takes to put it all up and do a 3 or 4 day show.  There are a lot of aspects that run on cash. Cash, not credit card, not invoice and certainly not gift cards. For sales, it was all hands on deck. For techs, our big push was getting everything in the booth up and running. We often had a quarter million (in 1985 dollars) worth of equipment. In some cases, what was in the booth was a one-of-a-kind item borrowed from development. Gift cards? Pffft! Steaks and wine? There were nights when I would have killed for a day old hot dog. \n\nBooth selection for the next show is one of the most important duties for the person responsible. It is literally a corporate asset and screwing it up, even accidentally, would be cause for termination. \n\nThe person responsible for everything trade show was the MarCom Manager. In our case, this was Sue because, that wasn't her name. Nothing happened in the booth unless Sue approved it. We never opened a show at less than 100% functionality.\n\nNeither Sue nor I were a big fan of the shows once they actually opened. It is a different skill set manning a booth than the logistics of getting one out of the trucks and setup or striking it and putting it back to go home. We were never really off duty since things happen and we would have to go back in after dinner to get the booth all spiffed up and fixed for the next day. We did find time to have some fun with some games and challenges. \n\nMany vendors hosted special events. These were generally at the hotels and always involved food. One of the challenges was who could submit the expense report with the smallest entry for food and these events were one of the keys to that. The trick was to wrangle an invite with connections or bluff your way in. That was also part of the fun.\n\nIn Las Vegas we also played \"Spot the Hooker\". There were few rules other than mutual agreement if one of us spotted one. So, Sue I were walking the casino headed to the elevator when she gave me a shot in the ribs followed by a surreptitious, \"there's one!\" Score for Sue; short satin dress, fishnet stockings. We got into the elevator and so do the hooker and her John. The door closes and the John pipes up, \"Hi guys!\" What we have here is one of our VARs who had been invited to show his software in our booth. We politely recognized him and then glued our eyes to the floor indicator. So, the pair got off and he said good night. Sue and I collapsed in laughter as soon as the doors closed. He thought that he pulled it off, but boy did he look rough in the booth the next day.",

This included setting my own work hours, which varied week to week due to company needs, and also my own...\n\nAnyway, I (**Me**) got a new manager (**NM**) that was in between me and the director/now former manager (**FM)** I reported to. They were the sort of person that felt the need to micromanage and be in control of everything, despite having little to no understanding of what I do, and why my hours need to be flexible.\n\nNow, **NM** was purely office based, so setting regular hours that they worked each week was easy.

I explain the situation and he says he will talk to **NM**. **FM** obviously gives **NM** a bit of a bollocking and the next day **NM** pulls me to the side and says they're happy to go back to the previous arrangement I had with **FM**, provided I attend the meeting.\n\n>**Me -** \u201cNot a problem, on that note, I\u2019ll be leaving early Friday!\u201d\n\nI walked away, **NM** looked furious, but knew they couldn\u2019t do anything about it!

It's a CYA on the employer's part. \n\nI'm an HR technology consultant who often had to build this functionality into systems.",
            "What state or province you live in? Labour laws in many jurisdictions mandate you take at least a 30 minute uninterrupted break for every 5 hours of work. The employer has no say on the matter. You should've been disciplined for not taking that break TBH.",
            "As a manager, if your subordinates are getting docked for a lunch that they aren't taking because they're working hard, you're suposed to stand up for them \n\nIf youre ok with them getting fucked out of lunch pay, but not when it happens to you, you're literaly garbage.\n\nSeriously, fuck you.",
            "No, take yoir fucking lunch, just be fucking flexible about when it happens. This isnt really a mc its just stupid on both parts.",
            "Bragging that you don't take lunch isn't much of a brag. You should take your lunch and breaks mandated by law.",

            "I\u2019m assuming this is in America and lunches are mandatory and my company is pretty strict about a break after 5 hours, otherwise HR lets you know because they can get in a lot of trouble. Worker\u2019s rights and so forth, which are extremely important. People get tired after working so many hours and it\u2019s a liability. You really should take a lunch for your own sanity and health, but it\u2019s understandable that sometimes you can\u2019t always take one at a set time. Even 30 min lunch that can be flexible for you. I usually take a lunch between 12 to 2, but unfortunately shit happens and I clock out at 4pm to take lunch some times.",
            "They made you because the HAD to, it\u2019s literally the law. \n\nBut hey, screw them for trying to ensure you received your legal rights.",
            "Errr...\n\nSo... assuming you are in the US, those \"mandatory lunches\" are mandated by 21 states. Your workplace was probably pissed off at you because you could be violating the law, and it would be the company that gets the screwed. So, assuming this story is even true: congratulations, you potentially forced your company to violate the law, or lose business.\n\nAlso: Those lunches are often 30 minutes, not 2 hours. I hope you get a write-up and check yourself.",
            "Quite honestly you should have been fired. You do realize that it's a federal requirement that everyone take lunch? It isn't a stupid rule, you're stupid for working through your lunch.",
            "Ehhhh... I used to work in the legal industry. Employers in many states are required to make best efforts to ensure employees are taking lunch breaks. This is in response to wage theft claims made by disgruntled ex-employees. Maybe someone at your company filed a wage theft complaint at the state board and now they are being investigated so need to be on high alert to go by the book. \n\nThe problem here is you took a two hour lunch break when you're being docked 30 minutes a day. I don't see this as malicious compliance, just maliciousness.",
            ">They implemented mandatory lunches for everyone\n\nYou mean followed federal regulations?",
            "This is the shittiest malicious compliance ive ever seen.",
            "Here\u2019s all I need to know:\nYou\u2019re too special to follow rules and you\nblame someone who \u201cdoesn\u2019t like you\u201d.",
            "Maybe if I add a little bit to this. So in an 8 hour. We would get a couple breaks of 15 minutes each and half an hour lunch that like I said it was implemented to save money I'm a hundred percent sure. I didn't appreciate I was being forced to take it when it was convenient to them the end of the day skip lunch get this product for me skip a lunch skip a lunch skip lunch. So I would stop with one of my 15 minute break grab a burger and as a truck driver drive to the next stop and be fine looking forward to 2 and 1/2 hours every week of overtime because I didn't get to take my 30 minute lunch and a normal fashion. It may look like I was stealing time but I Justified it as my break time allowance"

        "selftext": "So this was well before Covid, so I might be fuzzy on the details, as this was back when I worked at a burger joint in the middle of a small city. A small one, but it gave me a chuckle, and I was reminded of it after reading an earlier post about someone falsely claiming a salt-free diet for a party.\n\nSome dude walks in, with the *most condescending* look on his face as he looks around our establishment. We advertised as a place which catered to dietary needs, including vegetarian, vegan, organic, and religious diets, and this dude at least doesn't look like the type such a place caters to, but I don't get paid to judge. He orders a typical burger (the joint's default), but with no salt on the patties. Not a problem, people have done this before, we easily prepare an unsalted double patty burger.\n\nThis time, however, when he bites it his face is a look of disgust.\n\nMe: Is something wrong, sir?\n\nCustomer: There's way too much salt on this burger!\n\nMe: That's strange, we didn't put any salt on your burger, as you asked.\n\nCustomer: As if! When I say no salt, I MEAN IT! I am on a no salt diet as per my doctor's orders!\n\nMe: Oh really? Well why didn't you say that to begin with? Let me just make a new burger for you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCue MC. Our place had special policies the moment a medical history or specific diet was mentioned.\n\n(4 minutes later, handing him a lettuce wrapped double patty with no pickles or bacon)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCustomer: The fuck is this shit? This isn't a burger!\n\nMe: Actually sir, it is a *properly* salt-free burger, as you requested.\n\nCustomer: But there's not even a bun!\n\nMe: Our burger buns are made with salt.\n\nCustomer (now studying the burger closely): Where are the toppings I asked for?!\n\nMe: Our bacon and pickles are both heavily salted. Since your salt-free request is a result of a dietary restriction, not just a request, we are obligated to remove any instances of the ingredient in question. Don't worry, we didn't charge you for the bacon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe customer then bit into the burger, stating that it was terrible. Not just that the lettuce wrap was far inferior, but that the meat was tasteless. Well I'm sorry sir, but not only did *you ask* for no salt (hence the tasteless), you triggered our establishment's dietary policy by making your request based on a medical need.\n\nMy manager had to explain to him that if he wanted a new burger, he would have to pay for it.\n\n(Edit: clarifications)\n\nEdit 2: To clarify, yes we took dietary restrictions seriously, it wasn't just some bullshit for marketing. That's why we had to change the order so drastically, otherwise I wouldn't have bothered. Yes we were aware that salt dietary restrictions are very serious for some people, that's why as I stated in a comment when someone did mention it as being a dietary restriction, we typically asked for more details, like if bread was still okay. Some people even switched to vegetarian or vegan burgers. I usually tried to warn them when that happened, because our veggie burgers weren't impossible burgers or anything, they were literal vegetable patties and they weren't that good imo. However, we'd dealt with enough malingerers (people making up diagnoses for attention) that we were pretty sure about this guy.\n\nNo we did not normally treat customers like this, people were generally much nicer than this, and those that weren't were usually easily spotted & caught malingerers. We'd comp'd or remade meals for people plenty of times because we screwed up the dietary needs on their order.\n\nNo I do not think this particular customer really had the restriction because 1. he was surprised to hear that bacon and pickles were super salty, and 2. he got angry with *us* for trying to adhere to his restriction.\n\nIf he really did, I wish him the best in that endeavor, and I hope we didn't turn him away from adhering to the restriction, but don't be a dick to the people trying to help you. This wasn't a malicious confrontation until he started getting angry because of the taste of the first burger.\n\nNo you cannot visit (or boycott) the place now, because both locations in my state already went bankrupt months before the pandemic in the US. Turns out the places had never made a cent in profit in the 6 years they were open, because advertising a $7 burger primarily to people who don't want to eat at other burger places is a *terrible business model*. There's other locations open, but only a couple in California and like a dozen in the Middle East. I can't speak for them.\n\nNo I did not edit and repost someone else's story for Karma, the story that reminded me of this was of someone going to a party at a house and very strictly demanding no salt in any of their food. This was a customer at a restaurant I worked for, not a guest at a dinner party.\n\nEdit 3: Thank you kind strangers for the awards and gold! Never thought this post would be this popular",

Can't use the toppings set up on the line, can't use the knife/spatula on the line, bread must be sent through toaster wrapped in tinfoil, all toppings and sauces have to be pulled from the cooler to ensure no contamination, etc.  It throws the whole operation out of whack, especially during a rush, so if you just prefer the gluten free bread and aren't allergic it really helps to know so we don't fall behind and end up with customers screaming at us for being too slow.",
            "That reminds me of my wedding. Friend's wife said for years she had to be gluten-free and, in hindsight, I recall her dodging the question of whether or not she had Celiac's very artfully. So we all thought she did. Even my friend helped her keep the ruse up. \n\nSo my wife and I are preparing our meal choices for our guests and the venue offers a gluten-free option. We mention we're having a guest who needs the gluten-free option as she has Celiac's disease. OK. It'll cost about 75% more than the per-plate cost of the other two options because it's a special request so it won't be cooked in large quantities, whatever. We're taking care of a friend with a medical concern.\n\nWe get their RSVP back and she's selected the chicken. A very not Celiac-friendly chicken. Gluten-free was crossed out because my wife and I pre-filled hers in when we sent it. \n\nWe called her up and asked \"What's going on? I thought you had Celiac's?\"\n\n\"No, I just thought Glutens were bad for you and made you fat.\"\n\nSo we made her take the goddamned Gluten-Free meal. Enjoy your flavorless whateverthefuck while the rest of us are eating well. To this day, I pick on her about it. Not because she fell victim to some misinformation online. Because she had every opportunity for YEARS to say why she was gluten-free and dodged the question because she KNEW it was wrong. And we paid about $260 for her to be there. Nevermind the people that RSVP'd Yes and then no-showed, we lost about $1,500 paying for their meals, but this one irked me the most.",

Told \"Case Closed\".  I argued that this was part of the original diagnosis and might continue for years.  \"Case Closed\" was the response.  I offered to pay for the pills but needed the script from rhe doctor to get more.  I was told that all I could do was reopen the claim.  \"ok, thank you.

            "My husband worked as an electrician for a manufacturing facility. He used his phone all the time in the plant for work. Other people working in the plant complained about the electricians always being on their phones. Management said no more personal cell phones.\n\nMy husband came home and told me that management is full of idiots, but he was leaving his phone at home. I  work from my home, and you can hear the PA system from his plant at our house. Judging from all of the text messages, the phone calls, and the announcements broadcast from their PA system, they really wanted to reach \"ET Bob.\" He couldn't respond; his cellphone was at home, just like they wanted. \n\nBob also couldn't do his job properly, because a lot of what he used his phone for was to take pictures of wires and circuits and boards where he couldn't stick his head. He had rigged some attachments to hold his phone steady to watch what he was doing, but that didn't work with what the plant provided. This meant tearing apart equipment to be able to remove the suspected faulty equipment before being able to even test said equipment. No more troubleshooting, just completely tear equipment apart, replace everything, then reassemble.\n\nIt cost the plant so much money. Down time, overtime, replacing everything instead of rewiring a board, reduced output, delays in maintaining other equipment.... The bosses were not happy. But now my husband was pissed.\n\nIf they wanted the efficiency back, then tell the preening little peacocks they had promoted to management to leave the electrical shop alone. It took two weeks, but then they were asked to PLEASE keep their phones handy.\n\nMy husband passed away unexpectedly in October, and somehow I keep getting emails from his work that they are hiring an electrician, would I like to apply. No you motherfuckers, I would not. This company tried to take back my husband's vacation pay because he didn't return to work on the Monday following his death. They can all rot in hell for all I care now. I don't know how I got added to their email list, but it is like a knife being twisted in my heart every time I hear from them.

To work security in a casino you need to have specific certificates and need to carry them on you to prove that you have them if an inspector visits. You could either have paper copies or have them on your phone but the regulation was that you needed to have them physically on you at all times when working. Which meant that security was the only people allowed to carry our phones. Another guard got caught using their phone at the security desk before the casino even opened. So like not a big deal. But the GM was in a pissed off mood so he got written up and it came down that we weren\u2019t allowed to have our phones anymore. Ok. We all stopped carrying our phones with us, and someone secretly sent a tip to the licensing board that none of the security guards were current on their certifications. We got a surprise visit a few days later and since none of us had our paperwork on us we all got fined. I don\u2019t remember the exact number but I think it was in excess of $100,000 that the casino had to pay for their stupid random rule change.",

I was dismayed to discover that our shopping schedules coincide and she was there the next time that I visited, and said the same thing.\n\nCue the malicious compliance.

They don't like that, not one bit, and after being told that no, they will not be getting the number to his hotel in Aruba, they're passed on to Tommy. \n\nTommy was the fucking new guy, but in a good way.

SGI Octane, dual-processor, with 128MB video cards, 4GB of memory, and monitors.\n\nThey don't care how much it costs, but they need them as soon as possible. \n\nTommy tells them he'll call back in a hour, he needs to speak to the vendors. \n\n<Vendor1> will take three weeks at least, they're out of stock.\n<Vendor2> will take two weeks, and cost 20% more since they'll have to upgrade existing systems.\nSGI themselves quote three weeks. \n\nTommy, for the first time in his life, remembers we had a former executive from SGI on staff, and calls him, begging for a contact that might make it faster.\n\n>Exec: How about today? We have 20 of them in the warehouse. Sure, they're supposed to go to <customer>, but that won't be for another two months. We can play some games with serial numbers on the lease after the replacements come in.\n\nTommy thanked him and called the customer back.\n\n>Customer: It's been almost two hours. Next time don't promise a deadline you can't meet. \n\n>Tommy: Yeah, I know, and I'm sorry. I had to work pretty hard to track down what you need, and well, I've got some good news and some bad news. \n\n>Customer: You called <Vendor1>? \n\n>Tommy: Yep, they can't have 'em to you for three weeks.\n\n>Customer: You call any other vendors? \n\n>Tommy: <Vendor2>, they want a markup but can have it in two weeks. I also spoke with.. \n\n>Customer: What about the manufacturer? \n\n>Tommy: I called them too, they also want three weeks. But we have.. \n\n>Customer: How much of a markup does <Vendor2> want? \n\n>Tommy: 20%, but that doesn't matter because.. \n\n>Customer: Go ahead and order them. \n\n>Tommy: You haven't even heard the.. \n\n>Customer: If I never hear another fucking word out of your mouth it will be too soon. Just get it ordered, and I expect paperwork by 8am tomorrow. \n\nThe customer paid an extra quarter million dollars, plus interest and fees, and the guys in Services got an extra two months to play Doom.\n\nWith the reship delays on the order, they didn't get their machines for four weeks.",
