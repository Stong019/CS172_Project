        "selftext": "Another fun story of an obnoxious boss.\n\nAs I've mentioned in other posts, I used to travel a lot for business, between 30 and 35 weeks a year.\n\nOur boss was a frequent traveler as well, and taught us the tricks of the trade for accumulating frequently flier miles (and especially status - a really great perk).\n\nEventually he retired and sold the company to new boss.  New Boss overheard that I had over 500,000 Frequent Flyer Miles with my airline (not credit card points), and said he should implement a new policy that we had to use our personal Frequent Flyer Miles  for our business travel, since the company had paid for our trips.\n\nThat weekend my wife and I sat down and booked weekend trips all over the country over the next year.  Boston for Clam Chowder?  Check.  New York City for a Broadway Show?  Check.  Garlic Fest in Gilroy, CA (a real and delicious thing, BTW)?  Check.  By Monday morning, my Airline Frequent Flyer Mile account was down to about 15,000 miles.\n\nLater that week it was time to book a trip and he said I had to use Frequent Flyer Miles.  I brought up my account and showed him I didn't have enough miles.  He asked where they went and when I said I had booked some trips, he demanded I re-deposit the miles.  I pointed out there was a $150 charge per-person and that since it wasn't policy, I wasn't going to pay it.\n\nPissed, he announced going forward we needed approval for personal use of our personal Frequent Flyer Miles.OK, boss.  You bet.\n\nMy next step was to spread my flights over any and every airline I could find to prevent accumulating the 20,000 miles required to redeem for a free ticket.  I was on United, Frontier, American, Delta, Northwest, Continental, US Air, Southwest, etc.  At one point I think I booked a trip on the Mrs. Grace L. Ferguson Airline and Storm Door Company (Google it - it's a Bob Newhart routine - and more true now than when he performed it 60 years ago.)\n\nHe eventually figured out what I was up to, and he lost what little patience remained for me.  Then the following (paraphrased) took place.\n\nBoss: \"I suppose you think you're a smart guy.\"\n\nMe: \"No, I know I'm a smart guy.\"\n\nBoss: \"Don't get cute.\"\n\nMe: \"No, I'm smart.  Cute is just a bonus.  Look, I see my wife about 10 days a month.  I live out of a suitcase.  I know the aircraft evacuation speech by heart.  Most of my meals are handed to me throuhg a window.  And thanks to my willingness to do this, you make hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Can you please just let me keep the only perk I get from all this?\"\n\nBoss thought about it for a bit, grunted, \"Fine, keep your miles.\" and walked away.  \n\n\nEdited to clarify these were Airline Frequent Flyer miles, not credit card points.  Sorry about the confusion!",

            "As contrast, the company i used to work for as a frequent traveler helped us to have more pleasant trips because they knew damn well how hard it is to be gone often.\n\nDuring the 90\u2019s before internet travel booking, our company has an in-house travel department as we had that many people travel.  Our agent had great relationships with several airlines and hotel chains.  We frequently got 1st Class upgrades and room perks due to her negotiation skills.  \n\nWe kept all mileage and hotel perks to boot.  She was absolutely adored by all of us traveling and the CEO personally gave her bonuses quarterly because of her efforts.  He also had near zero turnover in his sales, tech and engineering groups who did the bulk of traveling.  He damn well knew who kept the dollars flowing into the company.",
            "I swear we worked for the same guy.\n\nMy boss was a complete dick about travel. And it's true, if you're spending your entire life traveling, the miles are the one perk that comes out of it.\n\nAnyone who takes that away is just a dick.",
            "I spent 10 years on the road. Eventually I got permanent President's Circle status at Hertz. When a team went on-site for an implementation, I'd show up in amazing cars - brand new convertible sports cars, Camaros, Challengers, Mercedes, a top-end Cadillac CTS with 7 miles on the odometer - you get the idea. I got the nicest car on the lot, no matter what level car I reserved. The rental car bus would drop me off at my car. When I brought the car back, an agent would drive me to the airport check-in in the car.  \n\nMy superiors were pissed at this, but there was nothing they could do. I wasn't paying any extra - it was just a perk of traveling so much for so long. I still contend that the Cadillac CTS rental at corporate for a meeting, followed by the Mercedes in Las Vegas contributed to my firing. Oh well.",
            "I had an employer try and force me to use miles that I had earned before starting with them. When I told my supervisor, full stop, that I wasn't going to use MY miles to pay for a trip that THEY were requiring me to go on, his response was \"Well, it's obvious that you don't care about this company.\" I responded with \"That's not true, I care about this company about as much as you care about me.\"",

            "My company just goes straight for the jugular and forces us to use their travel booking company so they get the miles directly.  At least we still pay directly, so we still get the credit card points.\n\nThe ironic thing is that even though they get the miles for the trips we book, we could get much better pricing if we didn't have to use their designated travel service so they'd actually probably end up spending less on travel if they'd just let us book our own flights and keep the miles.",

            "Your boss might have worked for the federal government or a nonprofit that was funded by the federal govt., or maybe he had just heard about it, because that was the law until 2002. I worked for a nonprofit funded by federal dollars and traveled internationally, racking up many miles, but was required to use them for more business travel.\n\n>The fiscal 2002 Defense Authorization bill, signed into law in December, included a provision allowing civil service, military and Foreign Service employees to use frequent flier miles obtained on government travel for personal use. **Prior to the law's passage, federal employees were not allowed to use their frequent flier miles** because the 1994 Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (Public Law 103-355) prohibited them from accepting promotional items, including frequent flier miles, they received while traveling at the government's expense.

            "The first company I had to travel for issued me a company card and we had an official company travel agency for dealing with company travel. Boss says you need to travel, call agent, you\u2019ll have your tickets, hotel, and rental car booked. Just fill in the expense report on your corporate card. I quickly learned the ins and outs and what would be approved expense wise and when other colleagues in my department had to travel with they just got to ride on my corporate card. \n\nThe catch? Miles went to the corporate pool because it\u2019s a corporate card. As a lowely peon I don\u2019t get any miles benefits. Miles from corporate cards went to executives, maybe if you travel enough you get executive lounge access or a first class upgrade if an airline gives it to you. \n\nThe benefit... the one time I ran into a weather related event I called the emergency travel line as soon as we could turn on cell phones and my two coworkers and I had hotel, rental car, and rebooked flights by the time we got down the jetway, while everyone else was swarming the customer service desk. We got to go to a decent hotel and got to bum around Arizona state parks in a rented SUV for a couple days on the company\u2019s dime.  \n\nEvery employer since has been expense travel... so pay for it yourself and get reimbursed. And since it\u2019s your card (and finances) your card perks are yours. Generally get a one airline ticket out of rewards miles generated by business travel theses days. \n\nThe position of OP\u2019s employer seems dubious...",

At the time I had a lot of projects way out of state and had to go to a lot of out of state trainings so I racked up a lot of miles.  Well, government policy was, any frequent flyer miles earned were government property because we were traveling on the government's dime.  \n\nI just couldn't be bothered with that, nor could anyone else, so we didn't create frequent flyer accounts.  Net effect - nobody benefitted.   I eventually stopped flying unless the drive was over 10 hours because the drive to the airport - wait for the plane to inevitably board late - transfer to some puddle jumper (also late) - get a rental car deal took just as long as driving, and was far more tedious.",

Another aspect most people are not aware of: If they let you spend company-bought miles for private trips, you'd actually have to pay income tax on the monetary value of those award flights, because they count as additional company-provided benefits.

He doesn't do this to my brother or my cousins just me.  \n\nWhen I hit 16 I went to a technical college (in the UK) to do my A-Levels and my uncle went back to learn to be an electrician. We would pass now and then when our classes had breaks and normally just nod in acknowledgement. One day after class I went into the town centre bout 200m down the road and ran into my Uncle William shopping. I said Hi Will to him to get his attention we had our usual chat about DJ'ing as the only real thing we share in common then said our goodbyes and left.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI the 20 minutes it took to get home my dear Uncle William had called my mother and ranted about how I called him Will over and over and how I should call him Uncle William. I will point out neither my brother or I have called any of my Aunts or Uncles Aunt X or Uncle Y since we were about 8 or 9 years old and none of them complained. Mum told him to not make a big deal out of it but would \"speak to me about it.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLater we had a laugh but for the sake of keeping the peace just say it to shut him up from whining. Shame my dear uncle didn't think this one through. He didn't like this class mates to know how old he was and the fact I teased him that he was in class of people I went to school with drove him mad and to complain to Mum that I should never mention his age of fact he didn't have and GCSE's etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeing the caring and loving nephew I did of course shout \"Hey Uncle William\" any and every chance I got when I saw him at college. After the third time he called Mum who just repeated that \"he should show respect\" and to \"lie in his bed\". I admit I probably went out the way to ensure that on breaks from class we would go to where his class was having a coffee to go chat and say Hello to my Uncle William and if he could give Grandma a message when he got home etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think it lasted no more than three weeks before my Uncle had gone from calling Mum to demand \"I always call him Uncle William,\" to \"Only when away from classmates.\" Then \"Not at College\" swiftly adding \"Not in town either.\" Each demand met with my Mother replying its either all the time or none of the time you cant pick and choose. (I love my Mum) to eventually asking me to just calling him Will. (This was because I spent a day calling him Uncle Big Willy for the afternoon and playing Will Smith at him cause I was 16 and a dick).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL:DR My uncle demanded I call him Uncle William at all times so I did and 'humiliated' (his word not mine) him at college classmates because he was embarrassed about his age. (I still him him Uncle William now and then to annoy him or mainly to shut him up)",

We went over the \"uncle vs great uncle\" and \"1st cousin, 2nd cousin, 3rd cousin\" thing etc....   \n\nWe found out that because Old Cousin was so much older than EVERYONE, he thought that the youngsters would have an easier time calling him Uncle.

Every July, there was a summer stock take over the weekend, which was compulsory, but overtime was paid. This consisted of last orders being picked and sent from the warehouse, outstanding  errors etc being cleared off the system in the office on Thursday, count on Friday and Saturday (office staff would join in after a quick refresher on the warehouse management system) then Sunday would be a catch up order picking/sending day so branches would be running as usual on Monday morning. Office staff were not trained/employed for picking, and we weren't needed on the floor. For several years we got away with not having to work on Sunday but one year, the pettiest of the petty women caught wind of us not working on Sunday and went to management to demand that we work it. If everyone has to work all weekend, that should be *everyone*. \n\nThe DC manager told us that we would have to work it, we asked what we were supposed to do. Our job was to answer calls from branches (closed on Sunday), and sort out issues from the day's deliveries (which didn't happen on Sunday). Manager insisted, so we said that we would come in but we were bringing party food and playing Monopoly since there was no work to do. 'Fine, do what you want, as long as you're here and in the office'.\n\nSunday comes, we stick to our word and have a lovely day playing Monopoly, eating treats, listening to music, I think I'd even brought a portable DVD player and we watched a movie. The onsite HR manager came in at one point and asked us what we were doing so we explained, I could see her mentally calculating how much double time we were getting paid to play board games and she stalked off to shout at the DC manager whilst we were in the clear. \n\nThe following year we didn't have to go in on Sunday, and petty people who moaned were told to mind their own business!",

            "Years ago I worked in retail, and head office decided the best solution for our complaints about being understaffed in the holiday season was to send some office workers to the store to have them help out.\n\nExcept these people were completely untrained, and during the busiest days of the year is not the time to train new people. I imagine the US equivalent would be to start your first retail job on a black friday, with no prior explanation.  \nThey did not know their way around the store, did not know where anything was located in the back, were far too slow to handle the registers and even managed to constantly get in the way if we just had them bagging products.\n\nWhen we send them to do the simplest chores, they complained that this felt like a waste of time. We told them to stand to the side for a bit and watch our pattern: 3 people behind a single counter with two registers, on in the middle bagging for both. We never had to ask each other to move though we were constantly weaving in and out, grabbing a thing from the other side. Customer asking for a gift card on the left register, person on the right closer to where they were stores would hand it to left colleague. Gift bags on the other side, same thing. A lot arriving from the back at once, help the bagger quickly to make space for the next customer.\n\nOffice worker filmed 5 minutes of this and send it to management, claiming you cannot install a new component in a well oiled machine while it is running at full speed. Next year they approved more overtime for anyone who wanted it, with above a certain threshold the option to receive two hours vacation time for every additional hour worked. No more staff complaints that year.",
            "one thing that manglement at every company needs to learn is to tell the busybody/tattletales who whine about other people's hours that they are NOT paid to track the hours of anyone who doesn't report to them, and that by doing so it is clear they are not doing their own jobs.\n\nAnd that is all they should tell these people.   Sure, investigate if it might be a major issue in regards to output or a legal liability, but otherwise tell the clock-watchers to MYOB and pay attention to their own work.\n\n\\---\n\nI would also note that in my experience anyone who tracks the attendance of others who do not report to them usually is very poor at their job and uses the tattling in an attempt to prevent manglement from noticing their failures.",

            "Bwa ha ha ha ha! Amazing, I love how people bitch without knowing anything about what the other job actually entails.\n\nBack in my 'Squad days, there was a restructure and I had to be \"moved\" to a technically lesser position so that I could keep my full time status and benefits. The job consisted of no actual service work, but I did handle phones (inbound and outgoing), running reports, shipping, receiving, and a few other administrative duties, (I also kept an eye on new PC setups since I'd sometimes have time and did data transfers since those required more wait time than touch time). Because of the nature of it all, there was no point in me coming in on the weekends when the part timer could handle the one third of the normal duties during that time. Since what I needed to get done could easily be handled between \"normal\" work hours, I received the unicorn retail shift of 9-6, mon-fri. Things worked as smoothly as a middle manager on vacation for about 7 weeks before someone noticed I didn't come in on the weekends. For some reason this put a bug up her butt and she complained about how it \"wasn't fair\" (despite the fact our two positions had almost no overlap outside of the side work I elected to do for them) and I lost my free Saturdays as well as my \"never have to close\" schedule. Two weeks later my old spot gets put back open and I easily get it back (kind of hard for someone else to sell themselves on a position that I had literally already performed under the same supervisor), so I get my old spot back and she takes the one I just vacated so she can get some full time perks. Then she realized how she just screwed herself out of not working every weekend and getting the same hours. Had she just let it lie I had already proven that the full timer for that spot was not needed on the weekends or evenings if everything was run correctly during the week. She tried to get it changed back, but since she was the reason it was changed to begin with it fell on deaf ears.",

        "selftext": "Another post reminded me of my own little bit of malicious compliance back in college. This was more than a decade ago.\n\nSo in my junior year I was taking an art history class on medieval art and architecture. Partway through the course, the professor assigned a paper and the instructions were that the paper length was to be 5-9 pages.\n\nI wrote my paper and it ended up being 5 pages. I said everything I felt was necessary to say in that amount of pages.\n\nWhen I got the paper back, I received an A minus. Now, I'm not usually the type to complain about an A minus, but in this case I knew I wrote a strong paper. I was an art history major and at this point was three years into my program, so I had a buttload of art history classes under my belt and I fucking knew when I produced a good art history paper. So I really wanted to hear why I got the minus instead of a straight A.\n\nI went to the professor's office hours to ask why he graded it as such. Yes he was quite amused someone was complaining about an A minus. I didn't give a fuck. I wanted to know why he took off points and what he thought could have been improved.\n\nHe hemmed and hawed for a few minutes (because there wasn't anything wrong with my paper) and finally he said, \"Well, it could have been longer.\"\n\nI said, \"The prompt said 5-9 pages and I was within that range.\"\n\nHe replied, \"It could have been longer.\"\n\nOkay fine.\n\nNext paper that came around was the term research paper and this time the prompt said \"At least 15 pages.\"\n\nCue MC. I worked my ass off writing this research paper. And out of pure spite, I made this dude read no less than 29 FUCKING PAGES about some stupid medieval church. Now I had written papers this long before (and a year later when I wrote my honors thesis it was nearly four times that length), but for this particular topic, I was really stretching it. The verbosity was a bit ridiculous.\n\nA week or two later, he returned the paper. A+ grade. He handed it to me and said with a genuine smile, \"It was great, I loved it. You should submit it for publication to xyz history journal.\"\n\nI begrudgingly submitted my maliciously compliant paper to the journal and it was accepted and published.\n\nAdmittedly I was probably the one that suffered the most from my own MC but I didn't care and I'd do it again.\n\nEdit - thank you everyone for all the awards! I know some people have asked for a link to the paper that was published but I'd really prefer to remain anon on reddit.",

            "I love this story and want to upvote it, but it could've been a bit longer.  Just saying.  /s",
            "As a former English professor, I did not require a page length for essays. I always would tell the students that the paper should be as long as it takes to tell me everything the thesis promised. As a guide so that I didn\u2019t get scammy essays of one paragraph, I would inform the class that most A papers were in the X to Y page range. I also showed examples of A, B, C, D, and F papers. \n\nIn my opinion, basing the quality of a paper on the length is just asking for a bunch of BS shoveled onto the pages. No one wants to write that I, for one, do not want to read it either.",
            "This is funny. When I was in college, it was much easier to write a ten-page paper than a five-page paper.  Editing everything down to make sense in such a short paper was difficult. But the classes that insisted on short papers were good practice for the classes that did not specify. I took a couple economics classes just because I wanted to. One of the professors paid me a great compliment in saying that I was getting higher grades than people who wanted to major in it. He said he thought they understood it better than I did, but the part that I understood, I explained so much more clearly so that he had no doubt.",
            "When I taught graduate students I never used minimum paper lengths. I would say;\n\n'You need to cover a, b, and c. You need to do it in a way that communicates your points completely and clearly to an audience that would be a typical X (usually someone in a position in a professional environment they reasonably would work in) and it can NOT be longer than Y pages excluding title page and references. If you submit a page longer than Y pages I will not read it. You can resubmit it as late if you want a grade.'\n\nHad a few students test me on it. They were almost always the butt kisser types. Had a few students love the concept that had been hurt by minimum page length requirements.\n\nI don't understand minimum pages thing for papers. No serious person in the real world gets impressed when someone stretches 5 pages into 30 pages to make the same point.",
            "I had a professor that gave me a 94 on a practical exam. (That's when you have to actually do something like in my case, make food)\n\nSo I challenged him on it, and asked what's wrong with it ?  He said there's nothing really wrong with it. I said well, then why isn't it a. 95 or a '99 or even 100?\n\nHe said, well it just felt like a 94 to me.\n\nI said \"look, I'm paying you to be an instructor, and if there's something that can be improved on this, it's your job to teach me. So if you can't tell me something tangible that I should do to make this better.... \"\n\nHe knew that he didn't have a leg to stand on, he had nothing to say that could improve my dish, so he changed it to 100. It wasn't that I was trying to be antagonistic, I want to learn, I want to be better!  if he's the teacher that's his job is to help me get to that perfection right?\n\n Plus, the guy was a dick in general, so I have to say it did feel good to call him out.",

            "I live this. My English Professor in college assigned us a paper 8-10 pages not including cover or bibliography. Got my outline back and was told I needed to provide more history ( paper was on how women writers have influenced and encouraged change (Harriet Beecher Stowe, Betty Fredan, Rachel Carson). \n\nTold me the the reader might not understand how Stowe\u2019s book Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin might have influenced the Northern population because modern readers wouldn\u2019t know about slavery. WTH. Made me start with the history of slavery in the US instead of 1852 with publication of UTC. Wanted detailed info on The Fugitive Slave Act. My paper ended up being 29 pages to \u201cmeet\u201d his criteria. \n\nWe also had to give a presentation of the paper in class for our final. He didn\u2019t even read it, not a single notation, criticism, or correction. Bastard gave me an A+ based on my presentation and the single question he asked about the slave trade. Nothing about feminism or the environmental movement. I was the only student asked for that much info.",

            "Way back when papers were actually on paper and handed in, a professor demanded final paper to be 15 pages. It had to be 15 pages or she would throw it out without reading it. Now I\u2019m not usually a wordy person. If I can use one sentence instead of three, then one it is. I refuse to insert gobbledegook in the middle. Oh, and there were warnings about format, etc. \n\nSo I write my masterpiece, done! And it\u2019s 14 pages. Actually just one line on the 14th page. I\u2019ve already put enough sweat into this, not going to do a rewrite dammit. So playing with the font I managed to eek out this paper into 15 pages. Got my A, and never again.",
            "When I was in my masters program I had one professor who would give us minimums on papers followed by \"brevity is appreciated\". Loved that guy.\n\nI had another professor a few quarters later who also gave us page lengths and reference minimums. I went over those by a mile and got a B. Because I didn't have enough references (what?!). It was also my first B ever. I was furious. My next paper had references for every other sentence. A+! Woohoo! Third paper was exactly like the second and.....B-. \"It could have been structured better.\" WTF. 4th and final paper was meticulous, exceeded every metric, was exactly on topic, and got an A+....with the comment \"well, this topic is only tangentially related (absolutely not) but I'll allow it.\" \n\nI had another professor in a different quarter that checked off the weekly assignments as 100% and never bothered to grade my major papers and presentations. An easy 100% is nice on some level but I'm paying for instruction and feedback! \n\nSome professors are wild, yo.",

            "I did something similar although not quite as good outcome. Prof gave us fifteen pages of what felt like random notes and told us to develop some of it for teaching. Very little other instructions, even when asked. I got sick and spend several days too sick to do much, so I worked through the whole thing and handed in around 100 pages, like you out of spite. Got the A. A year or two later Prof mentioned that he had finally had time to read through it and \u201cThere was some good stuff in there.\u201d High five to malicious overachieving!",
            "The teacher brought out the best in you. Win-win.",
            "I actually had graduate level professors that wanted work limited to a single page. That enabled them to look at the entire paper rather than go through its length, and it forced we students to get right to the point and not fill a page with triviality.",

            "This is precisely why I give page guidelines to my students, but don't grade on them. For some stronger writers, they can say more in less. They can write a 5 page paper and every word and sentence is intentional and clear and spot on - A+ Some of my students take a little longer. They still get to the point, but they use a roundabout method to get there. But they get there - A+. I always tell my students if you can do it in less, then do it. If it takes a little longer; there's no problem in that. Frankly I learn a lot from both papers that I'm happy to award excellent credit for excellent work - no longer how long it takes.",
            "So going back to my undergrad years ...\n\nI took a class as a freshman most people take as a junior. It satisfied 3/4 of some requirement in one class. Figured I'd knock it out.\n\nWell, my graduate student instructor was a bitch. Idk if she hated me, my writing style or what. I met him with her, brought pre draft papers, edited and still was getting b- c+ on papers. I couldn't figure it out.\n\nFast forward to the final where there is just a stack of blue books in front of the gsi's and they just grab at random.

            "In high school I had a civics teacher who was clearly one of those guys who was long past burned out.  His class consisted of him reading, in a droning voice, from yellowed prep notes that he likely created when he was a fresh faced new teacher 30 years earlier and he never developed any new material since. \n\nA large part of the grade was to take notes on his \"lectures\" and turn them in for his perusal.  A good friend of mine, Roger, was in that same class. Roger was not an A student. I was.  So when we got our notebooks back I assumed, like usual, I would get a better grade than Roger.  I was miffed to see that Roger got an A and I got a C. Roger was surprised too. So I went to the teacher to see why I had gotten such a low grade. Especially compared to my friend. Teacher said that of course Roger's grade was higher because he had 30+ spiral pages filled whereas my notes were less than half that number of pages.\n\nSo, with Roger's permission, I showed the teacher that I had neat penmanship with 3 times the word count per page than Roger.  The teacher was unmoved. It was apparent that the teacher didn't even look at anything other than the page count to determine the grade. So he must have spent mere seconds determining each student's grade.  \n\nI can appreciate burn out. But when you're phoning it in to the detriment of others, that's malpractice. I'm still pissed off about it decades later.",
            "Reminds me of some of my grad school instructors. I attended an online program where the bulk of our work consisted of written topic discussions (like Reddit but with citations and better grammar). Most courses would tell us the number of discussion posts we needed to submit each week, usually with a minimum and maximum range. \n\nUsually I would try to aim for the middle of that range, but I had a full time job, 3 young kids, and a spouse who was also in grad school in a more traditional program at the time; so sometimes life happened and I was lucky to get the minimum in. I had more than one instructor who would knock points off my weekly grade with the rationale that I \"only\" did the minimum so I didn't deserve full credit, even though nothing else was wrong with my submissions.",

I got a B on my first paper, so I was aiming for a cool C for my second paper and coast. Apparently, the other freshmen didn't do so great on the first paper so if we got a good grade on our second paper, that grade would apply to both papers and become our final grade.\n\nFor my second paper, I skimmed through the prompt, wrote up my argument in about 20 mins which totaled about 1.5 pages.

Which means it\u2019s an unpaid time period so any extra time I take on lunch, doesn\u2019t count towards paid time. Sorry y\u2019all.**\n\nSo about a month or so ago, I was pulled into the office by my supervisor and another one, acting as a witness. The main topic at hand was that I would take an extra 20-30 minutes on lunch everyday (personal decision that I\u2019ve been doing for 6 years now). When I explained I would do this to kill some of my OT, and was saving the company about 2-3 hours of time and a half pay, it didn\u2019t matter to my supervisor. He stated that I needed to be more \u201cpunctual\u201d because he needs me on the floor. Okay, that\u2019s understandable. I followed up with \u201cwell does that mean since I show up on time everyday, I get to go home on time everyday?\u201d He didn\u2019t like that question since he just got through telling us at the beginning of the night how everything needs to be done before we leave. So he put it in the system under my work profile that we had that conversation and that \u201che knows I can do better\u2026\u201d\n\nOh, I did better. \n\nFast forward to last week, it\u2019s been almost a month of one hour lunches only, and still staying late to finish off the work from the night. My paycheck was the biggest I\u2019ve seen since I took this position a little more than a year ago. I was excited, and I knew why it was that big. Unfortunately for my supervisors, they got into some heat for how much OT I earned over the last month. Needless to say, they were directed to address us three about how we can\u2019t get any OT anymore and that we need to work our schedules as they are. My other supervisor said, \u201cy\u2019all can take a longer lunch to help cut down OT.\u201d I jumped in immediately and stated that I would not be taking any longer lunches because I was formally sat down for a conversation regarding that matter. Straight up refused to do it and the one who gave me that conversation just stared at me.\n\nMan, it\u2019s felt super awesome to say that to them, and for them to realize I was doing them a \u201cfavor\u201d this whole time. I actually got sent home early today, because I\u2019ve already accrued a day\u2019s worth of OT.\n\nTL/DR: I consistently cut OT by taking a longer lunch; gets told not to do it anymore by a supervisor; sticks to one hour lunches and gets a crazy amount of OT; supervisors inform us to cut OT because we earned to much of it; suggests taking longer lunches; I blatantly refuse since I was scolded for it before; justification",

We need to lose that by the end of the day... And we can't let you leave early because we need you until the end of the shift... So can you just take a long lunch instead?\"\n\nMe: \"You want me to sit in the break room for 2 hours instead of just letting me leave early? And you said I could keep the overtime, that's why I agreed to stay.\"\n\nSupervisor: \"The store manager unfortunately didn't approve it, so we need you to lose it today. The long lunch is perfect so you're still in the building if we need you.\"\n\nMe: \"But I won't technically be available, I'll be clocked out for lunch.\"\n\nSupervisor: \"Just take the long lunch today for me, please.\"\n\nMe: \"Alright, but never ask me to stay late or come in early again. If I don't get to keep the overtime, I'm not wasting my personal time.\"\n\nSkip ahead to the middle of my 2 hour long lunch break.\n\nSupervisor comes into the break room and says \"hey, we've got a customer that needs help out here, can you take care of them?\"\n\nMe: \"Nope, I'm on lunch, and if you talk to me about work again while I'm off the clock I'm filling out a time adjustment form. If I'm off the clock, I'm not working.\"\n\nQueue look of shock and annoyance from supervisor as she stomps out of the break room to take care of the customer herself.\n\nSkip ahead a few weeks...\n\nSupervisor: \"Hey, we need you to stay late tonight, someone called off.\"\n\nMe: \"Nope, if I don't get to keep the overtime I'm not staying late.\"\n\nSupervisor: \"But we need you. Everyone else said no. You usually help us. I thought you wanted to get promoted to supervisor soon?\"\n\nMe: \"Yes, I do, but I'm not giving up my personal time without being paid for it. This is a job, if I work I get paid. End of discussion.\"\n\nThey tried this a few more times, each time they were more and more frustrated that I wouldn't help them again. They eventually convinced a few people to do that long lunch nonsense, to the point where some people had 3 hour long lunches... Which was leading to the reason why things weren't getting done if people were sitting in the break room for half of their shift. \n\nI don't miss that store at all.",

            "Every time I see this \"issue\" all I can think is...\n\nThey need to schedule better!!\n\nThat is it!  They are NOT, in any way shape or form, accounting for close down procedures. Sounds to me like they schedule everyone till whatever time is \"close\" but not accounting for what happens between closing time and people actually going home.\n\nI worked in a retail store that had close down procedures that took a minimum of 45min and averaged about 55minutes.  Rarely would it go for an hour.  These procedures took three people, and three were usually there till \"close\".  We ran into this issue of Corp stating \"too much\" and \"no\" OT.  So, I suggested the manager schedule us for 1hr past close to handle the end of day shit.  It was a simple scheduling update where we would come in one hour later.  Everyone rejoiced as full timers were actually hitting 40hrs and leaving, and those on part time saw additional hours.  Plus, those who closed never hit OT again.\n\nIt's really NOT a hard thing to solve...",
            "Used to work at a grocery store as the receiver. As the receiver it is my duty to handle all incoming deliveries, organize and clean the backroom, deal with scanning out damaged/out of date product, printing and delivering reports of departmental deliveries, marking down out of set/discontinued product and also have to put out the bread delivery that came in.\n\nNow that the responsibilities have been said, let's get onto the crux of why it's relevant to this post. As you can imagine, doing all of these things can result in a hectic day and it did. Constantly going from the bread aisle to the backroom for vendor deliveries is not fun. But the thing that was lowest priority was the markdowns of discontinued product. The store at one point discontinued Kool-aid packets. Each box contained 48 packets, shelf holds 6 boxes in a row, 5 shelves of it, 8 wide. That's over 11 thousand packets that each needed to be individually snickered a markdown sticker. Each roll of stickers was 476 stickers it took almost 23 whole rolls of stickers to print enough of them but remember, I not only had to print each one but also place them on the product.\n\nThis resulted in the grocery manager trying to yell at me for having HELLA overtime because \"you can't have overtime\" so I didn't. Then less than a month later he tries yelling at me for not finishing everything on my daily list of duties (markdowns was all that was left) and so I told him that he can't have both, it's either I make everything look good and all done, or I don't get overtime, pick one.\n\n\nAlso, another manager we had once tried yelling at me for clocking out 7 minutes early (we had a 7 minute window leeway) so I asked if she was gonna stop me from starting 7 early. She stopped pestering me after that.",

When he replied that he'd worked the hours he'd been scheduled and asked if they wanted him to skip shifts they said no. He pointed out that he was scheduled for over 40 hours that week, and they told him he had better not work over 40 hours. So he asked if that meant he was going to need to skip his last two shifts that week.\n\nHe was told of course not, and that if he did that he'd be in trouble. He'd been scheduled, so he needed to be there.\n\n'Well if I work them I'll be over 40 hours.'\n\n'That's bad, don't do that.'\n\nHe left very shortly thereafter.

            "When I had an hourly rate as a software engineer I loved participating in hackathons for work. My company (pre-Covid) would hold them periodically and employees would form teams and build out as much as they could of something within 24 hours. Literally just in a big room together for 24 hours and they bring food / coffee / whatever. I mean you can obviously leave any time and step out to use the restroom or whatever but yeah. You work all day and night and then present to the judges the next morning. Winning team could get anywhere from $5,000 each to potentially $25,000 plus having their work shifted to building \u201cnew thing\u201d full time for the company. \n\nBuuuuuuut. Your hourly (in CA at least) is 1.5x after 8 hours and 2x after 12 hours. So clocking a 24h shift for the hackathon (did I mention you get a free day off after to recover?) basically got you a whole week of extra pay.

            "I don\u2019t understand how taking a longer lunch break is an acceptable method of solving the overtime issue. In my country your standard hours are not just the amount of hours you work each day. You have fixed start and finish times, usually with a 30min unpaid lunch break. You might start work at 8am, unpaid lunch at midday, then finish at 4.30pm. Any work completed before 8am, during your normal lunch break or after 4.30pm is considered overtime and paid at a higher rate. An employer can\u2019t ask you, just for one day for special circumstances, to start at 7am and finish at 3.30pm and pay you as a normal day. The early hour before 8am is paid at the higher rate. It\u2019s their responsibility to schedule tasks accordingly and if your normal personal time (outside your 8am - 4.30pm work window) is affected you are compensated.",

We asked him to stop walking around chatting so he read up on employee rules and said he'd report us for not giving him a 15 minute paid break twice a day. We said take the break but don't use it to talk to co-workers who were busy. My business partner then found the lunch break rule and told him we only had to provide a 30 minute break for lunch, unpaid. We had been giving him an hour paid for lunch. So he told him that since we would follow the letter of the law for breaks, we'd also follow it for lunch.

I was very frugal, but in smart ways. I got a lot done for little money and always was looking out for the company. The owner recognized and respected this.\n\nAnyhow we had gotten big enough where I didn't report to the owner anymore and I was assigned to report to an inexperienced accountant who got her degree from some sketchy on-line school. She was going to change the world. I used to be able to just buy anything I wanted because the owner knew when ever I asked for a company credit card, that I had already done my homework and it would be good for the company.\n\nWell now, if anything was over $500 I had to go through this process with her to justify it. It wouldn't bug me except that she had no real business savvy or common sense. I was just painful to me to try and explain the most obvious things to her and she would fight it just because of power-tripping or something, Example: I was trying to justify having at least one computer loaded up and ready to go as a hot spare for when someones broke. She balked at having $1500 sitting on a shelf unused. I tried to explain that about once a month someones computer would break. All she could see was the $1500 sitting unused most of the time. She couldn't understand the real cost of a broken computer. That the person could no longer do their job effectively. Parts not getting ordered. Jobs not getting expedited. Emails not getting returned. Me having to drop everything to react to this situation, overnighting in parts. The true impact cost to the company was several hundreds of dollars every month.

Just buy more parts and assemble yourself. Dual monitors for everybody! (bought one at a a time)\n\nBite me Charmaine!",

            "I ran an engineering team at a school. We had advanced to the point we needed multiple computers. One for presentation work, one for research, one for CAD and another to run the CNC machine we bought. I was extremely frugal with the money my team raised, grants we acquired, donations received. When it go to buying the computers, the system had a mandate we had to purchase computers through a company that sounds like Hell. The cheapest refurbished computer with the specs to run the CAD software we had was $800. I could deal with some of the others being of lesser quality, but that had to be a good one. All told, I needed about $1500 worth of computers and my budget wouldn\u2019t do that. I had an idea. Talked to tech guy and asked if my team could build some computers as projects. He said that was fine. I asked what we could do with the computers after we built them and he said we could use them. So I spent about half the amount and got the computers I needed with better specs than the refurbished Hell computers. The system had an extra Windows license and donated it to us and we loaded Linux on the other two. Had a local IT guy come in and lead a computer building workshop for my students. Wins all around. That was about ten years ago.",
            "I work for a company that sells books to schools. One of the districts has a policy that no purchases of more than $200 can be put onto the school credit card without an excessive purchasing process that librarians/school admin can\u2019t be bothered going through. For most of the books, we are the either the only supplier, the cheapest or just have the stock available.\n\nWe have purchases from almost all of their 1500 schools, and the most common order total is $185-$199.95. Some school librarians will have 3 or 4 purchases of that same amount in a day. Our company know that the schools have just complied with the district policy, but damn it\u2019s annoying!\n\nWe\u2019ve spoken to the finance people at the education department, but they are adamant that they don\u2019t need to change their policy as \u201crarely do schools request to purchase more than $200 of goods from your company\u201d.

            "I worked for years at a large Australian company three decades ago. About 5k employees.\n\nAt one stage our IT manager resigned and to fill the void temporarily they assigned the head of accounting department as temporary head of IT too.\n\nAnd it was a disaster.

But if you wanted something expensive, you couldn;t get it at all. It would never get approved\n\nNow, this was back in the time of the 386/486 pc. Back then, computers were changing rapidly. Going from 10mhz to 200mhz in the space of a few years. If your laptop was out of date by a year it would be slow to run the latest software. If it was out of date by two years you might not be able to run it at all.\n\nAt the same time, the business was rapidly expanding. And I mean rapidly. I worked there for 13 years; in that time we went from having 30 outlets to more than 480. So our computing needs were rapidly expanding too. Not just laptops, but mini computers used to run the entire company's back end at head office.\n\nSo IT would put in requests and they were always denied, especially if they were expensive. When they eventually requested an entire refit of the IT room, new minicomputers and upgraded systems...coming in at millions of dollars or more..it was of course denied. And denied. And denied. After several years of this our systems were rapidly approaching breakdown point.\n\nIn the end the accounting chief was fired (not just as being head of IT, but as head of accounting too.) and they got an actual IT manager who immediately authorized and arranged the upgrading of our systems.\n\nI remember one of our IT guys complaining about the old accountant: \"He knows the price of everything and the value of nothing\"\n\nThat quote always stuck with me.",

They were really nice people and we had a friendly conversation about the house.\nThe previous owner mentioned that the cable bill was paid up until the end of the month (about 3 more weeks), and that he had already turned in his cable box, but the cable signal should still be active til the end of the month.  I told him thanks and we let him finish packing up.\n\nWe moved in the following week and when I hooked the cable to my TV I got all the basic cable channels which was all I was planning on getting anyway.\n\nCome the end of the month, I called the cable company and asked to sign up for basic cable. The sales rep told me that there was going to be a $100 hookup fee. I told them that the previous owner had left his account active and that I was literally watching cable as we speak, so there should not need to be a hook up fee because the cable was already hooked up. They just needed to start billing me for basic cable.\n\nThe rep then clicked on her keyboard and told me that her data showed that the address I was at does not have cable and that they will need to send out a crew to activate the signal. I told her that I was not paying $100 for a hookup fee and said never mind, I don't want cable.\n\nI waited another month (still had cable) and called the cable company back to ask what it would cost to get basic cable? A different operator from before said it would cost something like $30 a month and a $100 hook up fee. I asked why the $100 hookup fee? She said that it was because my address does not currently have cable. I told her never mind, I don't want cable unless they waive the hookup fee. She said she was not authorized to waive the fee. I just thanked her and hung up.\n\n4 years later, we still had cable, but we ended up moving out of state for work. \ud83d\ude04",

            "Slight variation on the theme here.  Back [edit]  in 2000-ish I had cable in an apartment.   The company made us sign an ironclad agreement that included a specific admonition that I could NEVER REMOVE THE CABLE BOX FROM THE PROPERTY *under penalty of law!*\n\nWhen I moved out,  I set up one of those infamous appointments where the cable guy will be here to take posesdion of the cable box \"between 8am and noon\" and I have to stay on the premises in case he shows up. \n\nOf course he didn't show.  Although it was a huge problem for me, I hung around until 5pm in case he showed up, despite having to, you know, move everything I owned to a new place.\n\nNext day I called them and complained.  They said \"oh that's all right, you can just bring it in and drop it off.\"\n\nNope.  Cue the malicious compliance (or is it noncompliance in this case?).  I told them I am *legally forbidden* to remove the box from the apartment. \n\nLater they had someone call me back and insist that I bring the box in.  Nope, no can do!   They said I would get in trouble.  Sorry, I'll also get in trouble if I remove the box.  No you won't, they claimed, the lawyers don't *really* mean that.  Oh, are you a lawyer?  No, not actually.  Okay, I won't take your legal advice then.  I'll abide by the signed agreement.\n\nBy the way, I give up the key and am gone Sunday afternoon, so your guy better be here before then.   \n\nHe can't,  they said, the schedule is too busy.  Oh well, I replied.\n\nSunday afternoon a cable rep showed up at the last minute and he was mightily pissed off.",
            "We wanted cable and Dad didn't wanna pay the hook up fee either. So he opened up the green box on our property and just screwed the little cable with our house number onto one of the cable connections. Turns out that is all that was needed for there to be cable at the house. So he hooked up every house in the entire box. Free cable TV for everyone! Nobody ever complained and we lived there with free TV for about 10 years. Now when they unhook your cable they squish the connector with pliers so you can't just hook it up yourself.",

            "Back when I was eight (so about 1977,)\n we moved to a new house. It had a finished basement, with wood paneling and white cinder blocks. Lots of white. And a wall-mounted phone which was a jarring avocado color. It just drew your eye to it and wouldn't let go. This was back in the days of the Bell telephone monopoly and you paid every month for your phones on top of the service.\n\nThe phone was so disturbing that my Dad called and asked to have it replaced with a white wall phone. The operator responded \"our records indicate that you have a white phone.\" He assured her it was not white, but avocado. She insisted that the records showed a white phone so they could do nothing.\n\nHe called back a couple more times and was told the same thing each time. Finally, the last operator told him the only way to have it replaced would be if they phone was damaged. \"Just a moment,\" he replied. A loud crash followed and he returned to the line to tell the operator that for some reason, the phone had fallen off the wall and was now broken. She arranged a tech to come and replace the phone. \"White?\" My father asked? \"Of course. The records show it is a white phone and will be replaced the same,\" she replied.\n\nWhen the tech arrived with a white phone, he stopped and stared at the avocado phone lying on the floor. He then called into the service center to tell them that the broken phone was avocado, but he was sent with a white phone. \"The records show that is a white phone. Replace it.\"\n\nAnd that's how we got rid of the avocado basement phone.",
            "I had something similar happen when my wife and I moved into an apartment decades ago, except I never wanted cable. At some point, I plugged the TV into the cable to see if it'd give us better reception, only to find out that we had full access to cable. Now, in general I didn't want cable, but there were a few shows I didn't mind watching, so I did. I also notified them about it, and they said I didn't have cable, so I wiped my hands of it. I think about 6 years later (we were still at that same apartment), they aggressively tried selling us cable, and I mentioned not only did I not really _want_ cable, but we were still getting cable despite asking them to deactivate it. They finally deactivated it after that, and yes, the cable did still act like a decent antenna.",
            "We had our first house built years ago. Told the builders we didn't want cable to the house so they didn't. Years later after first kid, we figured babysitter could use cable and they had a $1 installation special. We called and asked if we could get the $1 install special if the house didn't have cable. 'When was the house built?' Few years ago. 'Your house has cable. No problem, $1 install'.  Well, OK.  They came out and had to trench from the nearest cable drop to our house, run it into the house, and chase it to the 3 places we wanted connections.\n\n$1",

Turned out later the rebuilding people cut it and plastered the wall where it was. \n\nPhoned the provider but all they could do was point to a website where you can request a connection. 700 euro from the street into the house. Phoned again and asked where the cable could be in my garden, thinking if i find it, i will extend it myself. They said they dont have anything like that.\n\nCoincidentally my dad knew a guy who works for those companies. Within an hour I had a map of the whole street with the location of the cables. We dug where it should be and found it in 5 minutes,drilled a hole into the basement and connected a new cable. Saved 700 euros",

So it\u2019s physically impossible to get the broadband they sold me on. \n\nThen when I tried to cancel the order, they try to charge me early cancellation (service was never activated, can\u2019t do that under eu law). Then they tried to retain my connection fees (again, they never connected me, eu law, also have a 14 day cooling period where you\u2019re allowed, again by eu law, to cancel a contract with no penalties, for any reason, including buyers remorse). Tried to retain my deposit (can\u2019t, eu law). Then finally told me I\u2019d just have to wait until the service was eventually available. The bloody gall! \n\nAfter multiple hours on the phone with multiple different people, and a threat of escalating to the country\u2019s consumer protection commission, finally they relented and agreed to cancel my contract and graciously agreed to refund all fees already paid.

            "Similar thing happened to me around 2009 when I moved into a new house.  Signed up to fast internet for the first time ever (like 40mbps, not fast compared to today's standards but I was getting about 5 before that) and I told the ISP I was happy to plug the modem in myself. The modem arrived on a Sunday by courier, which I thought was pretty great, so I plugged it in and turned it on and enjoyed the fastest internet I'd ever had. They said \"your first bill will come in the mail within 2-3 weeks and you can logon and check your usage\". \n\nA couple of months later, there had been no bill, and I was concerned something had gone wrong. The internet worked fine, but I couldn't use the email addresses they provided for us (didn't care really) and I also couldn't logon to check my usage. I called them to find out what the go was, and they had no record of my connection, sending out the modem, connecting me or any sort of charges. The lady I spoke to said \"I will look into it and someone will get back to you\".\n\nFour years later I moved out, and no one ever got back to me. Conservatively, I saved about $2,000 between the monthly charges, connection fee and modem. I signed up for a mobile phone contract with the same company about six months later and they had to completely start a new account for me because they had no record of my existence.",

            "Cable companies can't seem to keep their stuff organized, and still believe that they have no competition so they can continue to be sloppy - where else are you gonna go?\n\nA decade ago, we built a new house. As move-in day approached, I called Time Warner to get an appointment set up for the hookup. They told me \"oh, we can't just hook up a new house, we have to do a site survey to verify that we can provide service, then we can set up a time to hook it up.\" I told them that the houses on either side of us already had cable hooked up. The wire was already run from the street to the house. The house was already wired. All they had to do was punch the wire through the wall, and flip on service. Nope, have to do a site survey, and we're scheduling those two weeks out. \"OK, whatever you say, let's schedule that\" and we did.\n\nThen I turned around and called Direct TV. \"Hey, do you guys still have that deal where you can be onsite and installing service within 48 hours of me calling?\" \"Yep, we sure do!\" \"OK, hold that thought.\"\n\nI hung up and called Time Warner. \"So you guys told me you can't hook me up until you do a site survey and then schedule another appointment, right?\" \"Yes, that's correct.\" \"OK, then let's cancel the site survey, I won't need it. Direct TV will be here within 48 hours and have me set up.\"\n\nSurprise, Surprise! Time Warner \"magically\" was able to set up an appointment to hook up service on the day I asked for (a lot closer than 2 weeks) the instant they realized someone would be eating their lunch.",
            "I tried to disconnect service when my dad passed.  They said I had to fax them a copy of the death certificate. Ok, fine. Done. Still had cable. Called again. Eventually, I gave up and enjoyed the cable. I got a call threatening to sue/have me arrested because I'd been 'stealing cable' since the bill hadn't been paid in 2 years. I told them to try it. The person who had the service had died 2 years before. Plus, I had dates, times, names of who I spoke to, and the copies of the fax receipt for the death certificate. They said they would blacklist his & my name if we didn't pay. Um, go ahead? I was getting married and moving out the next month anyway.

            "Friends of mine were moving into a new home. They called the cable company in advance to set things up. The cable company was surprised to see that in their records, the house had no cable hookups. They then discovered that nearly nobody on the street had cable hookups, which is definitely not a normal thing.\n\nIt turns out, most people on the street did, in fact, have hookups, but nobody was being billed. This was either some sort of big oversight by the company when the street was built, or the worker who connected the street offered the residents illegal hookups.\n\nWhatever the case, the street no longer had free cable.

At this point, she had cable only, I think. She called them to try to fix it and they couldn't. She called again, and they told her she had no account.  She wrote them a letter and got one back saying that since she never had the setup done, they were canceling her account. I think she got the phone line and internet through a different company and kept free cable for the whole time she owned the place.",
            "The house I grew up in was in rural West Virginia, about a mile from a state road. Comcast (then Adelphia) only ran service along that road, so to get cable at our house, we had to pay them like $1k to run an overhead line, which crossed our long driveway to connect to the second floor of the house.\n\nWe eventually stopped using Comcast, and the wire started to droop. We called to have Comcast repair it, and they said they wouldn\u2019t since we no longer had service. So we said, okay, we\u2019ll have someone else repair it.

Actual (as in, law-registered) registries are different from public access ones most of the time.\n\nIt happened to us with the internet connection (note, country most probably varies, I live in Spain), we had copper connection (town in hellfuck nowhere back in time, not so now) and we had been asking for optic fiber for the whole three years we were with the phone company we asked continuously to have fiber installed because the copper installation was pretty derelict and had almost continuous connectivity problems.\n\nWhen repairmen came here to patch whatever issue we had at the moment they said two things, one, the problem was in the installation itself (plus, the connectivity point was further than the wire had guaranteed quality) and that we could install fiber because nearby homes had it. Hell, it reached the point where we had another company install fiber in our building yet, somehow, ours still denied us it, _even when other flats in the same building had access to it with the same company as advertised on their webpage_.\n\nWe started digging around and, lo and behold, we found the issue. Our house, as per the local Catastro (propiety registry in my country, our town's in this case) was numbered number 1, but as expressed in tangible terms, it was number six, flat G0 (no other flats on the ground floor). Of course our phone company didn't want to hear any of it because according to them there was no such thing as a number 1, much less number 1 but it says on the building it's number 6 and the flat is the G0, and, in the end, we flipped them the metaphorical bird and went with another company",

It happens sometimes. \n\nHalf the country is now encrypted, and the other half still is Simulcast. That means a lot of things like you can still use antennas and digital ready tv (no box, weird channel numbers) but most importantly it means all the cable comes through the line all the time unless a filter is on. It's a metal cylinder about the size of a cigar that fits onto your drop line. So you could easily get cable to varying degrees if a channel trap filter was never put on. On the computer it says you don't have cable to us. Every now and then, audits should be done to resolve that issue. Usually results in a hard conversation about how someone was getting a lot of free cable that isn't now. \n\nThe install charge was valid. ISPs often won't just change the name on the bill to restart services. The services are attached to the person, not the location, like power and water.

I purchased the cable internet package but not cable TV so my dad brought a cable splitter over and we hooked it up to see what would happen and I had free basic cable!  Months later Time Warner calls me up and asks if I want to purchase their basic cable package to add to internet service.  I asked them what channels were included and it so happened to be my current free package.  I politely declined and had free cable until the day I moved out.",
            "We had a similar setup for years. Had cable, brought the box back to cancel due to household budget cuts, and they never sent anyone to physically disconnect it at the pole. (This was back when analog signals were present unencrypted on the wire and the boxes were only addressable for the scrambled channels.)\n\nHad it for years until lightning struck the house while I was watching A.L.F., bypassing a 120' tree in the front yard, the power pole in the street, a basketball hoop buried in the ground in the driveway, travelling under the eaves and directly to the coax cable line. The TV made a brilliant flash and died and the stereo started humming at 11 until we unplugged it (then never turned on again) but the VCR somehow remained completely unscathed.\n\nWe chalked it up to God telling us to stop stealing cable. Bought a new TV and stereo and got the cable installed the next week. The connection fee covered running new coax under the eaves. The installer asked \"what happened here?\" as he pointed at the burn mark and melted coax sheathing. Dad told him lightning struck and killed the TV. It took him a few beats, but he flipped through the order papers and saw we hadn't been paying for service, put 2+2 together, grinned a little, and kinda shrugged a bit.\n\nHe gave us a \"special\" box that gave us HBO for free. For years I feared another lightning strike any time we watched something on HBO.",
            "I had this happen once. Time Warner had sales guys roaming the blocks trying to up sell, guy comes to our door and starts talking to me about how we only had internet and no cable. As he was talking about this, I had my TV going in the background on the local news. The guy looked behind me and said \"Oh, looks like you already have service... I don't see any reason the company has to know about this. Have a good one\" and walked off. We had service for about two more years before they started encrypting channels and we had to pay.",
            "The previous owners of our house were running a business from the add-on front room and had three phone lines coming to the house from the pole - one to each side of the house.  I called Pac Bell (this was a while ago) and told them I wanted the extra box removed and the wire removed.  The rep said they can't do that. \n\nI didn't care for that answer at all.\n\nI informed the rep that if they didn't come get their box and remove the wire from the house I would simply go outside with my trusty wire cutters and remove it myself leaving it hanging from the pole because I did not want or need THREE phone boxes on my house.  Amazingly they had a truck out in 2 days and the wire was cut back to the pole.",

            "Had a similar incident in my very first apartment. Was about 6 months into my year-long lease and had been watching cable with no issues. Then one day, the cable stopped working. I called and explained that I had had \"free cable\" for the last 6 months and wasn't really sure why it stopped but that I'd like to go ahead and get the cable turned back on. She clearly didn't realize that I intended to pay for cable from that point forward because she kept saying, \"Sir, we don't have a *free cable* package.\" Despite me explaining that I knew that but that I had had free cable for the last 6 month and was willing to pay, she kept insisting that they didn't offer \"free cable.\"",
            "I had the opposite. In 2020 I moved from an apartment where I had cable to a house built in 1978. Filled out the moving notice online, and the instructions said just to bring the cable box with me and hook it up at the house. Okay, if they say so. \n\nCome moving day, I plug the box in at the house, and no signal. Check the side of the house, there is coaxial running to a satellite dish, but no other connections. This house did not have cable, physically. But that didn't stop Xfinity from charging my account for service every month. It took 5 months to get a crew out to bury line to the nearest junction, and every month I had to call to get them to refund my bill.",

I told them that I can plug in a router myself and didn't need to pay $100 for someone to come plug in a black box that I bought third party anyway.\n\nAfter three days of trying every cable in the house and even giving it a day to just sort itself out, I called them and said that the ports aren't working. So they came in for a maintenence call and I was assured that I wouldn't get charged an installation fee, since I told them that I was hooking it up myself, but their lines are the things not working.\n\nA few days later the guy comes in and does all the same stuff that I did before getting stumped and calling his supervisor. After two hours, he went outside and dug up a flat cord from the backyard and ran it on to the house through my window. He informed me that this was how they fixed the issue that the last tenant was having, and that cord had been buried by the people we were renting from.\n\nHe assured me the I would not get charged the $100 install, his supervisor assured me that I would not be charged the $100 install... my bill a month later assured me that I paid for the $100 install, and customer service was adamant that the \"work\" had been done and I could not get a refund.\n\nCable companies are evil monopolies that someone smarter than me REALLY needs to put in check.",

After all the workers were done & they were gone, we discovered our cable wasn\u2019t working at all. I called them about our cable being off. They sent out a tech, who really didn\u2019t bother doing much of anything, he declared the problem had something to do with the cable inside the house, which was our responsibility and that someone needed to be home so they could come in to show us. I stayed at home on the designated day, no one showed up at my door but the guy who supposedly came by checked the cable outside and declared it was inside the house where the problem was. After I went higher up the chain, chewing people out right & left, one guy promised to send someone to talk to me face to face to prove to me the problem was inside. They said they were booked up that day but GUARANTEED someone would be by even if it was late. I stayed up til midnight. No show, I called, threatened a lawsuit, guy came out the very next day and found that, when the people changing out the main cable feed to all the houses came through, they just dug out the old cable, cutting all the lines that went from the main cable to the individual houses, the. Once the new cable was in place, they had guys who were supposed to reattach all the feeds from the houses to the new cable. They missed my house completely when doing that step. But that meant the guys who \u201cchecked the feed\u201d from the cable outside my house was transmitting properly lied about it and declared the issue had to be inside the house. I\u2019m talking about over 10 feet of mine from the main feed to my house. There\u2019s no way those idiots bothered to check the actual line that was going into my house from the main cable or they\u2019d have discovered the problem the first time. It took a supervisor going out there, personally, who actually checked our feed just where it went into our house & was able to instantly realize it was on their end. We got 3 free months of cable and a reduced price on premium channels for a year because of that fiasco. Not quite as nice as getting free cable for 4 years, but it was still ok with me. I don\u2019t mind paying for the services I want but if I had experienced a similar event as OP, I\u2019d not complain seeing as the company itself was screwing themselves out of the deal."

No biggie, when we get on the flight we will just offer the window or aisle seat to whoever booked the middle seat. Boarding time came and we were in group 2, so the pre-boards and group 1 got to go before us. When it was our turn to board and we got to our seats, there was an older man seating in the window seat. I thought that was kind of a dick move to just take someone else\u2019s seat without asking. Obviously this guy has flown before since he had pre-boarding status without having young kids, was not disabled and definitely wasn\u2019t in the military.   I let it go since we were going to switch seats anyway. Soon after the flight took off the attendant came up to me with a gift bag and congratulated me for achieving 1K status. The gift bag wasn\u2019t for me it was for the guy that took the window seat without asking. He obviously knew what he was doing and has probably done this before. The guy was looking out the window all through boarding and never turned his head to acknowledge us until the flight attendant came over with the gift bag. I accepted his gift bag and the flight attendant ask if I\u2019d like a complimentary drink as well. Of course I said yes and even got a free glass of wine for my wife too. I glanced at the guy and could see the anger in his eyes. But he didn\u2019t say a thing. Petty win for me over this guy that took my seat that I would have given him,  but instead he took it without asking.",

I'd delt with similar people in retail by this point and was pretty good at dealing with them. I continued to politely answer his questions and be as patient and friendly as possible as a line started to form behind him. After some time, he started to realize I wasn't getting pissed off and he started to get annoyed by it. He started being even more annoying in the same fashion. There was now a line of people behind him, watching this happen. I decided not to inform him that people were behind him. Eventually, he asked me something along the lines of \"Am I not pissing you off?\" except not that direct, but that's still essentially what he was asking me.

            "Used to work in consulting, and clients can be horrible for doing this sort of thing (intentionally or not). In the rare case where someone is being malicious or intentionally wasting time, I've learned that nothing pisses then off more than me pretending I'm loving the conversation or whatever activity we're undertaking. My favorite story was when a certain senior developer was unhappy that they (the client) had to work 60+ hour weeks but us consultants were currently at a hard cap of 40, so he called as many pointless meetings and reviews with specifically the consultants so we would be behind on our work and be forced to work more hours or risk looking bad (simplification, but you get the point). The look on his face when he found out we were extremely expensive to pay overtime for and that we also individually got overtime pay from our consulting firm. The best part is that in the following weeks, most of the consultants would continue to ask to meet with this guy specifically at the same ridiculous rate he insisted on previously in hopes of getting more overtime pay.\n\nEdit: Didn't expect this to get so much attention. I originally wrote this up as an afterthought on my phone between meetings at my current job and had no idea there would be so many other people who could relate. For those wondering, most of us worked ~10-15 hours of overtime that week (not a ton for Software Engineers and Architects, but a monumental sum for a project with a tight budget that the client was previously adamant about not paying any overtime for). There was overtime scattered here and there for the remainder of my involvement on the project but nothing crazy. As much as I wish I could say differently, nothing serious beyond a scolding behind closed doors happened to the 'senior' employee who orchestrated all the time wasting and spiteful behavior that led to this in the first place. I suppose the existence of people like him at that particular client was one of the big reasons they relied so heavily on non-specialist IT consultants in the first place despite having plenty of engineers themselves.

I was hoping for a grade in the 40s.\r  \n\r  \nThe day she returned our stories I did not receive mine, but she asked me to stay after class.

            "15 years ago , I taught a pre English 101 class at a community college. A student plagiarized her diagnostic essay. She just needed to write it. No grades. I liked to plan how long I\u2019d spend on certain topics based on that. Most of these kids could barely write, hence their failure on the placement exam. This essay was perfect so I googled a few sentences. I found the entire thing word for word on some other college writing center website as an essay example! \n\nI read 2 paragraphs of her essay to the class. I asked the class- I\u2019m reading this essay because it\u2019s so well done. Why is it well done ? It\u2019s plagiarized. I didn\u2019t name her. I said if anyone pulled this on me again I\u2019ll have them read their own essays to the class. \n\nShe wrote an apology letter to me. Her excuse ? It went something like this :\n\nI was talking to my sister about my nice , new English teacher and the first assignment of the class. My sister wanted to see how teachers can tell if a work is plagiarized. Since it wasn\u2019t graded I thought to test you. I realize my mistake and I so completely apologize for the disrespect! \n\nMan oh man. \n\nI did end up getting other papers with sentences here and there with no proper attributions. I would print off and staple the web pages I know they used and gave them  until the next class to fix with a late penalty or they would get a zero. \n\nI wanted them to be successful in English 101 so they could be done with it. They made it so hard on themselves.",

His mother insisted he hadn't plagiarized it.  I showed her the exact words he used on an easy to find site.  I didn't back down, and he learned not to do that, at least with me.

            "In my 1st year English class, I was accused of plagiarism because it was written too well.\n\nContext: \n\nMid 1990s. \n\nIt was the 2nd paper turned in to the prof. \n\nProf had lectured in the previous weeks about the essay topic, which was about whether John Moss' argument about a book being analyzed should not be considered within the era that it was written. Prof argued against Moss' argument. As the prof gave his perspective, I decided to write on that topic. Seemed like a no-brainer: I could even use his arguments from the lecture as part of my 'proof'.\n\nInstead of writing the night before, I took a few days and wrote the paper. I saved about 5 versions of the paper, overwriting the last version with each edit. Printed it out on the computer lab's printer, turned it in, thinking nothing else.\n\nFast forward to when the paper is being returned; I'm told to see the prof in his office as he suspected that I didn't write it. Wtf? I'd never experienced this before. I asked my high school English teacher, explaining the situation. He indicated that I had to provide proof of my writing style, any versions of the paper, etc.\n\nI go to the prof's office with my 5 copies of the paper previously, a previous English paper written in my grade 13 English class, plus a history paper I'd recently turned in. Prof goes: I don't care about your high school English, nor your history paper. He sees the 5 versions. Then asks if I had help. No, but I explained that I had not written this paper 'the night before'. Did I leave it on my pc in my dorm room for 'help'? No - my dorm room is locked when I'm not in it.\n\nI get the paper back: B+\n\nOf course, I wrote the next few papers 'the night before', but I always saved extra versions of the paper as I made changes to it, just in case. \n\nFor each paper after that, I saved versions of each paper so that the prof could see any modifications, even if I made changes as minor as punctuation. Did it through my 4 years university, and 2 years' Masters degree.",

He fights it and drags me into meetings with the Dean, proceeds to lie a bunch more there and drags the Veterans affairs person in to convince me to drop my report (its not his first plagiarism rodeo). I stick to my punishment. \n\n2 days later, foreign student comes to my office to inform me that a student is trying to \"buy bad teaching reviews\" (for $5) to try to mess up my evaluation scores. However, she says she will only report this anonymously as the student \"says a lots of crazy things about guns\" and surprise, its the same student i just had all these meetings with. Cue the mandatory threat reporting and around 80 hours of meetings with several Deans and psychologists so they can make sure I don't feel threatened (the state had just implemented concealed carry on campus, gotta love the good old USA). \n\nWell, good old boy decided to skip the final (failing himself) and when I returned to my desk there was an email from him informing me how I had cost the university $157,874.53 (or some other oddly specific number in that vicinity) because since he was unable to pass my 100 level class he was not able to graduate and would not be attending law school and paying room and board the next two years (where his oddly specific number came from). \n\nI forwarded that email and a few more things along to the Dean, the cheater was not allowed back on campus after the semester, and I got my best overall teaching evaluations of my career that semester with a singular anonymous Zero rating, but I can guess who that's from based on the comments.",

Not-so-bright-student then claims \"I wrote it first, other not-so-bright-student must have plagiarized it! I can prove it by sending you the MS Word file with timestamp!\" \n\nThat he did.

No. She went and took a sentence from one place and two from another and her paper consisted of more then 30 plagiarized sources all woven together into a Frankenstein's monster of a paper.

I didn't really need the points to pass, so I was just going to attend the mandatory presentations and get my 5 points.\n\nIn the last day to deliver this essay a guy came to me and asked to borrow my computer so he could write the essay. He said something like \"I know to copy in a way the teacher won't notice. You know what, I'm going to make one for you too\". He comes back one hour later, gives me my computer and said \"I did both, already uploaded them\" since he took one hour to do both I thought it was a better idea to check what he wrote. \n\nIt was the worst thing I ever saw in my entire life, it didn't even qualify as an essay, it was a series of unrelated sentences in a random order, he didn't even get the font right. Turns out he went to a website and copied 2 sentences reviews untill it filled the 5 pages. \n\nAfter that I tried to delete my upload (an 0 is better than having anybody thinking I did that) but I could only replace it with another file.
