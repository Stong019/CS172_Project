        "selftext": "My commute to work got progressively longer and unpredictable over the past year due to 4 bridge closures occurring within months or weeks of each other. No date has been given for their reopening, so for the time being, short of heading off for work an hour or two ahead of time, you risk arriving a minute to 5 minutes late once or twice a week.\n\nEveryone has been impacted by the traffic in one way or another, which I mention because there was no way someone could feign ignorance.  One coworker, though, didn't care about legitimate reasons for my being slightly late for work every now and then, and complained so adamantly behind my back about it that my immediate supervisor reluctantly wrote me up.\n\nI knew it had to be that one coworker because they would get noticeably irritated whenever traffic conditions were brought up. They would leave the room, loudly interrupt with unimportant questions or comments, or roll their eyes.\n\nThey're also known for complaining about every little thing, at one point having played a big role in not having a seasonal employee rehired the following year.\n\nDespite that coworker, I love my job. So I started leaving for work an hour an a half earlier than before. My arrival time is now anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes before my shift starts.\n\nAnd that's when I noticed the annoying coworker always arrives about 10 minutes early and always has a very convenient street parking space available. I used to park on a different side of our building before traffic got bad, and had never noticed that they'd unofficially claimed that public parking spot as theirs.\n\nMost of the time, I'm at work early enough to get my pick of any spot in our always crowded employee parking lot, but no parking spot other than theirs makes up for my having to wake up at 530 in the morning.\n\nThat coworker can't complain about my being late now. They know better than anyone that I'm at work way before I have to. I've mentioned my arrival time to other coworkers with them in earshot, so they know I'm parking there out of spite. I've also gone as far as parking right in the middle of a space large enough to acomodate their car and mine.\n\nI have no idea if they've complained to our supervisor about it or not, but I really want them to have been stupid enough to complain about my taking their public parking spot away.",

To avoid this I'd take the next earlier bus, which unfortunately due to the time of day and wacky bus schedule meant I was consistently arriving an hour early to work.\n\nUnfortunately, management then decided because I was at work, I should be working and would insist I start early. Later in the day other management would insist I had to stay until I was scheduled to leave, so I was consistently day to day getting at least an hour of overtime.\n\nSo of *course* I was threatened with being written up for getting overtime.\n\nTired of this stupid tug of war, I changed my availability to start half an hour later - allowing me to have enough time to reliably get to work on time without being extraordinarily early.\n\n*Nobody* liked this, and I was even privately threatened with being written up for changing my schedule so I couldn't work early anymore.\n\nI ignored them. Unsurprisingly, that threat evaporated as if it'd never happened.\n\nThey knew what they could get away with and I was done playing their game.",

I had the same issue. 5 to 10 minutes earlier would get you there at about the same time or you could still be randomly late. \n\nThat's when bosses say leave earlier. Well, leave 45 minutes to an hour earlier and sure enough, you will get to work around an hour earlier. Now, what do you do with this extra time? And if you have schedule specific stuff, sometimes you can't leave that much earlier. Like dropping kids off at school. The correct thing was to ask boss if it's cool to update your arrival time to 30 minutes after while the bridge construction is going on. Then it's a win. And if the coworker complained, the boss would eventually get agitated as the accommodation was none of their business. Or if you love your brand of petty, ask to be accommodated for your earlier arrival. I hate people losing hours out of their day while not being paid.",

I figure it might be easier to make an edit here doing some explaining rather than responding to every person making similar rebuttals.\n\n1) The only legitimate reason I and another user can come up with for why this phenominon could happen is if OP is beholden to a set schedule they can not alter like a ferry, drawbridge, or dropping kids off at a care takers. If a local ferry runs on 1hr intervals then it could explain such an early arrival. Similarly, maybe their childcare can take a kid at 6:30 or 7:30, but not 7am.\n\n2) A lot of people are replying with \"If I leave at 7:29am I'm golden, but do to rush hour/construction/a school if I leave at 7:30am I'll be 20 mins late.\" Yes, I too live in NJ and know this struggle well. The opposite is happening here however. OP is already late. They are hitting the very begining of that congestion. It would stand to reason that if they left before their usual start time that they would miss it all together. The issue isn't that they are trying to tune their commute to allow them to leave as late as possible; it's that they were ALREADY leaving as late as possible. Leaving earlier will only help their issue. \n\n3) Yes, construction generally happens overnight and in the wee hours of the AM. Leaving earlier in this case would make OP either later or it would cancel it's self out.\n\n4) If OP leaves at 7am and arrives at 8:01am, they shouldn't have to leave at 6am to arrive at 7:59am. That math just doesn't line up (unless as I said before, there are scheduling issues outside of their control like a ferry). Were talking litteral seconds difference here. \n\n5) I can't possibly know all  the insane traffic congestion patterns across the entire country, but I do know NJ and the NYC tristate area. I have yet to come across anywhere in this state where there is stand still traffic at 6am. It can sometimes get dicey going into Manhattan that early, especially during bad weather, but generally speaking, if you leave earlier your commute is the same or better. If you leave later however, then yes all logic goes out the window.\n\n6) If OP leaves 1.5hrs early and arrives 45mins early, that is a 45min discrepency. They could just as easily leave 45 mins early and be on time...",

I was basically doing the job of 3-4 people while making maybe $.50 more per hour since when I started. They thought they could pull a power play and pull out my attendance record. Even though I had never called in over multiple years, and had worked hundreds of hours of on call and overtime shifts, they compiled a list of something like 75 tardies over the course of 3 years. I got pulled in and told I should have been long fired with this sort of shoddy attendance according to their policies. I brought up my defenses about what I was told when I\u2019d been hired, told them this was literally the first time attendance had been an issue, and asked if they\u2019d also like to pull up all the times I\u2019d stayed to work late because they were short, or agreed to work a double overnight because of a call out, or all the times I\u2019d covered other departments because they were short or we were otherwise busy. Of course they declined and put me on final warning. From a flawless record to final warning immediately, just like that. I tried to file an official complaint for harassment but was blocked by my hotel manager who sided with my department managers and said I had no other options to challenge, including filing a complaint with corporate. My performance plummeted, I stopped being available to work extra shifts or overnight shifts, I always said I needed to be out by my scheduled shift end time, and I stopped helping out in any way. I think I lasted another 3-6 months before they finally had enough ammo to fire me. \n\nFuck people that act like this OP, and fuck employers that give them power to do so. Hopefully you continue enjoying your job and that person moves on.",
            "If your management was any good, they would reprimand that employee. Constantly snitching and nitpicking just pisses everyone off and lowers morale. There is no way that one person is valuable enough to sacrifice the happiness of everyone else. I can't stand those people that find the smallest amount of power they can and then latch on to it to feel important. Personally I would take it further than taking a parking spot, start throwing their lunches away, or take all their pens, stuff like that.",

            "Why would you have to leave 2 hours earlier to not be 5 minutes late?",
            "Why do you care so much what this one coworker thinks? Are they your supervisor?",
            "You should\u2019ve been leaving earlier long before your coworker complained.\n\nYou being late is on you especially when you know you have to take a detour.\n\nEdit: People don\u2019t like being held accountable for their actions it appears. As others have said in this chain, leaving 15 minutes earlier isn\u2019t that hard. There\u2019s no reason to leave so early you\u2019re there 45 minutes early."

        "selftext": "I originally posted this as a comment on [Car dealer shenanigans...](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/lvqnsn/car_dealer_shenanigans/).\n\nMy wife and I have used a salesman's sexism against him, and it was so satisfying. It was when we bought our first new car. We were nervous that we didn't know what we were doing so we did a lot of research (it helps that my wife is a librarian).\n\nWhen we got to the dealer, the salesman would only talk to me. I was all buddy buddy with the guy, too, but he completely ignored my wife. We went along.\n\nThe dealer was running a promotion where they would give you $X for your trade-in, no matter what condition. \"If you can drive it on the lot...\" kind of deal. Of course they just don't discount off of MSRP in those cases, so it's a gimmick. When we walked in the salesman asked which car was ours parked outside and then asked if we were trading it in. I said no, we weren't trading that car in. You can see where this was going.\n\nAs I said, we had done our research and knew what a fair price was for the car we wanted. At the time Edmunds had detailed dealer-level price information for many new cars, including all the various ways a dealer gets paid and what their true costs are (the \"invoice price\" is not their true cost). I negotiated the price (since he wouldn't talk to my wife) and we arrived at a number I thought was fair, actually. We got a good deal at that point. Everything was going smoothly as he wrote up our agreement, until he confirmed that we didn't have a trade in. I said, no, we were trading in a car, just not the one we drove into the dealer in. He literally froze for a few seconds looking down at the form, his hand hovering over the page.\n\nHe asked the make, model, and year of our trade-in, and when I told him he sputtered and balked. The car we were trading in was on its last legs. I'd had it all during college and it was old before I bought it. It was definitely past its prime. I said, I thought you were running a promotion where the quality of the trade-in doesn't matter. I asked him if he would have given us a higher price if he knew we had a trade in? My wife said under her breath \"that's sleazy.\" He heard, as she intended him to.\n\nHe then tried to renegotiate the price. We knew from our research that if they gave us the price we had already agreed on, and they honored the trade-in deal, that they would be losing money. So we were willing to move a bit, but we wanted to take our time. He was visibly nervous. Every time he tried a new way of asking for a higher price I would say something like \"I understand what you're saying\" with a sympathetic look. Then I would look at my wife and she would look back at me and silently shake her head no. I'd then look back at the salesman and shrug and say \"I don't think that's going to work.\"\n\nHe was stuck. She was the one standing in the way of him getting out of his predicament, but he hadn't talked to her at all. He had barely even acknowledged her presence. He just couldn't start talking to her now when we were negotiating. Oh, and I even got to use the classic car salesman line, \"what do I have to do for you to put me this car today?\"\n\nWe finally agreed to raise the price to an amount that, after figuring in the trade-in, was what we had thought was their break-even price. We hadn't expected to get that low of a price, and we also got them to install a nice after market sound system. It's the best deal we've ever gotten on a new car. Honestly, we're not the best negotiators individually, but that day we made one hell of a team.",

            "When I worked in car sales one of the top rules we were taught in training was to always acknowledge all people in the group equally, especially in a spouse situation, because assuming the decision-maker was a nail in the coffin for any deal.",
            "When I bought my frs new, I checked two dealerships. One treated my wife with respect but didn't have the color we wanted (was going to be my wife's car) but another did. The lot that had the right color, but the dealer ignored my wife and was slightly rude to her. I went with the respectful dealer. About a week later the same dealer called and asked if I was ready to buy. \n\n\"No, already bought one\"\n\n\"Oh did you? Didn't like the ones you looked at?\"\n\n\"I loved them, but you treated my wife like she didn't exist so I went to a dealer that wasn't a shit head. Good bye.\"\n\nAnd I hung up. He was sputtering at the end, but I just hung up instead of letting him get in a word. I suffer no shit head that disrespects my best friend.",
            "I always pay cash at the dealership and they hate not being able to negotiate financing. The last car I bought involved a couple days of haggle ending in a price I was well willing to pay. Me: \u201cso if I bring a check tomorrow for this amount, I drive away with the car?\u201d Salesman: \u201cyes.\u201d Me: \u201cThis is the grand total, no extras?\u201d Salesman: \u201cit is.\u201d\n\nI go to the bank, come back the next day with a cashier\u2019s check. Sit down with some other guy to sign the paperwork. Other guy: \u201cyou need to pay this much more for thus and so.\u201d Me: \u201cthis was the amount quoted to me yesterday. I have no access to additional funds.\u201d Him: \u201cbut you need this because...\u201d Me: \u201cYou may cancel the deal if you wish. Give me back my check.\u201d I got the car at the agreed price. \n\nMy father always taught me that there is always another house or another vehicle if your agent won\u2019t play ball. Wise man.",
            "I have had to deal with car salesmen a handful of times and there was one who noticeably spoke to me more than he spoke to my husband as he knew the car was for me. All the other salesmen we talked to spoke almost exclusively to my husband. I respected that so much that not only did I insist on buying from him, I referred all my friends and family to him when they needed new vehicles. I went to see him with my little brother when he needed a car. He told me how much he appreciated all the business I had sent his way. I told him how much I appreciated being treated like an equal instead of a dumb woman. It makes a big difference.",
            "I once went to a car dealership with my wife, and we sat down to haggle on the price.\n\nPart of the deal was a trade in, and they quote me a price for the trade in value of my car.\n\nI said \"That's interesting, that price you quoted is several hundred dollars lower than this other dealership quoted me.  Perhaps if you could match their offer we could have a deal?\"\n\nAnd my wife, being helpful, said \"Honey, we got that quote over a month ago.  We've put more mileage on it since then, so it's probably not worth as much.\"\n\nBam, shut down just like that.",
            "My husband needed a new car, but because my credit is considerably better, I was purchasing it. We didn\u2019t tell the salesman this, and as usual, the dude talked to my spouse the whole time and ignored me. We both did a test drive even tho the sales guy balked at the idea of me wanting to drive it. When it came time to discuss the details, same thing, ignored me completely. Dude made us(hubs)an offer and my man said, \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re talking to me, she\u2019s the one buying the car. But since you don\u2019t seem to be interested in selling to her, I\u2019ll be surprised if she does.\u201d He turned beet red and tried really hard to recover but knew he\u2019d fucked up. Completely ignoring the sales guy, I said \u201cyup, I\u2019m sure we can find someone else who actually wants to sell me a car\u201d and got up and left.",
            "I found out that my mom was the best negotiator when we went to buy my newish (lease return/ex-rental) car from a dealer. I had gone with my dad and it didn\u2019t work to well. Two stubborn guys didn\u2019t have enough material to work with.\n\n*But* my mom was an artist. I would talk to her (completely ignored the salesman) trying to convince her we should probably go back to the purple one (at a competitor) because it was cheaper.\n\nShe would take the salesman\u2019s side and go but this is a really nice blue and the other one has more miles.\n\nI would hit back with. It\u2019s not much more miles and Purple is a good colour too. But of course admit that I *do* like the blue better (but except for the high price).\n\n\nAnd we would go back and forth until she finally agreed with me (with a \u201cbut you\u2019ll probably regret it\u201d) and we start getting up to go back to the other dealer. \n\nGot the blue one for less than the purple and mom got taken to lunch as a thank you.",
            "I learned how to haggle from my dad and it's not only incredibly effective, once you hear how to do it you'll think it's obvious and that everyone should do it this way. \n\nThe secret is you don't haggle. You're playing their game if you do and they're experienced. That doesn't mean you can't get a better price, but the second you start working down from a number they're already calculating how far it will go and ticking off boxes in their head to stop you. So don't. \n\nFind what you like before you ever go in and have an idea of how much you plan to spend. This number varies for everyone but you can easily knock $5k off a new car without even trying so just consider that your starting point. Listen to the pitch, test drive it, all that. When you sit in the little office and the salesperson starts writing, stop them (don't let them keep writing while you talk, get their full attention). Tell them quite honestly you know what you're willing to pay and you want the car. But you aren't interested in the back and forth over price. Tell them to give you a good deal on the first offer or you're walking out. Now you get to do the power move. Tell them you know how this works and they need to go talk to the manager, you'll wait. But don't come back with anything but the best offer. \n\nWhen they come back, look at it. Unless it's lower than you planned on paying, get up and walk out. Don't take a lot of time thinking about it, just start to leave. Either you're going to leave because they're still trying to mess with you or they'll basically panic and beg you to stay. If they do tell them you weren't kidding and you know that's not the price. Give them another chance. That second number is going to be just about as close to break even as they'll go. Don't try to knock it down further, you'll weaken your position. \n\nThis absolutely works and if you want go test it out but still don't buy then compare the price they give you with their cost online. I've done this for about 8 cars (helping friends and an ex) and I've always gotten within a thousand of cost. It seems aggressive but you gotta remember their entire job is using that same mentality against you. They know you want or need a car. That puts you at a disadvantage. By being willing to walk out you take the power back.",
            "When my wife and I negotiate a car purchase, I\u2019m not allowed to speak.  She is a beast and I pity the person that tries to haggle with her.  I had to buy a car a few years ago, and we walked out of there with free window tint, because she caught the salesman in an outright lie.  While she was chewing him out, I started for the door.  Afraid to lose the sale, he quickly threw in free window tint, even though we had him down to the lowest price in town.",
            "Little LPT here... if the salesman gets up to go talk to the manager get up and go with him and just talk to the manager yourself. Its really the manager selling you the car at that point so cut out the middleman.",
            "Most dealerships have a certain amount of cars they can sell at a loss, but in the end it\u2019s not up to the sales person but their manager if they\u2019ll take your deal.

I do not miss being a woman in that industry.",
            "This reminds me of how I got my last car.  I was in contact over phone/email with various dealerships within a few hours of my place about a single car.  I really got to know the price this car should be valued at and got to shoot down the dealers that were not even worth talking to anymore.  I finally got it down to two dealers (one super close to my house and the other 2 hours away).\n\nThe one further away was emailing me with something like \"When are you going to come to look at the car\" but he accidentally forwarded at the same time a link to some system they use to give quotes.  It showed me all of my information, all of the price lowerings I'd gotten to that point, and, most importantly, it showed me the lowest break-even price the dealer could offer.  Obviously showing me way too much info without asking for a login.\n\nI obviously couldn't get this dealer down to that price so I printed out the quote, went to the dealer closer to me and said \"Hey this dealer is further away but they're offering me this quote, can you get me it too?\"  The dealer seemed hesitant but we eventually reached a deal.\n\nEdit: I apparently don't know how to spell",
            "When my husband went with me to go buy my car, the salesman went straight up to him and started chatting him up, and ask what kind of car he wanted to look at.  He simply stared at the salesman and said \u201cyou\u2019re talking to the wrong person.  I don\u2019t have any money\u201d.  I damn near lost it laughing.",
            "When I first got into luxury car sales, I didn't have an established clientele yet, and relied on walk-in traffic, or \"ups\" as they're called, for the majority of my business. \n\nWhere we were located, we were one of the closest luxury car dealerships to a relatively large university. From time to time, students would wander in and check out the cars, and get completely ignored by the sales staff. They were deemed to be \"wasting time\" and unable to afford the cars we were selling, so nobody wanted to help them. \n\nOftentimes, they were foreign students, and I was told by the more senior staff that they would never qualify to buy the cars, and at best, they would waste our time and then go buy from someone in the big city who could speak their language. \n\nNevertheless, I took the opportunity to hone my skills on them. I didn't exactly have anything better to do, so I would try to practice my sales skills on them. \n\nOne day, a group of young, casually dressed foreign students came in asking about a new higher-end model sedan that we hadn't recieved yet. I told them we didn't have any, but we had the one up from it. \n\n$129,000 flagship sedan, twin turbo V8, and my sales manager had accidentally ordered it in an extremely dark shade of green, thinking it was black. \n\nI took these kids on an awesome test drive, got them all hyped up on the ridiculous colour and features of the car, and told them our promos on that model. Sales had been suffering on that model line and we had some pretty aggressive promos, and I knew our management was desperate to unload an accidentally green car that was heavily optioned, so I presented them with a discount that was steep but I was pretty sure would fly. They said they needed time to think about it. I figured I gave it my best shot but that my odds were slim. \n\nA week (and a couple of follow up calls) later, one of the kids shows up with a deposit for the car. Finance told him he had to put $40k down and provide a lot of documentation to get approved for financing (not being a citizen of our country and having no credit history) but apparently did so with no hesitation. A couple of phone calls and the money appeared in his account, a short visit to the bank and he was back with certified funds.  \n\nA number of his friends, so impressed by his car, my willingness to work with them (read: treat them like humans), and give the \"great deals\" I gave them, also bought cars from me that year. \n\nI later found out foreign students at this university paid insanely high tuitions and our cars were dirt cheap by their standards.",
            "The last car we bought, The first thing I said to the salesman was \"She is the one buying the car, not me.\"  I repeated that several times through the process.\n\nIt's her car, not mine... (She also makes almost twice what I make so talk to her)  It's like pulling teeth sometimes.",
            "Every time my husband and I go to make a large purchase the sales person tries to talk to my husband about price. I\u2019m in charge of our finances and have better credit so he\u2019s typically the co-signer and I\u2019m the primary. We let the sales person do their schtick and then my husband will excuse himself to take a bathroom and smoke break and tells the person \u201cmy wife handles all the financials.\u201d And leaves. I will then jump in and negotiate and most times, they\u2019re thrown off that I end up getting a better deal.

            "When we were buying our first car together, my husband and his new coworker (he was saddled with driving us around) were in uniform. The thing about being in the military and in uniform is that you have to be on your best behavior and the dealer knew this. \n\nHe simply wouldn\u2019t listen. My husband was trying to be polite, the dealer was ignoring me, but I had the final say. I told him repeatedly, \u201cthis is our budget, why are you showing us cars 10k+ over it?\u201d He kept trying to talk to my husband, but as this would be \u201cmy\u201d car (my husband had a truck that was as being shipped to us, I had left my parents my old truck before we moved) I kept trying to direct the dealer to me. \n\nFinally I said, \u201cclearly this isn\u2019t going to work for us. You\u2019re not listening, you\u2019re disregarding our budget and talking over me. We\u2019re done. Goodbye,\u201d even as we walked to the car, he kept trying to sell something to us, to convince us to stay. We ignored him and left. Found a nice, independent place and the car we had looked at online and left that day with it.\n\nAlso, buying my first truck, I looked online all night (nightshift) I printed out the good deals I found and presented them to my dad who used to be a mechanic for his opinion. I had a short window to do the actually shopping at the dealership and asked them to pull the truck up for us to inspect and we were on our way. \n\nWe get there and they upped the price by and I am not exaggerating 10k. I pulled off the print off from the night before, from their website, with the original price tag. The dealer actually went pale and excused himself. They then tried to make it seem like they were doing me a favor by giving me the price on the print out. Still drove off with her. Norma Jean is the best truck and I\u2019m sad I left her behind.

Mine you, I've never had a credit card before.  In my mind, because I've been good at saving for things and buy them myself, I thought this was a good thing.  Well, not in the eyes of a credit score.  The sales guy had the Manager come tell me the best they could do is sell me the truck with a 16% interest rate.  I was fucked.  I asked if they could budge on the amount they were offering from the trade in, since in my mind I was getting screwed on interest..  Magically the Manager agreed to a much higher trade in value.. gee I wonder why?\n\nWhile the Manager was off getting some paper work, my Mom asked if I was ok with her buying it outright by dipping into her life savings, and we would set up a private loan agreement where I would pay her back directly, no interest.  I agreed.  When the Manager came back we explained we were just going to buy the truck outright.  I visibly saw the blood leave his face and become white as a ghost.  He agreed and abruptly left, and the look on the Sales guy's face was \"Oh fuck\".  \ud83d\ude06\n\nSo not only did I get a great sales deal on a new truck, I got way more money for my trade in than they would have ever given someone.  Not sure how much money they made off that deal, but by the guy's reaction, it wasn't good.  I've since gotten a credit card and have great credit from just buying small stuff and immediately paying it off.  I also paid my Mom back in full for the loan, with a bonus.",
            "My daughter took her boyfriend with her to get her first almost-new car.  The boyfriend brought his calculator.  Because she has never dealt with a car salesman, she was ready to sign on the line.  But by the time her boyfriend was done, he saved her eight grand.  They were really mad at him.

(the bloke who saw us originally tore a strip out of the owner of the shop as we left)\n\nWRX and he kept asking me if I'd like to drive it, never asked her - instant lost sale.\n\nSubaru GT waggon, would chat to her but kept coming back to me, any questions she asked and he'd tell me the answer - so close, but no.\n\nLooking at a Yamaha R6 \"can this be lowered much?\" (they can be I've done two now for \"compact\" riders) and he rolls his eyes at me - I pulled the pin on that before someone needed an entire bike surgically removed.\n\nLast car (Sub WRX because fast/black/big vents/fast/cool wheels/turbo noise/fast/she likes Subaru) and I had enough of looking at cars, pulled the dealer over while someone got the seat right and said \"sell her the fucking car, not me, I have one\" because my god if I had to look at another bloody rocket powered hatchback...\n\nSo, to salesmen everywhere, if a female comes in wanting to buy a car or a bike or a 5 axis turret mill, then sell it to her, not her father/brother/husband/boyfriend/friend/random male she was seen with, it's a brave new world now and what with woman being able to vote and wear pants in public there's a good chance they'll want to make their own decisions on other things too.",
            "I\u2019ve literally been laughed out of a dealership, because I went in by myself. I knew what I wanted and the price I wanted it.

Like why do I need a man to buy a damn car.\n\nAlternatively, I\u2019ve gotten a call from my husband while he was buying a car. Because the salesman said he wanted to make sure this was what we BOTH wanted, and flat out said he wasn\u2019t comfortable selling to just one person in the relationship, and wanted to hear me say I was okay before going on. Was that a little overboard, probably. But it made me feel like my input and opinions mattered and not just my husband\u2019s.",
            "I was at a dealership buying a new vehicle.  We haggled.  Back & forth, back and forth.\n\nFinally the dude hits MY magic number.  ( I had done a ton of research )  Then he comes up with the old \"I'll have to get the manager's approval\" just to jack me around some more.  He said \"I'll need some money to show the sales manager that you're serious about this deal\"\n\nWell, we all know this is an excuse to disappear for awhile, only to come back with some lame excuse why the dealer needs 'just a little bit more' to close the deal.\n\nSo, I open up my wallet and fish out a dollar bill and slide it across the desk to him.  \"What's this ?\"  I said it's one dollar.  And, as far as I know, a dollar is enough to make a deal legally binding.  Then  said, If you're not back here within fifteen minutes, you can keep the dollar because I'm leaving.   He was back in ten.  \n\nBy the way, here's a freebie tip.  Shop on the last day of a quarter, it's when dealer's are anxious to meet their quotas.  And if you want to *really* get a deal, go on December 31 st.  If they haven't met their yearly quota, you can practically walk out with the sales manager's daughter ... lol",
            "I went to a dealership once interested in a Specific used car and test drove the car with the salesman. I mentioned we were interested in a similar car at another dealership and he got this glint in his eye and started acting all cocky. He decided to call the other dealership pretending to be an interested buyer and get the price from them. The dealership recognized him immediately by his voice and politely told him to f-off. I was laughing because this was all so awkward and hilarious. His sales manager noticed what was going on and he got in big trouble. Apparently he used to work at that other dealership and had some fish to fry with them, but it is super unprofessional to call other dealerships to price their cars out, so I got a big discount on the car and I don\u2019t think he got any commission from it.",
            "I sold cars for a few years, mostly luxury brands and sports cars, and we were always taught to acknowledge all parties, understand the relationship as much as possible, and understand who the car was going to be for, how it would be used, and who's paying for it, so that we can make everyone feel comfortable and respected. \n\nAfter maybe a year, I had gotten pretty good at negotiating and built up quite a bit of confidence in my own sales process. \n\nOne afternoon, a lady in her 50s came in, asking about a particular new sports convertible. She was driving an older European convertible that she said she would be trading in. I walked her through the whole process, including a lengthy test drive, and when she was ready for her next appointment, \"to discuss and finalize the deal\", as she put it, she showed up with her husband. I assumed she brought him to help her negotiate. \n\nUndeterred, I was sure to address both of them throughout the conversation, but he hardly spoke with me. He would just smile or chuckle and nod his head at me. She was all business, asking me questions and negotiating to include things, bump the price of their trade, everything. He said practically nothing. I was a little confused as to why he had come at all. \n\nOnce the deal was finalized,  she came in by herself again for her appointment with finance, and scheduled her home delivery with me. I made some cheesy remark about how I was sure she was going to love her new car. She replied \"Oh, it's not for me, it's for my husband. This car is far too impractical for me.\" Then she opened up to me about how she was the dollars and sense businesswoman of the family and her husband was \"an old playboy\" who couldn't be bothered by these things, and was easily bored. \n\nThat deal always stood out in my head as an example as to why you can never trust your shallow assumptions about people. \n\nShe came back a few months later and traded her old luxury SUV for one of ours, in the same colour, to match her husband's new car.",
            "One year, I attended the National Leadership Forum. Nelson Mandela was the keynote. There was a guy lecturing on the sexism of dealers. He said something like for 1/2 the cars, women are the main decision-maker in the family. Of the remaining sales, 1/2 the buyers are women. And yet, car dealers don't treat women well. \n\nMy favorite part of his talk was about a woman attending a conference in LA. She took a break and went to look at a nearby Mercedes dealer. Most of her time, the salespeople ignored her. She had 'Barbara' on her nametag and the one that finally came up to her called her 'Babs'. Finally, she said, \"My friends call me Barbara, but you can call me Senator Boxer.\"",
            "I remember going to a car dealership with my mom when I was about nine, she wanted a Toyota Rav4 with the V6 in it specifically so she had a bit more power to pass people on the highway if she needed to, tow trailers full of mulch, carry heavy furniture around, etc. She came in ready to buy the thing on the spot, but the dealer insisted that \u201cwomen don\u2019t need a V6, the four cylinder will do just fine.\u201d He seriously wouldn\u2019t sell the car to someone willing to buy at full price because we wanted leave the dealership with a car before the end of the day. We were literally the textbook perfect buyers, but \u201cwomen don\u2019t need bigger engine hurrr derr derr\u201d. So we went to a different dealership and bought the exact same car. Wack as hell",

I figure I just helped a customer make a better deal.  Unfortunately, I can only do that with borrowers with poor or insufficient credit, since if your credit is excellent you can get approved for a lousy deal (for higher risk borrowers, it becomes more important that the collateral is worth a greater percentage of the loan, since default is more likely), and my job is to judge the risk of the loan, not if I personally believe the customer is overpaying.",

            "My ex-husband, my best friend (male), and myself (female), did something similar last year. My ex-husband, W, is a congenial guy, and he knows this and isn't afraid to be chatty, my best friend, P, is one of those guys who rarely speaks in public, doesn't smile, and generally has this \"go away\" vibe, and I, D, make the decisions. We had a trade in that was in my best friend's name that he had bought new for me 8 years before. Long story, but it was a thank you for helping him when he needed it. I don't drive a lot so even though it was 8 years old, it had 50k miles on it and was in immaculate condition. I wanted a larger vehicle that had a few more bells and whistles. \n\nWe walk in and W is of course the one the sales guy gravitates towards, W is smiling and chatting this dude, giving him the run down of what we were looking for, he ignored me completely, didn't even ask my name, and only gave P a nod. Cool. We look at a few of the cars, I wanted a late model used car and he kept pushing us towards this one particular one. I liked it but it didn't have everything I wanted. We go back inside and goes over his inventory list and then puts it aside. I loudly whisper to P if he is bored he can go home, that was on purpose. He looks around like he is bored out of his mind and then scoops up the inventory list and speaks for the first time to say, \"maybe I will find a truck I will like\" and the sales guy, determined to get my ex-husband to buy this particular car ignores P, as people usually do, and keeps chatting away. \n\nP pulls a marking pencil out of his jacket and starts doing the line by line thing. The sales guy takes W out to show him a new version of the make and model I was looking at, in reality W was killing time while P did his thing. P is good at two things, he is an amazing electrical troubleshooter and he LOVE research before buying, or in this case assisting with buying something. He listens to Clark Howard every day, has a credit score that I have seen cause loan officers to stammer and enjoys making a deal. I do research and he finds the best price, we have worked together for years this way. P finds what I am looking for, it is at the bottom of the list because apparently one of the dealers was using it as his personal car. It had all the bells and whistles I wanted and then some. Even some amazing winterization that I needed where I was going but was useless down south where we were buying.\n\nSales guy comes back in with W and they sit down, P speaks up and asks \"what about this one?\" He even helpfully circled it in pencil. The sales guy was confused, and turned to W, who turned to me and asked was that one I wanted to look at, I told him, absolutely, and the dealer realizes he has been talking to the wrong person this whole time. Oops. When he realized the trade in was in P's name that was another funny OOPS moment. We told him the car was for me, even told him I would be doing the financing. He just ignored the info.\n\nSales guy looked like he swallowed a bug when just P and I got up to go look at the car. W actually said at that point, oh I am just the driver, she makes the decisions and P came to give her the trade in.",

I called my bank which was across the street and asked them and they said the dealer never even submitted it to them.

So we went, said we wanted X car and negotiated the trade in. When that was done, we said \u201cOh, and we have this discount...\u201d and when the sandman took it to the finance guy... he came running out and tried to tell us we couldn\u2019t get what they offered for the trade.

I negotiated everything as if I was paying cash because that was the plan. They gave me far more for my trade than I expected and came down further in price than I expected (essentially calling my bluff). I was only 90% certain I was going to pull the trigger. \n\nI only had one tactic left. My mom is very frugal and always made us \"sleep on it\" for big decisions. So I said \"you know my mom would kill me if I made such a big purchase without sleeping on it\". \n\nWent home that night. Woke up to a new email from Toyota detailing their 0% financing offer and 10% of MSRP. I walked back into the dealership, showed them the email, said I want this financing and, oh btw, lets take another 10% off the price. \n\nThe sales manager audibly said \"you lucky son of a b\\*\\*\\*\\*\". \n\nI still lost plenty of money in depreciation, but it felt good knowing I got a pretty sweet deal. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat car ended up being one of the last cars toyota built at the NUMI Plant in the Bay Area before they sold it to Tesla where (hopefully) my next car would come from.",

He called me while the salesman talked to his manager, and I said I didn\u2019t care and to go for it.

Dumb luck,  I was on their website at work and saw the deal.   I figured It was time to get into the modern day and save some money on my electric bill.   Ok I'll swing by on my way home.  I did not order them online, but the web site said the store had them in stock.\n\nI printed out the sale price and SKU from the web.  Went to the store and loaded up my cart.  Went to check out.  Rung up at the wrong price.  I showed them the online advert.  They said no dice.  I said,  but you match prices.  This is a home deport store,  this is from a home depot website.  manager said  sorry, but the online store is different from the brick and mortar store, we don't match online prices.\n\nOK fine... So I put the light bulbs back on the shelf.  Go to the contractor desk and hop on their computer.  go to the website,  make an online purchase. have the pro desk print out my receipt.  I head out the car, hang out for about 30 minutes.\n\nCome back in to  pick up my light bulbs.  Manager comes over and I show them the receipt for the pick up of the bulbs?\n\nManager:  Wheres is the cart that you had them in.\n\nMe:  I put them back on the shelf since you weren't going to sell them to me\n\nSo he gets someone to go get the bulbs off the shelf for me.\n\nManager says: you know you could have just left them in the cart.\n\nI say: And you could have honored the price when I first got here....\n\nIts not much,  but it made me happy...",

            "Top tip - watch the item numbers, too, when ordering. I just bought a slew of doorknobs online from Home Depot. The only reason I bought them online was because I needed 14 and my store showed only 7 in stock. Well, that was the first reason. \n\nThen I realized they were $3 cheaper per knob online IF I chose F40 ACC 716 instead of F40 V ACC 716. They appeared to be identical, with no logical explanation for the price difference (but, wow, the data entry! one said it was 9 inches high!). The price difference? That V stands for visibility packaging. Want a cellophane window in your box to see the doorknob? Extra $3! I couldn't find this out on the Home Depot site; it was in the FAQ on the Schlage website. \n\nThe store only carries the V version, of course, since walk-in purchasers would be more likely to want to see them before buying them.\n\n(Second tip, specific to these doorknobs but probably applicable to other products - the 4-packs are more expensive than buying 4 individual knobs, even in visibility packaging.)",
            "They did this to me a couple times last summer.  Luckily I knew one of the managers and he was able to adjust the prices.\n\nI still can't wrap my head around their logic of not being able to match their own prices.",

So im bringing these carts in and watching him take off all his gear ( it takes him like 10 minutes ) Finally he goes to walk in and gets told he cant come in. \n\nHe looks at me and goes you could have told me the store was closed! \nI look around the parking lot and say you could have parked in nearly any one of these spots. ( like out of hundreds of spots only a dozen had cars in them and they were all on the far side of the lot.)",

Recently it was oil, I wanted a particular kind of oil in a big (more than 10 gallons) volume. Website says store has it, store does not.

            "I have been waiting for years to tell this story. I bought a storm door for my house at Home Depot. I wanted it to look nice so I also paid for the installation. I took the door home with me. When I got home I looked up the installation on line and it looked simple so I did it. I went back to Home Depot and asked for a refund on the installation. They gave me a full refund on both the installation and the door. 2 days later a storm door is delivered to my house in anticipation of the installation. I took it back and tried to explain and they gave me a full refund on the door and installation again. Two weeks later an installer showed up at my house, I told him through the storm door I didn\u2019t need an installation! You guessed it, full refund on door and installation for a third time! Home Depot paid me about $1000 to install their door on my house.",

We went to HD because it's right down the street, found the pipe and wandered around looking for an associate for several minutes only to be told the cutter was broken. \nOff to Lowes we went. Found the pipe, instantly found an associate to cut it. \"But wait!\" he said. \"Where did you find this? We don't sell this pipe in this size.\" So we showed him. Apparently it had been returned from another store. No worries, he not only cut the pipe but honored the price listed in the spot we found the pipe (he jotted down a price on a random piece of cardboard and told us to show it to the cashier), which was a good 20% less than we would have paid at HD.\nIt's a bit out of the way but that's where we'll be going from here on.",

            "Home depot pulled something similar to me in November. Got my dad some stuff for his birthday. His birthday rolls around and I give it to him, he feels bad knowing how much we paid. Well he finds out that like the week after we bought it, they went on sale for a much better price. (We bought the stuff 9 days before my dad's birthday.) We take it to the store unopened and ask if they can give us the sale price. They say we have 1 week for price adjustments. But we can return it there and go back to the shelves, and buy the same thing again if we like. Really? You really can't just give us the sale price, you have to make it a hassle? Fine. We return it, order online, and they bring it to us. We got lucky and the dumb bastards didn't end up charging us for one of the things at all because of that ordeal, saved 300 bucks",

We do all the paperwork for financing, tax and title and he puts in the order.\n\nIt was going to be weeks before the vehicle was to be delivered.\n\nI get the call it is in. I have my wife drive me to the dealership and there is my nice new shining truck sitting out front. I am excited beyond belief.\n\nI go in and the salesman says the manager wants to talk to me.\n\nWe go to his office and he proceeds to tell me that they cannot give me the vehicle unless I give them another $ 2300US, which is a lot of money at that time. \n\nHe explains that someone had messed setting up the computer and everyone was getting the employee discount.\n\nI reminded him that in our state, the price we had negotiated and signed all the paperwork on was the deal. He would need to give me the vehicle for that price  and I leave with the vehicle in 5.minites or he would be all over the news for it and everyone they were screwing over would know and they would be out even more money on those other orders and then also lose a lot of business from bad press.\n\nHe hemmed and hawwed, squirming in his chair. I said times ticking. He wanted to call the owner. I said you have only minutes and I walk out.\n\nHe was sweating. He asked me to leave his office during the call and I said no, and for him to put it on speaker so I could talk to the owner.\n\nIt was very quick, the owner said give the vehicle and asked me not to go public. Sure i said.\n\nI left with my vehicle and drove directly to the local news station and told them all about it.\n\nBig news story. Dealership still in business. But it cost them thousands, probably tens of thousands, if not more.\n\nThey did spin it a bit and in the news story say they will honor the pricing and refund the money to those that had paid. \n\nI haven't purchased that brand of vehicle in a long time.",

            "I had a similar situation with home depot a couple of months ago. There was a sale on smart bulbs online, so I figured that it would be cool to be able to upgrade my lights. Weird thing is, the sale was only valid in Chicago, where I used to live, but now I\u2019m in Los Angeles where there wasn\u2019t a sale. (Home depot automatically selected Chicago as my home store when I went online.) So I called up my local home depot and asked if they would match the price and they said no. I tried to argue that I can just order them from Chicago to get the price and that it would be easier for both of us if they just honored the sale, but they persisted that they wouldn\u2019t. So I ordered them to be shipped from a Chicago store and got the sale.",
            "This is strange to me. As a cashier at Home Depot we\u2019re allowed and frankly expected to take up to $50 off the customer\u2019s purchase if we feel it\u2019s the right thing to do. We have to get approval, but usually not from the manager, just the head cashier. Not sure what the exact math came out to, just saying this is strange.",

            "Lol last year at Home Depot I bought a big metal panel, I think they are 12 or 16 feet long. Don\u2019t fit in my SUV, so I asked an employee if they could cut it in half with some tin snips after I bought it. He says sorry no, we don\u2019t have any tin snips to do that with. Knowing he\u2019s full of shit, I go to another employee. He says sorry but you\u2019ll just have to buy a pair of tin snips, use them, and then return them. Wtf? Then I see a manager. I tell him what I need, and he says yeah no problem! I tell him what just happened with the other two employees. He said that\u2019s not true we have tin snips on the fork lift. He was also really not happy an employee told me to buy something just to use for 1 minute and then return it. We go find the forklift, who\u2019s driving it? Employee number one that I had asked, who told me there are none. I then stood over employee, who was clearly annoyed, and watched him cut the panel in half. Sweet justice.",
            "Unfortunately due to the way it works, if they were to \"price match\" it would show the same as if they discounted it for being damaged, and the store looks worse in stats no matter how they mark it down in price, so in actuality the best way is for you to do exactly what you did. This way the store's metrics weren't negatively impacted",

I went to the store and it was regular price. They said prices on their site are the same in store, except for clearance.  But that made no sense since the website allowed you to search local store inventory, not online inventory.  So I used my phone, bought it online for 50 and had it set up at my local store.

            "Well sometimes i get the sentiment for having online shop at cheaper prices. Essentially people that shop online pick up the item quickly or get it delivered, they don't spend time in the shop requesting your assistance for  x amount of time so you can take care of other customers in the meantime. It also makes the delivery fees less annoying.\n\n However this only applies if you are a small business with a web shop, as soon as you're a big corporation store there shouldn't be differences in prices because they buy stuff in bulk all the time so the price difference shouldn't matter at all for them.",

I can only withdraw 250,000 won (About $216 a day) from an ATM and if I go in person to a teller I can only withdraw 1 million won (about $870) a day. This normally doesn't present a problem for me. I also can't have a debit/credit card I get a \"bank book\" which is kinda like an electronic check book that's a physical thing you carry (FYI I use my American bank for most of my day to day spending)\n\nBut...It did once. I signed a lease for a new apartment and the deposit was 10 million won (about $8,700, yes this is normal for Korea) so I transferred the money from my American bank to my Korean bank and I went to the bank in person to transfer the money to my landlord.\n\nI get there and the teller tells me I can only transfer 1 million per day. My first idea was to ask my landlord if she'd be cool with me transferring her 1 million won a day for 10 days, she doesn't like that idea.\n\nSo I'm sitting there arguing and the bank manager comes out, he's a nice enough man and speaks good english. Basically he says because of my type of my account there is no way I can transfer more then 1 million a day.

Why can't I withdraw money when my account covers it even without that cheque. Just ?!?!?!\n\nI take the $800 and leave.

I'd actually been working until about 1:30 (c. 18 hour day) the night before, and was thinking that only being 10 minutes late wasn't bad.  When I got my stack of papers for the day, I let out one of those low groans, and said, \"you've gotta be s#'#'[ng me!\", it was going to be another long day.  Boss takes that as his chance to call me out in front of the rest of the office: \"Hey, if you're going to show up late and then complain about work, we don't need you around here, you're fired\". Dunno if he thought I would apologise for coming in late and ask to not be fired, but I knew that I could have a new, equally crappy job before the end of the day. So I called his bluff, and handed over my clipboard and walked away. He must have looked through my work for the day, and realised that he didn't have anyone that could do what I could do and with the labour market crunch, he just didn't have anybody. On my way out to my car, I stopped and started chatting with my buddy and the dispatcher, having a smoke.  Boss comes out and tells me to meet him in his office so we can discuss my attitude.  I said, I'm not going to your office, I just got fired, my buddy and the dispatch are shocked, buddy says: \"you know he pulled 18 hours yesterday, and 15 the day before that\", dispatch says: \"why did you fire him, we've got no one to do his run today!\".  Boss is taken a little aback and says: \"I didn't say you're fired, I said you're FiHired\", so here's your route for the day.  I say \"well, if I just got hired, we should talk about my starting wage\", and that's how I got a $2/hour raise.\n\nEdit\nAnyone complaining about it 'only being $2 /hour': starting pay was $9 /hour, plus $1 /hour bonus if you didn't skip a shift, didn't break anything etc, so $10 /hour as a swamper if you got your bonus.  Got bumped to $12 /hour ($11 + $1) when you started driving truck, and you could get more from there as you worked your way up, I think the top end was $16 or $17. So for me, as a young guy, getting bumped to $13 + $1 was a big increase.  Also, this was around 2003 - 2004, and minimum wage was like $6.00.",

I am always the kind of person who is willing to do the harder jobs if asked to. One day my boss flips out on me because I have not put the napkins in a to go order yet. I put those on top of the containers so that everything was in the bag in a nice near fashion and no chance of the plastic forks poking a hole in the bag etc. He flips out and fires me. A week later when I am picking up my last pay check he told me I can come back to work, because no one wanted to work the counter, and they kept getting complaints from customers because stuff kept being left out from the to go orders, the coffee was always late to be made etc. Basically he fucked himself because he wanted shit done his exact way, despite the fact that I did everything perfectly in my own system. I should have told him I would only do it for a pay raise. But I moved on to a new job, earning more and working less. So I would say I ended up with a win.",

Years ago, when he lived in an apartment complex, the rental office staff became aware of how beautiful he decorated his apartment.  It really was award-winning, literally.  Anyway, the apartment manager notified Chad that his apartment was to be the model going forward.  Chad was not happy with this development.  Strangers moving through his personal areas, going through his things, possibly stealing things?  Unacceptable.  The apartment manager was quick to mention that this was a part of Chad's lease.  Suddenly, an idea occurred to Chad.\n\n\"Are you allowed to move or cover up anything in my apartment?\"\n\n\"No sir, we are not allowed to touch, move, rearrange or cover up anything.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nChad put up every piece of male erotica he possessed, and he even bought some more.  Posters, figurines, serious art. even a pile of magazines fanned out on the coffee table, like some kind of doctor's office.  Chad called the rental office and warned them against  bringing anyone into his apartment that was a child or squeamish about such subject matter.  The rental office immediately sent over one of their maintenance men to confirm.\n\nCheck and mate.",

At which point they said \"sorry, they're always like that, but they're the easiest to deal with\".\n\nLike what?! You knew what we were walking into and said nothing in advance?

            "I had flatmates when I was at college, and we rented a house with a room each from a landlord who seemed reasonable at the time. \n\nAbout 3 months (yes, *months*) before the end of the lease, he started showing round people with about 10 minutes warning on the phone. If we didn't answer the phone, he'd show up anyway.\n\nAll four of us got really annoyed with this, but he refused to stop unless we re-upped the yearly contract, which we weren't going to do because it was our finals year. The solution we came to was similar to OP's. We just went naked whenever we got the call (and in the UK, the landlord has to call). So he'd call, we'd ignore the call itself (thanks, caller-id), strip off and hang out in the lounge (weirdly enough, the lounge was on the 1st floor, not the ground floor which was all bedrooms, so no-one was looking in).\n\nHe stopped showing the place after the first few times. \n\nAside: I didn't think about the kid angle, but we didn't get any kids come by, just rather shocked adults who walked in on a room of naked guys, or who were confronted by a naked guy standing at the top of the stairs asking what the hell they were doing in our house ?",

As two baby gays, we embraced the potential and ended up with quite a fun little mid-century apartment. I\u2019m sure it was by no means as fabulous as your husband\u2019s apartment was, but for a college student dwelling in an old building it certainly stood out and made the best of what many of our friends saw as ugly and unsalvageable features. Word got out to the sweet old couple who owned the building, and after offering us $20 for each walk through, they showed our unit as the \u201cmodel\u201d to prospective tenants for the next couple of years.

Because I'm using my personal vehicle for this travel, the company pays me mileage.\n\nWell, there are basically two routes you can take between the two offices. One is about a mile round trip shorter, but has tolls. So I always took the 1 mile longer route and avoid the tolls.  I did it this way for a year.\n\nWell in comes the new bookkeeper and she is hellbent on saving the company money. And where does she think all this wasteful money is going? Expense reports, obviously. So she starts knit picking every report. Like if someone is out and has to buy some pens for work. She goes online and finds the cheapest price possible for those pens, and only reimburses for that cheaper price. It, obviously, has pissed several people off.\n\nWell, she eventually decided to target me. I submit my report for 2 weeks, and a few days later get the reimbursement payment. Well, it's $5.85 short. I ask her about it, and she says I've been ripping off the company for the past year by taking the longer route between the offices. She will only pay mileage for the shorter route from now on. \"And I'm lucky she doesn't go back and take back all the extra from the past year.\"\n\nI say Ok, but to please send me that per her I must take the shorter route and that this is company policy and leave her office. Before I even made it to my desk I had the email from her confirming what she said. 2 weeks later I submit my expense report. I reported the shorter route, so the company saved $5.85. But tolls added up to $136. A net loss for the company of $130.15. It's been 6 months and I'm still \"taking the shorter route\" costing the company an extra $130.15 every 2 weeks.",

            "Got to love those bean counters. Around 10 years ago I was invited to visit a vendor site in Montpellier, southern France. The vendor was picking up hotel fees and flights via easyJet, a budget airline here in the UK, but we had to get to Gatwick for the flight and the company needed to pick up that cost. \n\nI did a little digging round and found there was a direct flight from my local airport to Montpellier but it only departed a day earlier and I would need to spend an additional night in the hotel we were booked into. I confirmed the vendor would pay for the flight from the local airport, but I would need to pick up the extra night in the hotel.  I contacted the hotel and asked about the addition nights stay, it was going to cost \u20ac90. I went to our travel team to sort all this out ans was met with a flat no. There was no way they were going to stump up the hotel cost.\n\nI responded detailing the cost difference to them. \n\nI go a day earlier, the vendor pays all my flights and hotel costs apart from \u20ac90 we would need to pay, my wife drops me off at the airport just 6 miles from home and colects me when I get back. Net cost to the company - \u20ac90. \n\nI go on the day planned which starts with the taxi ride from home to my nearest main line train station. Then there's the return train fare down to London Kings Cross, underground from Kings Cross to Victoria, return train from Victoria to Gatwick. There is also a company policy that because of my pay grade I travel first class on trains. No idea why, if I'm paying then standard class is fine, I can't see the point of paying the premium for a drink and sandwich at my seat. All together this added up to over \u00a3470.\n\nI remember sitting at Montpellier airport on my way home watching the flight to my local airport taking off. It had landed at home before my flight to Gatwick went. I didn't get home for another 7 hours. When I got back to the office the follwing week, I made sure I also put in a claim for the additional travelling hours as well as claiming for meals on the way home. The accountant queried every last one of the receipts and at every step I justified the cost ans pointed out this could all have been avoided if they has simply paid the \u20ac90 for the extra nights stay.

I always think about saving. But I worked in a department where, though I was the head of me pretty much, I had to submit expense reports for office supplies to my bosses.

So I submitted a request for 500 manila folders, and one In & Out box (the stackable kind made of plastic). I received a response back from my bosses saying that the manila folders were approved but the In & Out box was not approved. Not wanting to burden my bosses anymore with this minute irritation, I sent an email to the person who directly denied the In & Out box and asked why and what was I supposed to do? The only response I got back was, \u201cdid the manila folders come in boxes? You can use those, per Michael.\u201c So here I was with a big beautiful office, a box of 500 manila folders and using the top and bottom of the Manila folder boxes as my In & Out boxes!

            "I can relate. I don't know what it is with some finance departments, but there are so many cases where strictly following policy is so much more wasteful. We had policies that required employees to choose the least expensive airfare. As we are an international company, this meant 4 or 5 extra stops or layovers when traveling internationally. Heck, even a cross country trip could add 10 hours if we followed pricing strictly.  Employees caught on and either:\n\n* spent an extra day in transit\n* gamed the system by narrowing time slots to only have single options\n\nOf course, the company caught on and began requiring multiple hour windows when selecting a flight. This meant that if you were due for a meeting/conference you had to either schedule flights a day early (incurring hotel and daily reimbursement) or book some redeye flight which meant you were near nead when you arrived.\n\nSometimes it worked out. Tuesday/Wedneday flights were often cheaper so in some cases instead of leaving on a Friday we could stay a couple extra days (on personal expense) and book a Tuesday flight and still come in cheaper.

Suddenly the expense clerks started denying dinner expenses whenever we went over $25 on a decent dinner - even if there were no other meal charges for the day. They really shouldn\u2019t have done that. My coworkers and I discussed the situation and all moved forward with the same approach. We never missed lunch again while on the road and we never spent less than $24.50 on dinner again - even if it was drive-through (and that was tough to do back then - but we did it). They dropped the ridiculous rules and started allowing any combination up to $45/day after a couple of years. \n\nThe problem with clerks/pencil-pushers is that they don\u2019t understand that when you fuck with people, some people fuck back\u2026.",

He was never less than fifteen minutes late, he lumbered like a zombie, and I caught him dozing off more than a few times during the first week on site.\n\nStill, he was the closest thing I had to a friend in Fort Wayne, so I invited him out to the bar on Friday for all the company-funded booze we could drink.\n\n\"I wish!\", he says. \"I'm going home and passing out until Monday, the commute has been killing me.\"\n\nWait, what?\n\nIt seems Dave's boss had been a dick, and, instead of paying for a plane ticket, hotel and rental car like my boss had, he'd instructed Dave to drive.\n\nFrom Chicago, almost three hours away.\n\n>Me: Dude.. That is like, totally no bueno. Six hours a day just driving?!?\n\n>Dave: Yeah, it sucks.\n\n>Me: Still, it'll be killer money. That puts you at what, like 70 hours this week? Jeez. Make sure you put in for your gas and tolls quick though, the last time I had to get reimbursed for expenses it took 'em over a month.\n\nI could see what little light Dave's eyes held fade.\n\n>Dave: They're not paying for any of that.\n\nHearing that I put in a call my boss, who was as puzzled as I was. If he'd worked for our division, he'd be paid for his drive time and expenses at least, and we were both pretty sure it was corporate edict and not something individual divisions could choose not to obey.\n\nUnfortunately, neither I nor my boss had any say in the matter and neither of us were familiar with Illinois or Indiana labor law, so all we could do was advise Dave to save his receipts for the IRS and complain to HR. \n\nOn Monday Dave was late again. After an hour I was worried and called his cell phone.\n\n>Dave: I just passed Portage, making pretty good time all things considered. I should be there in about two hours.\n\nDave sounded perfectly happy about it, so I figured he'd been required to stop into his office before heading out for some reason.\n\n>Me: Okay, Dave. I'll see you then.\n\nWhen Dave arrived a little after eleven, the first thing he did was take a 15 minute break. Long drive, I understood. There was still most of the day ahead of us, and after the break Dave finally got down to business booting up his computer.\n\nHe had barely logged in when he stood up and announced he was taking his lunch.\n\nOooookay. Something was going on, but I hadn't the foggiest idea what.\n\nAfter lunch Dave finally got around to some work, putting in a good twenty minutes reading email before stopping by to see me.\n\n>Dave: I'm gonna take my second 15 now, then I'm heading home.\n\n>Me: Uh, what?\n\n>Dave, grinning like a nut: Don't worry, I spoke to HR over the weekend.\n\nI didn't see Dave on Tuesday, his cellphone was going unanswered, and neither my boss or I had any luck finding out why. We didn't try hard; Not our zoo and not our monkey, after all. Ditto for Wednesday but whatever, he's probably just sick.\n\nAnd then on Thursday, I see Dave. Before work. At the hotel breakfast buffet.\n\n>Me: Dave! I was getting worried when you were no-show the last two days.\n\nDave laughed a little and after we'd piled our plates with bad scrambled eggs and burned sausage, told me a story.\n\nOn Monday the client had noticed him coming in late, doing no work, and leaving early and called our company to complain. Dave, in turn, was called into a disciplinary meeting with his boss and local HR who were prepared to terminate him over putting in for 32 hours of un-earned overtime the previous week and not working at all the day before.\n\nDave said they were serious, too. One of the guys from building security interrupted the meeting to deliver a box containing the personal effects from his desk.\n\nDave had an ace though. Well, three aces.\n\nAn email from his boss instructing him to drive to Fort Wayne every day at his own expense as a \"change in work location\"(1), an email from Corporate HR telling him he that while he wasn't required to work overtime, he was required to report any overtime worked, including driving to or from a client(2), and a page from his division's employee manual(3) which covered paid breaks off-site.\n\nHe then informed them that he was not working any more overtime and, after 3 hours driving in, 1.5 hours of breaks, and 3 hours home it left him with just a half an hour a day to do actual work. Less, actually, if the traffic was bad.\n\nOh, and that Corporate HR was willing to stand behind him on it. He'd just spoken to them before the meeting.\n\n>Dave: It took them about three seconds to realize they were screwed, and well, here I am, back in action. And, since everything was booked last minute, I'm in a suite with a Jacuzzi and my rental is a damn Cadillac!",

Best job I ever had. People were nice to me, I got to work on my tan, it payed pretty well, but most importantly, we were allowed to eat the delicious ice cream in our breaks.\n\nOne day, I'm serving a man and his son. The man orders a cone with two scoops for him and a cone with one scoop for the little one. The kid wasn't happy about that, and said to his dad that he also wanted two scoops. The dad explains that the scoops are pretty big and that one will suffice for him. I confirm this to help the Dad, even offering to make it extra big. Still, the kid doesn't budge, instead he starts throwing a tantrum, nearly crying how he wanted two scoops. The dad, clearly not wanting to ruin his vacation mood, gives up and says to the kid he can have two scoops. \"However\", he adds, \"if you can't finish your ice cream like I said you wouldn't, no more TV for you, for the rest of the vacation!\"  The kid happily agrees, claiming he could eat a whole tub of ice cream.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBig mistake kid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe, being the petty person that I am, wanted to teach this brat a lesson. I proceed by scooping one of the most gigantic scoops I've ever scooped in my entire scooping carreer. I put it on the cone, the kids eyes widen in shock. My scoop goes back for more, I see the kid tremble in disbelief. I scoop the second most gigantic scoop a scooper could scoop, and graciously add it to the first one. I hand the monstrosity I've created to the kid, who by now realises he won't watch tv again this summer. The dad seemed pretty cool with it, he even tipped me a little which was very rare. All in all a pretty good day.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Can't believe I got gold, thank you kind stranger!",

Especially when you both knew there was no way the child could win. That wasn't right or funny. The Dad needs parenting classes and sorry OP, but the better thing to do would be to give the child two smaller scoops he could finish. That way he'd get two scoops so it would feel fair to him. Being cruel doesn't teach children a lesson.",

            "As I read this it triggered my PTSD of working in a franchise kitchen where the manager was a portion control nazi. \n\nAbsolutely everything has to be weighed out and measured in mis en place then remeasured when serving to customer to ensure every single customer receives the same quantity and quality product no matter which X store they visit around the world. \n\nI can visualise the manager breathing down my neck (literally) as I scooped that big scooped, but he would carefully wait until I finished scooping the scoop to reprimand me and humiliate me in front of customer by weighing said scoop and if it were a nanogram too heavy above house policy then I would have to redo the induction course and retake a written test to ensure I understood what the company expected of me. \n\nYou crazy, wild scooper. Have you no respect for the rules of portion control?! Think of the cost savings, stocktake and KPI! You just wasted 4 whole grams of ice cream! \n\nImagine if ALL the scoopers in all six thousand world wide stores all scooped an extra 4 grams in each scoop they scooped. That\u2019s (I dunno) a shit load of ice cream wasted!\n\nThen a customer goes to a store in Dubai and gets an irregular portion of scoop and become unsatisfied with the portion of their scoop?!

The final leg of the flight departed from Paris, where I had this lovely interaction with the agents whom, despite me knowing are not TSA, I still refer to as TSA in my mind.  \nWhile going through security in the airport, I know the drill, belts off, jacket off, take the laptop off my bag. So I submit to the x-ray four trays: one with my carry on, one with my laptop by itself, one with my belt, watch and jacket, and one with my personal item (think a fanny pack).  \nI'm randomly selected for further screening (I have a lebanese last name and a beard. I'm ALWAYS randomly selected for further screening) and the agent berates me for putting all my electronics together. I point out that I took my laptop out of the bag, as per standard procedure, and the agent says (screaming at me, mind you) that that is not enough. I must take out EVERY electronic device from my carry on and put each of them in an individual tray, and I'm being sent to the back of the line to do so.\n\nHere comes the malicious compliance: there are two things this French-TSA Agent is unaware of: the first thing is that I'm a videographer by trade and I was in Europe to cover an event (SPIEL) with video footage and interviews. The second thing is that Air France changed my flight times so my 2 hours layover became a 10 hours layover, which I'm not particularly happy about.\n\nSo I'm being sent back to the end of the line and I have to submit each electronic item individually? Sure, no complaints from me. Two camera bodies, one drone, one gopro, four lenses, nine batteries and two lavalier microphones later, there is no more space in the treadmill. People behind me are complaining they will miss their flight, because I'm taking so long. There's nothing I can do, I'm just following the orders I received. And at this point, I only unpacked my photography vest and fanny pack. The treadmill starts moving, some space clears up to put additional trays, and that's when I open my carry-on bag. Again, I'm in Europe for work. I didn't bring any nice clothes or shoes or anything. All my personal effects are in the checked-in luggage. The carry-on is filled EXCLUSIVELY with electronics. I still have four microphones, two recorders, lights, additional lenses, battery chargers, video monitors, audio monitors, drone controllers. Once I open my carry on, it's very clear for everyone within eyesight that I'm not even 1/3 of the way done. One electronic per tray? Sure thing, I'll just occupy this entire checkpoint by myself, then.\n\nThe people behind me in line are literally jumping and screaming about their missed flight to the point the security agents leave their posts to control the line. Someone in a non-uniform suit appears, and talks to the agent who sent me to the back of the line. That's when the unthinkable happened: the agent comes to me and says there would be no need for me to continue separating my electronics, and I could just submit my entire carry-on bag as a single item and they'd examine it further if it seemed necessary. \"You sure?\" I asked \"Because it's no bother at all, I can keep unpacking here all day long\" They insist it's not necessary, but I still have over twenty trays at this point occupying the treadmill. I go through the metal detector, I spend some minutes recovering and repacking everything, and based on the amount of fuming passengers, I like to think I contributed to Charles de Gaulle reviewing their stance on x-raying individual electronics.",

            "Ah yes, this sounds familiar. I had a similar interaction, where I pulled out the laptop and tablet, then left the rest in the bag (like it works pretty much everywhere else). I was then told to re-do it, like you with \u2018everything in it\u2019s own tray\u2019. I ask them if that\u2019s truly what they want, considering I\u2019m carrying _a lot_ of electronics, and finally they relent that okay, for them, all passive items, like cables can be put in one tray, and anything with active functionality needs to be placed so that they do not overlap.\n\nI proceed with doing this, but unfortunately there\u2019s somebody now ahead of me, traveling through with an entire home theater audio setup in their carryon (???), so since they\u2019re having a hard time figuring out why somebody would do that, they chose them for random screening. This meant that I had to wait for my stuff to get screened. I stood there, waiting my turn (like you, I wasn\u2019t in a hurry), and after maybe 5 minutes of waiting or so, I was told to \u201cjust go somewhere else and wait, you can\u2019t stand here\u201d. I tried to tell the security guard that told me this that I\u2019m waiting for my items to be checked, and I was informed that no, It doesn\u2019t matter who or what I\u2019m waiting for, I\u2019m not allowed to stay there any longer, there are some seats nearby \u201cgo sit over there and wait, do not stay here any longer, if there is something needed from me they know where I am\u201d.\n\nThis was just when covid was starting, and I really needed to make my flight, so I didn\u2019t argue with the security personnel. In general, arguing with airport security doesn\u2019t improve your chances of a successful trip. I then went and sat at those seats, looking at my luggage, waiting for them to start checking it. The guy that was in front of me left after another 10 minutes, I thought excellent, now they\u2019ll check my stuff, and then I can continue my trip. They don\u2019t touch it for 10+ minutes, then I\u2019m starting to get a little pissed. I look to go over and security just looks at me like \u201cno\u201d. Eventually they start staring at the contents of the tray where my pockets were emptied to, and proceed to open my wallet and start pulling out cash and cards.\n\nAt this point, I go back, ask them wtf is going on, why they\u2019re stalling and if I can have my stuff back.\n\u201cWhere have you been?! You left your personal belongings here and we\u2019ve been trying to figure out who you are!\u201d We called out for you but you didn\u2019t come (note: I was sitting right there, seeing what\u2019s going on, and I didn\u2019t see anything like that, or hear my name being called).\nI ask them why they were going through my wallet, considering my boarding pass and passport were on the tray and visible and they say they didn\u2019t even touch my wallet. I note to the agent that I could see them open it and go through my different cards and bills. The agent does not take well to this and starts asking me what I think they stole. I didn\u2019t say anything about stealing, nor did I say I had any suspicion that they would do so, but she seemed to immediately think this and the whole interaction I had with her onward from this was just\u2026 not great.\n\u201cWell we wouldn\u2019t have to have done that unless you didn\u2019t abandon your stuff here!\u201d\n\nI calmly tell them that I was told to leave the area and wait elsewhere, and that I\u2019ve now been waiting for quite a long time and I\u2019d really like to have my things. \u201cYou did not put every piece of electronics in it\u2019s own tray, so they need to be checked manually, we will do that now\u201d. Now apparently, passive components like cables were considered something that had to be on it\u2019s own. I had a lot of them, that is why I asked if they\u2019re sure if they want that.\n\nI\u2019m pretty pissed at this point, but just calmly showing them each piece of my stuff that they want to see. This agent was some sort of supervisor, and they then after the check demanded that I tell them which of the security guards told me to go elsewhere, because this would probably result in disciplinary action. Unfortunately, the person that told me this didn\u2019t make any kind of lasting impression on me, so I told her that I do not remember. This did not make her any more relaxed.\n\nFuck CDG. I followed the signs and instructions to a T and they still proved their point about customer service.",

The group of 2 in front of me were pros, and had quite a lot more gear than I did. While we didn't have to put each individual item in a tray, we did have to separate the gear. Between the 3 of us, we spent 20 mins combined to get stuff through the xray. I have not had to do that before or after that trip through JFK, nor in any other NYC area airport, or any other airport.",

            "So satisfying! I would however not have gone back on it. If they insisted that every electronic item should have its own tray for security reasons, then every electronic item gets its own tray. No going back on security. Might as well not do the security check then!",

            "I had something like this happen to me too and I did the same thing. \n\nI was going home from Toronto and I had a laptop bag stuffed with laptops and electronic hardware, and a BIG Pelican case that had more electronic hardware. I tried to speed things up by putting the 6 laptops in 3 bins (2 laptops per bin.) And for the Pelican case, I just told the guy scanning it that I would unlock it for him to look in if he wanted, but I really didn't wanna have to unpack it to scan everything. \n\nI was told to take out anything electronic, so I opened the mess of equipment and started to just dump arm fulls of stuff into bins. After 3 bins filled up and no sign of slowing, they said they would just take the case and have a look. \n\nI replied \"okay\" and got 3 more bins for the stuff in my pockets, my jacket, steel toe boots. The eye roll was strong. \n\nTo be clear, I am white. But I traveled with a big trench coat and forgot my razor on that trip so I looked like a school shooter.",

            "Thanks OP for the share! This made me laugh so hard. I had a similar experience. \n\nMy mother must use a wheelchair if she has to walk a lot. Short shuffle isn't a problem but airports are quite ada unfriendedly. I took her to the airport after she braved the travel to come visit me. The airport was so understaffed (April this year) there was not enough wheelchair pusherers. Boarding pass people were kind and gave me permission and a gate pass to take her to the gate. \nWell I am lucky to have TSA precheck and it's been so long since I've flown without it. Holy moly are they abusive in the non precheck line. They made my mom who can't bend over, take off her shoes, took the chair wouldn't allow her cane and had her go in unassisted through the screening. I'm on the side with her bags still trying to make sure they get through the x-ray. Well the TSA lady was having a day and no amount of yes ma'ams were helping. \n\nI had pulled out all the normal things, her liquids and her electronics. However three times she brought my mom's bag back getting increasingly mad at me for not pulling out some other thing I didn't know about. A plant that was carefully packed, mom's medication bag, a tin of cat food(one muse return with cat treats or else), a packet with pens, some fudge, and so on. After the third go I looked the lady dead in the face and said ok I'm just going to unpack everything and proceeded to unpack every single item from my mom's bag and place it into multiple trays. A senior person caught on to what was going on and came over real quickly and said 'no no no that doesn't have to happen it's okay just bring all of your stuff to the end.' he grabbed up all the trays and took them to the end where they had parked my mom. Ma was furious but mostly because she was in pain. I don't understand why they make you remove so much stuff, x-ray technology is amazingly accurate.",
            "I applaud you for this. Bravo. The agent deserved it for screaming at you though you followed the rules",
            "The only thing that would complete this is if you had a gaming handheld. Seriously. In my experience with American actual TSA agents its like they were born from a lab and have zero knowledge of pop culture or ads. They never understand what a DS or switch is. Like \"for every electronic object larger than a phone, you need to put it in a tray on its own\"\n\nOkay. So for the DS/3DS do you mean folded or unfolded? Because they're phone sized folded, but bigger unfolded. And a Switch. Without joycons it's the size of a very large phone, and is certainly smaller than a tablet, which is what they're picturing as the next size category. What do you want me to do with that? Every agent I've ever asked just looked at me blankly. Are kids these days only entertained by tablets and in flight movies? \n\nA few times I've also been given instructions to take out all food and place it in a separate tray. I get the same blank look when I ask if my medications count, since you do ingest them and I assume they're looking for drugs. Jesus christ. Most meds need to keep kept in human safe temperatures and so have to be in carry ons. How is this not a normal occurrence.",
            "Having worked in airports I can tell you TSA people are selected on purpose to be dumb as rocks. They'll berate you for separating electronics, they'll berate you for NOT separating electronics, for putting your jacket in the same tray of your bag, or in a separate tray all together... The security theatre that makes us feel a little more safe, also makes them feel somewhat important and paladins of the skies.\n\nEdit. Typo",

So that\u2019s saying a lot. \n\nI travel to Italy about 5 years ago by way of Paris and it was the absolute worst experience ever. A large group of Americans had landed \ud83d\udeec trying to get on other flights. Apparently that day the security people at Charles Degaulle decided to have a work slow down. They forced other planes to be delayed and some planes \u2708\ufe0f actually didn\u2019t get all their passengers. Going through the line it was absolutely clear this was a conspiracy. Workers looked and looked at passports etc, quickly moved French citizens to another line and all acted as if they were stoned and moving in slow motion, inspecting everyone else. We weren\u2019t even going through any luggage as it was pre luggage pickup security. \n\nIt was seriously THE WORST and I will never fly into Charles De Gaul again even if I have to get off and take a train lol. To me not moving is the worst. At least I would get forward motion on a train.",

A few times we have had TSA/TSA-equivalent tell us we have to unload ALL electronics and been in a similar situation to yours, just not to that extreme! We also had an incident where the security in India tried to take our drone when we were leaving back to the States. They made us do the same thing with the electronics, but one of them tried to leave with our drone. They tried to say even having a drone was illegal (it wasn\u2019t, flying it without proper permissions was illegal, just having one is in no way illegal). My poor husband was terrified but I wasn\u2019t about to let someone take a $2000 electronic we had only had for 2 months!
