I have two mortgages with them, so it ends up being $84.00 a year that I pay for the privilege of paying them, which I find to be complete bullshit.\n\nSo I reverted to sending checks through my online bill pay with my bank. And despite the fact that I send them as two separate checks, with two different account numbers and two different property addresses in the memo field the mortgage company continues to apply both checks to one property.\n\nAnd every month they call me to tell me one of my mortgages is past due. And every month I explain the situation to the rep and he spends 30 minutes on the phone with me reapplying the funds to the correct properties, crediting the late fees back, noting the accounts, and ensuring it doesn\u2019t go on my credit report.\n\nSo instead of allowing your customers to use your portal - which I understand has costs for servers, maintenance, etc - and chalking it up to a cost of doing business, I will happily waste a half hour of yours every month to avoid your bullshit fucking fee.\n\nOn this most recent phone call the CSR suggested \u201cit\u2019s just $7.00 per month.

            "This is the fault of customers and their state regulators.  Utility companies are often a local monopoly because that is more efficient than having more than one set of pipes in the ground.  In exchange for the monopoly, the utility agrees to be regulated.  In some cases, a gas utility will have a profit cap like 11%.  No other business would agree to a cap on profits.  If a gas company collects excess profits, then the excess has to be returned to rate payers.    As soon as the rate case is decided and the utility gets their 11% profit, the next piece of pipe that goes in the ground will cut into the profits.  So the utilities do things like negotiate fees for maintenance or they work out the rates so all the profits are taken in the first units of gas burned or other schemes.   But one thing they are not allowed to ever do is benefit one ratepayer at the expense of another.  And if they allow one payer free online payments and charge the costs to their rates then that impacts another payer.  In addition, the state regulators are always trying to keep any cost from being passed on to the poor widows and orphans so this cost of processing cannot be part of the formula.  So you have to pay if you pick the online pay option. ",

We changed gears, canceled everything. The power was in our name for less than 24 hrs. We were sent a bill for $10 and change with fees and taxes and crap. We never set foot in that apartment. I called and told them about the situation, never signed the lease, blah blah blah. They said sorry you have to pay.

Boss reiterated that they disagreed, I ranted at boss a little, boss took it in stride and I ended with, \"going forward, I shall be a grumpy a$$hole like everyone else here.\" boss asked me not to do that, told me that they love that I am lively and vivacious. Also, despite the feedback, I got the promotion. (?!) Whatever, they screwed up the paperwork and now the promotion is in jeopardy due to a clerical error. Stupid is as stupid does.\n\nAnywho, this past week I had a meeting with the boss who had stipulated that the 'constructive feedback' be given. I went into the meeting as a stoic. Completely grey-rocked them. They nearly lost their temper. I gave one word answers and was completely unemotional. The big boss complimented me twice - you are my best writer, you are my best (job title). I just stared straight ahead. Meeting ended with them saying, \"I have to think about this meeting.\" I said, \"ok.\" and walked out.\n\nI also act my wage every day. I don't take on additional work, I simply say, \"I'm sorry, I don't feel comfortable taking that on. Perhaps one of the more seasoned professionals on the team can handle that for you...\"\n\nUnemployment here is below 4%. I can walk out the door and double or even triple my income. I no longer take any shit.",

            "Reading all the comments have brought up a memory from December 1977.  I was working in the furniture service department of a warehouse.  My boss had quit three months earlier and the management higher up the food chain gave the job title and pay to two beer-drinking ASS-CLOWNS who NEVER set foot in my department.  Guess who was actually DOING the job of my former boss?  Me!\n\nThen one day, all HELL broke loose!  The other secretary to the beer drinkers went out with a broken ankle.  One of the beer drinkers went out for surgery that was never talked about.  The remaining beer drinker wanted to stay in his office, sitting on his ass, and drink beer all day so he demanded that I leave my department to take care of his job FOR him!  I told him NO because I am BUSY doing MY job PLUS the job of my former boss!  A little while later, one of the warehouse guys comes to my department with the same request from the beer drinker.  I told that guy to tell beer drinker that my answer has NOT changed and that I am BUSY!  The warehouse guy replied:  \"I can't do that.\"  Me:  \"Why not?\"  Warehouse guy:  \"He's on the way to the hospital.  Says he's having a heart attack.\"  Me:  \"SHIT!\"\n\nThat entire day, I had to run from one end of the warehouse to the other, checking on incoming repairs, outgoing deliveries, etc.  Somehow, some way, I managed to keep everything on track.  At the end of the day, the managers up the food chain show up, praise me for my work, and tell me that all of this will be my new responsibilities.  I ask:  \"That includes the job title and pay?\"  \"Managers:  \"We can't do that.  You're only a woman.\"  By this point, I already had a better job lined up with a college so I didn't hesitate with my response:  \"Take this job and SHOVE IT!\"  KARMA got them all shortly after I left!",

You're doing it wrong if you learn how to do a job then get promoted into it.\n- If you did all this extra stuff before, people should have been aware of it before your boss gets to tell HR how he wants thing to go. \n- You feel that they don't properly value your contribution, but the way you went about it means nobody is really happy.

Minimum wage, no benefits until you became a permanent employee after 9 months. Management changed, new site manager seemed to think she'd look good by \"saving money\".  Gradually other employees left for whatever reasons, and the work fell on us. That is, in addition to our already full-time jobs, we were:  \ntaking the load of:  \na 3rd tour guide  \n2 part-time children's program workers  \nsecretary  \nlibrarian  \naccessionist  \n1 janitor  \nSo the only other employees were the 2 managers, 1 janitor and security guard.  \nI asked a friend at HQ when we would get help - she said \"No hiring as you are doing so well with what you have\". We did not have enough people to do the emergency situation protocol!   \nWhen you got close to the 9 months, they put you on a 2-week \"service break\" (laid off) and re-hired you 2 weeks later, thus keeping you on a temporary basis. I had been through that once.  \nIn November, my friend got hit with \"service break\" and I quit. Then she could not return to work as she no longer had a ride to work. Note that December was a big month with an additional building open, special exhibits, candle-light tours etc. But WE were not there!   \n\n\nThey pulled in some volunteers from the local historical society, limped through December, and CLOSED FOR 3 MONTHS!",

So, he did what he thought was his best play, which was to have ME fired instead.\n\nExcept I was the one doing all the scheduling, turning his reports in to corporate, and all that other Big Boss Stuff.

            "I feel your pain. I started on a paint crew last year, was laid off for the winter, but have sense learned a lot since then. I fell into a leadership role naturally - so I basically train them, focus on quality control, answer a million questions a day allowing my pace to grid to a halt, as well as my regular work duties. I've never gotten a raise, and given nothing but excuses why I don't deserve one(which I find to be unfounded). I take pride in my work. A couple weeks ago it came to a head. Was working in 95 degree heat, on a roof, with a brand new worker that doesn't know what he's doing(he doesn't listen very well, and he's 18 so distracted on his phone a lot. I've since told him to stop and told my boss he could easily hurt himself, but he's cheap so he doesn't give a shit). Worked 12 hour days to finish as requested. Come to find out it because he wanted to get paid for the job so he can take a week long vacation. I was livid. Put my body through that for absolutely nothing. So I started my own LLC. I don't get paid enough for that shit. Once I get my business license I will give him 0 notice. And have been daydreaming about quitting and telling him he lost his best worker and leader. Although id bet my paycheck he could care less. I understand it's my fault for not expressing clearly I need to be paid for the extra duties, but at this point, he could give me a 10 dollar raise and I could care less. Because I will double my income and work at my own pace, and not do other people's jobs for them. It will be all on me if I am to succeed. Good on you for taking a stand. Employers have no problem taking advtange of you if you let them, and I will NEVER do that to my employees if I ever have them.",

            "I got the management position after working my ass off  being the floater and coming in to save the day in any position that needed it and still got canned. I worked in computer/electronics refurbishment and recycling. Corporate wanted to start a new department in our facility dedicated to refurbishment that was currently being outsourced to another facility in order to save on shipping to that facility in another state. I was the best candidate for this position as it was my specialty and had 12 years of experience in the field working for a company they bought out. They doubled my pay and basically told me what they wanted and then pretty much left me to figure everything out on my own. I also found out that everybody in corporate expected the department to fail as our facility only received items from Florida alone and the other much larger facilities across the country received from multiple states. But to everyone's surprise I started turning a profit within weeks and with only a couple of employees I hired. Fast forward a year later and I had 22 employees working under me and was now coming just under or beating the 2nd most profitable facility and they had twice the employees and twice the intake of product. I had the place running like a top and therefore I was barely doing anything at all most days and would only be on the floor when there was an issue or the techs came across something highly valuable that they couldn't fix and call me out to give it a go before it was scrapped. I probably paid for my own salary just in fixing items that would have been scrapped had I not been there. One example was about 30 broken high end sony 4k camcorders we received from the military. Every one was broken and would have just gone to scrap as almost nobody knows how to repair cameras, let alone a 3k dollar when new sony 4k camcorder. However I took those 30 camcorders apart on my desk and learned. I made 20 fully working units over the course of a couple of weeks. We sold them on ebay and made almost $20k off what would have been a few dollars in scrap money. Fast forward another year and they fire me because I arrive 15 minutes late every day (I had a team leader that opened up every day and I was there almost an hour after close every day inputting daily production numbers) And that they barely ever see me out on the floor through the cameras... They replaced me with a tech from a different facility that they paid to move down here and only had 2 years of basic desktop computer repair experience. Almost all of my employees (who were certified computer techs or self taught techs) quit shortly after and said he basically knew nothing and they were training him on how to do my job. \nI can see online what they are selling out of my facility and it's a tiny fraction of what I was putting out. They also said on the call with HR when firing me that I just wasn't a good fit for the company and the direction they want to grow as a company. I guess the direction was less profit and inexperienced employees. For reference I was only making 55k a year and sales totals for the year out of my department was over 3 million.\nI work in a different field now as my experience was very niche and could not find a job as a repair tech in my area without a college degree needed. But I'm much happier now without all the stress of being in management.",

When you purchase something from them, and for any reason want to return the item, their policy is that they never give money back. They only give you a voucher redeemable same day only.\n\nI went to the store today and purchased quite a long list of items. I got home, my wife looks at them and says that we don't need some of them. \n\nI go back to the store, barely 20 minutes pass. The returns manager smiles at me as I tell her I'd just purchased these and would like to return them. She tells me that I stepped out of the store so she can't refund. Only give me a voucher and I must buy something else.\n\nI'd already bought everything I needed. Then she tells me to take the products home and keep them for the next time I would need to buy something, then I can come and get the voucher and redeem it. Imagine keeping a pair of shoes and a bowl and remember to bring them with you the next time you happen to need something.\n\nI tried to reason, but she was adamant: 'Those are the rules. You stepped out of the store, you don't get a refund.'\n\nAnd then it clicked. I asked 'so if someone wants to return an item without leaving the store, they get the money back?'. 'Yes'. \n\nYou see where this is heading. Malicious compliance kicking in.\n\nI ask to return the items and get the voucher. I take the voucher, get inside the store, find a product to exactly same amount. Buy it with the voucher. Right after the cashier, there's the returns manager. Straight from the cashier I go to her. Hand her that random product I'd just bought and say 'I would like to return this, I don't want it. And I never left the store'.\n\nShe is looking at me with barely contained rage in her eyes, I kid you not.  The awkward pause was getting longer. And then her manager comes along. Looks at us and I smile at him and say 'I never left the store and I would like to get a refund for this please'. He nods. Silent and not looking at me, she proceeds to refund me the money in cash.\n\nCompany policy, right?",

            "This reminds me of when I worked at a convenience store. A guy came in and bought a six pack of beer, they were glass bottles, goes out and runs into a buddy he stops to chat with in the parking lot. About twenty minutes later I step out for break and see the guy finishing up with his friend, and he goes to put the six pack in a cooler in his trunk, then promptly drops it on the concrete, smashing the bottles. Guy comes back in the store and wants me to just give him another six pack because he dropped his. I was like dude, no. His argument was that he was still on our property, so it was my responsibility. I told him if it had happened on his way out the door I probably would have went along with it and let him get another six pack, but not in the parking lot half an hour later.",

            "Something kind of similar happened to me recently.\n\nI was working 120miles from home, as an electrician rewiring and remodeling a house after flood damage.  So I was driving down Monday morning, staying Monday and Tuesday night. Drive home Wednesday night, drive down Thursday morning, drive home Friday night.  It sucked, but there were no hotels in the area cheaper than $300 per night, which was not feesible.\n\nWell after a while everything is blurring together and in some random town halway to the job I needed to get gas, drinks, food, and vape pods.\n\nI ask specifically for the quantity and strength, 5%.\n\nCashier confirms. Shows me the box, which she has 2 in her hand. Confirms again and confirms I only want 1 package. At almost $30 after tax.\n\nSo I check out, and she puts everything into a bag, after I say I didn't want one but whatever.\n\nI walk the 75ft to my van, at the pump. Open the bag. And there is a package for 2.4% I stead of 5.\n\nSo I go back inside, have to stand in line for 20minutes. Get to the register. Explain they gave me the wrong package.\n\nAnd they say they cannot exchange any tobacco or vape products. Which I can kind of understand. Like if someone tries returning them a week later that's kinda suspect.\n\nBut I was literally outside of the store for 30 seconds. The cashier confirmed what I wanted 3 times. Showed me the correct product. And put the wrong one in the bag.\n\nHardly anything I could have done to avoid the situation except for dumping the bag out on the counter as soon as I paid with like 15 people in line.\n\nSo cashier refuses. And begrudgingly gets a manager. The manager refuses because according to the receipt it's been almost 30 minutes.  No shit. After 20 minutes in line and 5 minutes going back and forth with the cashier and waiting on the manager. Yeah I wasted a lot of time.\n\nManager still refused to refund saying I left the store. It's my responsibility to ask for the right items, etc etc etc.\n\nOnly after I told them I will just dispute the charge. Did they finally go through the hassle of just giving me the item I asked for and was shown, and put the wrong item back,. Which was on the wrong shelf in the first place.\n\nBut nothing like dealing with a 40 minute stop at the gas station, in the middle of a 3 hour 30 minute commute.

            "Honestly, you made the mistake here and made everyone's life difficult by buying all the shit your wife didn't allow you to buy.

            "This.\n\nI barely do any physical shopping anymore, because the EU rules regarding online shopping are much more consumer-friendly than going to an actual, physical store.\n\nUnder EU-rules, when you shop online you have a 14-day right of withdrawal/cancellation. That right simply means the online store must place you in the same situation as if you had simply tried/looked at the items in a physical store and then left without ever buying those items.\n\nThis 14 day right of cancellation establishes a legal reality where the contract/sale never happened in the first place. Therefore, online stores are **required** to refund you - **money, not vouchers**. And not only for the items themselves, but also the original shipping costs.\n\nAs opposed to physical stores where they are not even required to take back the items, even refund you, except in cases of wrong charges or damaged items. If a store accepts returns and refunds, they do so voluntarily. Nothing requires them to do so except in obvious cases of wrong charges and damaged items, etc.\n\nIf a physical store does accept to take back online orders, then they are **required** to refund you items and shipping costs in actual money - not vouchers - within the first 14 days.",
            "I can only incentivize people to dispute payments when stores disrespect their customers by refusing to refund, or only refunding to a voucher. Treat these customer unfriendly places the same way as they are treating you. When a store treats its customers unfriendlily, I find more often than not that the store is also breaking one or more consumer laws or Mastercard/Visa policies, because these stores will do anything to grab as much money as possible, even if it is illegal. I often experience it when I am in touristy places where they know foreigners have very little influence, even if they complain to the national Ombudsman or Chamber of Commerce.\n\nI am not saying it is illegal to refund to vouchers or even refuse to refund the customer, but sometimes this is the case. It is often quite easy to dispute these charges with reference to these laws/policies at your bank. Even if you don't win the dispute, the store pays a dispute fee to the card processors on top of the time they need to spend to argue their case. A dispute can easily cost them more than it would have cost to simply refund the items. Treat these customer unfriendly places the same way as they are treating you.\n\nI tried this in a Nike Partner Store in Barcelona: The lines to the fitting rooms were insanely long so I bought some items to try them back at my hotel just a few streets down. I was happy with all items except one, which was the wrong size. I went back to replace it, but they did not have it in one size larger and therefore wanted to return it. The angry cashier lady told me, really rudely by the way, that it was store policy to only refund as vouchers. It was almost \u20ac100 so I was quite mad about it, too, as I do not live in Barcelona, and therefore it was basically \u20ac100 out the window, as the voucher was only valid for that particular \"partner\" store, and could not be redeemed at other Nike stores nor online. The cashier then found a hidden store terms and conditions sheet she had hidden behind her counter and showed me what it said (only in Spanish and Catalan, which I do not speak). Then she hid the terms sheet again. I took at picture of the entire counter from my perspective, pointing out that the store terms and services are required to be placed visibly at the point of sale so the customer knows before committing to the purchase. And, needless to say, within the EU those store policies must be displayed in a number of languages, too.\n\nWell, I complained a lot, but in a friendly and constructive way. I complained in writing to the store manager, to Nike about this particular partner store's consumer unfriendly practices, and I complained to the Barcelona Chamber of Commerce about this illegal practice - EU stores (online and offline) are required to display terms and conditions at every counter - visibly - and in at least English and the national language(s) of that country.\n\nI then just raised a dispute with Mastercard through my bank, pointing out that under not only EU rules, but also under Mastercard Guidelines, a store is requires to visibly display the store terms at every counter and in at least a number of languages. I attached a photo of the angry cashier lady with no terms and conditions showing visibly at her counter.\n\nOf course I got all my money back from Mastercard.",

        "selftext": "I'm not sure if this belongs in Petty Revenge or Malicious compliance for there's a little of both - so sorry if this has been put in the wrong place.  Either way I've enjoyed my malicious revenge/compliance so I hope you do.\n\nFor the past few years our business has been receiving telemarketing calls from an offshore call center trying to make appointments for \"Optus Business Centre\".   Every time they call, we'd politely tell them we were not interested and to remove us from their list and they'd promise not to call again.\n\nYou can probably tell by my use of the words \"every time\" that having ourselves removed from the list didn't work.  It didn't work the first time, and it didn't work the 50th time.    Offshore are cheap, and get paid per appointment.   So they would get quite aggressive.   It was clear that a new strategy needed to be found as it was taking too long to get them to bugger off.\n\nSo began my campaign of malicious compliance/petty revenge...\n\n*\"Hi we're calling from Optus business centre and we can save you 40% on your mobile phone bill!  Can we come and see you tomorrow at 11am?\"*\n\nYou can save me 40% of my mobile bill?  That's like sixty Grand a month!\n\n\"*What? How many phones do you have?\"*\n\n150 or so that I'm responsible for directly, plus a few others..\n\nThe appointment is quickly confirmed.    The next day a salesman calls me up he's running early - can we meet earlier.  I refused.  Our appointment is for 11am after all.\n\n11am rolls around and in he walks - we sit down in reception and go through the greetings.  I then ask him if it's possible to make the telemarketing calls stop now.    He assures me that it is, and so I stand up, shake his hand and thank him for coming in.\n\n*What? That's it?  You could have said that over the phone!*\n\nI point out that we did. Many times, and it didn't work - and I hoped that this waste of his time  (45 min trip from Homebush to Sydney) would perhaps teach him to mend his ways.\n\nOver the past 2 years they have sent out 5 different reps to see us.    They call for meetings - we accept them, shine them on about the value of the account and they roll in to be greeted by me dressed in a chicken suit;   made to wait in our meeting room for 20 minutes before being asked to be removed from the list; being turned away at the door (they sent two reps that time).\n\nI'm posting this today because it was visit number 6 and it was the best yet.    We got a repeat customer!   I sat him down in the meeting room and played the video recording of our last meeting :)\n\nIs that you ?\n\n*Yes! It's me!  Didn't I follow up ?   Did we have a good Meeting?*\n\nI point out that I certainly enjoyed our last meeting, and zoomed forward in the video to the part where I explained that we didn't have 500 mobile accounts - and he needed to please remove us from their list and you could see his heart break.   Which it did again, once he realised that whatever account he thought was being discussed today was not going to be discussed.    Which we also have on video, so we can go all inception if/when he shows his face again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:  [https://pasteboard.co/ICnJFPn.jpg](https://pasteboard.co/ICnJFPn.jpg)  Here's me in the chicken suit prepping for the meeting apparently hugged to death, try this:  [https://imgur.com/kKsHycQ](https://imgur.com/kKsHycQ)\n\nEdit2: Yes, it's a duck costume not a chicken suit. But we've called it the chicken suit in our office for years now, so forgive the fowl language error.",

This is a story of how a busy body boss thought they understood everything since they were in charge. At the work we were given two 15 minute breaks and one 45 minute lunch break. The breaks were scheduled into our day so you could see when they would be, but this would change day by day. \n\nMy role was a bit different than the normal agents as I was specifically dealing with the higher issue calls. These calls could take up to 1 hour to complete and the caller would need to stay on the line, unless they were fine with a call back later but this was rarely the case.\n\nSince I never knew when I would be getting these calls, my break times were a shot in the dark if I would or wouldn't be on a call. I would just take them as soon as the call was done if they ever intersected, which they did 99% of the time.\n\nEnter my boss. During a performance review I hit all the marks except for \"Attendance\". I asked about this as I know I missed a few days but always with a reasonable update for time frame and never had a no show day (where there is no warning that I'm not coming in). My boss stated that attendance also applies to break and lunch times and since I rarely took them at the requested time, I was getting written up. I explained my role, that they hired me for, and the challenges involved. They did not care and stated I needed to take breaks when I was told to. I asked for them to send me an email so that I could print it out, put it on my desk and never forget again. My boss smiled ear to ear, probably because they thought i was groveling at that point, and sure enough they did stating in the email \"You must take the your breaks only when the schedule tells you to, no time else. There is no excuse.\"\nI saved it, printed it out, sent a copy to my own email and followed it to the letter. Next call that happened that same day of course, had the long call crossing over with a break issue. I asked the customer if it would be ok for a call back, they said no, I stated that unfortunately I cannot stay on the line as I am required to take my break. They became enraged and demanded to speak with my boss. I told my boss, they said that I need to apologize and finish the call. I showed them the email they just sent to me and said \"you told me to take my break at this time no matter what. I'm just doing what you told me to do. I'm taking my break, would you like the customer transferred over? Or should I just hang up?\" They took the call over and from that day on I never had a missed attendance mark.\nGod busy body bosses are the worse.",

Boss told me that whenever I finished shelving the palette I could take a break (He had to let me into the break room so the on-shift manager decides when you take your break so not everybody does at the same time). And then however, he proceeds to give me (a 168cm, 50kg girl) the literal heaviest and most difficult palette to stock: drinks. I was almost falling off my little stool so I could reach the top more times I could count, almost fainting because I wasn't allowed to take a single break (not even to drink/go to the toilet, and yes that's illegal but they didn't care, they did waaaay worse) and was starving. And because I was also the back-up cashier, I finished it up when my shift (6.5 hours) ended, without ever taking any break. \n\nYea I quit as soon as I could and no I didn't tell my boss beforehand even though he asked for it. And so did almost every kid that worked the job for a little pocket money.

            "I work in a call center environment and although they place a lot of importance on adhering to schedules, there's also an integrated tolerances.   The \"if not\" mechanism is just sending an e-mail with a brief, precise, although relatively large in sense explanation\u2013\u2013 e.g. \"call before break lasted an hour\" when the average is 8-15 minutes.  This is expected for deviations larger than the break itself.\n\nThe great equalizing comment whenever we train a new class is how, in a site with over 200 employees, 98% of them somehow manage to get off the phones within 3 minutes of the shift being done.  Sounds like a coincidence, but seeing it happen daily would mean otherwise.  We're given a bit more freedom in our call handling than OP, I assume, but it basically boils down to planning where possible to extend calls that could otherwise be completed sooner to prevent taking a fresh/new call within minutes of a break/end of shift.  Similarly, if you take breaks late because call run long, you're allowed to take breaks early if they run short (again, within a tolerance of about 1/3 of the break duration, so 5 minutes early for 15 minute breaks).  Surprisingly, our call site average for adherence is usually in the mid 90s, which is exactly what it's planned/scheduled for.  Likewise, specialty positions are just given a rough expectation of a schedule, but are otherwise held to the bar of \"did you take the number of breaks you were scheduled for?\"",

        "selftext": "Story happened a couple of years ago, but it's my favorite lawyer story and I hope you enjoy (none of the following is legal advice, don't take legal advice from randos on the internet). TL:DR - client gets to plant sunflowers.\n\nClient walks into the office and asks us for a contract review. He then hands over an HOA contract. Before slogging through a whole HOA contract, I asked him what he was hoping to accomplish.\n\n\"They want me to dig up my sunflowers.\"\n\n\"Your... sunflowers?\"\n\n\"Yes, I planted a row of sunflowers outside my house. They pranced by and said that sunflowers are not allowed per the contract I signed. So I want you to tell me if that is true or not.\"\n\n\"Sir, before anything else I need to tell you that this will likely be an hourly fee bill. HOAs are notorious for dragging things out. So these could quickly become expensive sunflowers.\"\n\n\"I don't care. This is America and I should be able to plant sunflowers god dammit.\"\n\nStill thinking he wasn't *that* serious about sunflowers, I asked for a three hour retainer. He immediately pulled out a checkbook and paid for four hours. So I buckled down to review the alleged anti-sunflower clause. \n\nJust for reference, the sunflowers he wanted to plant were really big (5ft) and all along the front of the house. It was a very substantial amount of sunflowers.\n\nThe contract did indeed contain a clause, with a *very* thorough list, on which plants were and were not allowed to be planted. The list had just about every plant I could think of, in alphabetical order (think *apple, banana, cauliflower, dill...*). Sunflowers included. Corn was not included, which becomes very important later.\n\nQuick legal point - if you write 'no dogs allowed' it is normally assumed that you are talking about all dogs generally. If you write 'no labs, golden retrievers, or poodles allowed' it is normally assumed that all other dogs are allowed. Sometimes a *not great* attorney will write a super long list to pad hours (read: charge more) instead of just writing 'no plants without prior approval' or something.\n\nI called the client back in for the bad news. In explaining the above legal point, I let him know that the HOA got a raw deal from whoever drafted the contract. \n\n\"No can do on the sunflowers. But if it makes you feel any better they were probably over billed by whoever wrote this contract. Pretty shoddy work too, they even forgot to write down 'corn' but they included nonsense like 'dragon fruit'.\"\n\n\"So yes to corn, no to sunflowers?\"\n\n\"I didn't really check the contract for corn. But its not prohibited in the plant section, so probably?\"\n\n\"Excellent. That'll work.\"\n\nI thought he was oddly happy with bad news. Then two or three weeks later he came in with a picture of his house, surrounded by huge sunflowers.\n\nWhat happened? This guy drove out to the country and bought obnoxiously large and ugly cornstalks. He promptly planted them where the sunflowers had been. When confronted by the HOA he told them (paraphrasing) to suck it the contract lets me plant corn. Then after some negotiation he agreed to take the corn down, in exchange for permission to plant sunflowers.\n\nNow we are friends, he is still a great client, and he lives surrounded by a ridiculous moat of sunflowers.",

            "I planned something similar for my HOA but then learned it was actually one of the good ones that\u2019s laid back and is only there to make sure no one keeps a junkyard in their yard for example.\n\nI was having a hot tub put in and the rules said I had to have a living fence around it, ok not unreasonable.  Heard from a neighbor a story about problems getting a project of his approved so I was concerned.  Did some research and learned they had defined \u201cfence\u201d in the rules as an \u201cenclosed structure \u201c.  Only 3-4K\u2019 tall fences are allowed , 6\u2019 are not but the county does allow that.  So I was very prepared to install random 6\u2019 tall fencing panels in a manner to look as ugly as possible without creating an enclosure and therefore not meet the definition of a fence by the HOA.  Luckily it turned out they approved my project plans without issue, and made a couple suggestions that I had not thought of that I liked so it was a non issue.",

            "> If you write 'no dogs allowed' it is normally assumed that you are talking about all dogs generally. If you write 'no labs, golden retrievers, or poodles allowed' it is normally assumed that all other dogs are allowed. Sometimes a not great attorney will write a super long list to pad hours (read: charge more) instead of just writing 'no plants without prior approval' or something.\n\nThe reason to write \"no dogs\" is to include all dogs. The reason to itemize is to avoid arguments that a particular type of animal is not considered a \"dog\" for the purpose of the contract.\n\nA good lawyer does both:\n\n> No dogs, including (without limitation): airedales, akitas, ... and mixed breeds thereof...\n\n\"Without limitation\" means that the listed items are only examples within the scope of the term. They do not define the term, and the absence of any item does not indicate that it is excluded.\n\nAn extensive list indicates that the term is meant to be broadly defined, and is not limited to \"purebred dogs\" or \"breeds existing at the time of the contract,\" etc. And generating an extensive list doesn't require an hour of brainstorming - there's this thing called the \"internet.\" Google the term \"dog\" and scrape the webpage. Done.\n\nWe call this the \"belt-and-suspenders\" approach, and it often makes the contract easier to understand and less easy to circumvent - as in your story, for example (without limitation).",

            "My neighborhood doesn't have an HOA. We do have CC&Rs but, without the HOA, they really aren't enforceable. The other day, it occurred to me that, it might be a good idea to investigate establishing an HOA.\n\nBut not just any HOA because I think HOAs are a terrible idea. The main purpose of my HOA would be to make sure that no one else can establish an HOA.\n\nMy HOA would have dues - probably $1 / month. Or you could pay annually and get a discount - say $10 / year.\n\nMy HOA would have fines for violations of the CC&Rs and non-payment of dues - $0.25 per month that the violation goes un-remedied or the dues go unpaid.\n\nIn order to be implemented, my HOA would require an 80% majority of the residents to approve it in a vote. The main reason for this is that, then a clause of my HOA would be that it requires an 80% majority to abolish the HOA or amend the HOA rules.\n\nMy HOA would limit any increases in the HOA dues to $1 / month each year. So, if someone can get 80% of residents to agree to increase dues, then they can go up by $1 / month. But then another increase cannot be proposed for a year. Also any monthly dues increases would have to be subject to the same percentage discount offered for annual payment.\n\nI'm trying to think of other rules and benefits my HOA would impose but mostly it's just to keep anyone from putting a different HOA in place. I think my HOA would be very popular.",

Now if you excuse me, there\u2019s a pint of Kane Head High (my favorite beer) waiting for me around the corner.\u201d\u00a0 I walked out and joined my friends for a fun night.\u00a0 Now I must admit I feel bad for the bartender who usually worked Thursday nights.\u00a0 She had no part in the decision and her tips suffered because of our move.\u00a0 But that\u2019s on management, not me.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After a few weeks the owner noticed the dip in sales on Thursday nights and said we were allowed to drink at our bar again.\u00a0 However the damage was done.\u00a0 We found out that not only did the bar around the corner have all the beers we usually drink, they were much cheaper.\u00a0 We also struck up a great friendship with the bartenders.\u00a0 We found our new hang out spot.\u00a0 There was no reason to go back.\u00a0 Oh well.",

            "I had the same situation at a restaurant I worked at. After the restaurant closed a great many of the servers would head to the bar area to drink {full price for everything}, feed the jukebox, dance and generally have a good time. Some workers would even come in on their nights off to socialize. Well, the owners thought this was low class or something and forbid any server from being in the bar at any time. So we all stopped and found another place to hang out.\n\nA few weeks later management said we needed to stop this \"silly boycott\" and start spending time at the bar. You see a great many of the bar's patrons enjoyed the \"afterhours\" ambience and stayed to drink and dance with the servers. No servers, no need to spend money at the bar so they also left. The boycott remained in place. The restaurant and bar closed down a few months later.",

            "Reminds me of a story. I worked at a bar in my hometown of about 30k people. There were about 6 or so bars downtown near each other and we as bar staff made it a habit of visiting other bars and support the nightlife. \n\nThe bar owners all knew each other too, and would stop by and visit. \n\nA new bar was opening up and my boss decided to stop in and say hi to the new owner. The guy was from out of town (like 20 minutes away) and so was his staff and he really spiffed up the place, which was cool. \n\nAnyway by boss introduces himself to the new guy and buys a beer. New guy charges him. A minor breech of bar owner etiquette ( generally you return the favor when they visit your bar) but no biggie. \n\nThen this guy starts making fun of my boss, calling him an old man and saying his bar was a shithole. To be fair he wasn\u2019t wrong. It was a dive bar but a really popular and fun place. The guy continues to make fun and even gets the other bartenders to join in. Dick move. Also the wrong move. \n\nBoss comes back and is laughing, telling me and the other bartenders what happened.\n\nWord of mouth spread, and other bar owners had similar experiences with this douche and his staff/posse. \n\nNobody went in the bar. The only people that went there were the ones who were banned from every other bar in town. This was not the clientele he was looking for. Drunks, drug dealers, and basic trouble makers were the regulars.   Remember that this place was brand new inside. I was personally kicked out for telling the owner ( yes, I went in simply to be smug) that he screwed up alienating his peers. I wasn\u2019t the only one. Many people let him know that he screwed up. \n\nHe lasted 3 months and sold it to another out of towner who was more interested in the city and the people who live there. It was a success and fit in with the town. He also stopped by my bar ( and others) regularly to say hi.",

            "So as a student I set-up a society that quickly had over 100 members. We met at a pub on a Tuesday night, which was usually pretty empty apart from us. The first night we met we had about 80 people there all struggling to squish in to the largest area. After that our numbers only went over 20 if we had a trip or event coming up and people needed to pay & get the details, for our weekly socials it was just the core few, but we never dipped below 10. We easily doubled the number of patrons in the pub every week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen one week the owner complained that most of us only drink soft drinks. He wanted us drinking alcohol because then we'd drink more? Because apparently students drinking in moderation isn't a thing. We couldn't meet there any more unless we drank more. I said OK, and a couple of us went to a pub around the corner to ask if we could meet in a large alcove in their pub. It did mean the weeks where we had people coming in to pay for trips we spilled out into other areas so it was harder to just do one big announcement with information, but it didn't affect us otherwise. And they had a quiz on a Tuesday we started joining so got vouchers for food sometimes.",

            "Being allowed to drink at your own bar is a double-edged sword. As a bar regular for many years, these are the things I've seen:\n\n\\-Patrons want to befriend and include the staff as much as possible. It's fun, some of my longest and closest friendships have been bartenders. Most of the time it's not an issue. Good regulars tip well and help discourage bad behavior in a bar. We're all there to relax and have a good time. Bad regulars want everything for free and tip poorly. Bad bartenders give away the bar for free in hopes of making bigger tips, which encourages bad regulars.\n\n\\-Sometimes staff drinking at their place of employment can be bad because the staff can be highly inappropriate when off duty. I've noticed five types of bartenders while partying: the one who doesn't drink at all but is still fun to be around, the one who drinks to oblivion when they do drink (like can barely walk to the Uber drunk), the casual drinker who is genuinely a lot of fun and has no problems, the one with a serious drinking problem (eventually does quit the bar, drinking or gets fired for being drunk on-shift), and the one who is an angry drunk and unleashes their gripes with patrons when drinking (usually has a large substance abuse problem). Three of these five are usually intermingled, progressive, and a huge liability to a bar.\n\nBut, as OP states, the ones that can hang usually have a huge group of friends they've made at the bar and outside in other social circles that will become regular. Restricting should be based individually behind close doors with the employee and the management.",

            "Maybe I'm just unlucky, but I've never met someone in charge of quite a lot who hasn't in some way felt like the dumbest idea they ever came up with was brilliant, just because they came up with it. Especially that thing about \"making your presence known\". I've seen middle managers with less education and experience than some of our floor guys and previous jobs come in and just to 'shake things up' fire or transfer the entire crew and start fresh. And weirdly, those middle managers never feel like their responsible for the loss in profit, productivity, or performance for these changes.\n\nAnyone with the mindset \"I need to make some serious changes so people know to respect me\" feels that way because it's impossible for them to earn respect any other way.",

Any place I\u2019ve known that has had this rule only had the stipulation that you couldn\u2019t drink in your work clothes, like anything that might tell other patrons you worked at the establishment. That part always made sense to me, you wouldn\u2019t want to give customers the impression you were allowed to drink while you were working.  None of my friends who served/bartender ever had this issue. I met quite a few at several different places for years. Only thing they ever really had to do was change a shirt, or take off a hat maybe. Maybe I\u2019m a little more forgiving too, seems like the owner made a rash decision, who knows why. Maybe he had had a complaint about employees drinking, wether it was an actual issue or not, likely maybe not.

AOL chatrooms were huge at the time, and people from my city's chat room would gather at the bar I'm working at to hang out IRL. We did the same at another guy's bar when he did karaoke on Saturdays. Anyway, one day the owner pulled me aside and said he's paying me to DJ, not to socialize with my friends and doesn't want them hanging out. So I inform the chat room and they decide to start going elsewhere. That next Friday, nobody showed and the bar had maybe 25% of its normal crowd. Same thing happened the following week, and the owner asks me (rhetorically) why the place was so empty. I reminded him of his friends comment and how they all decided to start going somewhere else. He rolls his eyes and made some comment about how there's no way the crowd was just there to see me. 3rd week, still no crowd, and the owner tells me to leave early (I got paid per hour). 4th week, I start setting up (bar is almost completely empty) and the owner tells me he no longer requires my services.\n\nHe tried other DJs and karaoke and stuff, but never got that busy on a Friday ever again.\n\nI ended up DJing at the other bar (where my crowd moved to) and stayed there for nearly 2 years until the owner retired and sold the place. He used to be so happy with the crowd I brought in, telling me his Friday nights were never that busy before I started working for him. The guy that bought the bar was a friend of the guy that let me go. He asked if I wanted to work for him and I declined, mainly because the chatroom thing was dying out and the crowd had slowly been thinning as people grew up and moved on with their lives.",

This time I put a bit more stuff in because of gifts but I thought I was fine. \nI pass the police and get to the check-in, where a woman in her late 30's/ early 40's that reminded me of my old history teacher indicated me to proceed. I give my passeport, do the usual stuff, and I put my luggage on the scale which shows 23.05kg (the limit being 23). \nI was quite pleased with myself while looking at it, thinking I got it just right, but *NO*, the woman tells me I need to pay 50\u20ac for excess baggage. I look at her confused, telling her it's 50 grams, surely it doesn't matter, she repeats herself and we start arguing until she says: \"Either you pay 50\u20ac or you somehow make the luggage 50g lighter\". (I didn't have a carry on so I couldn't take anything with me).\nAt that moment I remember the 200g of chocolate that are sitting in the luggage and I start smiling. I open the luggage, take the chocolate out and start nibbling at it with a grin on my face while looking at the woman, who goes from pikachu face to annoyed. She tells me to hurry up (even though I was the only one in line) so I offered her some and she just stared at me.\nI ended up eating exactly a quarter of the 200g and lo and behlod the scale showed 23kg.\nThe woman gives me my ticket while glaring at me, and I tell her to have a good day.\nTLDR: Lady tells me I need to pay because my luggage has 50g too many so I eat them (chocolate).",

I know it's a small amount and usually it's not a problem with a lot of check in desks, but ever since the new gung ho area manager started getting printouts of weight overrides and estimating the thousands in sales we're losing because of these exceptions, they've been leaning heavily on station managers to find money where ever they can from the lost sales from the pandemic.

I'm not fucking up my paycheck for this dude's 50g of crap he knew he couldn't take on the plane but of course it's his life and time that's way more important so he's gonna stand here and argue with me about it.\n\nI try not to glare, but I'm so tired and annoyed I can't help but give him a sharp look while he playfully meanders through his belongings, obviously entertained by his little fiasco he created, but I don't say anything to these people otherwise we might get another meltdown that these people post on social media thinking they're the good guy.\n\nAt last we're finally at the part where they think they're absolute fucking geniuses and are gonna beat the system by throw away/mail home/put on an article of clothing/give to someone else/eat a snack they packed to get that small amount under the weight limit they need. And, bonus, they're one of those people who thinks the rules should never have applied to them and now he's standing here staring at me like a psycho while slowly eating a candy bar. I bet they think this is some kind of huge victory in the life of their daily monotony, he couldn't hold back how smug he looked when he sarcastically offered me a piece, as if he had just got me fired on the spot over it or something (I so badly wanted to reach out and just take a huge bite out of it lol).\n\nWhat is with these people? Why can't they just say oops, take something out, and then we're good like all the other people a day who accidentally go over the weight limit? Why do they have to make such a big fucking deal over 50g? just put on the hat/eat the candy bar/throw away the half used tube of toothpaste or whatever or, better yet, just fix your poor planning. Who fucking knew your bag would be heavier with a bunch of extra shit like gifts and candy? \n\nI just want to go home, this is the last time I pick up a shift just so a gate can stay open and/or I can pay rent.

He insisted I couldn't board with more than the single carry-on I was allowed. So while staring him directly in the eyes I put the jacket on, slipped the neck pillow around my neck, and stuck the bag with candy bar in my carry-on. He was absolutely furious but he waved me onto the plane.",

            "GREAT MC! 50g is absolutely nothing. And would\u2019ve probably been overlooked here in the states. I did notice one or two comments about the weight situation. These \u201cexactly the same weight\u201d things. Yes taking out a sweater and wearing it is gonna make the overall weight on the plane the same. THATS NOT WHY THERE\u2019S AN EXTRA COST!!!! \n\nIn the US (and IIRC Europe and Britain too) there\u2019s a government entity called the Occupational Safety and Health Administration or OSHA (not sure what it\u2019s called in EU or UK, but there should be a similar government entity). In the US, OSHA regulations state that no ONE person is to lift more than 50 lbs (EU/UK 23kg). So the extra cost you\u2019re seeing to have an \u201coverweight\u201d bag is actually NOT for the weight of the plane! It\u2019s because there are going to be 2 people handling your luggage instead of one.\n\nI used to work at Dulles International Airport (IAD) near Washington DC. I was an Aircraft Fueler that had friends who worked for other companies that loaded luggage who confirmed this for me. I have also seen some of the protocols they follow for this. They place the overweight item on its own separate cart, so it\u2019s typically the last one loaded and the first one off. But that helps them focus on the fact that your luggage needs to be handled by Two people. Yes weight is a factor on aircraft, as I have had to do the math to convert gallons to pounds (UK/EU liters to kg) for aircraft fuel.\n\nBut otherwise, GREAT JOB with that MC!\n[https://giphy.com/gifs/other-the-more-you-know-randomgif-tANpI4H9zlv1u](https://giphy.com/gifs/other-the-more-you-know-randomgif-tANpI4H9zlv1u)",

If they catch on and make you let go of the handles then you can push a knee into one corner of it also. \n\nBut you can pull some serious misdirection on them if you are smart and confident. One airline made you pay for hand luggage and I didn\u2019t know until I was there. It was a small airport as far as I could see and I knew the guy on check in was going to be the same guy scanning tickets and checking hand luggage at the gate. So at check in I told him I put the hand luggage back in my checked bag, and then at the gate I managed to sip it by him pretty much in plain sight just by telling him it was a real pain but I managed to make it fit in checked. \n\nI have many more such stories like this",

This ride is 100% controlled by the operator. \n\nA couple of weeks ago this woman and her friend came up to my ride making fun of one of the kids that were on the ride.  She was saying so many hateful things  about how they look. Without even looking at her I told her to stop and this is how it went.\n\nMe: you\u2019re literally talking about a 7yearold like that you need to stop or you will not be allowed on the rides.\n\nKaren: but it\u2019s true look at them \n\nMe: don\u2019t disrespect other guests please it\u2019s not ok. \n\nKaren\u2019s friend: stop karen before you get us in trouble again\n\nKaren: what ever\n\nWhen the ride was finished I start letting the next group of people in. \nI say \u201cdo not pull down on the bars pick any seat you\u2019d like! \u201c to everyone as they walk in since pulling on the bars can break the seats over time. I let a group of young boys in before Karen\u2019s group and they sat at the end seats. Karen marches over to the kids yelling at them to get out of her seat and that she paid to sit at the end. \n\nMe: miss please stop yelling at the kids or you will be removed from the ride with no refund in tickets. \n\nKaren: don\u2019t tell me -\n\nKaren\u2019s friend: stop it  Karen just sit in the middle\n\nShe complained the whole time walking to the middle seats and then pulled down the bar. I was thinking it was time to get a manager over but I didn\u2019t want to bother them with her. Once I got everyone seated I close all the seat bars.  When I was checking the seats Karen\u2019s one was on the loose side so I pushed it in a little to make it tighter. \nKaren: you\u2019re trying to kill me first you left my seat open now you\u2019re making it so I can\u2019t breathe \n\nI ignore her and keep checking seats. When I finally start the ride I slowly rock it and Karen is screaming to take her off so I make the ride go faster doing full circles now. Half way during the ride.\nKaren screams:  stop the ride you fucking bitch. \nShe wants me to stop it? Fine with me  I park the ride at the top of the ride like I do when closing but keeping the ride on. The 6 others on the ride weren\u2019t scared the ride stopped. Karen started screaming bloody murder crying and begging to be let down. The parents watching know what she said before  their kids and know what\u2019s going on and start laughing. After around 30 seconds she is screaming let me down still. So I do on the fastest setting I start the ride spinning  full speed. I made the ride a little e longer  since all the kids were having fun. Before I opened the seats I scream a warning.\n\nMe: wait for the bars to be fully open and stay above your head before getting up! Stay seated!\n\nKaren pushes it up and gets up having the bar fall back down and hit her in the head. Her friend laugh at her and get up walking her off the ride.\n\n\n\n\nTLDR: Karen bullied kids, didn\u2019t listen to rules so when she told me stop the ride I left her on top then made it go full speed making her cry. Then she hit her head on the seat bar. \n\n\nSorry I\u2019m not good at telling stories but Felt like  this belonged here and that at least  one of you would enjoy.",
