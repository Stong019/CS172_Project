        "selftext": "Costco has a pretty relaxed return policy, so 99% of the time customers bring things in to return or exchange, my friend says it's no questions asked.\n\nBut if on the computer system he notices in someone's transaction history that they're abusing the system, he'll deny the return and offer a pretty clear explanation as to why. Honestly, most people don't raise a big stink. The evidence is pretty clear and they say, \"okay, I didn't know that's how it worked,\" and go on with their lives.\n\nBut last week, a customer was getting upset that my friend wasn't going to do a return even though there was a long list of transactions that made it pretty obvious this guy was routinely buying things, using them a few times as needed then returning them. In this case, he had bought a bunch of food and was trying to return the packaging for full returns. He's not backing down.\n\nMy friend has full authority to cancel a membership (and this comes with a refund most of the time), so he tells the guy, \"Sir, it doesn't seem like you're happy with our products and services. I'm going to go ahead and cancel your membership and give you a FULL refund of the annual fee.\"\n\nThe guy, immediately understanding that this means he won't be allowed back in a Costco, sits kind of stunned for a few seconds, then gets REAL panicky, like \"No no no, I'm good, please don't do that.\"\n\nMy friend isn't backing down so the guy asks to speak to a manager. Friend plays the whole \"I am the manager of this department.\" So the guy escalates.\n\nThe assistant warehouse manager comes over and looks at the transaction history and immediately sides with my friend, saying virtually the same thing but in super sing-songy \"we're so sorry you haven't been happy with the products we sell,\" and backs my friend up while he finishes cancelling the guy's membership.",

            "There's a big advantage membership stores have. They generally bend over backwards to keep members happy but when members cross the line, they get ushered out. Give them a full refund of the membership fee so they have nothing to complain about.  Now they are Walmart's problem. \n\nCostco used to have a \"return any time for refund\" policy but people started abusing it on computers and TVs so they had to limit it on electronics.\n\nIt would be stupid for a business to keep customers that make you lose money.",
            "I work at a Costco where a guy had returned around $25K worth of electronics. Also took the assistant warehouse manager to say \"Yeah, you are abusing the return policy and we are cancelling your membership\" It's why I couldn't work at the return counter, would be no where near as understanding as they are.",

            "I knew a couple that abused Costco's generosity. They were self employed and horrible at money management.  So when times were good they'd splurge,  especially at Costco. When times were bad,  they'd simply load up random stuff the bought at Costco and return it. A vacuum they used for 6 months, half used food, didn't matter. Wish they would do this more for abusers like this so it doesn't ruin it for the rest of us.",
            "We bought a $1,500 couch from Costco. It was the most we ever spent on a piece of furniturez and when we bought it, we talked about how it would last for 30 years or more. it was leather, and we were really excited for such a luxury piece of furniture. After a couple weeks, the piece where the cushion was sewn into the couch separated on my husband's favorite spot. After a few months, almost every cushion had started separating. Then a few months later, the cushions began to deform so that the white stuffing that was now showing. I was so fed up with the couch that I returned it to Costco. I got so many shitty looks from other customers. I felt really bad, but we used the store credit to buy a new couch and a new chair. The couch has held up better, but still not great. The chair is doing great though. I could totally see it lasting for another 20 years.",

            "I bought a bottle of Trader Joe's Irish blend whiskey because their house brand of Scotch was out.\nTook the bottle home and poured myself some and nearly choked. It tasked like kerosene! I figured it was me, just not used to the taste. Tried it again. Nope, it tasted like kerosene.\nNormally I'd chalk this up to lesson learned. But it was more than twenty bucks for the bottle. I rarely take back things, but I also rarely buy things that I don't know what to expect.\nI figured it was a long shot, returning an open bottle of alcohol, but I was going to try anyway. (I also figured that if there was something wrong with it, they should know about it and maybe trace it back?)\nAnyway.\nThey guy at the counter was intrigued by my story, but not enough to taste it himself. He called a manager and we talked about it, and they agreed and returned the money. I bought a different more expensive bottle so Scotch. One that I knew and trusted.\nI'm still surprised and glad that they gave the refund. It really did taste awful. :)",
            "I used to work as a security guard in a mall that had a Holt Renfrew (very very very expensive department store). I was chatting with the stores Loss Prevention officer one day and she was absentmindedly browing through photos from some ritzy event that had occured earlier that evening, occasionally taking screen shots. After about 10 or 15 screen shots, i ask if shes looking for a formal evening gown.\n\nNope. Shes looking at the event photos to see what dresses they sold so they could watch for them being returned. \n\nApparently it was ***super*** common for women to come in, drop $12-65k on a designer haute couturier gown, wear itnto an event with the tags tucked in and then return it the next day. The very high profile women were allowed to do this (the store would be directed by the designer to lend them the dress) however these were the women who were arm candy or just trying to *look* rich, so they didnt qualify for a loaner gown. \n\nWhen a gown came in the night after an event, especially if it had been purchase within the week, the staff automatically would call the Loss Prevention girl and she would check her photo catalog to see if this had happened. The amount of women who thought they could get away with it (and then got stuck with a $25k dress) was mind boggling....",
            "I have a fun Costco returns story! My grandmother had dementia, but it hadn't been formally diagnosed. My cousin, and his friend, grown men in their late 20's decided they would use her membership to go buy expensive items (TV's, computers, etc), pay with a check - it was back in the day, and then return them (unopened) for cash after the check had cleared.\n\nThey stole about 30  grand from my grandmother over 2 years before Costco caught on. The family only found out when we tried to return something (legitimately) to Costco and we were informed that they no longer accepted returns from this member.\n\nThen we found out about the credit cards they'd opened in her name, and the mortgage they tried to take out on her house...",
            "My ex-wife used to work for Blockbuster and the number of people who would kick up a stink over small amounts of money was crazy (\"It's not the money, it's the PRINCIPLE!\"). And at a certain point, they would always say, \"Well cancel my membership then.\" And my ex-wife would press, like three keys quick and loud and then go, \"Okay. Done. It's cancelled. Have a good night.\"\n\nAlmost everyone backed down after that.",
            "I worked women\u2019s wear for many years. People were always trying to get away with stuff. \n\nOne customer was looking at dresses from our pricier line (still not very expensive) for the bridesmaids at her daughter\u2019s wedding. She brought them up to the cash wrap desk to show us that the stitching appeared to be coming loose around the waist on two of them. One appeared to be pulled apart by being too tight for whoever tried it on, the other looked like someone had shoved a finger into the pleat to separate it. (The dresses were new stock so this group was the first to try them on.) The mom asked if she could have a discounted price since the dresses were \u201cdefective.\u201d \n\nI called over my manager and told her the situation. She immediately grabbed all six dresses and told us to put them back in the stockroom. \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right!\u201d she told the customer. \u201cThese dresses are in terrible shape. I can\u2019t in good conscience sell you defective merchandise!\u201d Then she loudly instructed us to send them - all six dresses - back to the manufacturer. The would-be buyer began stammering that she would be happy to pay full price, this was the only dress the bridesmaids all liked, yadda yadda yadda. Manager sent her packing. \n\nExcept for the two they\u2019d messed with, the dresses were fine. We had them back on the sales floor in a couple of days.",
            "Their return records are a great tool to reward people who have low returns as well. Once, a water cooler was acting up just after I bought it, so I stopped by the return desk to ask when the purchase date was for a possible warrantee claim. Turns out \u201cjust after I bought it\u201d was actually three years, but since my return rate was so low they had me bring it in for an exchange the same day. \n\nI can\u2019t believe the quantity of items that are returned. There must be so many people that abuse their policy.",
            "My rule is that I never return anything that I've used.\n\nDone some shady stuff with price shopping, but the store got an unused product back. By this I mean I found it on sale on their website (theirs, not another store), bought it in store because I needed/wanted it right away, and then returned the one I bought online with the store receipt. Product is unused, they get a restock, and I get it at the time I need without paying a premium cause the store won't price match their own website.",
            "I once had a college student try to return an umbrella to the campus bookstore I was assistant manager for. It had rained the day before. \u201cIs there anything wrong with it?\u201d I asked. She said no, but she had the receipt. From the day before. \u201cDid you use it?\u201d I asked. She said yes, she did use it. Then I tried to explain to her why she couldn\u2019t return a functional umbrella she had purchased to use in the rain yesterday. \u201cBut I have the receipt!\u201d I told her we weren\u2019t in the business of umbrella loans. She asked to speak to the manager. I said I was the manager. She asked to talk to the manager above me, who was just walking by, who yelled over her shoulder, \u201cYou can\u2019t return it!\u201d She walked off in a huff, after grabbing her umbrella. I was just glad she didn\u2019t make me talk to her mom, like I had to do regularly.",
            "Best Buy is the worst.  I returned something- I don\u2019t even remember what it was but it wasn\u2019t something expensive or electronics.

            "I know someone that does this and I'm embarrassed every time. He'll buy a folding table and chairs and then return it after the BBQ.

I wanted to lie because I didn't really want to pay for it, but they asked what happened and I just blurted and told them about the tea spill... they said that's okay and replaced it and I had the best laptop for about 8 years!!!",

            "I live in Las Vegas where we have a huge trade show called CES (Consumer Electronics Show).  In the past, exhibitors were buying flatscreens from local stores to use in their booths for a week and then return them.  This was usually done by those who were coming from overseas that didn\u2019t want to pay to move a big TV back and forth and didn\u2019t want to pay for a rental.  Now, most stores that sells TVs implement a special policy where the sale of certain items is final for just the period of time around CES.  The policy is posted with large signs around checkout, so they know what they are getting into, but damn if there aren\u2019t tons of people attempting to circumvent the policy at the end of CES saying the TV is \u201cbroken.\u201d  Always fun to see those people throw a fit and be stuck with a huge tv that they don\u2019t have a use for and can\u2019t get back home.",

            "Amazon does this. I worked there as a customer service agent, and I would get calls all the time from people trying to return/replace or complain about something and clearly being able to see on the customer\u2019s file that they had done this multiple times. It was pretty much up to us how we wanted to handle the situation though; we could apologize for the \u2018error on our part\u2019 and send them on their way, or we could offer a free month of prime, a $5 gift card, etc. We wouldn\u2019t refund their item though. We would also explain why we weren\u2019t sending a replacement for the 159th DVD player that \u2018didn\u2019t show up\u2019 or the 1,145th vacuum cleaner that was \u2018broken when it got there.\u2019 Some people got the message, and then of course others wanted to talk to our supervisor. \n\nIt always sucked though because when we didn\u2019t issue a refund and the customer decided to take it out on us by leaving us a bad review, it would mess with our scores and drop them. Scores are everything with Amazon. Good scores = raise, promotions, etc. \n\nTip of the day: always leave a good review when someone from customer service helps you. I know they\u2019re super annoying and seem like a waste of time, but companies actually use those to determine a bunch of crucial stuff in your career. Those good reviews are essential for customer service agents",

You were given an allotted amount for each action down to the nut and bolt.  If you added up your allotted time and you finished early you got a 10 cent an hour bonus equaling 80 cents a day.   Also, this was to prevent you from helping other bays as you weren\u2019t allotted time for other\u2019s work. \n\nMalicious Compliance... I was efficient and didn\u2019t waste any movements.  I would blast through my bay, add up all the allotted time and saw that I finished two hours earlier than I was allotted.  \n\nRather than turn in my sheet and get 80 cents extra for the day, I sat on a comfy couch at the end of my bay and did nothing until my allotted time was up.  \n\nI remember when the manager drove by and said, \u201cwe need you to go help \u2014\u2014 and get damages.\u201d  I just looked at my watch, then at my beautifully prepped bay and said \u201cI\u2019m still prepping my bay.\u201d  Put my headphones in and leaned back while he looked completely shocked.

It was somewhere around $0.15 an hour extra for each percent over 100% efficiency you were. So if you were good you could get a few bucks AN HOUR extra for the whole day. \n\nI don't remember the exact incentives, I remember that it was a max of 120% efficiency and $3/hour for the bonus.\n\nIn theory that was cool. In practice I found it basically impossible to meet the quotas. You'd get an order of 200 items in 150 locations to be completed in...50 minutes. And those weren't small items either. The first 50 items would usually be heavy boxes of soup cans, and it takes you 15 minutes just to drive around to the locations. So in reality you have 35 minutes to pick 200 items. Sometimes they would be right next to each other so you could walk beside the pallet jack and toss stuff on without slowing down. Other times you would drive halfway across the warehouse, grab 1 item, and then have to drive back. Great. Thats 5 minutes more gone from my time. \n\nAnd they expected you to be hovering around 110% efficiency all the time. It was absurd. \n\nFor some reason in the meat fridge the times were super generous. Every time I would go in there I would have an order of 20 items in 8 locations to be completed in...45 minutes.

            "Hahahaha, dude this one is great and makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. I love when companies think that some small pittance will make people work harder. A place I used to work did a very similar thing to me.\n\nWe had a strange overtime system, I was paid salary, but occasionally would be asked to do extra work. The way that particular job operated, was on a job by job basis, I would work a 9 hr. day, but be expected to complete a certain number of jobs for the day. Each job had a level attached to it to represent how many approximate hours it was supposed to take to complete on a scale from 1-4. Therefore, each day every employee was expected to hit their levels based on skill level and pay. If we didn't hit our levels enough, we would get scolded, but if we did over our allotted weekly amount, we were supposed to get the extra as overtime based off a calculated hourly wage according to salary. So if I had a weekly level limit of 50 and did 55 levels, I get my hourly rate x5 added to my check. Pretty simple. On paper.\n\nThe thing is that if you got good enough at the job, the level system fell apart. A level 2 for one designer might take them two hours, while it might only take me 30 minutes. Depends on the difficulty of each job. As you might imagine, with the proper motivation, the right person could make a ton of extra cash just working their regular 9 hours and doing double the levels required. Once the management realized how much extra money I was making, they upped my weekly levels to a point that would be really hard for me to even meet on a regular basis unless I kept pushing myself. The problem was, the raise they gave me with the extra work I was supposed to do, was not equivalent to the extra money I would have made if the now required levels had been overtime, it was less than a third actually. So they wanted me to do the same amount of work for less money and be forced to do it rather than choosing to take on overtime as needed.\n\nI straight up told them I was never going to do a single level over my limit ever again and would never even try to hit my limit again. I tried to refuse the \"raise\" as well, but they told me I had to take it. It was clearly a way to stop me from making more money than they thought I deserved. I left that place pretty soon after that, but for a whole different reason.",

They also got their moving cost covered as well. I did not make them homeless, some of them thanked me.\n\n2. We moved to a new neighborhood that was only 5 minutes walk to my office, it was a single family house. We loved that neighborhood, it was so LGBTQ friendly. We stayed there for a year until we bought our house. The rent was actually cheaper.\n\n3. The building was own by a corporation, so when I say landlord it refers to the owner+property manager. I hope they learn their lesson.\n\n-----------\n\nThis happened in 2018, I just moved to a new apartment. It was a three bedroom first floor apartment and it had a finished basement. It had two bedrooms, a living room, and a kitchen on the first floor. It also had a bedroom (with a full bath) in the basement and a bar/gaming area. It was also in a very nice area of the city. The apartment was owned by a corporation.\n\nHonestly, we loved that apartment, until it kept having recurring issues in the basement. The carpet was wet from time to time, at first the landlord would send a cleaner to come and handle it but it keeps happening. I asked them to check and fix the issue. They did not do it, I told him I'll call the city inspector to check the building, they laughed at me and told me 'go ahead, call the city inspector', so I did.\n\nI called the city twice until I finally was connected to the right department and they sent an inspector a week later. The inspector found so many building violations. They told me they'd contact the building owner and would come again. The next day, the owner called and begged me to tell them what I know about the problem with the apartment. I told them that I sent complaints multiple times, they should check their record. \n\nThe city inspector, the owner and the property manager came two weeks after that, the city inspector was whooping their asses. He laid it to them, it was bad. They have to deal with structural and foundational issues and some safety issues too. There were 4 tenants in that building including us, imagine it was a big colonial/multi family home divided into four apartments. They had to break the lease with all of us to fix the building. They couldn't fix it with us being there. We were ready and already consulted a lawyer, we told them that:\n\n1. We want our deposit back before moving out\n2. They paid for all of our moving expenses\n3. They paid for our deposit at the next place\n\nThey could not kick us out, they could not rent the apartment after the inspections, there were four of us and we could all sue them for placing us in a dangerous building. In the end they spent so much money to relocate us and fix the apartment.",

With all the patience I could muster I replied politely telling them if they had fucking fixed it in the first place then we wouldn't have anything to point to, *and also that was the whole reason we were moving!* They were going to have to fix it either way, but now they had to do showings and sign a new tenant up and all that bullshit instead of just cashing my prompt checks each month.\n\nAbsolute fucking clowns they were.",

They'd pay to move our stuff to storage then to the house when it was ready\n3. They'd pay any points on our loan if interest rates went up while we were waiting for them to get the house done.\n\nWithin 4 days all the repairs were done and we moved in on time.  \n\nFor those who are interested the house cost $195k back in 1993.",

We live on a dead end (private) road that he had no business being on. He wasn't visiting anyone, he was just snooping.  \n I was building a new front porch for our home two years ago, and while I was getting ready to start building it, I had all of the lumber laid out in the driveway. Well apparently if you have building materials, (that are being stored) they have to be covered by a tarp or other water proof covering. They do NOT have to be covered if you are in the act of active construction.  \nWhile I was taking a break in the house, the old man drove by. Sure enough, the next day someone from the county stopped by. He told me someone called in about my lumber, at the same time he could see I was actively building and that there was no violation as far as he could see, I also told him that the construction would be finished that day.  \nWhile he was there I happened to mention in passing that there was an old guy down the road with an old Corvette that was actively trying to sink into the earth and that it had been an eyesore for years.  \nHe drove down to the guys house, inspected the property, and the owner (old drunk nosy guy) was given 48hrs to clean up his property, including scrub brush, the car, an old riding lawnmower and other various junk he had around the property. He had to hire people to come and do the work because there was no way he could do it on his own in 48hrs.  \nThe best part, I haven't seen him down our road in over 2 years now.",

I thought \u201cgreat, two birds one stone\u201d despite the Rate My Professor for this class being abysmal at best. \n\nA few things to note, I have ADHD and dyslexia (bs ds ps and gs) so I have a hard time reading most times but especially handwritten stuff. Even my own. It\u2019s also important to note that I had an ADA allowance on file (meaning I get some permissions to allow me to take classes and function as normally as possible). These permissions included use of my tablet during class to write notes and about an hour longer on tests. \n\n\nWell first day of class, the professor strolls in with the arrogance and snobbitude of someone who *thinks* they\u2019re getting tenured this year. He starts talking, going over the syllabus and says \u201cthere will be no phones, laptops or technology of any kind in my class. You will write all your notes by hand\u201d which isn\u2019t going to work for me, so I raise my hand and ask him if I can talk to him privately about the rule. \n\nThat went over about as well as a lead ballon and he starts getting snippy and says \u201canything you need to talk with me about can be found in the syllabus\u201d. But again I said that I needed to talk to him and that it was pretty important. Finally he just says to say it to the class, he doesn\u2019t have time to take out to deal with whining of any kind. Like ok dude. So I say that I\u2019m dyslexic and need my tablet to do the notes and read the assignments, and that *my ADA permissions are on file and emailed to all my professors before class*. \n\nHe says \u201cyeah I saw the email but I don\u2019t care. You can do the work just like everyone else, you\u2019re not special even if you were in special ed\u201d \n\nThe class goes deadly quiet at that. \n\nIm absolutely shocked at his bold and completely hilarious lack of awareness and care for his job. Im staring at him open mouthed and he thinks he\u2019s won. He\u2019s got this smug little face like I\u2019ve just been told and they\u2019re no other options nor is there any way he\u2019ll regret his behavior. \n\nOne of the girls in class finally finds her voice and calls hun out in his ableism and lack of decorum but he cuts her off saying \u201cif you don\u2019t like my rules, you can drop the class\u201d so she says \u201cokay\u201d and pulled out her laptop and dropped the class right in front of him, and taking the cue from her 3 other students and I do the same and we leave class together. (At the same time) \n\nI\u2019ve never met this girl before but she then asks me if I want to go to the dean because honestly I\u2019m really shaken so I said yes and we go straight there telling the dean of students what happened as well as the ADA counselor. They took the girls statement and mine, and discovered that this Professor had pulled this shit for years but nobody wanted to get involved. \n\nSix months later I hear that not only had the Professor not gotten tenured, but he was fired and blacklisted from teaching at the collegiate level.\n\n\nEDIT: WOW this blew up oh my goodness! Thank you guys so much fir the awards and I\u2019m trying to reply to everyone but it\u2019s a lot. \n\nI really appreciate the awards but please don\u2019t spend real money on me!

She came to me on the first day with a doctor's note, saying how she would need to take tests with the book open because directions like left/right and up/down, as well as the actual spelling of words, were very difficult for her unless the picture was right in front of her. We were covering queues and linked lists, so there were a lot of arrows!\n\nAnyway, midterm exam comes, and the last question - worth the most points - was to write a program to detect palindromes, e.g., words spelled the same backwards and forwards, like CIVIC or MADAM, I'M ADAM. I set her up in the library so she could take the test \"open book\" without drawing comment from the other students, then returned to my class. Came to check on her half an hour later; she had completed the entire exam in record time ... except the last question, which totally stumped her. She was in tears and saying she was going to drop the class, even though she was one of my best students. That would have been very consequential, because it was a core course which was required for the degree program.\n\nI was hating myself because I knew about her disability, yet had phrased a question in terms of words spelled the same backwards and forwards. To be fair, this was 1989, and most people hardly knew what dyslexia was. But I thought very rapidly, then crossed out the problem, and wrote a new one which expressed the same concept in purely numerical terms. It was teaching the same concept - iteration vs. recursion. When she read the new problem, her face lit up, and she said she could handle it.\n\nShe handed in her paper fifteen minutes later, got the best score in the class, and went on to get an A.",

        "selftext": "So after I graduated college I went back to work at my high school job at a large auto parts chain. I have a few stories of malicious compliance from there because it was a miserable place to work with miserable management, but I think this one takes the cake.\n\nI lived about 15 minutes from the store and would routinely work 1-2hrs past my shift to help the manager close up and tally cash sale receipts(we were mainly wholesale so the cash receipts were a small portion of the sales and had to be tallied by hand) as well as take out the trash, prep and stage the first deliveries for the next morning, as well as sweep the store front. I didn't mind doing these things because I got a little OT out of it, got in the good graces of the manager(or so I thought), and being that even though my drive home was short, staying a little late and letting traffic die down was fine with me. \n\nOne morning I walked in at about 9:07, when my shift was scheduled to start at 9am. I didn't see what the big issue was since I had been staying late every day for months helping him close the store, but he apparently took issue with it that day. Which would have been fine if he had said something along the lines of \"hey, liabilitylandon, you're late and I know you worked long yesterday, but let's still get here on time.\" But that isn't what he said. He flew off the handle and went on about needing to \"work my schedule\" and \"we have schedules for a reason\" and \"you just need to be at work for the schedule that I made you\". Well needless to say, since I had been staying late for months to help him close the store(it's against policy to not have 2+ people in the store at a time) despite it not being \"on my schedule\", this rubbed me the wrong way. So, I convinced myself that instead of causing a scene and yelling, I would just do EXACTLY what he said.\n\nSo, 5:30 rolls around(we closed at 6) and I stood in front of the computer until it hit 5:30 exactly, clocked out, and started walking towards the door.\n\nManager: where are you going?!\n\nMe: home.\n\nManager: what? Why? Who is going to help me close the store tonight?\n\nMe: I dunno, but you made it very clear I was to \"work my schedule\". So, I get off at 5:30, it's now 5:30, and I'm going home.\n\nAnd I walked out.\n\nThe next morning I got there at 8:55 and just stood in front of the computer until it hit 9:00. Phones ringing? Too bad, my shift hasn't started. Deliveries need to go out? Sorry, I'm not on the clock yet. I clocked in at 9:00, and then clocked out at 5:30. Same conversation as the day before about who was going to help him close.\n\nThe third morning I walk in, and he waits for me to clock in, then pulls me aside to talk to me.\n\nManager: you know, I think we can overlook a few minutes in the morning if you stay and help me close.\n\nMe: oh, interesting. I thought I was supposed to just work my schedule.\n\nManager: yeah well I guess we can overlook that.\n\nI had very few problems with this manager after that little exchange. If y'all want more stories from the insane tiny-tyrant filled auto parts world, just let me know. Plenty more where that came from.\n\n\nEdit:Wow, my first silver! Thanks redditors! Had no idea this thing would blow up like it did. Guess I better get to writing down these old stories.\n\nEdit again: I'm dumbfounded as to how this took off! Thanks for reading! I really thought this was a pretty run of the mill post for this sub but y'all apparently thought it wasn't and spread the love. Thanks!\n\n3rd edit: 15k? Are y'all serious?!? Crazy!\n\nI would,however, like to clarify that this was by no means my finest moment in terms of being a well adjusted adult. Was I in fact late? Yes. Was my response petty? Yes. Would I handle it the same way now over a decade later? Hopefully(and most likely) not. But that isn't the name of the game in this sub, because this is \"malicious compliance\", not \"I did the right thing\".",

            "I was in a similar situation except that I was a salaried employee working a normal 9-5:30 job. I'd sometimes come in a few minutes late. I would also work through lunch 4/5 days and work an extra hour or two at the end of the day. My office was in a back corner of our suite and I used a back entry, so no one ever saw me come or go. I also had no one reliant upon me being available so this wasn't actually impacting anyone. But apparently my lateness was causing a huge disturbance in the company and upsetting everyone. So, I got a big lecture and it was stressed to me that our hours were m-f 9-5:30 with a 1 hour lunch so i needed to start keeping those hours. ok...\n\nThe following week you bet your ass i walked in the door at 8:59 am every day, left the office for an hour at work so i wasn't available, and left at 5:30 on the dot. What my boss hadn't realized is that most of our meetings took place while I was working through lunch or after 6 pm. I was now not available during those times and she wasn't happy. \"Can't you just stay a little later so we can discuss this?\" \"Nope, sorry. You were very clear about what my hours are so I don't want to come in or stay late in violation of those.\" I also would generally help out in other areas when I would stay late. Like helping our fundraising dept get out invites to events, or helping the membership department to user outreach and analysis. I stopped doing those things, so they started to fall behind. \"Can you stay tonight and help me stuff envelopes?\" \"I am really sorry. If it was up to me, I would. But {manager} made it very clear that I have to leave at 5:30 every day, so I'm not able to stay and help with that.\"\n\nI gave notice within a month and haven't worked in a physical office since then. No being late if your commute is just opening slack and saying \"morning\", not that my current company would even care a bit.",
            "I had a lead that didn't like how some other engineers would show up after 9 (we didn't have to be in until 10). We could flex our hours just as long as you got 40 by the end of the week. Well he decided to schedule a \"meeting\" every day at 8:30 as his way of getting people in at a time that he thought was \"acceptable\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe would also leave 2 hours every day in the summer to go biking during the middle of the day (when we were all supposed to be in) but apparently that was ok in his view. I was glad when I finally left that team.",
            "One of the reasons I left my old job.\n\nLived an hour away, would show up at 905-915 depending on traffic for a 9-5 shift, would leave at 8 or 9pm every day,\nNo overtime \nNo benefits\nNo sick pay\n17 an hour as the only employee. \n\nWe had no customers coming in (all long term projects) and we didn't open until 10 anyway\nBoss wouldn't show up until 11 or 12 then would go to lunch at 130 for 2 hours.\nWould bitch every single payday about the late minutes, never acknowledging I was doing 60 hour weeks plus every other weekend. As the only employee in a shop that had 4 mechanics worth of work year round.\n\nAsked me once at 9pm to come in at 7am to help him with a certain vehicle for an event, I was there at 7, no keys for the car or parts to install. he showed up at 11. I left at 3 and got yelled at, from that day on I was done.\nLeft exactly 8 hours after arriving,\nTook whatever vacations I wanted and said either deal with it or fire me idc.",

            "I'm the manager at my location.  Anyway, my manager from our head office one day contacts me to tell me he can see through our rostering system that I changed my rostered hours during the week and that if I do that I need to ask for his permission first.\n\nI ask him why and he tells me because I have to work to the hours in my contract.  I reply, \"Ok,\" and continue to change my roster as I see fit.  Why?  My contract only mentions how many hours I am to work per week, not per shift, not per day, just per week.\n\nAnyway, he obviously calls me again to ask why I'm still changing my roster without asking.  I inform him that my contract only says how many hours I am to work per week and that I'm following company policy by not doing more than 8 per day.\n\nHe says he'll look into that and then calls back that he can see that my contract only mentions my hours per week and not specific rostered shifts which is what every other manager has.  He tells me he's going to have HR write up a new contract for me to sign as he wants me on specific hours.  I ask what will happen if I don't sign and he has to admit nothing because it'd be voluntary so I told him I'm perfectly fine with my current employment contract. \n\nSome managers just really want to micro manage you.",

            "I worked part-time at a big-box, home improvement store when I was in college. I hated some of the management, they were always on a power trip. Plus, if we clocked in or clocked out 7 minutes before or after our scheduled time, it would go down on our permanent record. However, the most annoying thing was working the closing shift and having that one customer who walked in 1 minute before closing. We couldn't kick them out and we couldn't start cleaning and restocking. Managers would yell at the opening shift for not having the shelves stocked. Depending on who closed (some people were just lazy workers), we all understood what had happened. We eventually started maliciously complying with their unreasonable requests and they would just yell at us more for not having the store ready for business.",
            "Good for you! \n\nI did the same thing in the past few years.\n\nWe had rolling managers for awhile. Prior to this one manager though, I communicated with my manager my start and end time which was 6:35-3:15 I believe, I explained all the reasons why this was good for work and for me and they ALWAYS had no issue. Was a 2 minute convo at most.\n\nWell... new manager decided to make moves and tried to bump me up from 6:45 to 8am. Didn't talk to me beforehand, just said he was making the change.\n\nI got the union involved and fought it after trying to reason with him. Eventually settled on a time much closer to my original start time. It took a hell of a lot of time and stress and dealing with management threats.\n\nI WAS the kind of employee who would show up early if needed due to workload, I would work through lunch, through breaks, i'd stay late to help my teammates, or for some tasks that required it, or management last minute requests.\n\nBut they fucked around with me, threatened me, violated my rights and policies so I said fuck em.\n\nThey decided one of the tasks we do that requires us to stay late, they would no longer pay us overtime, they wanted us to move our hours for that day.\n\nSo I said, well, thats too bad, we agreed on these set hours for these reasons, this is what you wanted and I'm not willing to stay late. \n\nThey weren't happy, but nothing they could do. I now show up on time, take all my breaks, take my lunch in full and leave exactly when i'm supposed to. \n\nThey took one of their most productive members and made him just like everyone else.

            "It's called \"working to contract\".  \n\nI'm a government contractor and was told I must have prior approval to work overtime.  We were also told to always enter actual hours worked on our timesheets.   \n\nOne day my government PM told me he needed a deliverable a day early, and gave me a verbal okay to book more than 8 hours that day.  I ended up staying until 2am, and entered the 18 hour workday on my timesheet.   When my company boss saw the Extra hours after I submitted my timesheet he went nuts and told me to remove the extra time because the company would not allow it.   Okay.  FIne. \n\nFrom then on it was 8 hours exactly every day, and I told my company boss that I would refuse any future schedule pushes (which happened periodically).  I lived up to that until I got a better job and gave notice.  In my exit interview I told him that little incident made it clear the the company would not live up to their part of the arrangement: paying me for hours worked.  \n\nSee ya!  \n\nBTW: the government Program Manager was the one who insisted our company never book \"overtime\".",

            "sounds like my last job. I was a front office manager and usually came in anywhere from 15-30 minutes early every day. I would transfer calls to my desk at that time as a matter of routine. One day I walked in, hadn't even removed my coat when a staff member told me to transfer calls right away as she was too busy to answer. I looked at her, told her that I always transferred when I came in but 1. I was a manager and it wasn't her place to tell me what to do and 2. I actually wasn't on the clock for another 25 minutes.\n\nShe immediately went to the GM and complained about my 'attitude' and I was called in. The GM  told me I should take the calls immediately. I explained I did on a normally but did not appreciate a part-timer telling me how to do my job. For the next week I sat in my car until 2 minutes until the start of my shift. Every day the GM sat at my desk for an hour handling calls (she started an hour before me). After that week I returned to coming in early and taking the calls when I walked in like I always had.\n\nQuit not long after that.",

They said I'd have to take vacation time to be able to take the time off. Even though she was always leaving mid day for her daughter's sporting events and that was constant.\n\nI still got there early, but I'd sit in my car and wait for my time to come in.

And this job also had no budget allotted for overtime.  So we started getting pushed to at least get to a stopping point, and would be yelled at if we cleaned up too early in their eyes. So we started making it to the gate later and later. Eventually leaving the gate 10-15 minutes late 3-4 times a week. And I decided since we werent getting our time paid I would get it back. So friday rolls around and as we put in an extra hour through the week, I took an extra 20min for lunch and got a verbal warning. Explained the issues of no OT and hot chewed out but the verbal warning stuck.\n\nNext week similar thing. Say wednesday we were help up almost 25 minutes. So I came in 15 minutes late the next day and got an official write up. So I called the hall immediately to inform them of everything. And talk to everyone on site as we didnt have enough people on site to have an official steward.\n\nAnd I explained that it was more than pitching in and being an employee. And they were taking advantage of us. And while we can give up something in a minute, it can take years of negotiation to get it back. So we cannot give an inch without official negotiations. \n\nNeedless to say the bosses were beyond pissed bit didnt have a leg to stand on. Although I was very shortly after laid off. With q job call posted the very next day. Technically it was by the book but a shitty thing to do. But honestly I was happy to leave that employer if that's how they operated. Bit I was happy to know that as we are all in the same local, and talk regularly that everyone stuck to their guns, and made sure to not get bullied into staying even a minute late without being paid OT.",

            "OHHHH I WOULDA MALICIOUSLY COMPLIANCED THIS SHIT *SO HARD* AT MY OLD JOB ... \n\nback in my 20s I worked at a restaurant (breakfast place), \n\n\n they were mad if we were late but also made us pay tip out (which means legally it goes to the bus boys, cleaners and chefs- split between them. This place used it for the electric bill!) and they furthermore had us clean up after shift. \n\nNow we get a servers wage of 6,95 instead of 15,00 \n\nWhy? Cause servers get tips. Now. It is illegal to have a server do other non tip related work while paying them only 6.95$ for good reason to obviously \n\nBut they\u2019d have us do prep in the kitchen, bus tables (which is not bad- I consider that server related at least), but certainly I don\u2019t consider washing all the windows when it\u2019s slow and vacuuming every night among other tasks that were DEF NOT appropriate for people being paid 6.95, like cleaning out every machine in the kitchen - they had nasty syrups and milk dispensers and also putting away and getting out soups, making desserts, and whatnot.\n\n\nFrequently we were made to do the vacuuming AFTER midnight. We were forced to clock out at midnight. So we WERENT EVEN GETTING THE 6.95! We had to do that shit for FREE. \n\nWell of course I figured that out based on the low amount of the pay checks when I started recording my actual hours. I was suspicious. It was direct deposit and we NEVER got a pay stub. \n\nI eventually figured out what we weren\u2019t being paid to do (staying late vacuuming, staying late cause someone showed up at 11:50 etc, still having to clock out at midnight- if we didn\u2019t clock out they wouldn\u2019t pay us for the extra time anyway). If we got there early by five or fifteen min (needed to set up your area and make change or whatever) we also got that cut off our pay. Basically whatever hours they set for us to work, they paid for - if my shift was 3-12am. That\u2019s all they\u2019d pay. Even if I had to stay an extra hour or two serving and THEN sweeping and vacuuming. \n\nI told people about it all. And we all demanded our pay stubs. And finally I kept telling all the other waitresses that we didn\u2019t have to do shit we don\u2019t get tips for because we\u2019re paid the server wage. So definitely not window cleaning or dusting or cleaning kitchen wares in downtime. Unless they want to up the pay by double for every minute we do that. \n\nEventually they \u201claid me off\u201d which secretly meant fuck u UR FIRED..... for telling people what the laws are; they\u2019re mostly immigrants and just because you\u2019re at university N know basic Canadian law \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6 regarding what\u2019s acceptable under the 6,95 wage, doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ll allow u to educate others even if it\u2019s on your breaks. Those fuckers. They literally belittled people into working foe less than the most minimum of all minimum wages! (Server min wage. The worst kind!) \n\nPersonally server min wage is fair and fine if you just work waitressing but 60% of the time we WEREN\u2019T waitressing. We were doing shit that deserves min wage pay. \n\nThat place CRUSHED SOULS. the people who were already beaten down even tried to \u201cShhh!\u201d Me about it.\n\nLucky I didn\u2019t really need that job. But years later I realize I probably shoulda complained about that method and reason for firing. Educating people about fair pay on off time isn\u2019t a reason to fire someone. Also they can\u2019t just lay someone off and not pay our vacation pay or severance or whatever. They have to tell you they\u2019re firing you. Not half ass it.\n\n\nMy original point: If they had done what they did to OP to me this at that job I would\u2019ve just locked up at 12a and left. Also turned away anyone who showed up within 20 min of that time. Or just let them do takeout only. I don\u2019t care. So long as the door is locked when they stop paying me for my time.\n\nAnyway that place was terrible. Never eat at Denny\u2019s. Never eat at the golden griddle. They\u2019re both SHIT to their employees",

All I got out was \"Im having an issue confirming...\" and he cut me off saying just send it to him and he'll do it himself.\n\nWhat he didn't let me get out was that the email was \"Admin@ *very clearly a porn site*\" and we had constant internet monitoring so I couldn't exactly verify it (also, I really didn't want to). It literally had \"Furry\" and \"SM\" in the site name.\n\nSo, doing as I was told, I sent him the email.\n\nThanks to our shitty walls my coworkers and I were treated to a loud \"OH MY GOD\" and the ensuing phone calls from IT and HR asking him to explain himself later that day.\n\nHis eventual response just said \"verified\"",

He reported it to HR and their mildly incompetent HR decided someone needed to catalogue all the images. And, of course, to limit the damage, no one else should be exposed. So they set a 17 year old kid to view ALL the porn images and write down their content. These were not attractive people so even if my hub were bisexual, he would not have enjoyed the task.

The idea was that we'd send a copy of the Acceptable Use Policy to those that had personal media on the shared drive, give them 2 weeks to delete it, then delete the data.  If porn was found, the file listing was printed off and forwarded to my supervisor who took it to HR.\n\nI do my search and discover that one of the VPs had a ton of porn on his home drive.  I chuckle to myself and print the file listing (the names themselves were obvious), and handed to my supervisor.

        "selftext": "Might as well share something that happened to me. Saw a thread over on legaladvice that reminded me about this incident, figured it might fit here. This happened to me in 2013. i was over 30, had gone back to school, and it was the Friday before finals week on my last semester to finish my CE degree. Bordering around campus, it's rather low income and not highly educated, and not a place I frequented.\n\n****\n\nI walked into a gas station, we'll call it Square L, about 7:30am. Locally, that's 30 minutes after they start selling alcohol, county is dry between 3am and 7am. Grab two of the largest packs of cheap beer they sell, and head up to the register. No big deal, just stocking up for a small \"study party\" with friends on campus later that day.\n \nThe person behind the register eyes me suspiciously as I set them on the counter and tells me I'm not buying them. I politely explain it's after 7am, and I don't see a problem. The manager, denoted by dress shirt instead of polo leans over and tells her to get my ID, so she asks me for it. I'm like fine, whatever, and I fidget around a minute before realizing it's in my car. I say as much and offer to grab it, and she told me to go ahead. \n\nI dash out to my car, grab my wallet from my book bag. No big deal. Walk back in and present it to the person at the register, who promptly glances at it, snickers, snaps it in half, tosses it in the trash, and tells me to get the **** out of her store. \n\nI stood there a minute, sort of dumbounded. The manager tells me to get the **** out of the store or police will be called and someone is getting arrested. I mumbled something along the lines of oh shit, and opted to comply with the second half. I went to my car, grabbed my phone, called non-emergency and told them I just had my driver's license taken and destroyed, read off the address, ended my call, then headed back inside and stood. \n\nThe manager tells me that's it, they are calling the cops. I let her know I already did. The clerk laughs and shouts for the people in the store to hear \"ya'll want to stick around, this punk *** ***** called the cops on us for taking their fake ID\"\n\nIt took about 10 minutes, but they showed up. As they arrived, the manager rushed out the door, and I walked behind. The cop asked for me immediately by name, dismissing the manager pointing at me and rattling off about my 'fake ID'. I told him what happened, and I was told to leave or cops were to be called and someone were to be arrested. \n\nHe then takes the statement from the manager, then the clerk, then requests the ID be retrieved from the trash. He looks it over, and hands the two pieces back to me. \n\nHe hasn't said anything other than simple requests for info up to this point, then asks me to come along, and we're going to have a chat outside. At this point, I'm actually growing a bit concerned. \n\nHe punches in the DL number, and up pops my face and info. Clean history both driving and criminal. He then lets me know that destruction of a license is a misdemeanor in this state, and asks which one snapped it. We have a brief conversation, and at this point, he's smiling ear to ear. He asks me if I want to press charges, and at this point, I've already missed first class, so state I do. I'm told to play along with him, and we share course of action. By this time, there were 4 squad cars, and police milling about. Customers had grown scare.\n\nWe walked back in, I'm staring at the floor looking pensive, and he says loudly \"What do we say?\" and nudges me. I politely say, \"I'm very sorry this happened, and I'm sure it won't happen again.\" The clerk and manager begin chuckling. I then finish with \"The manager requested the clerk take it, who snapped it, then the manager is the one who said someone is getting arrested.\"\n\nThe officer undid the cuffs from his belt, walked up to the clerk, and began with miranda rights. Another did the same to the manager. \n\nAnother 30 minutes roll by while they are sitting in the backs of squad cars, store is devoid of employees until someone walks out from the back cooler. I wait patiently, eventually they are cut loose under 'own recognizance' and I'm given a date to play witness in court. \n\nWe head back in and the manager is IRATE. The employee, on release, bolted. \n\nI pay for my now-warm beer, and leave.\n\nMy professor got a great laugh out of the police report, and let me do my project presentation late anyway.  \n\n****\n\nTLDR: The juicy bits are above, but in a nutshell, \"Fake ID\" taken and broken then trashed, I'm told leave or someone will call cops and someone will be arrested. I complied with the second option. \n\n****\n\nEdit: Just got home from work and RIP my inbox. Thank you for the gold. Guess I need to make a few replies now.\n\nEdit2: As for the court date, one of them pushed it further, so it turned into 2 dates. As the witness, I showed up, but wasn't really needed. The first pled no contest to a charge for destruction of state property, got 6 months probation and 1000 hours of community service, as well as having to write me an apology. The other ended up pleading guilty to an obstruction charge, and got 6 months probation only. Neither ended up going to jail, and only wore bracelets for the 30 minutes or so in the car. Sorry it's a bit anti-climatic, but I felt justice had been served.  \n\nEDIT3: For those who say 1000 isn't possible, it started as probation and 100 hours for the first person who plead no contest. They spoke out against the judge. He upped it to 200, then 500, then 1000. Kid kept mouthing off, but the judge, at that point, told the bailiff to remove them. That was the clerk, and I remember there was a string of other offenses on their record. The manager had only had a previous possession charge, but on his date, acted humble and polite in court, total opposite of how they had in the store with the cops. \n\nEDIT4: I never did get the apology letter. If it was written and turned in, I have no idea where it went. \n\nEDIT5: For perspective on how this county does things, I, myself, received 200 hours and 6mos probation for getting caught stealing a pack of cigarettes when I was 19 (we were all young and dumb once, and they didn't used to hide behind the registers everywhere), which I served in about 50 hours picking up trash, then the guy signed off on the whole time.. so I doubt they'd have had to actually serve the whole thing.

            "In college a friend and I went to a store, he wanted to buy cigarettes.  The lady kept the ID, saying it was fake and saying she would call the cops.  He told her to do so, and she did.  Cop walks in, looks at the ID, looks back at her, and says \"Why would anyone make a fake ID saying they were 20 instead of 21?\"",
            "God, they suck at their job. \n\nIt\u2019s easy. Here, you can refuse to serve anyone for any reason. So even if they have ID, you can say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not convinced this is legitimate, you\u2019ll have to take your business elsewhere.\u201d  Then you give them back their ID. \n\nThey have zero recourse. They might leave a bad Yelp review.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got evidence the ID is fake, (Scanner, Blacklight test etc) you tell them to their face. \n\n\u201cYour ID didn\u2019t scan, I\u2019m required to call the police and hang on to it as evidence until they show up.  I\u2019ve got better thing to do than baby-sit you, you\u2019re welcome to leave, but please don\u2019t return.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ve got a choice. If they leave, we didn\u2019t even call the cops most of the time. If they hung around, we called the non-emerg number and someone would come by an hour later. Usually the patron had gotten bored and left. The cops collect the fake, take a statement, life goes on. \n\nIf you fuck up, the police are the ones to confirm the ID is real and return it, and you\u2019ve done nothing illegal.\n\nMost places require you to take an online course and pass an exam to serve alcohol. This is all covered. ",
            "I got carded for Weinhard's Root Beer once. Luckily I was over 21 and had my ID! When I pointed out that I was not purchasing alcohol, the cashier got really embarrassed, but I thanked her for making me feel young again.",
            "Oooo I hate people who won't believe I'm over 21 when they're looking right at my ID.\n\nI went to a grocery store and bought some liquor and some candy. I walk over to the cashier, put my stuff on the belt, and she starts scanning. I'm looking at the card swipe pad and she tells me to swipe but I notice the total is only like $3. I look at the belt and the liquor is still there. I tell her I wanted that too and at this point I'm super confused because it's not like it's hiding and there was no one behind me?? She grabs it, rolls her eyes at me, and scans it and snarkily asks for my ID, which I hand to her. I usually get carded, so no big deal, but her attitude is annoying me at this point. \n\nShe takes the ID and pushes some buttons on the screen and goes \"I can't sell this to you\" with that same stupid smirk like she caught me doing something wrong. The thing you should know about this store is that they have the ability to scan my ID, which will tell them all they need to know about me so they can sell me the alcohol. She didn't scan it. I said \"what do you mean?\" Now I'm super confused and pretty pissed off. No one had ever denied me before, because while I look young, I also have visible tattoos and my face pierced (nose and lip). So I don't look like I'm 14 but I guess I could be younger than 21, but it's still believable that I could be 23. She then tells me that I'm too young or not old enough or something. I say \"excuse me? I'm 23. It says so right on that ID. What are you talking about?\" \n\nLuckily before I got really mad, another cashier came over and says \"she said she's 23!!!\" And takes my ID and finished the transaction. I thank her and the original cahsier says sorry, still in that awful snarky attitude way. I'm still sooo mad about that happening. Uhg. ",

            "So I live in a part of Canada where the legal drinking age is 18. Me and some friends went on a trip to Washington when I was 20, all my friends were over 21. They all want to go to the local college bar, and I figure it can't hurt to try and get in seeing as your drinking laws are bullshit. Standing in line o get in and the biggest fucking bouncer I have ever seen starts checking for ids. Now I'm like, well I'll give him my Canadian ID and maybe it will confuse him and he will let me. Get up there, hand him the ID, he stares at it. And stares at it. And stares at it. I figure the jig is going to be up. He calls over the second biggest bouncer I have ever seen, \"hey man, how old is this guy,\" second bouncer stares at it. Stares at it\n1st bouncer to me, \"Yo man, how old are you?\"\nMe, jokingly, thinking I was being messed with, \"21, ha ha.\"\nThey stare at. Stare at it. Stare at it. Finally the 1st bouncer yells at me, \"YOUR NOT 21!\" He backs me into a the wall, \"you better get out of here before I call the cops!\"\n\"ok fine but I need my ID back, I can't cross the border without it.\"\n\"I'm not giving this back, get the hell out of here\"\n\"Dude that's my actual ID, it literally says that I am 20, it isn't a fake, you need to give back to me.\" Guy is really fucking confused now, eventually gives it back, we leave, easily get into the bar two doors down.\n\nIt took too bouncers like 7 minutes to figure out that my Date of birth made me underage.",

            "As someone that worked in a convenience store, I don't understand how the clerk managed to fuck up the best part of their job.\n\nWhen you're the lowest rung on the ladder, paid minimum wage to sell people beer and cigarettes, you realize your one and only power: to deny alcohol sales. So you must relish that power and take care to always be correct, because there's nothing better than telling someone no *and* catching them in a lie.\n\nIt's as simple as taking the ID and asking them what their birthdate is. People will overwhelmingly respond truthfully, realizing what they've done right when they're reciting the incorrect year.\n\nThen you have a laugh, they have a laugh, and you send them on their way. Sometimes they'll try to recover \u2014 \"no way, they got my birthdate wrong!?\" \u2014 but the satisfaction in delaying someone else's fun while you're at work is still there and quite succulent.

            "A few years ago I went to buy a lighter at a gas station when I was 19 for fireworks on the Fourth of July. The guy looks at me and ask for my license. I tell him there isn't an age requirement for a lighter in Texas. (Use to be a boyscott and bought them a lot) He says he wouldn't sell it to me if I was under 18. So I was like whatever here you go. He then says Im 17 and hands it back. Now im frustrated and theres a line so I walk him through the math with my license as if he is 5, looking back it was a dick move but seriously was upset. At this point the person behind me, a big biker guy well in his 40-50's is laughing. Eventually the cashier shrugs and sells it to me. Then the biker guy puts his 6 pack on the counter roughly while saying \"Want me to do the math for you too?\". \n\n\nI use to work retail I know people can be jerks but I felt no empathy for the guy. He was very rude and did this weird head shake thing making the awww im sorry but im not really face the entire time. I dont go to that gas station anymore bc of him. ",

            "Reminds me of my own post, originally on talesfromthecustomer\n\nTLDR - The scales allegedly prove my Kia carried 8,400 pounds of trash in a single cardboard box, which I lifted and tossed into a dumpster. So, at $60 per ton tipping fee I owe $252.\n\nThe county government here runs a trash collection center (AKA \u201cthe dump\u201d). You drive over a scale on the way in and out. Charge is by weight: $60 a ton with a minimum charge of $7.50.\n\nI had removed a couple of full length mirrors and had a cardboard box containing about 30 pounds of razor-sharp glass shards. I thought of the many ways this could go wrong left out for the trash truck, and elected to take to the collection center.\n\nI drove on to the scale, got waved through, tossed the box into the dumpsters (not allowed to put mirrored glass in the recycle bin) and drove back to the scale.\n\nTrashGuy is TG. Cop and Me play ourselves.\n\nTG: \u201cThat will be $252.00 sir.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cUm, I\u2019m pretty sure you have me confused with someone else. I should owe $7.50\u201d\n\nTG checks his notes. \u201cNo, you owe $252 for 8,400 pounds.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cThat\u2019s not possible. It was one cardboard box that I lifted myself\u201d\n\nTG: \u201cSir, I have a photo of your car on the scale, with a time and weight. I have another photo of you on the scale now, with time and weight. The scale doesn\u2019t lie.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cEvidently it\u2019s possible for it to make a mistake, though.\u201d\n\nTG: \u201cNo, you weighed 12,300 pounds going in and 3,900 pounds going out. You\u2019re gonna have to pay, or if you don\u2019t have enough cash or check on you then we can have you sign the slip that you owe it and we bill you for the amount plus $35. If you don\u2019t pay then we issue a summons for your arrest.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cSurely you can just look at the weight and see there is a mistake. Is there a supervisor here? Can I see the photo?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo supervisor. If you don\u2019t pay and won\u2019t sign, then I\u2019m supposed to print out the photos as evidence and call the cops. As soon as I print it to show you, you owe the extra $35 just like we mailed it to you. If you leave without paying they arrest you.\u201d\n\nTG: \u201cI\u2019m not paying $252.\u201d\n\nCop is called, and thankfully shows up in about five minutes.\nTG: \u201cHe won\u2019t pay the $252 dumping fee.\u201d\n\nCop: \u201cWhy won\u2019t you pay?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cHe says I owe for four tons of trash. I dumped one cardboard box, maybe 30 to 40 pounds. There is no way my car coming in weighed over 12,000 pounds.\u201d\n\nCop: \u201cWhat kind of truck are you driving?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cNo truck. A Kia. That one.\u201d (point)\n\nCop: \u201cOK, I agree there is no way that thing ever weighed 12,000 pounds. The scales were wrong.\u201d (TG prints out my photos, and we all look at photo with weights and times.) \u201cHm. Ok, what vehicles were before him, and after him?\u201d\n\nTG: (Pokes around on computer, pulls up on screen, no printout.) Before me was a pickup, owed $7.50 on 100 pounds of trash. After me was a dump truck. Dumped eleven tons of scrap metal, no charge for recycle.\n\nI point out that on the photo of my car he printed out, it looks like the dumptruck behind me has it\u2019s front tires just on the scale. My \u201cin\u201d weight must be my car plus the front half of the dump truck.\n\nCop says I can go.\n\nTG: \u201cBut, he still owes at least $7.50!\u201d\n\nCop: \u201cNo. You can\u2019t prove that he actually dumped anything. You don\u2019t have accurate weights.\u201d\n\nI start to say I\u2019ll pay the $7.50 minimum but the cop looks at me and says \u201cGo. Now.\u201d\n\nI go.",

If they complained we told them that we can call the cops and they can deal with them or if they *really* wanted it back they could meet us at the back door in half an hour and we sell it back to them for $20.

Now, my friend and I live in Arizona and our licenses are set to expire years into the future (for example, I'm 25 and my license states an expiration date of my birthday in 2057). The bartender in New Jersey took one look at my friend's ID and said it was fake because of the expiration date. He said no license he's ever seen had such a ridiculous expiration date, therefore it must be fake and the police will be contacted unless he leaves. After a little bit of arguing, my friend just left and went to another bar instead.\n\nNow, I don't know if Arizona's expiration years are different than other states, but regardless this was clearly an incompetent employee if they're denying alcohol to somebody who has the proper identification and is legal to buy.

This allows them to be in city code and now when the spring hits, the neighbor is going to need to build a fence on their backside of their yard if they want to fill up their pool for the summer.\n\nIf the neighbor would have just been nice and not called the city like a Karen my friend would of build the fence up in the spring now problem.\n\nTLDR: wind damage friend\u2019s fence, friend was going to fix it in the spring.

We wanted to get it fixed as soon as his dog passed, but then he started piling wood up against our fence before we had a chance. The fence that is several feet over our property line, so the wood is on our property. \n\nHe wanted us to fix the leaning fence because it was making it hard to pile his wood up. The fencing company needs to get on his side of the fence in order to fix it, hence why we kept our fence over on our property line, in case of maintenance. We told him this and his response was, \u201cI\u2019ll put my wood wherever I want.\u201d He has 8 acres of land and our fence is the furthest place from his house. \n\nThen he called the township about our fence.

            "Haha! We ended up with a malicious compliance with our back neighbor for something similar to this. \n\nWind blew down a portion of fence between us and nice neighbors. Nice neighbors are on the corner and share their backyard fence with us and nasty neighbor. Nasty neighbor rents to a very sweet lady.\n\nThe entire fence needed to be replaced. There were portions that were rotted and starting to fall down. We coordinated with nice neighbor and single neighbor on our other side and everyone agreed to share the cost of a new fence. Nasty neighbor refused and said she installed the fence with her dad and she would just fix the parts that needed to be fixed. We told her that wasn't going to fly because the boards were all rotted and the entire thing was falling down and needed to be replaced. We weren't being jerks, we were being reasonable as the fence was 20+ years old and had never been maintained properly (we had only lived there a year at the time).\n\nTechnically, the fence was right on her property line. Cue the malicious compliance.\n\nWe marked the property line and the original survey markers and told them to install the fence on our side of the property, leaving her crappy fence up. The boards faced our side, so with the new fence, she would never be able to replace them without taking down everything on her side. \n\nAt some point, she came out with her husband and they actually looked at the fence and saw what terrible shape it was in. They contacted us, admitted it needed to be replaced, and we came to an agreement on their contribution. I like to think it was a win-win for everyone.",

So I knocked down the two walls and left the back one. Per code I was in regs now without the two walls.

            "I am right there with your friend. Here's the setup. My home has alley access to the backyard. The alley is also the sewer right of way. However, the city has neglected the alley for decades, ignoring the lean-to across the north access, the 30' tall x 2' diameter tree growing in the middle of the alley, and code violations on every fence along the several households bordering the alley. So, when I bought the property, I asked the neighbors if I could build the fence across the alley instead of building 65' along the property line. All accepted. This was 15 years ago. Last year I was siding my house by myself. A long, difficult process while working full time. The landlord across the alley threw a fit because his fence was falling down. His fence did not have the code required gate in it, so he had to access his fence through my gate. I never lock it, but he was inconvenienced, so he called code enforcement on my fence after 15 years. Of course, I was given 6 weeks to remove my fencing. They didn't care about my siding or their failure to remove the tree or the handful of code violations along the alley. I complied without malice.  Except when I was moving my fence to be within code compliance, I found my survey marker and put my fence inside it. Queue the malice! The entire line of fencing across the alley is inside the alley by 18\".  Mr. landlord is going to find himself with three properties needing new fencing, gate access to the alley, and less property, all because he threw a fit.  Further, the city will need to clear the alley they have ignored for almost as long as I've been alive. I am going to enjoy this shitshow.",

Parents drop their kids off near the easement and they can walk right to the school playground.  The school has been really good about helping us with the fence upkeep; they even sent their painters over to paint their side of the fence, and they asked if we wanted our side painted, too.  (We didn\u2019t, but that was nice of them.  We have it stained.) \n\nThe fence is, according to the maps at city hall, on the school property, but it helps both of us maintain some privacy.

After a 13 hour shift I got home and saw I had a code violation about my fence (mind you this is also in late fall / early winter timeframe). \n\nWalked out back because you cannot even see my fence from the street and I saw how much it was mangled from them manhandling the ivy off. She made the mistake of letting slip that they mentioned to the city inspector about the disrepair of the fence. After looking into my options and finding out I could take it down because it was part of my property and was put up from the prior owner I opted to remove it instead of repair. \n\nTook me maybe 30 minutes from start to finish to cut it down with my sawsall(sp?) and toss the scrap wood in the bed of my truck, the whole time I can hear the daughter screaming into the house that \u2018He\u2019s cutting it all down!\u2019\n\nThe husband had the audacity to come out that weekend when I was doing yard stuff to try to make small talk and ask when I was going to replace the fence (seriously?).

Or if it was damaged by my neighbor. \n\nIf the neighbor tries to replace the unbroken and still functional fence with something more expensive, I am not required to assist financially.

A couple days in I find a handwritten bill in my mailbox for what he said was half the cost with a threat to sue me if I didn\u2019t pay. \n\nInstead, I called the city code enforcement snitch line to report that he was building the fence on my side of the property line (where the old fence line was) and that he was putting the \u201cpretty\u201d side of the fence facing his own yard. \n\nBoth of those things are against code here and they made him tear it down & rebuild it six inches inside his property line with the nice side facing my yard.  \n\nI got a \u201cfree\u201d fence and another foot of backyard just because he had to be a dick.",

The neighbours in a third house that ran along the side of our driveway asked if they could cut down the trees that ran along the driveway and put up a fence to keep their kids in their front yard. Mum said yeah that's fine I don't really like those trees anyway.  \nAnyway the trees are cut down and suddenly a letter from the council shows up and the neighbours have invoked the fencing act on us. Demanding $5k for a fancy new fence with a the bells and whistles. The act requires that 2 neighbours go half cost each in a fence if one demands it. There was no discussion or request just boom straight to the legal route.  \nNow the fencing act was designed for a rural situation to prevent livestock from wandering not a tight suburban environment like we were in so it specifies that in a dispute the defending neighbour only has to pay for half of the cost of a post and wire livestock fence that any numpty with a post hole borer, some posts, roll of no8 wire and a staple gun can sort out, so that's all mum paid for. She got 3 quotes from the cheapest fencers out there to build the cheapest fence and paid half the average cost like $300. And the neighbours were out $9700 for their fancy fence.",

[From findlaw.com](https://www.findlaw.com/realestate/neighbors/fencing-on-property-line-who-pays-for-and-maintains-it.html):\n\n>**Who Pays for and Maintains a Partition Fence?**\n\n>Local fence laws determine who is responsible for paying for and maintaining partition fences, so it is important to check your state and local ordinances. However, in most jurisdictions, both property owners must equally pay for and maintain a fence that runs on or close to a property line.\n\n>This is typically true even if one neighbor made a unilateral decision to erect the fence. The reason both neighbors are on the hook for the cost and maintenance of a partition fence is because it's assumed that both neighbors benefit from the fence.\n\n>In practice, this means that if Neighbor A decides to build a fence on the property line shared with Neighbor B, Neighbor B generally has to pay for half of it. Additionally, Neighbor B is responsible for maintaining the fence (and yard that leads up to the fence) on his or her side. If the fence is damaged or in need of replacement, generally, both Neighbor A and Neighbor B must pay for repairs or replacement 50/50.",

That said, there likely was an arrangement with the prior home owner. \n\nFor example, I have a fence around my entire yard. My neighbor, who installed a pool, asked if they could just tie two sides of their fence into mine (it actually just ended up being a post planted up against my fence with a single bracket at the top to keep the gap closed). That way it saves them  the cost of 1 whole side. I was happy with it because it added additional structural strength to mine. \n\nThe prior owners might have had a similar agreement to save the neighbor money. And the neighbor wants it fixed because if it isn't and a kid or dog gets into their pool and drowns then they are held liable (civil or criminally depending on whether it's a pet or person). \n\nShould they have demanded it? No. Should they have gone straight to the city after 1 attempt? Also no. But I get their motivations.
