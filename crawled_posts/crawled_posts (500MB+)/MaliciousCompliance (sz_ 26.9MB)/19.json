Short hand is not permitted.\u201d \n\nI work in a call center taking information for admissions of new medical clients. So the people reading my charts/notes will be medical professionals. The only abbreviations used are those commonly known in the practice, such as IOP (intensive outpatient), ASAP (who doesn\u2019t know this?), etc (come on now). \n\nSo I have adopted their rule to the letter. I wrote every single thing out that would typically be abbreviated. Sometimes the notes require that times be recorded. Example: \u201cI set the callback expectation for by 10AM.\u201d\n\n\nIn my most recent scoring I was marked off for using \u201cspelling errors in notes\u201d. When I requested a review of my score, my supervisor advised me that writing \u201cante meridiem\u201d was what caused me to lose points. I kindly cited the new rule that requires no abbreviations be used. My supervisor stated that he had never heard the term ante meridiem before. I explained what it meant, being the long form of the term AM. My score was amended to reflect no error was made.",

BUT, here comes so many caveats,\n\n1. They should approach in a respectful manner.\n2. They should respect the other person's right to say no, and retreat if indicated that way. (Which was not the case here)\n\nNow, if someones approaches someone adhering to above two points, still if I put myself in women's shoes, I will be annoyed.

He tried to appeal but was shot down unanimously. So he checked the by laws further and found that while it was stated that all exposed walls must be painted, there was absolutely no mention of any color restrictions.\n\nBy the time he was done each plank was a different primary color and there was nothing they could do about it. They were furious with him and he laughed his ass off.\n\nEdit: this blew up. I didn't think it was all that interesting, just a story of a guy I used to know. To answer a few questions/comments:\n\nThis was back in the early 90s. The HOA was created years after the neighborhood had been established.

Fisherman would frequently stop by our store to buy them to fish with and they were sold by the dozen. Usually, when I  scooped bait, I would give a few extra fish to my customers. I had one Russian lady come in to purchase bait fish, so just as I normally did, I scooped a net full of fish and started dumping them in the bag counting them individually, and added a few extra to the bag. The lady watched me do this but insisted that I did not give her the correct amount. I assured her that I not only gave her the dozen she paid for but I gave her a few extra. I literally just counted and have done this long enough that I was really good at eyeing when it was over a dozen. This lady just kept insisting that I didn't give her enough so I said, \" Okay, let's count together just to be sure.\"  \n\n\nSo I dump all the fish from the bag back into the net and we started counting together very slowly \"1....2...3...4...ect...\" We get to 12 and it's very clear there are several extra fish still in the net. I  look up at her and I was like \"Ohhh you were right, I didn't give you the right amount.\" I then proceeded to dump the remaining fish back into the tank right in front of her and gave her exactly the amount she paid for.\n\nUpdate: She ended up just looking bewildered when I handed the fish back to her and left.

But said cylinders could also be used for paintball.  So these old paintballer farts would come in to get their tanks refilled, and _demand_ they be filled to 3000PSI, and want to watch the process.  So... we filled them to exactly 3000PSI every time.

        "selftext": "Update at the bottom.  Thanks so much for the up votes and silver, gold and platinum. I really didn't think this would take off like this.\n\nSome backstory; I was a general troubleshooter for my company. My job involved a lot of travelling to different clients we support. My area of work is Ontario, Canada (where I am based out of) and some of the nearby States in the United States (New York, massachusetts,  Vermont, Pennsylvania.) I did most of my travelling by car since my schedule can change quite quickly and flying can become very expensive. I had one colleague who is technically my subordinate but we have a very good working relationship and would often handle calls independently of each other only checking in by phone once a week and in person once a month / when necessary. \n\nA little over a year ago I get an email calling me to the head office in New York City for a meeting with the CEO and the board of directors regarding my job.  I check with my colleague and he got the same email. So we make our travel plans and meet in New York City the following week.  We have dinner together the night before our meeting and can't figure out between us what the issue is about (it's rare to get summoned to head office and more rare for things to be so vague).\n\nWhen we go into the meeting the next day we are informed that the company is dividing our department between the US and Canada and that there would be a new person to deal with the US clients and we were to restrict ourselves to Canada. Both my colleague and I were a little shocked at this since neither of us has even heard this was being discussed. I asked who the new person for the US was and we then learned that it was a new hire that the CEO had taken a special interest in. \n\nTrying to be of good spirit I offered to train the new person. (There are many realities of the job that are not in the job description). CEO accepted and then brought in the new hire. In walks a young lady who looks about 23 years old and wears an expression that she knows everything.  She sits at the table and immediately makes it very clear that she wants nothing to do with us.\n\nCEO - Bob, New Hire - Karen, My Colleague - Jim.\n\nBob: Welcome Karen, we have just informed OP and Jim about the change in structure and they are willing to give you the support you need to get yourself started. \n\nKaren and Bob both look at me.\n\nMe: Glad to have you aboard Karen, I think both Jim and I have a lot of experience to share with you and we are happy to do so, perhaps it would be better in a separate meeting so we don't take the board's time. \n\nKaren: Thank you all. I have a lot of ideas about how I can streamline our department and new policies I can introduce that should save the company a lot of money in expenses. \n\nI'm very confused at this point. Karen is speaking as though she is my supervisor and that is distinctly not what Bob spoke to us about.  I can see some of the board members giving strange looks at this as well.\n\nMe: Bob perhaps I misunderstood the new roles here. Would you please clarify?\n\nBob: Sure, Karen is the new head of your department and both you and Jim will answer directly to her.\n\nBoard member: That isn't what we discussed or approved as a board.  We weren't fully convinced of dividing the department but this is completely against what we discussed.\n\nKaren: What did you discuss then?\n\nBoard Member: That your department would be divided between the US and Canada.  OP and Jim would remain north of the border and you would run the US.  \n\nKaren: That's not what I was told but I can work with that.  As long as these two stay out of my way. (Indicating me and Jim)\n\nJim and I are both shocked and insulted to be spoken of in this manner. We are both very good at our jobs and before today have never seen this woman in our lives. \n\nBob: That settles it, OP, effective immediately, you and Jim are to have nothing to do with Karen. Do not interfere with her work at all.  You are both to restrict yourselves to working within Canada only.\n\nWith that he ended the meeting and left the room with Karen close behind him.  Jim and I sat there stunned for a moment and some of the board members came up to us to express their shock and sympathies about this. I had enough presence of mind to ask if we would get a written directive of this change and was assured we would. Sure enough both Jim and I got emails with the new directive from Bob by the end of the day. \n\nSo after sending an email to all our US based clients advising them of the change and giving them the contact information of Karen, Jim and I made our way back to Toronto and reorganized ourselves for working within Ontario only. This meant much less travelling for us so it gave us more room to breathe. \n\nWithin a week I was getting complaints from our US based clients that Karen was not answering emails and missing appointments.  I forwarded these emails to Karen and copied the entire board including Bob. Another week later I get a phone call from Karen who sounds frantic but will not admit she needs help.  She makes pleasant conversation and then asks how I would handle a particular type of situation.  I tell her I'm really not interested in discussing work as that might be seen as interfering in her work.  Later that evening I get a call from Jim telling me he had the same conversation with Karen and handled it the same way.\n\nBy the end of that month I get a call from Bob asking if I will take over the entire department again. I politely tell him no since I didn't want to interfere with Karen and her role.  For the next 3 months I'm getting emails and phone calls from US clients asking if they can have me back as their contact. This confirms an idea that had been in my head. \n\nJim and I had actually grown our client base in Ontario since restricting ourselves here. So I had lunch with Jim one day and asked him if he wanted to go into businesses with me as partners starting our own consulting firm. We couldn't provide everything our current company provided but we could provide a high degree of professionalism for our specific field and it seemed we had a ready made client base. By the end of the lunch he was on board and we started the necessary steps to get ourselves setup.\n\nAs soon as we were clear we both submitted our resignations with explanations of why. The next time clients contacted us we told them we no longer worked for the company.  When they asked if we still worked in the field we told them we had established our own firm and what services we offered.  A month later we had 60% of our US clients on board, and since the former company had no Canadian support at all, we had 80% of the Canadian clients. Within 2 months we had 80% of the US and 90% of the Canadian clients. \n\nIn the year since that time our new company has grown enough that we have hired 7 new consultants. Jim and I find ourselves doing more office work than road work, and a lot of client courting. Our old company has had to stop offering the in person troubleshooting (what our department did) and Bob was fired by the board.  No idea what happened to Karen.\n\n\n\nUpdates:  \n\nBecause of interest expressed in the comments I made a phone call to one of the board members I remained on friendly terms with. Here are some answers to questions. \n\nHow did Karen get the Job?  Apparently Bob had set up a business school scholarship out of his own money which had put something like 6 or 7 students through business school. Karen was the latest graduate and Bob wanted to give her a start in the business world.\n\nWas Bob sleeping with Karen?  No clear answer was given. But Bob's wife divorced him shortly after he was fired from the company.  Make of that what you will.\n\nWhat happened to Karen?  Apparently she got a job as middle management in a financial services company. Hopefully she can still build a life for herself and had learned some important lessons. \n\nWhat happened to Bob?  Last heard he was a regional director for a large hotel chain. Hopefully he also lands on his feet. Everyone deserves a chance  to make a life for themselves. \n\nSome questioned why the board was there for this meeting. I honestly don't know and neither did the board member I spoke with. It was one of their regularly scheduled meetings and Bob added things to the agenda. \n\nSome questioned my use of non competes saying its not nice. Its a normal reality in the business world. The oddity is that my old company did not have one.  The non compete I have my employees sign is not overly burdensome. It protects our intellectual property and professional contacts.  It does not in any way restrict the employees ability to work in the field. That said, Jim and I have both agreed that if an employee leaves us on good terms and reasonably asks to be released from the non compete we would oblige. \n\nSome inquired if we are still hiring. Unfortunately we are not. We are taking a pause from expansion right now as Jim's wife is dealing with cancer. I don't want Jim to worry about the office while taking care of his wife so we have decided to maintain our size (which I can do with minimal input from Jim) until his wife is in remission and he has a chance to rest and return his attention more fully to our company.  Jim and I treat each other like family. So this is a natural step for us. \n\nThank you all so much for your interest and the great feedback and discussion in the comments. \n\nEdit.

Well first of all, that wasn't part of the severance agreement, but we no konger had the income to afford a lawyer, so we simply didn't get the severance. Afterwards my dad started his own business with a VP who also got shoved out of the company(and was supposed to get like, 1 millsion dollars from his share of the company, still hasn't gotten it after decades of legal battles), using some contacts he had from his previous business (not giving names, but it's the kind of business that two or three contracts is enough for a two man business to prosper). The old business was a technical job, and all the people capable of doing the job had gotten forced out for objecting to the takeover. As a result, there was no one left to actually do the work required and their clients bailed. They then tried to sue my dad claiming he had aigned a non-compete, which was a lie, but my dad had just started his business and couldn't afford a lawyer. Thankfully, a family friend who was a very accomplished lawyer basically threatened the company with a letter promising to defend us if they didn't drop it, so they gave up. Eventually the company folded, and my dad's business is prospering, but the asshole who started all this is still propsering running a snow even for one of the companies they had a contract with.

Spent a couple or few months traveling around with you guys, getting to know you both, having you do the client introductions, all while stepping into her role. During which she could show she has talent and ability, but is also willing to learn expertise from those who have it. Making the two of you valuable resources in her future. Having you guys introduce her to clients not by email as your replacement, but in person as \"this is who you'll be working with now and she's great\". Which goes such a long way I really can't over emphasize it either. \n\nIn the end she could have come out with a lot of experience. What sounds like an incredible job for 23.

The day before Mother\u2019s Day I was about 10 minutes late punching in to work. I was coming from my primary job, changed clothes when I got there and punched in. The manager immediately pulled me aside and said that I needed to be more courteous to my coworkers and show up on time as my being late effects other people. I responded that I was aware and I did call in to let them know I would be late and that the person who answered was the person I was taking over for and that she said to take my time because she was just going home and spending the night in alone, no big deal.\n\nThe manager laid into me. She told me that I\u2019m not the type of person that can hack having 2 jobs, that I was too inconsiderate to work 2 jobs, and that maybe I should choose which job I value more and quit the other one, and that if I quit the Olive Garden that I would NOT be welcomed back. Initially, I thought \u201cwell I\u2019m not going to let you chase me away.\u201d But then I realized, this is a second job. I don\u2019t have to be here. I don\u2019t have to let her talk to me that way. I went home and told my s/o (who also worked there as a second job) what was said. We mutually decided that I should quit the Olive Garden.\n\nSo I went in for my morning Mother\u2019s Day shift wearing my street clothes, went to the back office to find the manager, and said \u201cso, I put a lot of thought into what you said and have decided that you were right and working here, for you, is not for me anymore.\u201d She looked stunned and said \u201cWell you\u2019re going to work today, right? You know Mother\u2019s Day is our busiest day of the year, you can\u2019t just up and quit, today of all days!\u201d I said \u201cWell maybe this will be a lesson for you on how to speak to your employees and how to be a decent human being. Besides, you said yourself I\u2019m too inconsiderate to work here.\u201d and I walked out. Have not set foot in another Olive Garden since.",

My retail job kept scheduling me earlier than my availability allowed (10am, but they scheduled me for 6:45am) I couldn\u2019t be there because I was working my warehouse job. Management kept telling me I should quit my warehouse job so I can work more hours at the retail job.

I said \"do you really think that putting me on report for going to church is going to end well for any of you?\"  They capitulated, but overrode my schedule again.  I sent a one line email to HR copying all the managers at that store saying something to the effect of, \"The hiring manager agreed to my availability and continues to change it without talking to me first - I have much higher priorities than stocking USB drives.\"\n\nNever had a schedule override again, still quit 2 months later.",

            "Unfortunately being employed by Olive Garden hasn\u2019t changed much. I know somebody who used to work doubles for them all the time and the managers were so pleased that they were talking about training her to be a manager. Then she got Covid and had to miss work, and all of a sudden she was their worst employee and she was written up. They also started over staffing so the waiters weren\u2019t making enough in tips to live on. Luckily she was able to quit and move on.\n\nJust don\u2019t work for them, they suck.",

            "I worked for Olive Garden for four years to pay my way through college. When covid hit I got laid off same as everyone else. I was so bored/terrified that I went and found a job elsewhere. I waited 10 weeks for them to call me back into work at Olive garden and went back a few nights a week. I was by far one of the strongest servers there and frequently took large sections to bail them out because they were short staffed. The manager was a control freak because his wife controlled everything he did at home. I can\u2019t tell you how many times he tried to catch me with a nit pick and lost \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 they demanded that we start working more shifts and started scheduling everyone outside of their availability. Even before covid they were never staffed appropriately and we were frequently out of dishes/breadsticks and the kitchen was constantly behind. People started tipping less and less. I went from making 40+ dollars an hour with my tips to ten or less some nights working more hours with extra tables. One day after a 70 hour work week at my new main job the manager decided to get picky about my uniform. (Mind you, it was a Friday night and there was myself and 1 other server on a Friday night when there are normally 20 servers on the floor) so after almost 5 years of putting up with him I cashed out and left.

My wife, to celebrate our first Christmas as a married couple put a white rope light on the railing on our 2 foot grilling area.    It, was nice little gesture.  \n\nThat night we went out to dinner and when we came home, found a letter under our door.  The letter read \"All holiday lights must be removed immediately from the exterior portion of the condo.  Christmas or other religious lighting is against HOA policy and failure to remove can result in fines and other legal actions.\"  My wife felt horrible and I couldn't believe it.  The owner of the condo had left a copy of the HOA regulations and I found a nice little loophole.  Apparently, they could regulate lights on the exterior balcony/grilling area, but not lights inside the condo. Game on.\n\nI took my wife immediately to the big box hardware store and picked up two fake Christmas trees, about 2,000 colored lights, a light ball and whatever holiday decoration I could find.  Our condo had 3 windows and the sliding glass door.  I filled up each one of those windows with lights, crisscrossing, around the inside of the perimeter of the window and one had the led ball hanging in the center.  The sliding door had the Christmas tree in full view completely covered in lights and ornaments.  Also the sliding doors were full of Christmas lights. My electric bill must have tripled.  When you came into the parking lot of the Condo complex, you saw a beacon of light full of Christmas spirit.  You probably could see the condo from orbit. And, nothing could be said by the HOA snitch.\n\nApparently at the next board meeting, a proposed rule change was brought up to limit the amount of \"holiday lighting\" being shown through windows.  It was quietly pointed out by another HOA board member that was an attorney that you probably could not regulate activities inside a person's dwelling.\n\nI moved out before next year, but I never received another notice.",

The title should probably read this: \u201cBob Doesn\u2019t care about your allergies\u201d\n\nthis happened about 5 years ago, and I haven't been to the home depot in question in a long time. Names have been changed for privacy.\n\nIn high school, I was working at the local home depot as a head cashier. I kept track of all the active registers and made sure things ran smoothly. I held this position for quite some time (1-2 years) and enjoyed it pretty well. Customers were nice, and my coworkers were mostly craftsmen and gardeners, all with interesting stories to share. \n\nbefore we go further, let me explain something. I am allergic to nearly every form of pollen. I mean EVERY form. I take allergy medication, but even then if I am in close proximity to flowers for too long (>30 minutes) I will begin to break out in hives and throwup most of the time. \n\nso after about three months working in the winter, the spring season was upon us (the worst season for my allergies). \n\nOne day, about three of our garden section cashiers called off sick. They are pretty reliable people so I had no problem finding people to cover for them. As I come to my manager to inform them of the position changes, my manager looks at me and says \"You can handle the garden section on your own, can't you?\".\n\nI inform my manager that I could cover it for at most 15 minutes before my allergies flare up and ill have to leave. \n\nhe states \"we don't have any documents on file that state you are not fit to work in the garden section, so unless you come to me with a doctor's note stating your allergies, I couldn't give less of a fuck.\"\n\nI don't know who shit in his cheerios that morning, but I complied, saying \"I want to be sure of what you are asking, you want me to work in a section which is hazardous to my health instead of placing equally capable employees in that section?\"\n\n\"Did I stutter?\" he said\n\n\"Ok, sure,\" I said\n\nI make my way down to the garden section, and immediately my eyes are stinging. I decide that I am going to stick it out for my boss's sake, no matter how shitty my service becomes.\n\nthe first 10 minutes are pretty uneventful, but then a customer asks me about the rash on my arms\n\n\"The Home Depot does not care about allergies,\" I say \"as I do not have official paperwork\"\n\nthis customer looks extremely concerned, asking for my manager's name.\n\nat this point, I was feeling nausea hit me, I throw up in the trash can at the register, turn back to smile (as well as I could) and say \" I work under Bob \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\".\n\nThe customer reassures me that I will be ok, and tells me I should head home. Turns out, this guy, Nick \\_\\_\\_\\_, was a higher-up at the home depot's regional management and was my boss's boss. So, naturally, I comply with the chain of command and head to the locker room to pack up.\n\nAs I am packing, Bob \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ comes in, fuming and cursing, telling me I have no right to leave yet and that my shift is not over for another 5 hours. \n\nI simply say \"Nick \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ told me to go home\"\n\nBob's face gets redder as he threatens to fire me, saying I was lying and tells me to go back out.\n\n**I comply, knowing that I will see Nick on my way out.**\n\nI pass nick, still in the orange apron, and he asks me where I am going. I say that Bob told me to go back to work. Nick's expression goes from concerned to furious, as he takes my apron from me and tells me I'll be paid for the full shift and to go home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI come into work the next day to see that Bob's nameplate has been removed from the office. I ask our HR rep what happened, and apparently, after I had left, Nick stormed Bob's office and proceeded to perform an audit on all of his past employee complaints. This guy had been throwing out complaints for the past **5 years**. Needless to say, there was an opening for the store management position, and I was given a week's vacation for my troubles. My satisfaction was huge.\n\nEdit: I realize now that the title may look like I am putting down Home Depot. That wasn\u2019t my intent, I just wanted to recount my experience.",

I could take allergy medicine, or my doctor said I could try allergy treatments where I either get a weekly shot or take daily drops under my tongue.\n\nI opted for the drops since it\u2019s more convenient for me. They make a custom mixture of my allergens so I slowly build up an immunity. I\u2019m about 6 months in & it seems to be making a significant difference.\n\nMight be something to consider so you don\u2019t have to feel miserable a good chunk of the year. If you can start soon, you may have built up a bit of an immunity by the time allergy season arrives.\n\nSucks you had to deal with that shitty boss & glad it had a happy ending for you!",

I had mentioned the offer offhand one day and he started pestering me to get him scheduled to come in, so I talked to the professor and we got my dad a day to come in. He spent the whole hour talking about the differences between Eastern and Western Europe from the lens of a visitor, everything from the cultural differences (especially in East/West Germany and Berlin) to architectural differences of buildings made before/during/after the Cold War, and even how it used to be that you could tell whether you were in formerly East or West Berlin based on the color of the streetlights. It was really neat, and at one point he and the professor were just talking about Poland for about ten minutes -- my dad got to bring up his favorite irrelevant fact, that his great grandfather was born in Warsaw during a period of time where it was owned by Russia, so his birth certificate is a little unique. \n\nI got a shitton of extra credit.",

Not a long time, but it was enough to realize it wasn't for me. \n\nEvery quarter, I would provide 2-3 extra credit assignments and offer an extra credit question on most quizzes/tests. I would also allow any student to retake any assignment (tests included) in order to earn a better grade, provided that they turned it in on time in the first place.\n\nBut here's the thing, the extra credit assignments were always just a little bit tougher than the normal coursework. They're *extra* credit, right? So you need to show that you understand the core concepts of the material being taught, and that you're able to expand that knowledge just a little bit *extra* to complete the assignments satisfactorily. If that's too hard for you, then feel free to redo any/all other process-based assignments to review the basics of what we learned. Again, that was always, always an option. And I talked about it all the time.\n\nAt the end of every quarter, like clockwork, I would get a rash of emails from parents or requests from students asking for extra credit work.

Adding more work to their load could negatively impact their grades and morale, considering it\u2019s extra time to devote to more work. And most people with overbearing parents would probably agree: the last thing they would want is to have to spend that extra time listening to their parents talking about historic/political events. They probably already have heard \u201chow much harder\u201d it was for their parents growing up, and it\u2019d get turned into an extra lecture on being grateful for the opportunities they\u2019re being given, etc, etc. I\u2019m just speaking from my own experience as a kid with overbearing parents would sound like the parents in this story. \n\nAnyway, IMO, extra credit assignments really should be for kids whose grades could use the boost, not for kids whose grades already sit at the top.

            "As a teacher I am incredibly against this.\n\nNot all kids will have the parents willing to do your stupid assignments but some will actually do it and then you will need to give those kids points.\n\nJust put your foot down and say there are no extra credit assignments in your class like I do.\n\nAdmin cannot force you to give extra credit assignments at all. If admin wanted to fire me over something like that I would just grab unemployment checks for a while while picking a district that wasn\u2019t run by fucking nut jobs.\n\nFind a district where your admin doesn\u2019t make you beholden to random parents whims that have nothing to do with how well you\u2019re addressing standards and learning objectives.",

            "Gonna be devils advocate here:\n\nStudent A is on track to be Valedictorian. They have worked hard all through high school and have completed every extra credit assignment and taken every advanced course. \n\nStudent B is on track to be Salutatorian. Like student A, Student B also completes extra credit and takes advanced courses. \n\nStudent A gets put in this teachers class. Student B gets put in the other class, where the content is the same but he is given tons of extra credit opportunities. Suddenly, through no fault of her own, Student A is no longer Valedictorian but Salutatorian, all because her teacher wanted to be pedantic about extra credit assignments.\n\nThe social sciences (which OP said is the subject this teacher is teaching) should be equally giving either the same extra credit or no extra credit. At this level of academics, grades can change a student\u2019s life and determine how many scholarships they get.",

When fighting for limited slots and selection committees are forced to distinguish, the A+s will have an advantage over the As.",

            "Question: when you turn your grades in, does that A+ equal a 5.0 over an 4.0 for an A?\n\nFormer teacher and our department rule was extra credit at most only brought you up a half grade if you were at 90%, up to a whole grade if lower simply because the report cards/GPAs didn\u2019t go passed 4.0 so\u2026 you know, no need to make anyone do extra work\u2026and no way for the slackers to only do last minute extra credit assignments and still get an A. \n\nIf the GPAs do go into 5.0 territory, then yeah, that sucks for the kids trying to compete at the school level for valedictorian say\u2026at that level though.",
            "Perfect! Let the parents know what a time/energy/overwhelming burden they place on their kids when parents expect A+.

When I was in my first advanced class in middle school, my parents were used to me being an AB student. That first quarter in advanced classes I brought home Cs for the first time ever. My parents were upset and parent teacher conferences were coming up. When they got to the conference they immediately asked my teacher why I was getting a C instead of an A or B. My teacher calmly told them that the class was a lot more difficult than a regular class, and that the C in the advanced class was better than an A in a regular class. My parents stopped complaining after that and were proud of me being in advanced classes rather than having higher grades in regular classes.",
