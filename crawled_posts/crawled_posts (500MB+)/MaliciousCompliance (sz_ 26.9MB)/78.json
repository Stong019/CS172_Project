        "selftext": "So I work at at a major University in the USA. I run a night crew that works a swing shift. Every 6 months or so, upper management likes to have some all staff meetings where everyone in our department shows up to listen to them talk about how great they are. Overall, pretty big waste of time. First one I ever went to, I was forced to go by my previous supervisor. I had to be there at 10am for a 90 minute meeting. My normal start time was 4pm so this was a HUGE inconvenience. The next year, that Supervisor had left and I was the new Supervisor. I knew another meeting was coming because I had received several emails about it. However, I had read the contract and it's required that any temporary shift change requires 48 hours **written notice.** So I decide to say nothing. Finally, less than 24 hours before the event, we finally receive our notice. I immediately reply saying that they failed to give us 48 hours notice and we would not be attending. My manager was initially upset because I didn't say anything earlier. I informed him that wasn't my job and pointed to the contract. He eventually gave in and said, \"Fine, you don't have to come. Next time we will give you more notice.\"\n\nHowever, I decided to make this a larger issue. I spoke to the Director, who was also upset we wouldn't be attending. So, I offered that we could do a smaller event for the night crew. Long story short, ever since then we now have a separate event at night. Turns out there is far more than just our shop. There are several other groups, including custodians who also don't have to adjust their shifts. I never intended it to be that far reaching, but that simple rule saved us a ton of heart ache. No one thinks about the night crew lol.",

I told them that me coming in at 3:00 PM for a meeting was the equivalent of THEM coming in at 3:00 AM for the same thing. If THEY weren't willing to come in on MY schedule, I wasn't coming in on theirs. Furthermore, if it didn't pertain to my job and ONLY affected day shift, send it in an email or write a memo and put it in my mailbox (pre-email days.)\n\nI never had a problem after that, because the managers realized I was right.",

I\u2019d have to come home, sleep 2 hours or so, go into work, have that stupid meeting, go back home, sleep another 4 hours or so, and then get up and go back to work? Nope, not happening. I\u2019ll quit before I do some bullshit like that. Every once in awhile we have a mandatory class. I\u2019ll call in sick the night before so I can sleep before the class, and call in the night of the class because I\u2019m not going to get up at 7am to attend a class and stay up until 7am the next morning.",

            "When I worked 3rd shift we always got the shit end of the stick when it came to meetings. The management would schedule \u201cimportant\u201d all hands on deck meetings at 8am. It\u2019s near impossible to shutdown an entire manufacturing facility quickly and without waste so \u201call hands on deck\u201d means all machines keep going so the incoming shift goes to the meeting at their normal start time and the incumbent shift stays over. THEN the 3rd shifters go to an identical meeting when 1st shift is done with theirs. \n\nThat meant sometimes the 3rd shifters ended up leaving 1-1.5 hours later than normal. Lots of people missed getting kids to school, missing appointments etc. Notice was often the day(evening) of and attendance was mandatory. Management would brook no insubordination when they wanted to us plebs. \n\nI didn\u2019t care, I was always there 1-2 hours later as I had stuff to pass on to supervisors and engineers, so I just started filling out the attendance sheet for people that needed to roll at their normal times. Yeah it was technically theft, but giving essentially no notice and draconian adherence to the point system was threatening people\u2019s livelihoods. It has since been modified to EVERY shift gets a piece of the overlap now and the demi-gods that are management have to work around shift change time, the poor things.",
            "Lol when I worked night shift in California I had to come in for an all staff meeting during the day.  Because the meeting took place less than 8 hours before my next shift I informed my manager that legally I could not work that night and they would have to cover. \n\nThey ended up getting me to agree to an exception on the condition I got overtime for the full shift.  I was never invited to an all staff meeting again.  \n\nThey wondered why I didn\u2019t care about anyone in the day shift, but any time there was a staff party I was never left a single slice of cake or pizza.",
            "Work nights mostly with a paving crew, few years ago they had the Christmas party and give out bonuses and food etc etc, but it started at 11 am and noone on nights was getting up for that, called corporate and said I was taking the guys out for dinner before the next shift on the company card since noone thought about the crews working night shift.\n\nI took them to a 5 star Brazilian Steak house near where we were working and racked up over $1700 bill plus tip put it on the Company card and enjoyed the rest of the night as we were too stuffed to actually get any production done.\n\n3 weeks later at the end of the month it starts running around the office about how I took the guys out, district manager is frothing at the mouth about how much we spent and how we didn't get approval, so i called our corporate office put it on speaker and let the HR lady ream out the district manager for not taking night shift into consideration and making us work the night before the party.\n\nSince then we have had 2 more Night shift Christmas parties, this year I got us a catered suite at a Tampa Bay Lightning game, the CEO showed up for that one \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23",

            "Once on night shift, I was working as 'mandatory personnel' so I had to work 12 hour shifts; 3 days on, 4 days off, 4 days on, 3 days off.    \n\n\nThe end of my 4 days on I am told at 0600 I have to stick around for another 3-5 hours to sit through some briefings that are *super mandatory*.  I tell my supervisor that it is a bad idea as I just worked 12, and am on 'crew rest' and people are very fussy about that. I would 'probably not get in huge trouble for sleeping in the front row of the auditorium in front of the full bird once I showed this instruction describing what crew rest was, that I just so happened to have in my pocket, but my supervisor might'  \n\n\nThey found a way for night shift to do it later pretty quickly.

You know where my ass was? HOME.\n\nMandatory my ass.\n\nLuckily my current manager is smart enough that if he wants us to have a meeting he shows his ass up at 6:30am before night shift goes home or he comes in at 6:30 p.m. before day shift goes home.",

Sorry Sarge, just got off work. Wanted to charge me with AWOL, so called my OIC and had him dress down 1St Sgt for overstepping his authority. Why won't they learn night owls will always win?",
            "Please *please* *please* tell me this meant that a day dwelling piece of sh*t had to come in and torture everyone with their grandstanding and self absorbed \"look at me!\" rhetoric.\n\nAlways loved it when \"guest speakers\" or union shysters at my graveyard custodial job had to come in on our turf/time schedule.\n\nCould tell the tired and worn out ones that was seething underneath at having to be up at a time they could be enjoying late night television with the ball and chain instead...\n\nAlways warmed my cynical heart to see them suffer for their inability to have any options for 3rd shift workers that pull their asses out of the fire more then any other shift in the company.\n\nNeed to see a union rep? Drive 100 miles round trip or take a bus to Los Angeles. Banking Questions with the company credit union? Schedule time for a day dweller appointment when you should be winding down and sleeping...

It\u2019s always fun explaining why my phone will light up with the name \u201cMergatroid \u2764\ufe0f\u201d and I answer with \u201chey Ma\u201d. I usually only whip it out nowadays when she\u2019s not paying attention to me and I really want her to, typically because I\u2019m doing/saying something just to annoy her lol. It\u2019s great when she\u2019s trying to ignore me in public, she will starts whisper yelling at me and her face gets red. God I love it. She put me on this earth, it is my sworn duty to embarrass/annoy her at any given opportunity. She chose this, not me.",

If it is still hurtful to your mom, and OP still does it anyway twenty years on, but OP loves their mom otherwise, I\u2019d encourage OP to talk with mom about why it is hurtful and why it is still happening.\n\nI miss my dad and there are so many hurtful things I said which I thought were funny or clever or that \u201che needed to hear\u201d, but which I recoil from the memory of now.  It adds another layer of mourning on top of the loss- wishing I could take it back, wishing I could tell him I was wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, if Mother deserves this, if she has shown in other ways that she does not deserve to be \u201cmommy\u201d, I might stop it anyway, particularly once OP has a kid of their own.  Little ones learn how to treat their parents by watching others, even if we don\u2019t realize it, and this might be a good spot to correct that tradition before it becomes fate.",

The HR director, Kelly, handed me a stack of resumes, told me about a friend's daughter, and bumped \"Kat\" to the top of my interview list. Kat passed the tech test with high scores and interviewed well so, I hired her.\n\nKat showed up to work on time, had a good attitude, performed well on assignments, and was generally a pleasant person all around. After probation, Kat was excited to tell me that her last raise was enough to get an apartment with her BF.\n\nIt was a couple months after her raise I started to notice Kelly spending an inordinate amount of time talking to Kat. The convos sounded personal / cordial and Kelly was friends with Kat's mom so, I didn't think much about it... until one day Kelly barges in my office.\n\n\"Did you know Kat moved into an apartment with her boyfriend?\"\n\n\"I might have heard something about that.\"\n\n\"Well, Kat is pregnant and her mom is devastated...\" and proceeds to fill me in on the details on Kat's personal life.\n\nUncomfortablly, I interrupt acting like I have a lot going on.\n\n\"This really isn't any of my business.  If there's something related to Kat's performance that we need to discuss, please fill me in but as for me Kat is doing a great job.\"\n\nA few months pass. Kat's baby bump is starting to show. Kelly is again in my office.\n\n\"Kat is not in compliance with the dress code.\"\n\nLast staff meeting, Kelly handed out a dress code policy with a collage  various womens shoes and dresses and suits presumably cut from fashion magazines to assist us determine what was acceptable from what was not. I picked up the policy and the Clipart sheets with a stare reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's I'm Of A Mind To Make Some Mookie! Batman / Joker scene.\n\n\"Is she wearing something in the 'not allowed' clippings?\" As I began to spread the clip art around my desk.\n\n\"She isn't wearing maternity clothes\" as Kelly points to the bullet about maternity clothes in the policy.\n\n\"Well, the policy clearly says maternity wear is allowed. Kat is clearly pregnant and she is wearing clothes, so...\"\n\n\"You know what I mean when I say maternity clothes. Clothes from a maternity store!\"\n\nI told Kelly that I would talk to Kat, which I did. Kat filled me in that there was some drama with her mom not liking her BF, that Kelly is involved. etc. etc. I just told her to read the policy and be sure she complies - and no matter what, to trust me: I had her back.\n\nThe next day Kelly is in my office telling me that Kat is again not in compliance with the dress code. At this point Kelly knows I'm getting frustrated.\n\n \"OK. I'll talk to her again. This time I want you present because I'm going to give her a formal warning and assign remedial training.\"\n\nI bring Kat into my office with Kelly present and formally read off my prepared statement making it clear that it will go into her permanent file.\n\n \"Kat, you were given a verbal warning yesterday to comply with this dress code. Because it is not clear to me what is or is not a violation of this policy, you are to report to the HR office 10 minutes early every morning for the next two weeks for dress code inspection. Report to me if HR finds your dress unfit. If you are found to be in violation of this policy and are unable to correct your dress before the start of the work day, your employment will be terminated.\"\n\nBy the time I'm finished, Kat is tearing up and Kelly is staring at the floor, speechless. I dismiss Kat.\n\n\"I hope that this is the last I hear about this because if I do, I'll fire her.\" as Kelly, speechless, walks out of my office.\n\nI told Kat not to worry about any of this; we have them where we want them. So, for a week Kat reported to me that her clothes were fine per HR inspection. At the beginning of the second week she was chuckling, \"Kelly told me that I look 'very nice' today.\" Attitudes began to change and everyone was smiling.\n\nI got called to the red carpet by Jim, the CEO. He tried to keep a straight face as he recited what he heard was going on and asked me to cut the remedial training short becuase it was embarrassing the HR staff.\n\nStraight faced I said, \"Well, Jim, if I stop the remedial training, I'd have to fire Kat. Company Policy clearly states that failure to complete a formal remediation plan is immediate termination. It is very clear... there is zero tolerance.\"\n\n\"You can't fire a pregnant woman for what she wears. I'm asking... no, I'm TELLING you to stop.\"\n\n\"Stop following company policy?\"\n\nLaughing he concedes \"Ok. I am rescinding that ridiculous dress code policy effective immediately.\"",

I always been a model employee, so one day I was surprised the manager asked me into her office. She reprimended me because I had taken a 45 minutes (instead of 30) break one day the previous week. I remembered that day, and indeed I had taken more than 30 minutes, 31 minutes to be exact, and that was because on my way back, someone had a concern that I took the time to resolve. I explained that to her but she was adamant that the system rounded to the nearest 15 minutes and that if it said 45 minutes, than there was no way I could have only been 1 min late. She made it clear that it was my fault and that the punch system is law since it can't lie.\n\nOn my next shift, I looked into it. On the punch system, there is a way to see at what time you punched. I realized that the system was not rounding the amount of time you worked/were on break, but rather the time at which you punched. What happened that day was that I punched out at 10h22, rounding to 10h15, and got back 31 minutes later at 10h53, rounding to 11h, hence the 45 minutes break.\n\nNow in my position, I had the luxury of choosing when to go on break as long as they didn't run out of anything during that time. From that day till the day I switched job a few months later, I made sure to go on break just after the cut-off, and back just before the next one. For instance, punching out at 10h08, rounding to 10h15, and back-in at 10h52, rounding to 10h45. I thus ended up with 44 minutes break, that according to the system were only 30 minutes long. One time, a supervisor told me that it seemed like I was gone for a bit longer than usual, I replied that she saw me punching in and out, and that she could go confirm in the system if she wanted to. Never heard from it after that.\n\ntldr: was chewed on because of a weird quirk of the punch system, learned how to use it to my advantage and had 14 minutes extra on all my breaks.\n\nEDIT: The manager was also under the impression that the system rounded the amount of break time to the nearest 15 minutes, not the ins and outs. That's also what they tell during recruitment, hence why I initially thought that's how it worked.\n\nThe supervisor who noticed was a part-timer, not the same person as the manager. I also don't think they actually cared, just found it strange.\n\nBefore leaving, I did share the trick with a few coworkers, but since cashiers have a supervisor that coordinate break time, they can't really be late. For them, 1 minute late is actually noticed by someone, let alone 14.",

So I would wait for the minute to change, then punch my break in.  \nAlso one time, I worked in a daylight saving time change of hours, and the hour repeated itself when I was on break. The time shown I had been on break was like -20(I think I had a mixup and took an extra 10 minutes)",

If you clocked that, it'd be ten minutes of real time, but it would be calculated as 0.5 hours.\n\nThey forced you to take a lunch break, so if you did 8:59-12pm and 12:59 to 6pm, total time would be 8 hours and two minutes, but total calculated time would be 8.82 hours.\n\nDo that every day for a two week pay period and you manufactured 8 hours from 20 minutes.",

So I would clock in at say 8:07, the punch would round down to 8:00, but my commute time from 7:30-8:07 would overlap it. On the flip side, if I clocked in at 8:08, it would round up to 8:15 and there would be a pay gap between the commute time ending at 8:08 and worked time starting at 8:15. \n\nNot many people noticed because it\u2019s typically only a few minutes here and there, and chance should average it out to a even balance. Not to mention, it didn\u2019t actually round the displayed time off- it showed the exact time you clocked in at. But the paid time at the top of the day would change depending on how it rounded. \n\nI always clocked in at 8:07, 8:22, 8:37, or 8:52 (when I get to my first job, I\u2019d wait until time to clock in) and I\u2019d always clock OUT at 4:08, 4:23, 4: 38, or 4:53.

            "One company I worked for, remotely at the master clock would set the clocks early to force workers to start and come in early and reset the master clock at after lunch to make you work later for free.\n\nI was required to sync all the PCs time to the national NIST service Atomic Clock.  I was called in and chewed out as the PCs time  did not match the wall clocks.  I simply stated the wall clocks were off and changing before work and after lunch and this was no accident.  Facilities was then dragged on the carpet in front of me.  \n\nHow did this all start.  Someone had complaint to the Labor Board.  I was not the one, but I saw it coming.  Now the master clock was done away with and battery operated clocks installed to save electricity.  Automation of clocks was so nice.",

            "I miss systems like these. My current job uses Kronos and I fucking hate it. My favorite was at Walmart back in the day; they gave us an hour lunch  half paid, half unpaid along with 2 15 minute breaks and management was often nowhere to be seen. I worked overnight in the back by myself and most days was unbothered. I used to milk the hell out of that time",
            "My last job had a punch out clock. We had to punch out for lunch and I would forget a lot because I ate at my desk and would just start working whenever I was finished. Sometimes it would be a 15 minute break, sometimes like 45. Eventually my boss started noticing and bugging me to punch out, so I just always took the full 45 minutes from then on and would use my spare time watching movies or playing games on my phone. Maybe go for a walk in the park. I would refuse to answer any questions or deal with any work related stuff, even if it was \"real quick\". I ended up getting a lot less done all so he could save a few bucks not paying me for a break.",

            "Shitty retail chain I worked at did this so I would take long ass breaks almost every shift. Also no one cared if I took an extra 15 occasionally so sometimes I would use this for an extra 30 with the rounding. As long as I brought my coworker on shift a coffee they were cool with it.",
            "Home Depot has used the same punch rounding system for years.  It was changed this year to pay based on the actual minute of the punch.  I am relatively certain that the topic of this OP was finally discovered by the powers to be in HotLanta",
            "But the system CAN lie, and does. You and your supervisor sat and talked about how it lies, and the company explained how it lies during orientation. \n\nIf it's not logging your exact in and out times, but rather rounding to any increment in any direction, then the numbers it is reporting are not factual.\n\nThese not factual numbers, that is, lies, are being used to serve a corporation usually at your expense. You jsut happened to find a way to tilt the lie in your favour. Kudos to you for that, but this whole story is about how the system lies.",
            "Under this same logic you could have started your shift late and went home early It's not your fault their system has such a flaw that results in time theft, I don't know what country you are in but in many Time theft is a very serious thing and if the company is the one doing it there are many legal penalties for them."

The speed limit is 25mph, but when I see lots of foot traffic on the sidewalks, I bring it down to 15mph or even 10mph if I see a big group of kids playing in the street. \n\nThere\u2019s this sweet group of kids who play basketball in the middle of the street eight doors down from my home. When they see cars approaching, they move to the curb and wait for the cars to pass before resuming their game. One day I was driving home from work and I saw the kids out playing, and their mother was on the front lawn talking with another adult. I slowed down to 10mph and went to the complete opposite side of the street as I crept by.\n\nA little while later she knocked on my door and complained about \u201chow fast\u201d I was driving and that I could have harmed her precious children. I said, \u201cThe speed limit is 25mph, and I was going 10mph. How much slower do you want me to go??\u201d She said \u201cI don\u2019t care, just slow down or else I\u2019m going to call the police! I have a doorbell camera so I can see you every time you drive by!\u201d Okay crazy lady, whatever you say!\n\nThe next day, the kids were outside playing in the street again. I slowly approached, came to a full stop, and then I took my foot off the brakes and let the car crawl at 1mph. The kids stared at me all confused as it took me an entire minute to pass through their makeshift basketball court.\n\nI continued to do this a few more times until one day the mother came and knocked on my car window as I was crawling by. I lowered my window and asked if there was a problem. She said \u201cWhy are you going so slow? Are you stalking my children?!?\u201d I said \u201cNo, of course not. You demanded that I slow down, so I am!\u201d And I rolled up my window and went on my way. She comes banging on my door again and says \u201cDon\u2019t get smart with me! Now you\u2019re going TOO slow!\u201d I said \u201cAre you saying that going 10mph is okay now? Because if you don\u2019t like it, you can call the police.\u201d She huffed and crossed her arms and stomped off my porch.",

        "selftext": "Being Friday the 13th, while waiting for my tattoo, I was reminded of a situation a few years ago with my friend Liz who's my primary artist and an especially Karen type lady and her Kyle esque boyfriend (double k for both) who came in to get cheap ass tattoos.\n \nI watched this whole thing go down but wasnt involved per say.\n \nSo Liz was doing a quick custom job on me and my buddy Chris (yes we got matching tattoos, Star Wars Yin/Yang for those wondering) I went 2nd so liz and I could catch up. Double K bypassed the massive line out the door and down the stairs and walked straight up to the artist area to try to skip the line. This was shut down pretty quick and they were told there's a huge wait in front of them and they'll have to go to the back of the line. \n \nWell Double K didnt like this one bit and started to throw a fit. Like legit tried to pull me out of the chair because \"hes getting what he wants and I was here first\", she wasnt, i was there at 8 am to help Liz load in OJ and Doughnuts and the 10 people in line before me knew this too. \n \nWell one of the artists just finished and said \"I'll take you two\". We were all kinda flabbergasted by this but Liz got this big shit eating grin on her face so I knew something was up. I figured the dude would do a terrible job, go too deep, use the wrong needle, something to just royally fuck up their day but he did none of this. He pulled his flash sheet and said \"pick one\". Karen picked something and he asks where she wants it. Back of her ankle, so dude gets to work free handing it while Double K keep looking at the line like they won something.\n \nWell they did win something, the smallest tattoo I've ever seen. This thing was no bigger than a dime, from 10 feet away all I could see was a little black spot on her leg that looked more like a mole than a tattoo. Double K lost it. Screaming about him assaulting her and forcing her to get a tattoo and they're gonna call the cops and all that. Then they tried to skip out without paying. They were rather impolitely informed that theft of service is a felony and that cops are only 10 minutes away. They tried to pay up the $13 but that's where the guys brilliance really shone through. \n \nHis sheet said \"Custom\" at the top. All custom tattoos were $31. Not only did this lady have a very tiny, and very intricately detailed tattoo, she only had a $50 on her and they had a big ass sign at the register that said simply \"NO CHANGE\". Double K ended up paying the shop minimum anyway, but she got her tattoo ahead of the line.",

Dude with Bella lagosas face on ass doesn't come to funeral or wake because he's working a volentary shift to kiss his bosses ass rather than showing up for a one time event for someone who was very important to us all.. And at the wake the tat artist is clear he's furious. He tells us that he wanted it to be a secret for him, but he felt he needed to share. He explained there's the new black ink that does not discolor much, but also that old ink that as you get old it turns that green blue color... He said he hid 37 cock dootlles into the Bella tat, with the old ink so as dude aged the cocks would discolor and slowly appear over the face of Bella. He told us that if he's ever asked he will deny it here forth on out, but he kinda hopes dude heads about it so he can sit there with a mirror looking at his own ass trying to figure it out.. Now I don't know if that's doable, or if that's a story to fuck with that guy.. But if it's doable, knowing the tat guy I woo ld wager he 100% did it given how pissed he was at the guy for annoying him.

Judging by the reactions below, what I'm hearing is that I should only do stuff like this in a really quiet bar when I have a bit of rapport, where the staff has enough time and overall giveafuck to customize it.

I wish I knew what he had put into it, but it was exceptionally good.\n\nThe bar wasn't busy as it was basically exclusively for our group.  It was a great experience.\n\nMy assumption if I say surprise me, is that the server or bartender will simply make an additional drink of something else that was already ordered by someone else or just pick a drink they personally like.  I don't drink often, and like to explore new things and that is an easy way to accomplish this.\n\nI'm finding some of the responses here a bit disturbing.",

            "Some people order like this because they don't have a lot of experience or knowledge about alcohol. The first drink I ever had was a margarita at chilli's when I was like 26.  People can also be super self conscious at bars or around bar tenders and just simply clam up and not know what to order. \n\nAlso consider that they may not know what's appropriate to order at that place, for example, I'm born and raised in Florida and I'm female so literally every cocktail I know is either a margarita or a rum based drink,  but I feel like it would be weird to order a goombay smash in a swanky Manhattan bar.\n\nSo I guess what I'm saying is that if you bartend and someone does this don't assume they're being cocky or trying to waste your time. Maybe just make them a classic universally well liked cocktail like a professional and not be an ass?\n\nOr maybe all the inexperienced alcohol drinkers of the world can ignore the fact that the bar is busy and that you'll have to get the blender out or go to the kitchen for fruit and order the only thing they know for a fact they'll like since you can't be trusted....have fun making twenty thousand strawberry daiquiris and margaritas a night I guess?",

            "At the last place I bartended, we had $4 well drinks. If you just wanted a shot of tequila or whiskey and didn\u2019t name a brand, you get the cheap stuff for $4. It also wasn\u2019t uncommon for us to get some cheap, inconsiderate clients in as well. So we decided to make a shot, just for special occasions. Apparently when you take a shot of well gin (normally $4) and add Tabasco to it, suddenly the price drops to $3.50. We called it the forest fire, since it was like a prairie fire, but with pine needles instead. \n\n\nThere were a number of times where jerks ordered a round of the cheapest shot we had, and I was more than happy to oblige, and stand back and watch their faces as they down that unexpected, quite unpleasant concoction. ",
            "I'm not a professional bartender, but am the GM of two sister restaurant/bars, so occasionally I find myself bartending, and I have also developed a handful of cocktail menus, so I have atleast some sense of what creating a drink entails. I like to try new things, so as a customer I also frequently ask a bartender to \"surprise\" me. From both sides, I dont really see what the big deal is. I'll give an example of each:\n\nThere's a local Italian place that my wife and I eat at as often as we can. They have a small cocktail list, and also a list of some rarer alcohols that they carry. Their two main bartenders are particularly talented, so if I see one of them is  working I'll order from my server by saying something along the lines of \"I'll have the [rare alcohol]. Please ask [the bartender] to make something fun with it. I'm sure whatever he makes will be perfect.\" \n\nThe last time I did this I ordered a rye whiskey and the server returned with a cocktail that contained a large flat orange peel bridged atop the glass with a burnt piece of wood resting on top. It looked amazing, and tasted fantastic. A few minutes later the bartender stopped by to ask how I liked it and to tell me a little about what it was and his process in creating it. Far from bothered or annoyed by my request, he seemed excited both to create the drink and have the opportunity to talk about his craft. For my next drink I asked my server to ask the bartender to make whatever he would like, and recieved an equally creative and delicious cocktail, though by that point he was too busy to stop back and talk about it.\n\nNow from the bartending side. I was short staffed this last weekend and needed all my available bartenders to work the bar, leaving me to bartend a wedding we were catering. I've served in the bar, so I've poured a few drinks, but I've never been the sole bartender of an event. Wedding bars are high volume, but usually pretty simple in that most of the orders are for a [alcohol] and [mixer]. So even for someone as inexperienced at bartending as me, pretty manageable. \n\nBut at this event I had four guests who were insistent that I \"surprise\" them each time they ordered. I needed to make custom cocktails despite there always being a short line of guests waiting behind them. I didnt find this annoying at all, and it barely slowed my pace. \n\nI drew on my experience creating cocktail menus and simply added a slight twist or variation to cocktails I was familiar with. I made Soco-ritas, which was just a traditional margarita with Soco in place of tequila and topped with a splash of grenadine. I also made a few different variations of long island ice teas, substituting one of the ingredients with another alcohol in the same family. The rest of the \"surprises\" were just combinations of sweet alcohols with sour mixers, or sour alcohols with sweet mixers, topped with a splash of this or that. \n\nThey weren't all winners of course, but overall the guests enjoyed them, and I enjoyed making them.\n\nTl;dr - a \"surprise\" order is more of an opportunity than a threat.\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Seems like more work than it's worth; when they say \"no, I meant something with alcohol, nice joke though\" then you have to backtrack and make an actual drink. ",
            "Just have like 3 shots in your head that you always make in that situation. There\u2019s nothing wrong with indecision at the bar if the customer is relinquishing control like that. I\u2019ve been tending for 9 years and I am sick of hearing bartenders complain.",

        "selftext": "TL:DR: You shadow me, better keep up. BTW - I love the stairs.\n\nAs a tech of going on 30 years I've seen some stupid management directives. This one is one of my favorites.\n\nBack in 2007 I worked for a large bank that is based in Atlanta and I worked in Richmond in a 28 story office tower. My primary job was desktop support and fixing phones. At that time I was very athletic, I moved fast all the time and hated to use the elevator. If I had to go less than 6 floors - I took the stairs. My boss didn't care for as a team we were the most efficient team in the company as far as # of tickets worked each week per tech. We worked smart, not hard.\n\nSo upper management in Atlanta decides one day to do a deep assessment on how ALL the techs in the bank did our job.  My team gets a visit from Atlanta one day in the form of a heavy set guy who says he will be shadowing us to see how we did our job. He was a bit of an condescending jerk too in his attitude. He even had a stop watch to time us. Now we all knew right away what was happening - Management wanted to outsource us so they needed to know what we did, how long it took and what we used so they could put a cost on it before soliciting for bids. Lets just say my team was not thrilled about it.\n\nNow I decided to be a smart ass about this and my team knew what I had planned for this \"event\". I was told this overweight condescending jerk was to shadow us and time us. OK - he is going to have to keep up. Time for Malicious compliance.\n\n**I ONLY used the stairs.**\n\nOur lab was on the 20th floor. A typical morning for me would be like this: I'd run a desktop monitor ticket to the 6th floor, then go back to 20 to get my phone bag to go to lower level 1 to the IPX to hook up a phone then go to the 14th floor to test the phone then up to 22 to fix a printer then down to 7 to look at a laptop. Today - I'm ONLY doing the stairs so this guy was about to have a heart attack trying to keep up with me while I did my job. I took no pity on him and didn't even pay attention to him.  As far as I was concerned this jerk was assisting others in having my job eliminated. At some point I'd lost him in the stairwell. Later my boss says to me the guy was a bit mad for me taking the stairs but my boss told him - \"That is how my tech works and he is one of my best. If you can't keep up - that is your problem.\" (To this day I have said she was the BEST boss I've ever had)\n\nLater I find out what I did got back to upper management in Atlanta. They were pissed yet they could not punish me for I was doing my job and did it very well. The story also got around to other techs and they thought it was funny as hell what I did. \n\nIn April 2008 we found out we were outsourced. Just like we knew it was going to happen. I no longer work there.\n\nEdit: I'm doing quite well these days being a code developer and SF admin so I look at that experience as my cheese moved so I needed to find new cheese.

        "selftext": "I (30f) have been working at a super small construction company for the past 2 years. I've put my best foot forward every day, and never had any issues with anyone in the company. As of 3 months ago, they moved me from an in-field coordinator, to an accounting position. It was an emergency move as one of the employees stole 80k from the company and they needed an immediate replacement. My new supervisor, we'll call her Mary (34f) was always super kind to me and we've became pretty good in-work friends. Well these past couple months have been hell, I hate the new position, and to be fair, I'm not very good at it. So I found a new position and I've been keeping it a secret for a while. I let the owner know first and he was very kind and receptive to it. \n\nThe issue started when Mary got word of it. She immediately cornered me and started going on this rant saying things like; \"Why didn't you tell me? You're being incredibly unfair and selfish. I can't believe you would do this to us, this is unacceptable. Don't ask me for a referral because you are not getting one from me\" etc. I politely told her that the opportunity was something I simply couldn't pass up. She then went to the owner and asked for any details I might've given to him about the new company and new position (I believe to try to sabotage me leaving), and thankfully I hadn't discussed any details about it with anyone. It was awkward after that, but I didn't think anything of it. \n\nThe next day when things took a turn for the worst. Mary decided to be petty and removed all of my authorizations to any accounts I had so I couldn't perform any of my daily tasks. I didn't want to leave on a sour note, so I brought it up to the owner as Mary was OOO (out of office) that day. He re-authorized my accounts and I continued to work. Mary was back the following day and was completely livid that I had went around her and talked directly to the owner. Her actions towards me would only get worse from here on out. \n\nThe next day, I came in to notice that my desk was moved and my computer access was taken away yet again. Cue the malicious compliance. Since I couldn't do any of my daily tasks, and really didn't feel like dealing with a screaming Mary- I was on Reddit for basically the whole day. At the end of the day, Mary came into my new back storage \"office\" and said \"Busy day today? I know mine was.\", I just smiled and said \"Yep! Exhausting\". She did not like that response and went to the owner to say that I was purposefully not doing my job, and my last two weeks would be pointless so we should just let her (me) go now. The owner disagrees- calls me into his office, and after I explained what she had done, he gave me access again, and told Mary to work from home. \n\nAnother day goes by, it's extremely peaceful now that Mary is working remote, but unfortunately this does not mean my day was getting any easier. Instead of taking my access away- she had IT start forwarding all my emails to other employees in other departments that had nothing to do with my specific position. At this point I only had three days left and so I just took it as \"OK, this sucks for them, but it's on Mary's head if anyone has any questions. I looked at my PTO and I had way more than I had thought! So why not use those for my last days? And that's exactly what I did. I was originally supposed to let all vendors know and start forwarding them off to the appropriate people, and interview second round candidates for my position, but not any more. The owner was completely okay with it, and understood that Mary was being toxic and that he would have a talk with her about her attitude and position if this continues. \n\nNow with my last two days, and me being on PTO, I finally thought I was safe from Mary. But low and behold she was still holding a massive grudge, as if me leaving my position was a personal attack on her. She called me at 4:30 in the morning, and left me a voice mail saying our company was having an \"Accounting Emergency\" and I need to come in IMMEDIATELY. I called her back about 4 hours later, which she was fuming about, and went on a massive rant about how I'm extremely entitled, I will never get any where with my attitude, she's embarrassed for our company to say that I ever worked here, that if she ever finds out where I will be working she will make sure that I'm fired and will never get a job in this town again. I laughed at her, and she went ballistic- like when you take a 4 year old's toy away. Screaming so loud her voice was shaking, saying silly things like I have no respect for her or the company and that I will rot in hell. \n\nI hung up on her once she started bringing my family into things. I called the owner and explained to him what happened- which he wasn't shocked about and had told me that when she came in that morning she was going on a rampage like the Tasmanian Devil. After finding out why she was freaking out, he promptly fired her.  I was shocked- since this was such a small company and he definitely needed her. \n\nI had heard from another coworker that she ended up destroying a bunch of company property on her way out and now she's facing a lawsuit due to the damages. \n\nSo thankful she revealed her true self to everyone & that I'm far far away from that company and her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

Narcissistic people typically don\u2019t go crazy like that when somebody quits (sure you\u2019ll get the rumor mill started but her reaction is that of someone who is severely wrong doing).
