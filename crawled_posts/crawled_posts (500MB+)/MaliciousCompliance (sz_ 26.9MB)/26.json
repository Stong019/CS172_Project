        "selftext": "Last week I was working from home one day, and got up to use the bathroom and make a cup of coffee. Took 10 minutes, tops. I get back to my computer to a bunch messages from my boss, getting increasingly nasty about something and why I wasn't answering quick enough for her. I send a message back with whatever it was she needed to know, and \"apologizing\" for not getting back to her soon enough.\n\nWhen she finally answered me (about half an hour later) she said if I'm not going to be at my computer for any amount of time, I need to send an email to everyone in my office (including high level executives)  that I'll be unavailable for X amount of time and why.\n\nSo that's what I've been doing. My normal phrasing for the message is \"Hi! I'll be unavailable from this time to this time as I'm going to use the bathroom/make some coffee/etc.\" Every single person in my office has told me it's fine and I don't need to tell them when I'm going to be gone for a few minutes, where I then forward them the original exchange between me and my boss and apologize but say this is what my direct report has told me to do, and this is the result if I don't. \n\nThey all hate her as much as I do now.\n\nEdit: Hi All,\n\nApologies for forgetting to let you all know I'd be unavailable due to sleeping. But I will be unavailable for the next about 15 minutes as I'm going to be making breakfast. I will send note when I'm back at my desk!\n\nWell damn, this got much more attention than I thought it would. I live off this shit so I might have to start posting some more. I love all of your suggestions and I'm going to try and start doing at least a good number of them! \n\nTo answer a few questions I saw, my boss is about 43, and the rest of the office is women aged about 40 and up. I 100% don't have to worry about getting fired, I've only been there a couple weeks and have established myself as one of the better assets to the office (I'm a recent college grad who studied in a tech field, no one in my office knows how to use excel, PowerPoint, etc.) I already showed everyone besides my boss how to make rules in their email so they don't get spammed with my messages, and they all love me and see that I have no problem riding this one out to piss boss lady off, and since they're not getting spammed with my emails they're fine with it.  Unfortunately she's very much a micromanager, and just a massive bitch on top of that, but I can't afford to quit so this will have to just do.\n\nThank you kind stranger for my very first gold!",

            "I once arrived at my office at 8:58am (9 was the normal start time for the company), to find that at 8am my boss had sent me a fairly nasty demand for some data (he was on a business trip in Germany at the time so we were in different time zones and I wasn't too surprised to receive email from him before I arrived, but it was unexpectedly mean), and had sent several increasingly hostile demands for explanation of why I hadn't sent it yet in the hour since and demanding very harshly that I attend to it immediately.\n\nAt 9:00am I sent a terse but polite email to the effect of \"It's 9am here so I just arrived at the office as usual, it'll take me a couple minutes for the database to collect the information you want, and I'll email it to you as soon as it's ready.\" I then gave the database the appropriate command and sat back. (Really this wasn't my job, he should have sent the request to the database guy, I was the manager and just happened to know how to do it, as my boss should have been able to do himself, but the database guy wouldn't have been in any earlier.) While it was working I got an angry email from him, threatening my job if I didn't get it immediately. (There wasn't anything exciting about the numbers he had asked for, he just wanted some sales data that he had in fact gotten the day before to see what had changed. Nothing had changed, and he should have known that, we had closed 5 minutes after he got the data the day before and we hadn't opened yet when he asked for an update.) \n\nAt 9:05 the database returned the results. I formatted them for human consumption and emailed them to him at 9:06, with a note that said \"Here's the data you requested. If there's anything else I can get for you, please let me know.\"  \n\nAt 9:10 he phoned me to scream at me about how I was \"rude\" in my responses (see them above and tell me which part was rude) and how I was unresponsive to his requests for over an hour (he didn't care that actually I took care of his request first thing when I arrived, before even looking to see if I had anything else) and how I had \"poor communication skills\" which lead to the fact that \"nobody on the staff respects you.\" (My staff adored me, they all hated him and were, in fact, interviewing for other jobs to get away from him, and I knew it and he didn't - which should tell you the one with problem communication skills wasn't me.) He yelled at me on the phone for 25 minutes. Then he decided it wasn't enough so he called back and yelled at me for another 20 minutes. \n\nA few seconds after we got off the one I thought \"waitaminnit, this isn't fourth grade, I don't have to take this shit any more.\" I ducked into the nearest conference room for some privacy, called my agent, said \"get me out of here!\", had a phone interview the next business day, and a new job in 5. (Would've been sooner but I had some questions and they had to adjust the hiring letter.) I handed in my resignation and left. When word got around that he'd driven me out, he was fired, as was his boss. \n\n(Most of my staff from there still turns to me for professional advice years later, not counting the ones who retired. One of them had dinner with me last friday and was sounding me out about whether he can hire me.)",

So the manager eventually tells him, hey, you need to let me know whenever you\u2019re heading to the bathroom. \n\nNext day, the manager is in a meeting with some higher ups, and the worker walks in the meeting room, says \u201chey manager, just a heads up, I am off to take a shit!\u201d ...he didn\u2019t have to tell the manager that he was heading to the bathroom anymore after that.",
            "Going to get buried and sightly different. \n\nThis all started when my new boss began getting upset at my short office days. Our entire team worked so hour days without breaks or lunches. I did the same, plus many extra office hours and 24/7 availability. Boss got upset about my short shifts. I explained that I worked the same as my team plus spent many hours working from home to assist each week. Not to mention the occasional 12-24 hour shifts I'd pull without complaint. Boss said that he wanted me in the office 8 hours a day and that my assistance from home and extra hours were my choice. \n\nSo he turned a long term dedicated employee into a clock watcher. I left at exactly eight hours every day. Abandoning any work not completed.\n\nAround rolls autumn. My property has a dozen maple trees and leaf cleanup is a major chore. I mean days of riding tractor with a huge vacuum trailer attached. Often late into the night, usually assisting my elderly neighbors as well. \n\nOne day a shipper forgets to send docs for their international shipment. This had been an ongoing issue so the dispatcher grounds the flight until docs are provided. Huge uproar ensues. I don't answer my phone as I'm literally sitting between two loud engines with doubled up ear protection. \n\nAfter dumping the trailer I shut down to refuel and grab a beer. I see that I missed a call from 15 minutes earlier from said customer. We've worked together for years so I call back immediately and we work out a mutual plan. No other issues occur the rest of the night.\n\nNext day I get a very angry email from new boss that about how I missed a call the night prior and must be available at all times. I was miffed and ignored the email entirely. At the end of the shift he stops by my desk to inquire about the email I ignored. I simply reminded him that per his direction it was my choice to be available from home.",

I wrote a simple VBA program that auto-filled in random shit for each 15 minutes, which I would hand edit to fill in things like meetings and when I went to lunch to make it more believable.\n\nThe rest of the team fought back, asking \"well, what if did things that crossed a 15 minute time period, like I worked on a spreadsheet from 11:03 to 11:22?\" We fill in what we did a majority of that increment. So if we spend 8 minutes chatting with him, that's a 15 minute \"meeting with boss\" increment.\n\nOnce that was established, things got silly. A lot of people documented bathroom breaks, and the boss said, \"I can't believe you spend an hour of company time using the bathroom!\" to one of our female programmers. \"I don't. I went to the bathroom 4 times, but it took 8 minutes, which you said counts as 15.\" Then he argued that going to the bathroom 4 times in a 9 hour day was \"excessive.\" \n\nThis did not go over well, and upper management came to him and told him to stop tracking people by spreadsheet; we were a professional company, not a prison.

            "There was a similar story here a while ago. The tenants were required to paint the house *on the day* they move out, supposedly to cover up any damage left by them moving furniture out. They repainted a few days before, but avoided damaging the walls when they moved out. Cue landlord complaining about them not repainting when they moved out, so they did the same thing with black paint.",
            "This reminds me of a friend of mine. His family had just moved into a new house and his mom insisted on repainting every room. His room was already like a plain blue or something fairly basic for a bedroom and plus he was moving out for college in less than a year, so he didn\u2019t think he needed to paint it. His mom pitched a fit (she\u2019s a Karen through and through) She demanded that he pick out a color or she was going to pick one and paint it herself. So he did. He\u2019s a Clemson fan so he went to Lowe\u2019s and got the brightest neon shade of orange he could find and painted the entire room. It was gloriously hideous. Imagine standing inside a traffic cone. If he left his door open the entire hallway would glow orange.",

He painted the floor, leaving a path from the center of the room to the door.    \n\n\nThen he took off the ceiling fixture glass, and painted the bulbs.  And painted the glass of the fixture. Inside and out.  He then backtracked along his path painting the rest of the floor.\n\nHe consdiered that since the door swung in, it was part of the room, so both sides of the door were painted.  \n\nThen he painted the ladder, and left it in the room.  The inside of the door jam was painted red, as were the doorknobs.  Then he closed the door on the wet paint, touched up the doorknob.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe hadn't been told to clean his brush and paint tray, so he left them by the door to dry.",

Then you could get someone for like $200-$300 paint the entire space with a paint gun in a day.   But when you run into stuff like this you could spend more on all of the extra coats of paint than just taking care of it yourself from the beginning.\n\nAnd you have to figure into your price that paint and carpet will be replaced after every tenant.  Snap lock floors every 5 to 10 years. And things like tile and cabinets every 10 years or so.   And to be a successful landlord you'll either need to know how maintenance costs work, or have someone in your corner that you can trust that does.

        "selftext": "So I was in a speech class, it was my last semester. Completely online due to COVID. Our professor assigned us a group speech that we were to record and send to him by the due date. I thought it would be easy enough as he gave us two weeks to work on it and group speeches weren't anything new to me. He even made separate discussion boards for our groups that we could use to communicate. This project was worth 30% of our grade so failing this project meant you would pretty much fail the course.\n\nI wanted to get it done early so we wouldn't have to worry about it so I immediately post a message to everyone in the group asking when they were free to do a zoom meeting to discuss the project. No reply for a few days by any of them. I then post again. This time a little more stern as it didn't seem any of them cared enough to even reply at all. I waited a few more days. At this point we only had a week left before it was due so I just divided up the work and posted what everyone would need to write their portion of the speech about and gave them a date/time that I would be holding a zoom meeting for the final recording to send the professor. Still no reply.\n\nIt was now the day before the speech was to be recorded and two days before the speech was due and my group members had not made an attempt to make contact in any form at all.\n\nSo I did the only thing I could think of and emailed my professor explaining the situation. But I assumed he would not reply because throughout the entire semester, it took him over a week to reply to any emails I had sent him. I then did the entire group project on my own, which took me the entire night with no sleep. After I finished writing everyone's speech, It was around the time I had scheduled the zoom meeting to record. I joined it out of amusement knowing nobody in my group would be there. Sure enough it was empty. So I did the entire speech myself. But the rubrick really put emphasis on transitioning to our other group members including saying their name. So between every section where it would cut to a different member, I would say something like, And now (My Name) will explain the importance of blah blah, then mute my screen briefly as if to add a cut, put on a different hat, and continue the speech. I did this for all 6 portions of the speech. I turned in the speech shortly after and filled out the \"Group Member Role\" sheet that was due as well. I just put my name in every box that was supposed to be a different member.\n\nA week passes and I see he graded the project (Still not replying to my previous email about the situation btw.) and he gave me a 0 stating it was supposed to be a 'group' project and me doing it solo meant I did not follow instructions. I was actually infuriated by this and knew that emailing him about the grade was as good as useless so I went straight above him to the board of the college and explained to them what happened. They apologized and said the situation would be resolved and within a few hours of me talking to the board, He had replied to my email three times stating that he was sorry for the miscommunication about the project and that my grade would be corrected, scolded me for going above him saying \"I should have just emailed him again if I couldn't get in contact with my classmates.\" and putting the blame on me for not 'trying harder' to reach out to them. The next semester, I saw that he was no longer with the school. My guess is that it was a habit of his to not reply to emails and he got fired for it.\n\nAlso his 'corrected' grade was a 70. But I was so mentally exhausted from the situation at that point that I didn't care to fight it anymore",

            "I once got an A on a debate\u2026solo. My \u201cpartner\u201d realized very quickly that debate wasn\u2019t for him, and ghosted on both me and the class, but not until the day of our first debate. I\u2019d had zero participation from him, so just in case, I did all of the work on our position, and on the day of, I was offered the assistance of the teacher\u2019s aide to present, but I chose to go it alone\u2026and got an A.",
            "I got a A+ for doing a group project solo once. Teacher was furious and demanded I got their grades. I had no idea college was like Highlander and you could go around abosrbing grades.\n \nEdit: thanks for all the awards woah jeez, most upvotes I've gotten neat-o\n\n 1.) No, I did not have to cut anyones head off. No weapons on campus.\n2.) The whole situation was a 5 person assignment for administration of law; I got everyones information (numbers and emails), when everyone agreed to meet at the library and never showed up I just worked on the project. I made a powerpoint and went all out. On the day of presentation the Professor asked the groups to stand and show their work, I was the only solo presentor and after class had a talk about the situation. So I got a boost to my grade for doing extra work. \n3.) Love your comments hard to respond to everything with all the family AND their dogs visiting. \n\nGood night and again thank you for the awards and stories interesting, hilarious and infuriating!",
            "Many professors believe that group projects are the closest you'll find to the real world. And they're probably right - if they include real world accountability. Where they go off track is when they fail to account for the fact that the individual student is paying for the class and should receive a grade based on their specific contributions and achievements. After all, there's no such thing as a group transcript or a group degree.\n\nIt's unfair and unreasonable to punish a diligent student for the inaction of lazy students if they haven't simultaneously provided a mechanism for the diligent student to hold their lazy peers accountable.\n\nIf one person manages to produce an adequate result in spite of others not doing their part, I'd give them maximum credit. If they produce a superior result, I'd give extra credit. If they were unable to produce a viable result and could demonstrate that this was primarily because others refused to participate, I'd simply not count that assignment as part of their final grade.",
            "I had a group project like this in my databases course. One guy dropped off the face of the planet, and this other person couldn't even be bothered to edit the sample code I found for her, so I did it all. Fast forward to the end of the semester I have walking pneumonia and still came in to do the presentation sitting the entire time because standing was too strenuous.\n\nQ&A time my instructor goes, Thank you Yetzederixx, turns to group mate... \"What exactly did you do all semester?\" She failed and graduated a semester late.\n\nFast forward to our software engineering course a year later and I have that person in my group again. Day 1 I'm talking about how I will intentionally fail this course and graduate with a degree in mathematics (on time) instead of computer science if they slack and she pipes up: \"Don't test him, he'll do it.\"",
            "I once pulled a passing grade out of a completely broken group coding project thanks in part to version control and having one other group member on my side.  The program didn't run, was full of useless code and did none of the things we intended it to do.  We had to present to a state department that was the supposed client (the group with the best reviews won the \"contract\" and would have their application shown at an upcoming trade show) and through the art of bull-shittery, a largely clueless/forgiving client, and sheer dumb luck we managed to spin it as just acting up that day, and talked up what it SHOULD have been.  I still got a C+ out of it somehow but the prof never explained how and I never questioned him on it.  All I can figure is that the logs showed me and the only other group member to take it seriously furiously editing the other group member's code to try to cludge-fix the thing the week before the presentation, as well as our group reviews.",
            "Reminds me of one twelve-week project I was assigned to when at uni and this particular class was remote. I spent six weeks of the semester attempting to contact anyone in the group I had been assigned to before finding out belatedly that they had all dropped out of the course in the first week and none of the course co-ordinators or lecturers had deigned to inform me of that fact.",
            "good for you\n\nI hated group projects because there were always too many freeloaders",
            "In a group project of mine the opposite happened.\n\nA duo of people in our team assigned things to do for everyone, we split it up, so far so good. Then they... immediately did ALL the work very early on in the semester without consulting us.\n\nThen they contacted the professor saying we (the other 2) didn't do shit (still very early), and that we were freeloaders. My last fucking semester at uni, I thought we were adults in there.\n\nThat was a real shitstorm to fix tbh, professor took their side, we had to prove we were working on our side of the project by ourselves. Eventually we split into 2 groups and turned in different projects so they gained literally nothing out of this except having all 4 of us have twice the workload. We had similar grades so nothing of worth happened after that, but at that time I thought why the fuck would you even do this? I really disliked them, their heads were so far up their own asses, unbelievable. All for nothing except drama.",
            "Oh that is hilarious. \n\nI can't even fathom why he would immediately fail you for the entire class when you not only showed up for the project but demonstrated that you put a lot of work into it. Rubrick be damned.",
            "If I was the professor, I'd have given you a 70 \u00d7 6. This would have equalled to 100 for your part of the project, plus 320 Extra Credit points. \n\nYes, a solid \"A\" for the semester, to student who is undeterred by the apathy of others.",
            "I had a professor in college who tried to fail my group because one member didn\u2019t participate in the final presentation\u2026 because she has been in a car accident and was in a coma!!! We had her work she\u2019d done before the accident and showed him, proving she had been participating, but he was adamant that we hadn\u2019t finished the requirements. We went above his head, with proof that she was in the hospital fighting for her life, and our grade got changed. \n\nI happened to see this professor again on campus a few months later. He tried to greet me with a friendly smile and I gave him the angriest death glare I could muster. I also did my best to let people know to never take his classes.",
            "The kind of people who hate having you go over their head are the EXACT kind of people who should be gone over.\n\nOut of the whole situation their immediate take away was that you were the problem... when in reality you were the only one not being a broken cog in the machine.\n\nI hope they did get fired as such awful work ethic for a professor is just unprofessional and can even ruin people's lives.",
            "This situation reminds me of when I had to organise my group for a record session in Uni. They pretty much had to say what their profession is on the project and what they will be contributing. Straight forward, except for one member of the group, I continuously asked him to get it done.\n\nHe never completed it, and I had to combine all of the videos at the end; when it got to his part of the video, I used a generic photo of him displaying his name. Unintentionally made it look like he died halfway through the project...",
            "I had to do something similar last semester. One professor went ghost for over 2 months and did not grade *anything* from October to the end of the semester. I reached out to her dean and she gave everyone an automatic A for the course.",
            "Something similar happened to me in Uni. I was paired up with some guy who was repeating the class for like the 3rd time. We were supposed to do a presentation, I tried talking to the guy a couple of weeks prior and he told me there'd be no issue and he'd send me his part with a few days to spare. Right.\n\n\nSo I was preparing my part and decided to also prepare his, because I felt he would come up with some bullshit, which he did by ghosting me until the night before the presentation was due to take place. He then told me he had prepared a completely different thing.\n\n\nNow, this teacher was notorious for being a dick, so when my partner tried to present the wrong thing, the teacher told him to take a seat after like 30 seconds. I presented both parts and actually did well. Teacher said I'd done okay. \n\nSurprise! Grades come and I had failed the class due to the other guy's fuck up. I went to see the teacher to see if something could be donez and he only changed his mind after I told him I was applying for a semester abroad and his grade was the only thing keeping me from getting it.",
            "It is a hope you had a paper trail to back you.  This, along with not responding to email in a timely fashion, is likely what killed the job for him.",
            "This is why, as a teacher, when I assign group projects, as long as you are okay with the effort from your teammates, fine. But if someone isnt pulling their weight, or does nothing, their grade will be affected (I just need documentation). \n\nHonestly i thought you doing all 6 parts was ingenious and i would've awarded the \"wow\" factor, which probably would've resulted in 100%.\n\nEdited typos.",
            "In my sophomore year, the biology teacher asked us to prepare a presentation about celular division. Somehow I got the worst group. No one was moving a single finger to help to organize the presentation. So, I decided to prepare it myself and give everyone else their part to present and asked just one thing: at least read the others' content before the presentation.\n\nOf course they didn't read a single bit.  Some of them, I believe, didn't even read their parts on beforehand.\n\nSo, the presentation day comes, and everyone \"presents\" reading their parts from a paper. I was the only one really talking as if I knew the subject (what indeed I knew, since I was the one doing everything).\n\nThe teacher waited until the end and just asked a couple of questions about the subject. Of course, no one knew how to answer any of them. So the teacher asked me if I could do the entire presentation again, by myself.\n\nI did and got A+. Everyone else in the group got the lowest score.\n\nAt least they understood that it was not my fault and were not angry at me. They got better after that.",

            "I had a government teacher who put me with the \"bad\" kids for a group project. These kids weren't bad per say but they were well known for not doing a damn thing and he knew it.\n\nWe had to do the work for this project in class so they were literally right in front of him doing fuck all while I did everything, we were 4 feet from his desk so the only way he could have missed any of it was if he was completely blind. He obviously wasn't because every 2 to 3 minutes he would yell at my group to help me and do the work.\n\nI talked to him about this because I would fail and have to take another class next year, he said it was fine and if they didn't do anything and I did my part then he would at least pass me.\n\nWell we got grades back for it and surprise surprise I was the only one who turned anything in, and another big surprise was the giant 0 I got back because the other people didn't do anything. I asked him about it and he said he gave me a 0 because the other people didn't do anything, you know the exact thing he said he wouldn't fail me for he did.\n\nJokes on him though the retake class was easy as hell, I just had to show up. Actually not even show up, I skipped some days to do work in another class and just told someone to tell the teacher where I was at. Perfect attendance in that class all year.",
            "Most of those \"professors\" are just lecturers by craft and are hired on an \"as needed contract basis\" meaning they all have a canned 12-16 week process and just mail in the effort.  When I was in school I always made a point to visit with the \"professor\" in the first week and find out if they were tenured, what their research work was in or if they were just clicking boxes for a pay check.  It's amazing how the dynamic of the class would change once you knew that kind of information.",
            "Proud of you for taking control of the situation. The system is not exactly fair in college, but luckily you were able to fight for what is rightfully yours. Although you deserve a better grade, sometimes life just isn't fair. I'm so happy that you passed",
            "I hate group projects for precisely this reason, there will always be at least one person who doesn\u2019t pull their weight. \n\nI had an assignment for my MBA and one guy decided to do the bare minimum, so me and another member decided to just do all the work since his contributions had to undergo so many edits and corrections it was just easier to do it for him.\n\nWe decided to be nice and still include his name since we didn\u2019t want him to fail, especially since he was a foreign student and their fees are higher than locals.\n\nOn the day of submission where we had to sign our names on the cover sheet to acknowledge the submission, he had the audacity to ask us to sign it on his behalf. \n\nThat was the last straw, I told him if he couldn\u2019t even sign his own damn name after we did all the work for him, we were just going to leave his name out and he would fail. He rocks up to class 15 minutes later all sheepish looking and signs his name and thanks me and the other group member for our work.",
            "I still remember in high school a \u2018group\u2019 presentation that my history teacher had given the class a week to work on.  I had been sick since the project was assigned, and found out about it when I came back - the day before the presentation.  Teacher offered to have me join a group and get the same credit they did.  I refused, and spent that class putting together a solo presentation.\n\nDid it as the only person left at a news broadcast, as everyone else I would have swapped to was either at the sit-ins, or affected by boycotts and protests.\n\nI still group projects and presentations.",
            "I must have been lucky in college because my teams for group projects rocked.\n\nOur physics group project team had two engineering students, a graphic designer, and me, a math major. The engineers would conduct the experiments, the graphic artist would do the pictures, and I'd show the equations behind the physics. Every team project we did that semester (I think there were four) was an A for us, and we had a blast every time we got together.",
            "I had a group project in my final year of my Bachelors and we were spilt up into small groups (there was only around 14/15 people in the class). It was worth 50% and contained multiple parts, such as a presentation, Q&A and a 5-page summary.\n\nThere was a guy who never showed up to class and was put in a group of 2 girls that I knew. After messaging him and limited response from him, they went to our professor and explained the issue. She contacted him and he lied, saying something along the lines of that the girls were excluding him from the conversation and weren't communicating with him properly. \n\nThey showed our professor the full chain of messages in the group chat which he received and his lack of response. This professor is really nice and understanding (she was one of the girls and I's peoject supervisor that same year).\n \nIn the end, they were allowed to join our group project instead. I don't what happened, but I know he was made to write an essay for his assignment.",
            "You totally did the right thing, though you should have sent an email to the prof first, and when he didn't reply, go to the admin.\n\nThe worst part is that the group project with individual speeches for each group member is a great way to do a collaborative project. The fact that guy did six times the amount of work required is really the worst.",
            "Your only mistake was not going above his head earlier BEFORE  the project was due.\n\nWould have really save you the struggle of doing a group project on your own.",
            "Not that I think that this professor would care, but if this happens again in the future CC the professor after only one week of no response from groupmates to alert them of the problem. Not only is this what (good) professors need to know to correct the issue, it's basic CYA you'll need to learn to use if/when you work in an office environment. Management (in this case, professors) need to be made aware when coworkers (in this case, group members) are not reachable and don't pull their weight\n\nProfessors want you to think of group projects as something that will be preparing you for the workforce, and that includes CYA, which is the most important lesson you'll need to learn",
            "I hate group projects. My last one was a complete cluster. The cherry on top was the night it was due. The project leader started spamming our group chats asking what he was supposed to turn in. Everybody promptly told him the wrong things. Now mind you, the prof spent 10 minutes the day before going over just this. Eventually, I had to send a screenshot of the project pdf showing the exact items. Said items were highlighted in bright yellow by the professor. Four months and not a single other member, especially the project leader, even read the pdf once.",
            "I was once in a similar situation. Did a majority of the work while other group members did nothing. Day of the presentation arrives. I'm horribly shy at this point and HATED the fact I had to speak in from of the class. I was so nervous my voice was wobbly, but I got through it. My group makes get up, no preparation, and bs their way through. \n\nWe were given our grades immediately after the presentation. Afterwards the professor comes up to me and tells me it was obvious I did the work and they didn't. They still got a higher grade than me.\n\nThere's a reason group projects are the bane of all humanity. The pandemic, climate change... it's all the world's largest group project and therefore we're doomed.",
            "No offense, because I know school is stressful especially these times, but this is SLIGHTLY on you. If your group isn\u2019t responding to you at all, you need to contact your professor way before two days until the due date. Otherwise, I think you did everything else right.",
            "I might get downvoted for this, but you definitely were partially in the wrong. You had two weeks to do the project and when no one responded after 2 attempts you should have communicated that to him then, not 2 days before it was due. \n\nI agree you shouldn\u2019t have gotten a 0, but in the future don\u2019t wait until 2 days before something is due to communicate a problem to your professor.",
            "Like many of these postings. I also did a group project solo. Unfortunately, when the \"group meetings\" occurred during the classroom time,  the groupware software recorded the attendance automatically. But group started to log into the groupware, then do whatever they  wanted, which was NOT our project. \n\nNevertheless,  I  did the work. More specifically, I did ALL the work. I had done some group projects before, but never using group software.  The worst part was when the final meetings came during the playoffs, and one group member was watching  \"the game\" from home (there weren't any other voices from his audio feed, except from the game) but my other group member was watching the game from a sports bar while logged in from his cell phone, and I was treated to dozens of other voices screaming out as the local team was winning.\n\nI, of course, was logged in from home making snarky comments both in the texting feature, and on the audio. I was righteously pissed, and perhaps my language did not reflect professional standards, but I though it all went into the \"bit-bucket\".\n\nWhen I filled out the group assessments, I sent a note of apology to the teacher that I did not keep her apprised of my situation.  Later, to complete another project, she offered me access to her school to do interviews, etc.  When I met her in person for the first time at her school,  I again offered a personal apology about the group assignment. **That is when she quietly informed me the \"groupware\" saved every text, and all of the audio from our \"group\" sessions.  Oops!**",

            "I just took a classroom assessment graduate class and this dude totally fucked up as an instructor. Group projects are bullshit and your grade should never suffer or artificially inflate based upon who you are paired with.

            "I once had a class with a guest professor (a project manager at a business in our field) who wanted to structure the assignments for his class the same way he would handle the employees at his business. He assigned our teams, which most of us expected anyway, and told us what our tasks would be. My group had the classic problem where one member neither attends meetings nor contributes, so we told the professor we wanted that person out of our group. He replied, saying that in the business world, you don\u2019t choose your coworkers. Only management has the ability to fire someone, and it\u2019s done at their discretion. Basically, this was something we just had to put up with. We were mad that it seemed like he didn\u2019t care, but had no choice but to continue the project and divide the extra work between the rest of us. When it came time to present the projects and be graded, the professor told us that this would be treated like a performance review. Those of us who worked hard and put in \u201covertime\u201d picking up the slack would be rewarded with a bonus, and the person who didn\u2019t pull their weight \u201cwas unfortunately being let go\u201d.

Me being the studious student I was (/s), skipped the class where he said we could use a reference sheet, and showed up to the test empty handed. ***BUT***, and thank christ for the *but*, I had taken stats the previous semester, so all of the formulas and processes were fresh in my mind. I took the test and actually felt pretty confident, even without the sheet. \n\nThe next class, prof starts out by saying that people blatantly wrote more info on their sheets than they were supposed to and that he could fuck everybody for cheating. However, what he decided to do instead (bless his heart for this) was collect everybody\u2019s reference sheet and curve the test based on the information every student had available and their results. \n\nImagine his surprise when I went up to him after class and told him I didn\u2019t have a reference sheet.

So, while I hated English classes, I was actually looking forward to this assignment.  I followed the instructions as provided, broke down all my opinions on the meaning with references.  I called my high school English teacher to see if he was willing to check over for glaring mistakes (found none), and turned in what I thought would be an easy A assignment.\n\nI get the paper back.  Not a single mark, and on the last page a gigantic F followed by your opinion is wrong.  After class, I asked the professor about the grade, he said the paper was perfect, but your opinion is wrong.  I asked what the definition of opinion in his sense was, and he replied the standard and expected definition.  As OP, I went over his head to complain, and the next day grade was changed to an A.

He was quite rude every time he spoke to me or looked my direction.  When we finally get to the first test, I got a 100.  He said I either cheated or got lucky (was neither).  100 on the second test, and I got the death stare from hell.

That much time means the expectations are going to be pretty high.  \n\nOn the professor's end I'd say there were issues with:  \n*Not kicking people out of the class that weren't doing anything.  \n*Giving a student a 0 that obviously did something.  \n*Probably didn't check the discussion board to see your attempted communication.  \n*Not responding to earlier e-mails promptly.  \n\nAnd then there's one thing that I really can't say whether or not it was an issue:\n*Not following the chain of command. There are likely 5 levels between your professor and the board of the college. That would be the department chair, college dean, president's hand (goes by various names), and president. Pretty much no student issues should have to escalate beyond the dean, and in the rare chance that it's actually warranted, it probably made national news. In this case, as a faculty I would say you should have talked to the department chair.  \nOn the other hand, the squeaky wheel gets the oil and if there are no repercussions for skipping the chain of command, I can't really fault you for it. What the board should have said was \"Go talk to the department chair.\"; by solving your issue they're just risking you telling your friends about this and having more students complain to them in future semesters.\n\nAs a last note, it's extremely rare for faculty to be fired. It's more likely that he was planning on leaving, may even of had another job lined up, and had essentially 'checked out' of teaching your class. Super sucks when that happens and usually they give very high grades or very low grades. In this case, he probably looked at your project for 3 seconds and said \"F*king students can't follow directions. 0%! I can't wait until I'm done with this school.\"",

            "I taught a college course at a big state university. I had a group project where it was very obvious one group member did all of the work and the other two showed up. When their presentation was done, I asked if that was the case. To their credit they admitted it was. I gave the two dead beats a 0 and kid who worked on the project 100%. \n\nAfter that I had a peer review form for all group assignments. If an entire group said someone was MIA, I\u2019d discuss the circumstances. If they had a serious emergency or something, I\u2019d give them an opportunity to make it up. Otherwise I\u2019d give them a 0. \n\nOne time a student trued to go over my head without trying to work it out with me. He emailed the dean of the college, that dean sent a cornered email to my department head. In it he said he wanted to know more, but said it was ultimately my decision. My department head seemed like he wanted me to change the grade. So responded back with an excerpt from my syllabus, an email exchange with the student, and my very brief justification for his 0. I then scolded the student for not coming to me first. He got a zero and I got the full support from my department head and dean.",

I wound up writing his section of the paper and performing his part of our multimedia portion of the presentation (I was supposed to only put together a Powerpoint for us to use instead of being in the video). I'm frankly surprised he showed up to class on our presentation day to read off his section of the Powerpoint presentation. He read it word-for-word, adding no extra information. Professor knew what was up right away, asked him a question about his supposed part of the project, and called him out in front of the whole class. He failed and the rest of us got A's. Felt good.",
            "This post just unlocked a highschool memory for me, I totally forgot about this story, and now must share it. So, one time in grade 11 I had a group project for social studies, it was a power point project (it was on one if the big wars from the 1900s, don't remember wich exact one anymore), and I was partnered with my now ex friend & one of the biggest slackers in the class. Now both me & my friend needed accomodations for our disabilities, and one of those was that neither of us had to actually present in front of the class. I had bad PTSD (victim of childhood SA), adhd, as well as social anxiety. So I couldn't handle people staring at me, and had panic attacks just thinking about being stared at by everyone. My friend has ASD, plus extreme social anxiety, and couldn't speak in front of the class. So the slacker guy would have had to, if it weren't for our accomodations (since he didn't have disabilities that required accomodations), and he thought he could use him being the only one able to speak in front of the class, as a reason for him to not work on the project. Don't know why he didn't think we had other ways to do the presentation, he really didn't think it through well. So while me & my friend did our part of the project, he kept refusing to do his, saying if we expected him to present by himself, we needed to do his part of the project. Little did he know part of our accomodations were to be able to do the presentation, just for the teacher, and she wouldn't judge us on our presentation skills. So we didn't need to do his part, for us to be able to present our work. On presentation day, he kept waiting for our groups turn to do our presentation, and freaked out a bit when the teacher said the presentations were done, after everyone but us had gone. That's when I chose to explain our accomodations, that he was going to get a zero on this project, and that we hoped he learned a lesson from this. Me & my friend got As for our part of the project, as she didn't want to punish us, for our group partners failure to do his part of the project. As far as I know, he always did his part of the project after that",

We did our draft fine and a suggestion (not a command, just a suggestion) from the teacher was to focus on one thing instead of all 3 of us with our own thing. The others took it as gospel and so we just had to do it that way. We chose one thing and the group member who had already written about it did nothing else. I did my share plus extra. Third person waited until 8pm the night it was due to do their part, and it was barely anything. \n\nWe got a B, but were so close to an A. If they would have put just a little more effort...",

I told them I\u2019d do it, made sure they got their parts on time, and left it at that. Yes, it was hella extra work, but I needed an A and they just weren\u2019t up to it. Big picture. I only sent one email to explain that first situation to the Professor who said do what you need to do, so I did. Knowing I could only count on myself from jump was freeing. Extra work yes, but I knew it was right and got my A.",

When this happens, I only have the student do a portion of the lab report depending on how many people are in the group.",
            "I hated group projects in college. One of the first group projects I did in my second college was a group of four or five can\u2019t remember. Just me and another guy were the only ones communicating throughout the project no else answered the group chat till the day before the project except one. The other guy guy and I did our part extremely well barely read off notes. The others did not know they\u2019re parts and read off their notes completely and I felt like walking out on the group or sitting down. At the end of class the two of us talked to the teacher showing proof they never communicated and we did. We knew our parts and felt embarrassed for the presentation. He gave us 90% for each. Couldn\u2019t give us higher because the others did horrible that he made sure any other projects had to have daily check ins with him about any and all progress. Another group project had this one girl that was really controlling about everything that it was mostly done by her. I did basically nothing in the project but this teacher required peer evaluation as part of the final grade. I admitted I barely did anything and had emails to proof I tried to do anything but the girl kept changing my part to I didn\u2019t do anything. It was kinda like a schedule/timing making class to create a timeline of how long a construction project should take and the timing of every detail in a computer program. I did like a mini version of the program and turn it in with the peer evaluation and got full credit. I think she suspected something cause she gave me the stink eye because I passed the class. There are more stories on why I hate group projects but their the same bs. No one communicates till last minute and others have to pick up their slack or wait last minute to do their part because idk why.",

I\u2019m not entirely sure why she never showed up, but my biggest guess was she had a mental health crisis or simply could not wake up in time for an 8:30 class. Considering how I preferred to work alone I had no issues with that as I was already familiar with the course load.\n\nWhat absolutely infuriated me is that she refused to use any other test bench except the one I used at \u201cour\u201d table, despite there being plenty of breadboards and wires to work with elsewhere. I spent something like two two hour class periods getting a circuit arranged on a breadboard with chips that weren\u2019t working, wires that were a total mess, and overall the perfectionists version of absolute misery and nirvana, to get it finally working.\n\nOnly she comes into class between the period I finally got it arranged cleanly and our next class and completely tore the breadboard apart because she needed to use it for a lab she was catching up on. She then looked at me and said \u201csorry I took pictures of it\u201d, like that was definitely the solution to this problem.

I just needed 3 ideas and panicked when my group didn't contribute. \n\nI called Portsmouth Council who put me in contact with a media department, because Portsmouth has HMS Victory the ship Nelson died on. They were used to students filming around there so I had permission to go and film there. This early 2000s and easy to get onto the naval base. Only one of my group said they'd go with me, an Italian guy called Iacopo. HMS Victory is still an active ship in dry dock and there was a lieutenant on board I forget his actual rank. We were cleared to enter on arrival by security and he escorted us around the ship telling the story of the final battle of Nelson and how he died. We filmed on the ship it went smoothly and the  the following week I edited the whole thing on my ow n.

Since his competence is not up for debate, my only assumption is that his time is constrained by other scheduling demands.

Also, good group communication is a skill and we cannot just presume everyone knows how to do it. \n\n\nI'm well aware that some lecturers/teachers have such enormous groups (I had 350 students as a part-time lecturer) that group projects are often unavoidable, but that's not an excuse to ignore and not address the problems created by them.

Then when you call them out on it during peer assessments, they flip out as if they came up with the whole project. I get the idea of group projects forcing people to learn to work together, but especially in todays day and age of social distancing and technology, everyone works alone as it is. If you want to make it a \u201cgroup\u201d project, give someone an unfinished project and tell them their assignment is to pick up where the other person left off.

One person just didn\u2019t turn up to any meetings or do any of the work, and was rude ti is when we saw him on campus. One person turned up ti the meetings, but didn\u2019t submit any of their allocates work. Two people were ok-ish but not great, so me and one other person ended up doing the entire project pretty much. \n\nAll the chat about \u201cit prepared you for work\u201d no it bloody doesn\u2019t. In my 15 years of being in a professional job, I have hardly had any instances of people behaving like douch bags and not participating. \n\nAnyway, from Y2 onwards we could pick groups, and I buddies up with a group of girls who were all super smart and super keen. Most painless group work ever from then on!",
            "I had two group projects in my undergrad, one I got hosed on, one I got helped on. \n\nFirst one was in a subject I'm expert in (I was a mature student, it was in my area of work).  Four people, two dialed it in.  Prof gave us like an 82% and when he handed the paper back told me 'you should've gotten a 100%'.  yeah, I know but I couldn't manage the other students any more than what I did.  \n\nThe second one was a coding project in a stats course.  Preface, I am the worlds worst coder.  Well, I quit coding many years ago because I'm so horrible so I guess that title now goes to the previous world's second worst coder.  I jumped on the school's subreddit and asked for someone in the class who was willing to work.....and got connected with a computer science major with the same work ethic as me. He ended up doing all the hard coding and I worked on the other stuff like analysis and the presentation.  We got a great mark because of him much more than my work. Buddy completely saved my bacon on that project.",

There were 5 of us on the team, my girlfriend (now wife) and I, a friend of ours, and 2 other students who were friends with each other.  \n\n\nWe had to learn the function, interview the staff, create an audit plan, do the fieldwork, entrance/exit conferences, documentation, etc.    \n\n\nMy GF, friend, and I were very aggressive about getting this done, as there was a lot of steps and documentation needed over about 6-7 weeks.  The other 2 were casual members at best.  They would pop in occasionally with the excuse that they had a heavier workload and/or other commitments.  We complained to the professor, but she insisted that we push forward, as getting the job done was the important part.    \n\n\nWe did excellent work, but were a bit steamed at giving them credit for our hard work.  After we were graded, the professor told us that our \"work\" grade was worth  30% of our grade.  The other 70% would be given by taking the average of your other teammates assessment of your effort/participation.  \n\n\nAnd we had to do it right then, to avoid any collusion.  \n\n\nThe slackers ended up a C because none of us had the heart to totally fail them, seeing as it was a graduate school class, though they deserved it.  The rest of us ended up with an A.",

Group participation was like 50% of the grade for that project. . I had sent many messages in our class group chat, which was monitored by the prof, messaged prof directly about nobody else participating, etc. had to write and perform the whole speech myself, none of the other group members even showed up to class that day, and it was considered our final and worth 35% of class grade.

In the case that this does not occur you have options, If you approach your learning facilitator early they MUST make reasonable adjustments for equity and fairness, and as long as you\u2019re in the right facility they will do so.\n\nWaiting for the last day to make an email hoping for an exception to be made  isn\u2019t reasonable. Universities have a system and it can\u2019t be that flexible in a day.

Teachers really didn't care. \n\nSo we have to do some history work about something. My group was a friend of mine, these two guys, and another one that was planning to do the same the others did. So I talk to my friend, we compare grades and realize that, even if we didn't do this assignment, we were still passing. So we just didn't care. \n\nI remember the day we had to do the presentation about it, these three guys look at us and are like \"so, where is the project?\" We were like \"we didn't do it, you didn't even contacted us to do it so we didn't do it.\" It felt so good. The teacher understood what we did, and I remember he laughed at it.\n\nSo, long story short, the three of them failed, we passed. I have a terrible grade in history lol. But it was worth it.",

We went to the professor showing them that they hadn't done any work at all. They stood up to present the project with us and the professor told them to sit down. Their faces were pure horror since they realized they had just gotten a zero on the final project and failed the class.",

Obviously since it's a two party problem, student and professor, you never know how the other party is going to react.  Blaming you is fucking wild though, that's downright psychotic.\n\nThe funny ending to my problem was the \"What did I learn essay?\"  I wrote a scathing review of this project and how I was certain that I was being set up, and that these sorts of games are not cool to play with innocent students.  I got a perfect score on that as well.",
            "I once had a group project in heat transfer. There were 5 or 6 of us in the group. The professor made it very clear that all group members would need to put forth approx. equal effort and must be able to speak to their sections. If that didn\u2019t happen, then everyone in the group would lose massive points (basically an instant fail on the project if one person drops).\n\nWe were given half the semester to get together and do the project. Well everyone but one person contributed and took part. About a month before it was due, we went to the professor and asked him for advice on getting the other person to join in and help. He offered to speak to the student on our behalf, and apparently the student responded to the professor like he was going to chip in. We still never heard from him, despite many attempts at communication. \n\nA week later, We went to the professor again. He said he would allow us to remove him from the group, but we still had to do his section, and he would be expected to do the whole project himself. \n\nHe stopped coming to class after that and apparently failed the class. At the end, the professor told us he only allowed us to exclude him for two reasons. One, we tried everything humanly possible short of abduction to get him to join in, and we started early enough to keep the professor in the loop and get his help. Two, the kid apparently failed every test and was destined to fail the course, while we all had A\u2019s and B\u2019s and he felt bad for us. After the class was over I\u2019m pretty sure the professor regretted his decision and wished he would have failed the whole group.",
            "That's a bad teacher. You did the best you could. I had one teacher who thought he was the most amazing person because he was once published in Playboy. He taught Humanities in college and literally made all but 2 classmates cry because he publicly roasted 1 by 1 after reading their paper. I guess those 2 people picked some choice key words. I even asked one student how he approached it and he said it was all a game. To find abstract metaphorical meaning that wasn't even there to appease this teacher.",
            "My anxiety for public speaking made me drop the class 3 times before finals at 3 different time periods. Sometimes months, sometimes days, sometimes weeks. It fucked up my financial aid ultimately for like a year. \n\nLater realized it wasn\u2019t worth it at all to drop the speech class since it was mandatory. Took it the 4th time and got a fucking A+.",

I could end up having to extend my course over a 2 ECTS course cuz of these fucks.",
            "I don\u2019t know what I did to make my teacher like me so much but had a project that he explicitly said if we didn\u2019t have a partner we would only get half a grade. I asked multiple people to be my partner and they all declined saying they had a partner already. So I just did the work by myself accepting the half grade. \n\nIn the section where I had to fill out the other persons student number and name I just put \u201clol no one wanted to work with me sorry\u201d and I ended up getting perfect + bonus points because \u201cI made him laugh but next time to tell him if I couldn\u2019t find a partner\u201d \n\nHad him for another class the semester after and was struggling to finish his tests on time. I understood the material well and demonstrated this to him in class but I\u2019m horrible trying to do equations under pressure/time limit but somehow I still passed all his tests. I would write up until \u201cpencils down\u201d and just apologize to him as I handed it in because the front page and last page were usually done but the middle pages were all just half finished equations and scribbles.",
            "Good job. I was the queen of convincing my teachers to let me do group projects alone. I was extremely shy so I think they felt bad for me. I don't know exactly, but it worked about 80% of the time.",
            "I had a few experiences in college like this. But I was in two classes the specifically got a professor fired. \n\nOne was an online English course at a community college. She was moonlighting at the community college but was tenure at the local university. She didn\u2019t even post the syllabus until 3 weeks in. She didn\u2019t grade a single assignment  the whole semester. Then over Christmas she hit half the 170 person class for plagiarism because that little plagiarize software hit it for 10-15% which is typical if you included some quotes. Just your reference page can get that. I didn\u2019t get my final grade in that class until 4 weeks into the next semester. It was such a shit show for the school they told her other job and she was fired from both. \n\nSecond was a night class at local university mentioned above. It was the only time it was offered and the building was locked prior to class so the professor would have to let you in. So if you didn\u2019t show up in the 5 minute window you\u2019d have to miss. He also had a policy that if you missed more than 1 you dropped a letter grade. He was the professor high school teachers warn you about. Can\u2019t be late, no talking, no phones, no extensions, had to ask to go to the bathroom, no missed classes even with valid excuses, must take notes or you\u2019ll get points deducted, list goes on. I got sick one day in class he refused to let me use the restroom or leave. Other students were like \u201clet her go she is obviously really sick\u201d and he just kept saying \u201cyou can go but it\u2019s 10 points off your final grade\u201d so I stayed livid and sick. When I went and reported him the next week I found out half the class had already done it for me. He wasn\u2019t asked back for another semester.",
            "My entire university career has been rife with various situations like this, with multiple professors.\n\nI was worried I was just being dramatic, but apparently it got bad enough that one of the professors was fired for it because he had been undercutting dozens of students' grades for nonsensical reasons that contradicted his own rubric. I was just the only one who was too stubborn to not back down when push came to shove. He even threatened me for it. I tried contacting him for 3 months, and he would never respond, so I had to give to the department chair. He ghosted THEM too! The school launched an investigation and ended up having to replace him with someone else to grade assignments for the last month or so of the semester. Then the next semester, the school 'declined' to renew his contract.\n\nI feel bad, because I basically got the guy fired, but... He was screwing with students grades, tuition, lab fees, and scholarships with his grading crap. It's hard to not feel conflicted.",
            "In uni, one of my profs was really bad. Phoning it in every lesson, showing no interest in the very material he was supposed to engage us with, and just generally teaching *the room* instead of anyone in it.\n\nI did my work and passed the class, as did a friend of mine, but where I was merely disappointed that the prof was a dud, she was offended. On the last day of class she wrote and hand-delivered to him a letter which I won't be able to recite from memory, but the general flow went roughly, \"there are some professors that I'll remember for the rest of my life, and I know you are one of them, because you made this class a chore.\" It waxed poetic about education as a beautiful and sacred thing, and then described his class and all the ways his lazy, inept teaching made it ugly, boring, and useless. \n\nHe left education the following year. I like to believe her letter moved him toward leaving, instead of an already-planned departure being the reason for his piss-poor lessons, but I'll never know the real reason."

My daughters actually just asked me to post this story here.\n\nAnyway, so I was a good student and had a great reputation among the faculty at this school of about 2000 students.\n\nDuring class, I am running an errand for a teacher when I walk by the smoking area.  It is outside of course, but it is against one of the buildings and has a roof over it like a carport.  There is a large metal trash can in the middle.  And it is on FIRE.  Not a rip-roaring fire, but is on fire nonetheless.  We have flames starting to work there way out of there and plenty of smoke.\n\nI decide I don't need to pull a fire alarm, but clearly I need to get a staff member to put this fire out.  There's no one around, so I make a fast trot up to the Main Office.  As I quickly enter, I see the Secretary talking to another student, so with a loud voice I say, \"Ms. Knight Ms. Knight there's a...\" \n\nAnd that's when the Assistant Principal rounds the corner behind Ms. Knight while ripping into me about how we wait our turn in here and how I am being disrespectful and loud and I need to stand there and wait until I am called forward.\n\n\"Okay\"  And then I just stood there while Ms. Knight kept helping the other student as Mr. Evil Assistant Principal stood overwatch in the corner like a bouncer.\n\nFinally after a few minutes, it was my turn.  I calmly walked up to the counter and said, \"Ms. Knight, the large trash can in the smoking area is on fire\".\n\nThe Asst.

In my school it was called the \"Tobacco Area\". Possession of tobacco on school grounds outside of the smoking area was a major infraction, which more than a few parents pointed out was crazy. If you let students use tobacco, you have to let them HAVE tobacco. Our principal couldn't figure out why anyone had a problem with the tobacco rules. \n\nBut my high school handbook had another interesting rule. Guns were only allowed to be kept in a locked vehicle or locked in the gun rack in your vehicle. We have a bunch of families involved in agriculture in our area. If you are working a ranch or farm, you need a gun handy. Our state has a LOT of snakes. So guns were allowed, but only in your car.

            "Somewhat along these lines: summer of 1995, I was driving through the West Side of Chicago en route home and saw a vacant lot on fire on one of the major east-west streets such as Madison.  This was before mobile phones were widespread, so I looked for a pay phone to report it.\n\nDialed 911 from the phone, about a 1/4 mile down the street, and the calltaker asked me for my present location, i.e, where am I calling from (never mind that I already supplied the fire's location).  She then argued with me that the intersection from which I was calling didn't match her records.  Never mind the fire that's underway.\n\nIt gets worse--she then gets a sergeant on the line and he rips into me about the payphone location discrepancy, accusing me of lying.  At that point I said, \"Look, I was taught as a kid that if I see a fire I need to call the fire department.  There's a vacant lot on fire a short distance from here--I'm just doing my civic duty.  But if you want to let it burn and have another Great Chicago Fire on your head, that's on you.  Sorry to have bothered.\"  And I hung up.\n\nAt this point I wondered if they'd bother sending CFD in response.  I drove back by the same lot and at that point firefighters were hosing down the lot from their truck, so at least Chicago didn't burn that day like it did in 1871.",

Roofers are working on the room.\"  Well, it happens that I'm not only quite sensitive to smoke, I an readily distinguish what sort of fuel is burning.  This was NOT hot tar.  Supervisor ignored me, so  I just went to lunch.  When I got back,  there was a clear haze in the room.  Supervisor still ignored me, so I took my work and went to the library a couple wings away and worked there all afternoon.  When I got back, two of my senior colleagues were tearing apart the ceiling in the supervisor's office, fire extinguisher in hand, and the fire department had been called.  The supervisor was right all the time.  It was the roofers, alright.  They'd set the roof on fire.\n\nAnother time I smelled smoke in the room but nobody else seemed to.  I could identify it as burning electronics -- a very clear smell to me.  Supervisor ignored it -- until an electronic component started putting out visible smoke.

        "selftext": "The background- \n\nI used to be an Armorer in the US Army. (I was the person in charge of securing and maintaining all the weapons)\n\nI was stationed overseas at a base that only had one arms room, and I was the guy who ran it, so instead of just being responsible for the weapons in my unit, I was responsible for all the weapons in the entire post. \n\nOn paper, that's a job that's supposed to be done by an E6 with a two person support staff. In reality the position was chronically short staffed. It was just me, as an E4, doing the job of three people.\n\nBecause the position was critical to the operations of a bunch of different units (including things like PsiOps and Special Forces where everything about them is classified by default, and joint operations with the navy and air force, and a few foreign militaries who were working with the US), I had to get a security clearance that was higher than everyone else in my own unit. As far as I knew, there were only 4 other people on the post with clearance high enough to do what I did, and they were all officers. (This led to some amusing situations where I was accidentally called for security briefings that were *way* above my pay grade.)\n\nThat sucked because I was on call all the time, and had to go to work anytime anyone needed a weapon. Being on call was supposed to be a duty rotation, but I was the only one who could do it. So I slept in the arms room a lot. \n\nI wanted to make sure I had as little to do as possible so I got *very* good at my job. How good? During an army wide review of the entire supply chain, my post was found to be the best run arms room in the entire army. I won a medal and everything.\n\nThen we had a change in command, and the new captain *hated* that I didn't have to go on training exercises because I wasn't allowed to be more than 30 minutes away from the arms room, ever. \n\nThe Compliance-\n\nThe new Captain was absolutely determined to take me on a training mission. She'd somehow gotten it into her head that I was a slacker (which I absolutely was, but only because I was efficient and pissed off that I never got to leave the base).\n\nSo she drew up a bunch of paperwork to sign the arms room over to the supply sergeant. \n\nI refused to sign, because the person with all the ammo and the person with all the guns are supposed to be *different people*\n\nNext she tried to sign the arms room over to the PsiOps company commander. I refused to sign because that commander had become a friend of mine so I knew he was required to leave the base weekly for security briefings. \n\nFinally she tried to sign the arms room over to our company's supply lieutenant. I tried to explain that the lieutenant didn't have high enough security clearance, but she cut me off. She said she was tired of my excuses.\n\nThen she *ordered* me to sign, and threatened me with an Article 15. \n\nI wrote \"Under Duress\" on the paperwork. \n\nShe didn't even look at the signature. \n\nSo I sent an email to the Warrant Officer who was in charge of logistics for the area (he was the guy who'd given me the award I mentioned earlier, so he was pissed when he found out what was going on) and went on the shitty little weekend training exercise and basically enjoyed my vacation.\n\nThat sequence of events happened on a Friday afternoon. The Chief didn't get my email until Monday morning. \n\nOn Monday afternoon my Captain was relieved of command. \n\nI eventually had to testify at her disciplinary hearing. \n\nMy second favorite part of the whole experience was the supply lieutenant (who got a slap on the wrist for inadvertantly obeying illegal orders because he hadn't learned the regulations before signing) saying \"Is it like that for you all the time? This has to change.\"\n\nMy favorite part was the full bird Colonel in charge of the hearing asking my former commander \"Your soldier was awarded for being the best at his job in the entire army. After he refused your orders the first few times, why didn't you start asking questions?\"\n\nEdit: Some clarity about a bunch of questions I've been getting.\n\nThis was at Camp Hialeah. It doesn't exist anymore, but you can look it up to see all the different units that were there. They all used the same arms room, and yes that's weird and it sucked.\n\nI had a TS clearance. It was explained to me that knowing the weapons logistics of the whole post was a big deal. I had the training and deployment schedules of two dozen units, including foreign militaries, other branches, and an SF group. That's a lot of important information, and it was definitely above my pay grade. I absolutely *should not* have been the person doing that job, but I was. I knew I needed to cover my ass, which is why I was so careful about record keeping. \n\nThere were probably more than 4 people with TS clearance on the base. I only knew of four. Unsurprisingly, none of them wanted to do my job and had the clout to say no when asked. \n\nI didn't actually go to any fancy security briefings. I was mistakenly called twice, and promptly told to leave. (I think the person scheduling the briefings just sent a shotgun email to everyone who had a TS clearance. After the second time I stopped getting them, so someone must have sorted it out)\n\nAt the disciplinary hearing, I was called to answer questions. I showed up, answered, and was dismissed. It was a long drive to another base for 30 minutes of standing and talking. I don't know anything about the results. The captain didn't come back. That's all I know. \n\nThe award I won is called an ARCOM. It's not uncommon. I wasn't some kind of indispensable prodigy. I was just in a job above my pay grade and scared of fucking up, so I took very meticulous records. Because I was the only one doing anything, I had to really know the system. So I got an award for being good at passing an audit.\n\nI'd like to thank the people who introduced me to Zach Hazard. I've been binging his stuff on YouTube since last night. It's hilarious and vindicating.\n\nAnd yes I know it's PsyOps. That was me having a moment of stupid and I'm not going to fix it because the jokes in the comments are pretty funny.",

My direct manager is pissed and tries to argue against it but was told by the SSGT \u201cwe pay for your clearance and we pay for your team to be on base, we\u2019ll use them how we see fit or you can leave.\u201d\n\nWeek later and I\u2019m in the kitchen, mug of tea in one hand and phone in the other.

I was entrusted by the base commander(an O6) to secure said CLASSMAT from anyone that wasn't on the approved list.\n\nAll 3 of these ensigns thought that they were on the list.  They weren't.  They tried to order me to release CLASSMAT to them.  I did not.  They all wrote emails to the chain of command saying that I was disobeying direct orders given by an officer.  They learned REAL QUICK what a legal order entailed.

The restaurant was fairly new but was already filling every table every night because the food was amazing. In addition to my friend and I being the only two hostesses, the bus boys were friends, half of the waiters were friends and the dishwasher was a friend. \n\nThe owners son was the floor manager and with the success of the restaurant started to implement new changes. Everyone must look presentable and in uniform at all times. No dirty uniforms. Even for the bus boy. He was rather rude to all employees and would hover and take over our jobs right in front of customer apologizing for our inability to do our jobs correctly. However, everyone there was fantastic at their jobs. The dish washer even found creative ways to stay clean and tidy. \n\nThe straw broke one night when my friend and I were both working the hostess stand on a packed Saturday night. The manager walked up to us and declared our hair was not compliant with dress code. Both of us had our hair pulled back in the requisite buns. However, we both had a few stray wisps. You know, those tiny little new hairs around your face. Never mind that is was August and it was hot and we were all working as a team like crazy to make sure the night ran smoothly sharing duties such as bussing tables and running foot and drinks (underage). He loudly fired both of us on the spot in front of the entire restaurant and front staff. He then said we were required to continue to work for two weeks and train our replacements. \n\nI asked, are we fired? He said yes. And I said firing means every don\u2019t work for you anymore. We walked out, punched our cards and went to change out of our uniforms. When we got out of the dressing room, there was a line of people waiting to change including the bus boys, half the wait staff, and the dishwasher. All were so mad about what had happened that they quit on the spot. No one liked the job anyway. \n\nWe all went to iHop to eat and we\u2019re soon joined by the rest of the wait staff and the line cooks. So all that was left of the entire restaurant staff was the bartender, the owner/cook and the manager. \n\nI later heard that the owner just decided to shut down the restaurant because the only reason he started it was to provide his son a legacy from the family businesses in Italy and he decided his son couldn\u2019t handle it.",

That is, you had a **union** that you never even had to talk about or recognize as such to form.\n\nIn case any other service industry folks are reading this: you *can* and *should* organize with your coworkers. r/union and r/workplaceorganizing are great places to find resources to get informed and get started.",

Two customers come to the register together, and one asks for cigars. Company policy, and state law, requires that I id both customers. I turn to grab the cigars after asking to see id from both, and one of the customers leaves the store.\n\nUnfortunately, in this scenario, I cannot finalize the sale until I see id from both customers, regardless of if one leaves. I tell the customer this, and he argues with me. The manager is on the register right next to me, so I explain that no, I need to see the id, or I cannot sell either customer age restricted items.\n\nIt\u2019s now 10:02. My shift officially ended at 10, though we are allowed to and encouraged to stay on the clock while there is a rush. The customer claims he doesn\u2019t know the other guy, even though it was clear they were together. Annoyed but just wanting to get out of this interaction, I say \u201cwhatever\u201d and set up the terminal to take his card. He puts his card in, and the reader asks \u201cis this amount correct?\u201d or something of that nature. Customer hits no.\n\nA lot of customers do this, they don\u2019t read and think the screen is asking if they want cash back, but if they hit no, it cancels the transaction. Usually, we would then reset it, walking them through to make sure they hit the right button. But then I think, what\u2019s going to happen? It\u2019s my last day, I\u2019m supposed to be clocked out, I don\u2019t care about this job, and company policy prohibits managers from giving references anyways. I say \u201cokay, you hit no, so good night,\u201d I put the cigars back, and I clock out.\n\nAfter clocking out, I mention it to the manager, who says the customer looked confused for a minute and then just gave up and left, dumbfounded.",

He pulls out a temporary paper id that is 4 YEARS expired. Says he can't afford to get it updated. I told him, well, you aint buying today (he bought a 5th of whiskey and 2 packs of smokes every day) so you can take all that money you are saving now and go update your ID, cuz you're not buying here again until you do!\n\nI then made sure to tell the store manager, and the man was actually banned from buying without getting a new id.

So I did.\n\nSome cops don't like people to see their full names and addresses, and this one refused my request. With the watchful eyes of Helen burning into the back of my skull, I told her that I couldn't sell it to her. She could see what was going on and didn't get mad at me. Instead she had her partner, who was a gorgeous twenty-something buy it. \n\nThis seemed like an equitable solution to me, but I immediately heard the words *no two party sale!* coming from behind me and I just shrugged my shoulders.

The paper temporary license he had at the time doesn't have a picture, so he used his expired license that has his picture together. And it literally says on top of both paper and old expired license that both need to be present to be accepted as legal ID. The lady wouldn't accept it. We argued a bit because it should be accepted. The lady wasn't budging. So we looked at each other, said fuck it and walked out. My friend had to get his passport from home and we ended up buying things from another store.

        "selftext": "I've  worked at many retail chains... have had MANY terrible bosses... here's one story I think I can give up without any repercussions.\n\nAt a small specific retail store, 5-6 years ago at this point, I was confronted by my old boss on a specific event that I was late by two minutes.\n\nPrevious day, he had asked me to come in on my day off - and at an earlier time than I normally do. I agreed to come in on my day off and work a shift I am not normally used to -but it's retail, it cannot be that difficult.\n\nMy old boss asked me to work 7AM to 4PM, and I showed up at 7:02AM. Which, in my state, there is a 5 minute window for everyone, and this was 100% not a habit of mine at all. I am normally one to show up 5 minutes early everyday and wait aside the time clock. I clocked on, and walked to my department with a drink I had already purchased the previous day.\n\nAs I walked into the department, the manager greeted me then said, \"When I schedule you at 7AM, I expect you to be IN department by 7AM. Not a minute later. We can't pay you to clock on, buy something, and then start working.. over the course of a year that adds up to hundreds of dollars of lost labor for one individual.\" I told my old boss that my drink was from the previous day, and that I just clocked on 2 minutes late. My old boss replied with, \"That's not my problem, you need to plan better. You were scheduled at 7 and we are losing cost of labor each minute you are not here. Be in department AT scheduled time!\"\n\nWhich is not true. I spoke regularly with a payroll employee - and she explained to me quite some time prior, that the company does not pay you 3 minutes before or after your scheduled time. So if you clock on at 7AM, you are not getting paid until 7:03AM. If you clock on at 6:57AM, you are not getting paid until 7AM. Same for when you return from lunch. However, if you clock on at 7:04, after that 3 minute window - you begin getting paid immediately that minute.\n\nMy boss was right, I NEED to plan better.\n\nI asked for a print out of my time stamps going back as far as they had record of... and I tallied up EACH day that I had arrived 3 minutes early - and did not get paid for it. I counted well over 330 minutes within a three month span that I was not getting paid for - which ended up being a little over $110.\n\nI gave my old boss a copy and said, \"You can pay me for these dates where I was in department, on the dot, without getting paid for it.\"\n\nMy old boss then replied, \"That's not how our company policy works.\" He then went into detail, to explain to me, exactly what I had already known - and gave him a copy of... yet my old boss is now recognizing that he's contradicted himself and willingly lied to me. When everything clicked in his head that he's contradicted himself - it was far too obvious because his face went bright red and he started smiling... imo, like he had been caught.\n\nMy old boss: Well  you know the policy, we can't pay you for that. :)\n\nMe: Then I will begin my shift when I am getting paid, not the minute you schedule me. It's not like you're losing labor if you're not even paying the employees that window of time. Schedule me at 7, if you like but I will not be clocking on until 4 minutes after the scheduled time, as you will not be losing any cost of labor for it, and I will not be losing pay over your personal policy.\n\nFor about three weeks, I clocked on 4 minutes late everyday, no matter how early I arrived. I eventually got a warning from the building's HR that it's riding the line and very close to getting a write-up, and down the discipline road. I explained to her the entire story, as she seemingly did not like this manager of mine either, she laughed pretty hard at the whole thing and offered me a department transfer, with a higher pay. She reminded me that my behavior was listed under a category that could get me terminated, and thought the transfer would be a fresh start. Instead, I put in my two weeks notice and thanked her for the wonderful opportunity.\n\nThe funniest part of all of this, years later I saw my old manager working at a new chain, in a similar position to what he was doing when I worked for him. He smiled, waved. I smiled, waved, continued on.\n\nAs time went on, I also bumped into the old HR manager, who was working in an entirely different field... I asked her why my old boss left that company... she laughed and said, \"He didn't leave, we fired him for time theft!\" Apparently my old boss would take a lunch, leave the building, and never clock out for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit:grammar",

            "A long time ago I worked at a gas station and was asked to cover another shift on my day off. But I was asked about 40 minutes before the shift started so I told the store manager that I can do it, but I would be about 15-20 minutes late.  Well when I come in, and try to clock in, only to be greeted by the store manager berating me for coming in late and how important coming in on time was.  I tried to clock in, but she kept cutting me off and standing in my way, so I being tried because I only had around 4-5 hours of sleep over the last 2 days, turned around and left.  Since she was the manager on duty, and the only other employee in the store, she had to cover the shift instead.",
            "I knew someone with a job like that. They wanted you there fifteen minutes early for a debrief on shift change but didn\u2019t let you clock in until your scheduled time. Took a few years but eventually they had to give everyone back pay. It was absolutely ridiculous.",
            "Once upon a time, I had a manager who would check the time clock app on our cash registers and manually edit everyone's times while muttering, \"nope, he took longer than that. She took longer than that too.\" etc...\n\nShe got to my name and I told her that I print receipts every time I click in or out and would sue her pants off if she altered mine. Then I spread the word to everyone else that she was stealing minutes of their pay everyday, and they should print receipts, too.\n\nMany years later, I was working a job that didn't have a time clock at all. I was the only non-salaried employee and simply wrote my hours on a time sheet and got paid appropriately. Everyone worked 8-5 with staggered one hour lunch breaks. \n\nI was always the last one to get a lunch break and my boss would always tell me to wait until the last salaried employee came back from his break before taking mine, and run a bunch of errands on my way back.\n\nThe guy before me would go home and play PS3 for an hour, then go shopping for lunch and sit in the break room eating for another hour. I considered his break over when he returned with his sandwich. I'd pre-order my lunch, pick it up, eat it in the car while running the errands, then return to work and browse reddit on my phone for an hour. The salaried guy was usually still in the break room when I returned, and the boss would see both of us sitting on ass, playing on our phones and get mad.\n\nUpon realizing I had already completed all of my errands and ate, but the guy who started his break before me was still eating, he'd direct his anger at the right employee and then challenge me to a game of words with friends.",

            "Similar story just happened yesterday.\nI was late by 3 minutes, boss gives me the same \"hundreds of dollars lost\" spiel, and tells me they don't pay me to be 3 minutes late.\n\nEvery wednesday, we have a pretty big meeting with the big bosses, whom none speak Spanish. My boss and his boss both speak very poor English, so it is part of my job to be at the meetings and generate a summary of it, and ask questions.\n\nExcept, my shift starts at noon, and those meetings are at 10am. So i just didn't show up. I ignored their calls too, and made it to my desk as the clock ticked over. I get immediately called to the boss' boss office and get yelled at for being irresponsible and ignoring their calls. After about 10 minutes of them both yelling at me, while I stood in silence, boss' boss ask if I have anything to add.\n\nI reminded them my shift starts at noon. Boss' boss is confused, and my boss is draining color, for he knows what is about to happen.\nBoss' boss asks me to explain, and I simply state that yesterday I was late by 3 minutes, and sternly reminded that I'm not paid to be late and expected to be on time. It stands to reason I'm not paid to be early either, as every wednesday i take an hour long meeting before my shift, and then clock my 8 hour shift on top of that, but strangely only get paid for the clocked hours. After a month, that is half a day worth worked for free, and it was against my best interests to continue to be working for no pay.\n\nMy boss instantly tried to change focus on how me working an extra hour a week was no reason to be a few minutes late. Boss' boss ignored that, and asked me to tally all of my extra hours for him, and to remind him next week to add an extra hour to my time.",
            "I worked in a factory for a few years. One day my manager asked to see me about some paperwork as I came in. It took about 20 min to get through, which caused me to start my shift 15 min late (didn't even get a chance to clock in because the machines were further in).\nFew weeks later I get called in again. Manager asks me why I was 15 min late that day, I remind him he called me in. He proceeds to berate me and tell me that's no excuse. I told him that if I hadn't listened to him I would've been berated and when I do listen I still get berated. \nHe kept giving me shit and told me any shift I started late (was late for my shift that time aswell because of him) would be written up and that that day was the second time in a month so I might already be in trouble.\n\nI worked a 0-hour contract so my response was \"what do you mean? I'm not even working today\".\nHe was confused and looked at the schedule for that day, with my name on it. He said I was scheduled for that day. I just said \"Oh, that's right. But I'm not working today. Or tomorrow. Or the day after. You know what? I'm not working here ever again. Goodbye.\" and went home. Officially let HR know I quit and to take me off every schedule I was on, and why.\n\nThe best thing is, when someone doesn't show up someone else has to cover that shift. That day it would be my manager. He does that occasionally but he was a lazy bastard who enjoyed sitting in the office pretending to be busy more.",

            "In many states that \"policy\" constitutes labor theft.  In my experience, every single hourly job I had, except one locally owned (by 4 partners- NOT one husband and wife- that seems to be the reason they did not suck) restaurant, shorted my pay.  I don't know exactly when I caught on- but I started keeping those little time card print outs, and comparing them to my pay check around 18-20 yr old.  And EVERY SINGLE CHECK was short 20 min or more.  Across hundreds of employees a year, that is a LOT of labor theft.  But I knew my rights, and I complained and filed correction requests, along with a copy of each state's law.  Eventually they would each stop doing it to me.  I educated my fellow employees on this rip off, but very few of them bothered to check and compare and see if they were getting paid.  IDK, I only made $10/hr or so- I needed every dime I was EARNING.  I guess they did not. \n\nInterestingly, years later, my mom started an hourly nursing role (RN) in a \"religious\" hospital.  I told her to check her time cards/paychecks....that they did it to her too!!!

So he saw me standing around one day, scolded me for it and threw in that line. And it got me thinking! What am I being paid for? What value do I bring?\n\nWhile cleaning, stocking, and serving deli meats was definitely part of it, those didn't take up *most* of my time. You might disagree with me here, but what I came to realize is that the biggest value I brought was my *presence*. It's not the actual serving customers but the *being ready to*. It's the fact that I am there exactly when a customer wants food that's crucial. Think about it. If the *store* chooses the time it serves customers rather than customers coming by at their own convenience, it'd be a terrible store that no one would visit. \n\nIn the end, thanks to that conversation, rather than always looking for something unimportant to take my time, I became more self assured in just standing and chatting while on the clock.",

            "I had an old manager do something very similar.\n\nI used to be an assistant manager in retail and if my staff were running late I would clock them in on the system because they were casual and my manger would get them, and me, in trouble if they were late (I was supposed to call them etc if they were more than 1 minute late).\n\nMost of the staff were international students taking public transport to work and I knew that was unreliable because there was only one route to work. Anyway, one day I clocked in a guy who was 5 minutes late, then he was 10 minutes late, so I called and he was sick in bed and slept through his alarm on cold and flu meds. I sympathised with the guy and said no worries, organised a replacement and logged him out on the system after 5 minutes.\n\nThe problem was the manager saw a 5 minute shift and asked me about it, i told the truth and he absolutely cracked it, wanted me write down whenever I had done this in the past and the company would get the money back from the worker. I lied and said i only did it when i had called people so it was less than a minute and 'forgot' who I did it for. I still get an official warning from him.\n\nFast forward several months, the owner of the business and the regional manager come in and talk with the manager. Next thing I know he is gone, no warning, no goodbyes. Eventually I learn he was coming in early on weekdays (like 2.5 HOURS early) saying he needed to do paperwork. He would clock in then go get a coffee, play on his phone etc. So he had stolen probably hundreds of hours worth of pay from the company and he was threatening me for maybe 15 minutes across my whole time there.

Then on Saturday I come in late a few minutes because there had been an accident and I was a first responder on scene.\n\nMy manager says it\u2019s okay and sends me out to supervise three flights at the same time, which isn\u2019t allowed, safety and such, so a normal summer day and my shift plays out as usual. Many late planes, annoyed/late passengers, missing bags all that. Then at around 6am, my shift was supposed to end at 3, things start to calm down a bit he calls me in and rants at me we have strict schedules and need to be there on time and I can\u2019t just come whenever I want to.\n\nAfter the week and especially day I had I couldn\u2019t care less at this point and just told him he\u2019s right, we really should stick to schedule and clocked out and left. \n\nHe was really apologetic the next day \u2026 guess they really needed the workers \u2026",

It was overnights so i saw my manager like once a week because he was a peice of shit that didn't like to come in at the time he should. \n\nWell apparently my information about the 5 minute window was incorrect and for almost 2 full months i was violating the break policy, nobody notified me a single time. Then one day my manager finally comes in and gives this sheet that basically says i owe the company 15 HOURS of my vacation time because i had 15 separate violations over a couple months. They wanted me to use an hour per violation that was essentially 2 to 3 minutes over the limit. I asked him why i was just finding out about this after so many violations and he said that HR should've contacted me.

In December of 2017 they started changing from specific area support buildings to regional support buildings. \u201cLuckily\u201d my building was deemed the regional building , and everyone from Buffalo NY to Albany was forced to change position, find a new job, or relocate to where our building was. \n\nWe went from supporting Buffalo and Rochester to supporting all of New York, as well as Vermont to Connecticut.

Then one day for some reason I had to clock back in early to help with something, it happened to be 19 minutes total. I was looking at everything at the end of the day, I have an extra 30 minutes On my timesheet. I thought Did I not punch out for lunch at all? Yeah it says I did. The next day I punch in and out for lunch for 25 minutes, and it takes 25 minutes off my timesheet. To make a long story a little less short, I figured out if clock out for less than 20 minutes it would take no time off at all, and HR would see a lunch punch in and out and not question it. \n\nTLDR found a loophole where if I clocked out for less than 20 minutes It wouldn\u2019t take any time out of my timesheet at all. \n\n\u2014 if you knew the company you would be proud.

I didnt know this until months after i started. I was only getting paid hours i worked, instead of 4 hours like everybody else. In my state, obviously its not a legal requirement to pay 4 hours on the weekend, but it is a legal requirement if everyone else is, and they decide to exclude a person from that thats in the same position. So after i found that out i traced back every single weekend i worked there, all the way back since i started. Every weekend day i worked was 1/2-1 hr short of the 4 hours everyone else was getting.

It was a good time and fun job and best  of all most of the clerks (kids) we use to hang out and party etc. after hours. There was this pharmacist she was early-mid thirties, and would joke with me any time i came by the pharmacy counter or whenever i was stocking prophylactics and such in front of the pharmacy i would make products comments loud enough for her to hear if she was on the other side. There was nothing romantic or anything we were just talking shit cause i was bold enough to say it to her so our banter would go the whole shift or until one of use departed. She got along with the rest of the clerks that were mostly HS females because that's all that both the manager and assistant manager would hire so it was me and another guy on alt shifts and he would keep mostly to the lottery machine all the time. I would work the register or the stock the isles or anything deemed heavy. There was a major bus transit station right outside one of the sides of the store so it was not unusual for someone to walk in grab a plastic trash bin or some type of container and go down the candy isle and dump boxes into it and tag a receipt on the side of the container put it over their shoulder and walk out in time to get on the bus while he's buddy was waiting outside to block the doorway long enough to hop on the bus.... long story short - some other folks waiting in the lottery line would get hungry, and wonder over to the candy open a bag of M&Ms  or whatever grab a handful stuff it in their mouth and get back inline without a care in the world. So when I restocked I would pull the open packages, dump them in a box outside the managers tiny office where we clocked in and everyone would  grab a handful of candy when they went in/out before the managers recorded the \"item losses\" and dump them. I made the mistake of grabbing a handful as i was coming in the door carrying the box cause i need to cover a register, the manger came out of his tiny office and screamed at me that i was stealing from the company and fired me right there even as the AM protested the whole thing. The MA was no saint he did it mainly cause I was the only one dumb enough to run after the guys stealing stuff and he was too fat, but we also got along. I was devastated for being fired for such a stupid reason, never came late or short on my register, and got tons of compliments form customers.

        "selftext": "This was a while ago and I have since quit this job. \n\nI used to work at a diner on the weekends. To-go coffees are served in styrofoam cups and only come in one size (12oz). \n\nA trucker came in for breakfast and he asked for a \"big coffee\" to go. Again, they only come in one size. So I sold him a 12-oz coffee and gave him his cup. Usually we leave space in case people want to add cream, but I filled his up all the way. Then my manager pulls me aside in front of him and reprimands me for not giving him a \"big coffee\" like he asked for. All while he's nodding and smiling. \n\nWhen I asked her what she would like me to do because we only have coffee cups in one size, she tells me I should have known that I was supposed to use a styrofoam soft drink cup instead. Those cups are 30oz. In my entire time working there, we have never done that. There is no option in the register to charge someone for a 30oz coffee. But the customer was upset, so she made up a nonexistent rule on the spot and belittled me to make him happy. She threw me under the bus. \n\nYou'd be surprised how many customers ask for \"big,\" \"large,\" \"jumbo,\" \"huge,\" \"enough to fill a 10-gallon\" coffees everyday. It's usually a joke followed by some comment about them being tired. They aren't really asking about coffee cup size. They're just trying to make conversation and use silly words. \n\nSo for the next several months I proceeded to give every single person who made a comment about coffee size a 30oz coffee and charge them for a 12oz. That coffee maker was constantly going. I mean constantly. We were going through bags of coffee like crazy... Almost as if we were selling nearly three times as much without making more profit from it.\n\nEdit: Clarification that the soda cup is also styrofoam. I do not punish the innocent with hot drinks in wax-coated paper cups.",

        "selftext": "So, the day after Christmas about 10 years ago, my brother called me up and asked me for some assistance setting up some of his new computer equipment.  He lived down the road from a store that specialized in discount china, so naturally it was extremely busy.  Busy as in, cars were parked everywhere, including on the grass in front of the store, and it was impossible to see around the corner if someone wanted to pull out of the furthest exit.  Unfortunately, the speed limit, 50 mph, is also extremely high on the road as well, even if you have to really try to accelerate to get to 50 mph by the time you pass the store.  So, I decided to play it safe and was doing roughly half the speed limit, perhaps 30 mph, while going around the corner of this store.    \n\n\nEven at this speed, of course some guy decided to pull out without checking, and I couldn't stop in time to avoid hitting him.  Now, I was driving an older Mitsubishi that already had some damage, and he had a small dent in his fender.  And, come on, it's still Christmas, right?  So, I get out of the car, take a look at the damage, and turn around to see a furious, older, red faced gentleman in front of me.  Right after I tell him that it doesn't really look like much damage, so there's no need to contact the police, he proceeds to scream in my face about how I was speeding and this is all my fault.    \n\n\nOh, oh no honey.  A young woman driving by herself may appear to be easily intimidated, but I was trying to be nice.  If you want the police involved, let's do it buddy.  I call the non-emergency line, explain there was a very minor car accident, and that the other driver was insisting that it was my fault, so I would feel better if the police were involved.  The dispatcher got my information, stopped for a moment, and then quietly thanked me for calling the appropriate number (911 was hardly necessary), and told me that she also felt it would be safer for me if the police were dispatched.    \n\n\nAfter a 30 minute wait, an officer showed up to the scene.  I, not being a total moron, sat quietly in my car and waited for him to come over to me.  The other driver felt it was necessary to leap out of his vehicle and run over to the officer and start screaming and gesturing wildly.  I didn't catch what was said, but I did see the look on the cop's face, and I was getting more and more amused.  After being clearly told to get back into his car, the cop came over to me, and asked me what happened.  I told him what was going on, and that not only had I not deliberately sped up to go the speed limit, I had actually slowed down because of how busy the business was.  He nodded, and went back to measure the skid marks on the road, and confirmed he believed I was actually doing about 25 and complimented my thinking on safe driving in this specific situation.    \n\n\nHe then proceeded to write the other driver a ticket, and the other driver pulled out of the parking lot a second time, with his window down, flipping me off.  At this point, the cop came over to me, explained that he wrote it up as the other driver's fault for more than 1000 dollars due to the damage on his fender.  He also stated that, \"Darlin', I don't say this often, but I believe you should take that man's insurance company for every dime you can get.\"    \n\n\nThanks for insisting we call the police!",

            "Similar story. \n\nOne day, when I was 21, I walked into my credit union and made the final payment on the car I bought when I graduated from HS. I decided I\u2019d go to my Grandma\u2019s and hang out with her, and started the hour drive.\n\nI was on a country highway, going 55, when the car in front of me stopped short, and I had to really *slam* on my brakes. I missed the car in front of me, which promptly drove off, and the car behind me missed me. \n\nI looked up in the rear view mirror and saw a very pained look on the face of the kid driving the car behind me. I was confused for a second - he missed me after all - and suddenly I was jerked forward in my seat. The car behind him had not reacted quickly enough, rear-ended him, and his car rear-ended mine in turn. There was enough of a space of time between him stopping and her hitting him that she could not have been paying attention at all.\n\nSo, here we are, (minor) 3-car wreck. Me and the kid behind me jumped out right away to assess the damage. I just paid off my car and was furious. The kid in the car behind me (he told me he was 17 and just got his license) was shaking and almost crying, talking about how it\u2019s his dad\u2019s car and he\u2019s gonna kill him. \n\nAnd then the third driver gets out, yelling, and demands, \u201cWho was in the gold car?!\u201d I explained that it was me, and she started yelling at me for causing the accident, that she\u2019s making payments on her car and it\u2019s all my fault it\u2019s wrecked (her bumper was in pretty bad shape). She says she\u2019s 19. I tell her this was in no way my fault, that me and the 17-year-old had come safely to a stop before she hit us. She was. Not. Having. It. Insisted we call the police.\n\nThe poor 17-year-old kid is actually crying now. I had told the girl that the rear-ended is always at fault, so he was freaking out that he\u2019s be in trouble since he technically rear-ended me. The girl has this crazy smirk on her face, insistent that this was going on her favor...\n\nNot only did the girl get ticketed and told the entire thing was her fault, but her insurance turned out to be expired by several months and she was arrested. I never someone go from smug to panicking in such a short period of time.",
            "I once rear-ended someone because I didn't think they'd stop at a yield sign when there weren't any cars coming... it was still 100% my fault.  It was really minor (I skidded into them at <5mph) but I hopped out and *immediately* apologized sincerely.  Dude got out, looked at his bumper, saw no damage, said \"don't worry about it\".  And we both went on with our lives.\n\nSince it sounds like you were *going* to do this, I'd like to thank you for being a nice person in that kind of situation.  Since the guy was a jerk, you absolutely did the right thing.",

            "I had something similar happen with my wife. In a parking lot she opened her door and accidentally hit car next to hers. Guy was in the car and got super aggressive demanding payment, etc. She called me freaked out and I headed over to her. He called the cops in the mean time and when I arrived, he wasnt near as tough. Cops arrived and looked at his car and asked where the damage was. He pointed it out and cop walked over and wiped the dirt off in the area. There was a very minor ding (size of a pencil tip) and the cop pointed out that the damage elsewhere was much worse. They wrote up info for report and told my wife if insurance got involved to tell them that wind caught door causing it to swing. Cops gave other driver shit for calling them out on a nothing call and gave my wife their card in case she had issues (he wasn't violent, they just didn't like him). Never heard from insurance and dude wasted an hour of everyone's life over a ding on a 15 year old truck.",

            "One time when backing out of my driveway I checked and no one was behind me so I backed out fully and suddenly ran into a car that wasn\u2019t there before. He had flown through a yield sign at a street that curved into my neighborhood and my house was on the end. I was around 17-18 and this dude was easily in his 50\u2019s and screamed all about how I\u2019d owe him a new car and he\u2019d drain me of all the money I had. All over a small dent and some scratches. The cops were called and since I was backing out of my driveway I had some fault but, since the dude failed to yield and at the same time rear ended me the cop told me about how he got a larger ticket. I remember how annoying it was to fix my car cause my brother is a mechanic so we did it all ourselves. The other dude brought me to court but kept lying about what happened even though there was a police report so I only ended up having to pay my ticket.",

            "Several years ago, I stopped at a green light to let an ambulance (with lights and siren) go.  The lady behind me ran into me.  No damage and no injury, but a police officer saw the whole thing.  She jumped out and was wildly animated as she explained her side.  I couldn't keep a straight face when she told the officer, \"She stopped at a green light, and I was trying to beat the ambulance.\"  Thanks, Lady! I appreciate you telling the police it was your fault.  Sadly, he did not ticket her, but the look on his face was still priceless.",

            "Reminds me of an incident I was indirectly involved in about 15 years ago. I was coming out of the local mall one evening and traffic was heavy. Suddenly the car in from of me came to an abrupt halt and I heard a crashing sound. Luckily, I had kept a decent following distance and was able to stop in time. Then, like all the cars behind me, I pulled around the scene and proceeded towards the exit. I was a few cars from the intersection when I saw a guy running towards my car. I rolled down the window to see what he wanted and imagine my shock when he said that the car that hit him was accusing me of hitting her! I denied it but he said I had better stick around because the cops were on their way. I got out, looked at the front of my car and confirmed there was no damage and walked up to the woman (probably around 18 or 19) who was accusing me. I said \"ma'am I didn't hit you.\" She said \"yes you did I had my foot on the brake.\" I checked my car again (still no damage) and checked the back of her car (also no damage) and said to her again \"ma'am there's no damage to your back or my front.\" Her replay this time was \"well I had my foot on the brake and my car in neutral so there's no way I could have done this myself\" (unlikely given that we were in an active traffic lane leaving a busy shopping center).\n\nAnyway, the cops never came so the two other drivers exchanged information, but no one asked me for mine and I didn't volunteer it. However one of them must have written down my plate number because the next week, my dad called me (the car was still registered at their house because I had just moved) and asked if I had been in an accident because there was an insurance adjuster on the other line looking for me. I told him the story and had him give the insurance guy my number so I could talk to him. I relayed the story to the insurance guy and he arranged to come over a couple of days later to look at my car. \n\nWhen the guy came out and took one look at my car, he laughed and said \"there's no damage here!\" I said, \"I know, that's what I was trying to tell your client\" and told him her cockamamie excuses. The guy just shook his head, took some pictures of my car as proof, and that was the last I had heard of it.",

            "Reminds me of some 20 years ago...\n\nThere's a little hill outside my apartment building, angling down towards the main road. It's in NH, 20 years ago, middle of winter, so the roads are a frozen lake. I'm sitting in my car, waiting to turn left into oncoming traffic, and watching tourists go spinning past.  From behind me, I hear a high pitched, \"Oh shIIIIIIIIIIT!\"  There's a soft *thud,* and my car shudders a bit.  '82 Honda Civic, car's 20 years old at this point.

We both look at what is a minor dent to my fender, I'm not even sure it wasn't already there.  No visible damage to her car.  It's too fucking cold.  \n\n\"I'm good, you?\"\n\n\"Yup.\"\n\nnever saw her again.  No need.",
            "Had a similar experience a few years ago. I was completely stopped at the upward side of a hill because there was a train going by on the other side of the hill. I could have pulled forward because the car in front of me did a U-turn and left, but I wanted to be visible to cars coming behind. \n\nI watched this woman for over a mile and when I realized she was not slowing at all stood on my brakes, which is the only reason I didn't rear end the car stopped two car lengths in front of me. This woman never touched her brakes and actually bounced back after hitting me. Which is when I noticed she was on her cell phone. I got out of my car briefly to ask how she was. The woman thumbed her nose at me, but a nice gentleman who got out of the car that was behind her asked me how I was while reporting she was ok.\n\nHer husband showed up a short while later along with police whom he had evidently summoned. I waited my tun while her husband escorted her up to see police first in a very haughty manor. \n\nThe cop talked to me just long enough to tell me it was clearly her fault after and said she'd be ticketed while she was getting checked in the ambulance. I went to get checked after and the two of them haughtily put their noses in the air as they passed me like I'd done something to them somehow?",
            "Had a woman insist on calling the police after she deliberately hit my car because she didn't want me to pull into the space in front of her. All it did was push my bumper off a bit and it could be popped back into place. No damage to her car. Refused to talk to me. \n\nPolice take over an hour to arrive and she goes out to tell them that I hit her and I needed to be punished and I was a bitch etc. Cop comes over to me and I simply go, \"Here's my dashcam. She hit me.\" The cop takes a look and sure enough, it shows that she hit me. \n\nShe was extremely pissed off and said \"well maybe next time I'll have a dashcam and then I'll be right.\" \"You do that, ma'am.\" After she left, he thanked me for remaining calm and not engaging with the crazy.",

            "I was about 17 when I got into my first accident.  I had to make a left to get into work so I slowed way down from the 25 mph speed limit and was in the middle of my turn (meaning I was in the middle of the lane for oncoming traffic) when some old bat hit my driver's side wheel well with her passenger side bumper.\n\nA cop got there a couple of minutes later as the station was literally next door and took our statements.  The lady swore that she was pulling out of a driveway and I had turned in front of her which I still try to my head around the logistics of that 20+ years later and I didn't use my signal.  I honestly don't remember if I used my signal or not.  It was all a blur as this was my first accident, but in any case, I had slowed down to an almost stop to make my turn because there was a short steep hill down into the parking lot I was turning into that if you didn't take at the right speed, your undercarriage would sorely regret it.\n\nThe cop put me in the backseat of his car with this lady as he wrote out the ticket.  The lady was ranting about how her sister had neck problems (ambulance had already come and gone, checked her out, she was fine), about how SHE was the wronged one, how it was my fault, etc.  The cop was very calm and cool headed.  I kept very quiet, partially stunned, partially terrified I was going to get a ticket too.  She finally asked who he was writing the ticket out for.  He said, \"You, ma'am.\"\n\nOh boy.  More shrieks and screams.  \"How much is that stupid ticket going to cost me?!\" she finally asked after her tirade ended.\n\n\"Ma'am, how long have you been working at the Clerk's office?\"\n\n\"40 years!\"\n\n\"Then you know how much this ticket is going to cost you.\"\n\nWhen she finally yanked the ticket from his hand and left, the cop turned to me and said, \"I've been on this job for 20 years and that is the worst woman I've ever met.\"  Which makes me wonder what fresh hell he'd been given before he'd put us in the backseat of his squad car.",

The accident did damage my bumper,  nothing at all on hers.  \nAdmitting I was as fault,  I gave her the choice,  go on with our day or call the cops.  She insisted we call the cops.

My friend ran back into the department store to go to the bathroom and she said she was fleeing the scene. The cop came, took a look at the damage and the cars, the scrape marks were on her rear bumper and my drivers side door.

No real damage. Scratches, paint knocked off, but nothing bad. The other guy, a senior in high school that I didn\u2019t know but figured was a senior considering he was driving, just said \u201cnah, as long as it doesn\u2019t make me late, it\u2019s okay,\u201d\n\nFast forward.. maybe 2 years. I\u2019m training to be a wrestler and I got this guy I met online but near me (a town over) into it and we started riding together and everything. One day we got on the topic of wrecks and he said he never had one except maybe once in high school. Long story short, it was the same kid my dad rear ended. Just thought it was crazy at the time.",

Video is also great!\n* If the other driver approaches you never ask if they are ok or apologize. Just inform them you have called the police and they'll be arriving shortly.\n* Get back in your car and locate your drivers license and insurance information and move your car to a safe location\n* Wait for the police.",
