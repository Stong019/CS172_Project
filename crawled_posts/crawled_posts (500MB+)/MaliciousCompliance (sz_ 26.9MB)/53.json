        "selftext": "Let's set the scene.\nSo this was a few years back. I have quite a few tattoos (basically all my chest, my upper back, top half sleeves and one on the inside of each forearm (about 15cm across)<<these last 2 are what started it all.\n\nI worked for a cinema chain for a LONG time. Always had tattoos. I landed myself a management role.(more like a supervisor). The standard uniform was black shirt and black trousers. I prefer a short sleeved shirt due to being a bigger guy and cinemas being bloody hot.\n\nMy site manager quite liked my tattoos and other querks that I had. My area manager however did not. She would come in to the site, walk passed 8 other staff with full sleeve tattoos and make a b line straight to me. Stating that my tattoos need covering up and I quote \"they're not offensive just alot of people don't like them\". Now my tattoos aren't offensive they're just patterns.\n\nShe informed me that I had to wear long sleeves to cover them up otherwise I would face disciplinary action. I had read the employee handbook a few times because of other petty crap so I know it was the managers decision (my site manager) but she decided to over rule it. What she forgot was just because the normal retail staff HAD to wear black. Management were allowed to wear white. Just Nobody did cos it was hard to keep clean.\n\nSo what should I do? I know let's go and buy the thinnest cheapest most see through white long sleeve shirt I can find.\n\nNow if you could only see her face when she came in next when I'm basically wearing a shirt more see through than tracing paper. (I'm talking you can see the colour shift from my individual chest hairs) and ALL my tattoos are on show for everyone to see while stood behind the tills talking to customers.\n\nNeedless to say I got to wear my short sleeved black shirt again after that.\n\nEdit: finished a sentence.\nEdit2: spelling\n\nThanks for the silver stranger.",

I don't understand why people make a big deal about tattoos,  if they are not offensive or obscene why do they care.

        "selftext": " This is my dad's story, but he's not into Reddit.\n\nMy dad is a hard worker. This happened about 15 years ago. Worked for a company that fixed and rented heavy equipment (backhoes, scissor lifts, steamrollers, forklifts, etc.) His boss (the CEO of the company, whom he reported to directly) was a middle aged Italian guy whose grasp of English was tenuous at best. He understood what people were saying, but had trouble communicating his own intentions back clearly. On the other hand, my dad had zero grasp of Italian but spoke perfect English. However, he was a solid mechanic who would go on to make the machine bay of this company something approaching a Sherman production line a la 1943. Shit. Got. Done. And, even though he didn't always understand what the boss wanted him to do, he just focused on the reason he was hired: manage the repair bay, hire new mechanics, train new hires and off-site 'on-call' repairs.\n\nWell, boss guy gets it in his head that my dad is going to 'replace' him as the leader of the company (because he's much better liked, speaks perfect English in an English speaking country and has basically all the department heads coming to him for help, even though he's technically only in charge of the repair bay.) And so, he calls my dad in, chews him out (we think, it was mostly Italian so my dad wasn't picking up on it, but the tone indicated as much) and manages to communicate that he's being fired for 'poor work performance.'\n\nAnd my dad just smiles, shakes the guy's hand and leaves. And, thanks to his less than firm grasp on both the English language and business law, the boss guy just sent him on his way with his last paycheck and nothing else. So my dad started his own business. In the heavy equipment mechanic market. And, after telling all his old work buddies about the situation, suddenly got a bunch of new hires. And his old workplace suddenly had a lot of vacancies that the Boss had no idea how to fill (because the guy he'd hired to do that had just been fired.) He went under about 6 months later.\n\nSometimes, my dad drives past where the old shop was (on his way to a call.) When he does, he just laughs and laughs.\n\nTLDR: A paranoid boss fired my dad because he was afraid my dad was muscling him out. My dad left and went on to create a successful rival business as a heavy mechanic repairman (and heavy equipment instructor.) His old job was shut down 6 months later.\n\nEdit: For everyone who's been saying 'this isn't malicious compliance,' here's why I think it is:\nWhen my dad was brought into the office, he knew right away that he was getting fired and he knew right away what the hell he was being fired for. Of course, the boss didn't say that the reason he was firing my dad was because he was feeling threatened by my dad's popularity and work ethic. Instead he just blustered through my dad's 'poor work performance' and fed him a line of bullshit about how 'he'd put up with it for a long time but enough was enough.'\n\nAnd my dad thought about taking him to court. But then, as he tells it, a bolt of lightning came down from on high and he just reached out and shook his boss' hand. He knew that if he took the asshole to court, he might get money out of him (almost certainly would have) but his boss would have had time to think about things and try to force a non compete contract down his throat. By just resigning immediately, he knew his ex-boss would never even think of it until it was too late. And he double-timed it putting in paperwork to get his new company off the ground before ex-boss COULD think of it.\n\nSo maybe I didn't explain details and motivations clearly enough but, based on how my dad told the story, I think it definitely fits into Malicious Compliance.",

They applied for an exemption and were denied. \n\nEach of the guys was making, maybe, $50k-$70k in their government jobs, and decided to roll the dice. They left their jobs and founded their firm. \n\nOn the second day that they were gone, the State realized that no one else knew how to do what these guys did, and so wanted to hire them back. They had already lined up a few contracts with local companies, and so knew they\u2019d be very busy. \n\nThey (partly joking, partly in spite) threw out a multi-year contract at $9 million per year ($3 million each). It took about a week, but the State agreed. \n\nThat was the revenue that allowed them to staff up into a multi-billion dollar IT company, and they\u2019re still going strong. \n\nI was told the story in a hangar full of their corporate jets, so am included to believe at least the gist of it.",

I'm telling you no lies when I say I never saw this woman stumped by any issue. She always knew what to do to help customers and keep everyone happy.

As I\u2019ve gotten older, the rides have gotten a little tougher on me. In addition, my daughter tends to get motion sick rather easily. I don\u2019t like the way motion sickness pills make me feel. So, I always take a ziplock baggie full of ginger candy along to prevent and soothe nausea. \n\nToday, I had chewy mango ginger candies, hard plain ginger candies, and hard lemon ginger candies. For those who\u2019ve never had ginger candy, it is SPICY. The lemon ginger is probably the mildest. The plain ginger is just plain hot. The mango ginger are sweet and spicy but they also stick to your teeth like crazy. They\u2019re definitely an acquired taste. \n\nAs we are standing in line for the log ride, I pull out my baggie. I choose a lemon one as does my son (13). My daughter (12) asks for a mango one. While I\u2019m fishing a mango one out, I hear the kid in front of us tell his mom that he (around 7ish) wants some candy. His mom distractedly says she doesn\u2019t have any candy. The boy says, \u201cBut she does.\u201d\n\nHe turns to me and asks for one. I tell him I don\u2019t really think he\u2019d like my candy. By this time, his mom has focused in on the interaction. As the kids starts to whine that, of course, he\u2019d like my candy, his mom just huffs and says, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a whole baggie. Can\u2019t you give him just one. Com\u2019n, don\u2019t be greedy.\u201d (Oh, you said the magic word there lady.)\n\nI say, \u201cAlright,\u201d and dig out a lemon one. (I\u2019m not completely heartless.) That\u2019s when the kid whines that he wants mango, mango is his favorite. I tell him lemon is better but he insists on mango. I tell him it\u2019s kinda sticky as I hang it over. \n\nThe kid rips it open, shoves it in his mouth, gets in three quick chews while my kids stare at him. Then, he actually starts to taste it and a look of horror comes over his face. He screams and tries to spit it out. He\u2019s jumping around and flapping his arms. His mom is panicking and asking what\u2019s wrong. He\u2019s screaming that it\u2019s bad and it\u2019s hot and he wants it out. His mom tells him to spit it out. \n\nThat\u2019s when I pipe up with the very helpful, \u201cIt\u2019s really sticky. What\u2019s left is probably stuck in his teeth. He\u2019ll have to wait for it to melt off if he doesn\u2019t want to chew.\u201d  The mom looks at me in disbelief and a shrug. Then she asks what in the hell I gave her son. (Probably should have asked that sooner, lady.) I answer, \u201cGinger candy. It\u2019s good for nausea.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d be dead if looks really could kill. We got to move up in line two spaces though because she whisked her kid off to a water fountain. I\u2019d like to think the kid will think twice about demanding things from strangers.

You're the smallest of us all so it shouldn't be a problem for you.\"\n\nNow not only had Dad not been trained for loading the compactor but even he knew crawling in there would be a dumb idea. \"Uh, George, I haven't been trained for this position.\"\n\nGeorge got all flustered and told him \"Just do it.\"\n\nDad then got an idea for some Malicious Compliance \"I'll do it but is it okay if I ask one of the other guys to spot me and make sure I don't get squashed?\"\n\nGeorge said \"That'll be fine, just make sure the job is done.\"\n\nDad then headed to his union shop leader Kenny (made up name). Like George, Kenny was a decent fellow but was very protective of his workers. Dad told Kenny what had happened and asked him to spot him.\n\nCue Kenny \"turning at least five shades of purple\" before storming to George's office. Dad told me the whole floor went silent as Kenny unloaded on George for trying to make \"a poor college kid do something so fucking dangerous\" and that \"this will be recorded and written up.\" Kenny stormed out, leaving a frightened looking George quaking in his steel toed boots.\n\nThe compactor ended up getting fixed without someone crawling into it and George always asked if people were trained for positions before asking them to do it.",

His training consisted of \"Take the stuff in this bin and throw it in the hopper.  Don't bother me with stupid questions!\" So he does and a few hours later the hopper gets jammed and shuts off.  Not knowing what to do he reached into the hopper and pulled out the phone book that was stuck.  The jammed cleared, the machine starts back up and sucks the phone book into the shredder along with three of the poor Private's fingers.  \n\nI can just see some poor college kid climbing into a trash compactor and getting squished when the jam was cleared.

            "Where I used to work, they had a policy that all tattoos had to be covered. Despite the fact that the business very much attracted an \"alternative\" employee base, the business caters to older and wealthier clientele, so they decided it was best to make all employees cover up their tattoos and take out all piercings while they were on the clock. If your uniform didn't cover your tattoo you were expected to either put makeup over it that blended in (vaguely) well enough to pass as skin, or to wear something like a bandage/extra piece of clothing specifically to cover that tattoo.\n\nWe had multiple female staff who were in uniforms that didn't cover their shoulders, but had tattoos on their upper arms/upper backs. There was at least one member of the staff who regularly wore a full size (at least 2\" x 4\") bandage while at work because she didn't want to wear the full-sleeve shirt option for her uniform, and management told her she had to wear something to cover the tattoo... it wasn't even an offensive tattoo, or something that people might object to. It was genuinely decent-to-good artwork, and it looked infinitely worse to have a massive bandage slapped over it.\n\nMeanwhile one of my direct supervisors had some ink on the back of their hand, and management told him he was expected to wear a massive bandage to cover the back of his hand every time he came to work. Fortunately, he was one of the most charismatic and endearing members of our staff - after multiple conversations with our customers, enough of them put in complaints to the business/upper-level management about how bad it looked for him to always be wearing a massive bandage on his hand that they eventually relented and told him he was allowed to come to work without it.\n\nYet, to my knowledge (haven't worked there in a while), they still require everyone *else* to cover their ink to clock in. They'd rather carve out a deliberate exception to the rules based on customer complaints than acknowledge they're out of touch idiots.",

            "I worked in a care home a few years ago that was part of a group of care homes owned by someome... The manager of the care home was awesome, not just because she actually cares about the residents but because she cares about the staff too (I use the present tense because I'm pretty sure she's still working there as the manager)\n\nAnyway, we had all types of residents not just ones with dementia... And there was the old boy in there who had an option about EVERYTHING! One day he got on to the subject of Tattoos and how the look horrible on women and how they're not ladylike and he always notices them no matter how small or hidden they are (weird, because most Tattoos are covered with clothes and at this care home the care staff wear tunics that cover your backside \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f) basically getting at one of the other carers... I said that I personally love Tattoos on women... And he says \"But you don't have any Taylou33...\" Bare in mind at that time I had two on my wrists, (one on each) one is a purple and green daisy chain bracelet tattoo, and one is a black Japanese symbol with blue outline on my inner wrist, (supposedly it means strength... This was at a time when everyone was getting Chinese symbol Tattoos and I decided to be different and \"edgy\" by getting a Japanese tattoo... Yeah, 19 y/o me was a total dick... But, if it means what it's 'supposed' to mean then its pretty cool as its highly symbolic to me, excuse the pun), I tell him that I've actually got a seven tattoos and two of them can't be hidden very well here because they're on my wrists (care homes get SO HOT and you really don't want to be wearing long sleeves under a thin tunic!). Tnis old boy then tries to tell me that I don't have tattoos else he'd have seen them... So I walk up close to him and hold my arms out and show him my wrists... All he could say is \"oh\"...\n\nHe never picked on or got at any member of staff about tattoos after that... I wasn't horrible to him (as much as I wanted to scream at him, but that tends to get frowned upon by management)... He was also they type of man that if you didn't answer his call bell, or A call bell right away, no matter how busy the carers are he'd have a pop... The care home I worked at has two different call bells one means a resident wants assistance, the other means drop everything making sure no residents are in danger and get here now... One night one of the other residents had a fall and he pressed the normal call bell so we took our time (3 of us on a night shift about an hour after shift change, so the senior was doing the meds rounds and me and the other carer were helping people get ready for bed). I'm available after 5 mins so look where the call bell is coming from, go down to see who wants what, see the other resident has had a fall and hit the emergency bell... As we're assessing the fallen resident the old boy who doesn't like tattoos on women kept saying \"I pressed that bell and it took you lot 20 minutes to come\" I looked him dead in the face, in front of my senior and said \"No, I came after 5 minutes, we can't just drop everything if its not an emergency... Don't start!\" he fell silent on the spot... I spoke to my senior later on when we had five minutes and asked if I was in the wrong for what I said to him and she said no not at all, and you did me a favour because ei was about to say the same thing to him!\n(just gave that 2nd story so you can get an idea of this bloke)",

Child was Under 15, and Adult was anything 15 and above.\n\nThis guy comes in with his mates, back of the queue to get in, but can be heard throughout the foyer being all loud and obnoxious, and the generalisation I've found in my experience in the cinema is that if they're teens on their own and they're loud and obnoxious in the foyer, there's a high chance they'll be the same during the film and generally be a nightmare in the screen. I start to notice some other people in the queue looking over at him and rolling their eyes.\n\nI get the pleasure of serving this guy.

And see that they have bought CHILD tickets from the self serve kiosk.\n\nI tell them I'm so sorry, I know those machines can be confusing, but you'll have to go up to the help desk and return your tickets. They can exchange them for adult tickets for you. (I was just being professional, we all knew they did it on purpose)\n\nI knew something was up when they returned the tickets, but instead of getting replacements from the desk, they went back to the kiosk.\n\nThey return to me with two SENIOR tickets. Now I'm pissed. I give them the same spiel, and dude is pretty upset at this point. They finally get their correct tickets.\n\nHere's where I had fun: since it was an R rated movie, we had someone stationed at the auditorium door checking tickets to make sure kids didn't sneak in. I radioed him, and told him to check this couple's IDs, even though they were obviously old enough. I also asked the concession stand to card him if he used a credit card (something we could do if we suspected the card was stolen)\n\nA minor inconvenience, but it was pretty satisfying watching him have to keep clawing his wallet apart in ever increasing frustration.",
            "I once remember overhearing a kid moaning about not being let into a 15, saying 'I've got size 9 feet, of course I'm 15'. I think the ticket guy had to hold back from laughing.",
            "I have a reverse story.  When I was in high-school, the gloriously tacky [Starship Troopers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120201/) came out.  It was rated R, meaning you had to be 18 or older to see it.  Of course, I and all my friends wanted to see it.\n\nSo we buy tickets for a different movie, and head into the Starship Troopers theatre.  The theatre is maybe 1/3 full (small theatre, smallish town). We're sitting there all smug in our epic teenage awesomeness at beating The Man(tm).\n\nThen a theatre employee comes in, and says loudly \"So... we have 2 tickets sold for this movie.  The rest of you go see the non-R-rated movies you paid for.\"   Cue dozens of teenagers sullenly leaving the theater while the 2 people with tickets were laughing their ass off.   My friends and I did go see the movie we paid for;   [it wasn't great.](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118689/)\n\nedit:  JFC people.  I know that Reddit is mostly US users, but the entire world doesn't follow US laws.   Where I am, movie classifications are controlled by law.  Under-18s cannot see R-rated movies, even with adult accompaniment, period.",

            "This happened to me and my friends once but by accident. Our school years are September to August, and the last person in our friend group had finally turned 15, in August. We rocked up to the cinema (not obnoxiously I might add) and she asked for a ticket and then said she was 14 by accident.\n\nThey wouldn't serve us after that. It was her actual birthday that day.",
            "Jokingly did this once with a couple of mates at the local cinema when we were 16. Woman at the box said no problem, but then pointed out the age rating. We confessed our ages but she said she couldn't let us in as for all she knew we were lying again. Eventually she settled on flipping a coin, we won, paid the extra and got in. Would never have worked though if it had been busy or if we were dicks about it.",

            "I had the reverse of this once. I asked for an adult ticket to see Deep Blue Sea. The guy asked how old I am and I insist I'm 15 to get in, after a back and fourth he eventually says it's cheaper if I'm a child and points out the film was a 12. Good guy.",

            "I took my cousin to see Spawn when it came out which was before the 12a rating was introduced and it was just 12 and above. He was 14 at the time and the ticket guy asked without any idea how absurd he sounded if he had any ID.\n\nLike what ID is a 14 year old meant to be carrying around other than possibly a passport which not even everyone has. After much arguing back and forth he eventually just gave up. Best part after the movie I realised he'd only charged us for one ticket.",
            "Went to see an R rated movie with my buddy one time.  Being a smart ass, I asked the kid for \u201c1 child for \u201cR rated movie\u201d\u201d.  Which I received.  The ticket checker took my ticket, and waved me in.  Said buddy was pissed. Lmao",
            "Two guys came through my line at work where we have children's and adult pricing for entry into paid exhibits for my museum. Two very grown men told me they needed a child's ticket for the one of the adult man with tattoos and cigarettes and I was like \"whatever, here.\" Then the other guy was like \"wait, lemme get two\" and I told them minors couldn't be unaccompanied and processed the adult and child's ticket for these 2 very grown men. It was funny.",
            "One time I was with my boyfriend, him 22 at the time and me 20, going to see an R-rated film. In the US you can be 16 I think (it might be younger) accompanied with anyone over 18 and see an R-rated film. Which honestly shouldn\u2019t matter in that case because I\u2019m clearly over 18 let alone 16, wearing a full face of make up and heels I\u2019ve been told I look 25, which I was wearing that evening. The woman at the box office refused to sell him two tickets because I didn\u2019t have my ID on me, but she never asked for his ID? So we just walked over to the self-serve kiosk and purchased the tickets, all while she is glaring at us knowing her attempt at ruining our evening was squashed. I still get heated thinking about that unnecessary bullshit.",

But the lady at the desk was doing her job correctly and didn't let us in, even though I thought they could go with an adult, which I was 19 yo. After being turned away we decided to go back and buy tickets for hotel Transylvania, and then we went into the theater showing Halloween.\n\nIllegal, idk,  but we had a good time",

            "This reminds me of when i worked in a cinema a few years ago.  \nAdding to the age restrictions, we had a group of loud, foul mouthed kids, about 11, wanting to come in and watch a 12A (where you can either be 12 or older, or under 12 and accompanied by an adult)  \nAnyway these kids come in and ask for tickets to watch Guardians of the Galaxy 2\n\n  \nI asked them for their ages or any form of identification that they have to prove their ages.  one was 12 and had  his Passport with him so i sold him his ticket the others said that they were 11 but nearly 12. Unfortunately, nearly 12 isnt 12 so i told them i couldn't sell them the tickets (Cinemas can get hefty fines for it).  \n\n\nThey start yelling and saying that they will call their mum who will  buy them the tickets and come back later.(Oh the Joy)  \nAbout 20 mins go by and the kids mother shows up, starts yelling at how its just a 12A and they have her full permission to watch the movie.  I ask her if she will be watching the movie with them and she mentions that she has other things she needs to do so she wont be watching it. Again i tell her that is she is not going to be watching the movie with the two kids under the required age they cannot watch the movie.   \n\n\nShe asks for the manager and he tells her the exact same story and she and the kids leave.   \n\n\nThe kid who was able to watch it ended up getting a refund and brought a tango ice blast instead...",

            "I was a 6'3\" sixth grader.   I used to carry my birth certificate in my wallet so I could get into the movies for the cheaper ticket.   Of course it stayed in my wallet for an R rated flick.",
            "(US, rated R means you have to be 17 years old to see the film.)\n\nA different take, take from this what you will:\n\nI\u2019ve recently turned 18 years old. I have an early birthday, so I\u2019m going to enter my senior year of high school.\nMy family is well below the poverty line, my mother is disabled and can\u2019t work and I have a 13 year old sister. My father is not in the picture. We have one car, and I haven\u2019t gotten my drivers license due to drivers Ed being ~$350, not to mention more than likely needing to purchase another car to drive in the first place. I have two jobs, one on weekdays and one on weekends.\n\nI find time to go see Rocketman, the Elton John adaptation. You know, the one that\u2019s only rated R because of one homosexual sex scene? The musical? yeah. that.\nI get carded, and she asks to see my drivers license. I inform her I don\u2019t have one and she asks for a passport. I tell her I don\u2019t have one of those, either \u2014 i\u2019ve never even left the country.\n\nShe tells me without any hint as to how old I am, she can\u2019t let me in to see the film. I ask if my student ID will do, she declines. I say I have my SScard, she says that won\u2019t do either. I\u2019m angry at this point, as I\u2019m old enough to vote \u2014 and a voice pops up from behind me. My manager at one of my jobs is there, and vouches to give the woman her card and she\u2019ll provide verification from my job how old I am.\n\nDespite my manager trying to be my knight in shining armor, the ticket saleswoman won\u2019t budge. I ask what else I could possibly provide her and she has no idea. I\u2019m extremely upset and storm home, saving money on overpriced popcorn and pirating the damn thing at home regardless.\n\nMy take is while yes, obviously underage kids by 4-5 years should not be allowed in, they\u2019re ridiculously strict on the carding of people on these films. The rating system is bigoted and corrupt regardless and these theater companies (keep in mind i\u2019m blaming the companies, not the workers themselves \u2014 I work two minimum wage jobs, I understand policy is policy) have their heads trapped in the sky about \u201coh? a gay sex scene? R. A straight one? PG-13.\u201d \u201cOk, they said \u201cFuck\u201d, but how many TIMES did they say it?\u201d \n\nThey seriously need to walk around outside, they aren\u2019t protecting the innoncence of anyone.",
            "Strict movie laws yikes",
            "My only gripe with your story is slamming this new crop of horror films as crappy and low budget. If anything I feel like the last decade has been a resurgence for decent horror films. Granted not all of them are gold, and while I've liked most in the Conjuring Universe (didn't care for the Nun and the most recent Annabelle was probably the best of the 3) there are exceptions, but we haven't had this many consistent decent horror films in a couple decades IMO. The 90s and 00s had films that catered to just pure jump scares with shifts in volume and very little of the good deep psychological terror. Or just weak Americanized knock offs of Japanese horror series like Ju-On or the Ring.\n\nHorror movies as a genre seem to be consistently better than most genres in theatres right now. Comedies are struggling and underperforming (feels like Hollywood forgot how to be funny for some reason) and Marvel still makes bank but other than Endgame, I don't feel like a lot of the movies have really been that high quality wise since Black Panther. One man's opinion of course, but of the movies I've seen, the only genre that has not disappointed lately is horror, and I'm looking forward to the 2nd part of IT coming out as well. Probably the only highly anticipated movie I can think of right now.",

Myself, being a tweenage boy and not having the good sense to be somewhere else, was drafted to help him one hot July Saturday afternoon.\n\nWe brought the new fence posts to the corner of the lot, along with a shovel and a post hole digger, and set about the task.  It was a long slow process, as the clay-heavy soil was fairly dry and hard-baked, and as such each hole was taking the better part of 20 minutes to dig.  This definitely wasn't on the list of things I wanted to spend my afternoon doing, but such is life.\n\nRight about the time we started on the final hole Mom yelled to Dad from the house, announcing that he had a phone call.  As these were the days before mobile phones, Dad headed off to the house and instructed me to \"Keep digging until I get back\".\n\nLucky for me this hole went a bit different than the first four.  About the moment he got to the door of the house I busted through the clay layer into much sandier soil where I could get a couple inches of soil in one scoop rather than perhaps a quarter inch per scoop.  Easy peasy!\n\nNow, I was a good kid.  I didn't cause trouble of any significant variety, I got good grades, and I helped out around the house when I got caught unawares.  But seizing an opportunity for malicious compliance was definitely among my personal strengths.\n\nSo I kept digging.  And digging.  Post-holer in, squeeze, post-holer out, dump, repeat.  Dad wasn't on that phone call very long, but I made good time and by the time I saw him at the door coming back, I was quite literally putting the post-holer all the way into the ground to the point where the tips of the handles were just below the surface of the ground, and I couldn't really dig because I couldn't open up the handles to squeeze the digging end any longer.  So, if I had to guess, I'd say that hole was about five feet deep.\n\nDad: \"How's it going?\"  \nMe: \"I think it's deep enough now.\"  \nDad: \"Let's put the post in and check.\"  \nMe: (Huge grin while he stoops over to pick up the post).\n\nDad proceeds to drop the post in the hole.  ***All*** the way in the hole.  See, these posts were maybe hip height when installed, probably about five feet long themselves.\n\nSo there's Dad, momentarily struck speechless, amazement washing across his face.  He looks at me.\n\nMe: \"You told me to keep digging until you got back.\" (shrugs)  \nDad: \"You little shit!\" (laughs)\n\nDad had to grab the post with his fingertips and pull it back out of hole, and it wasn't but a few seconds of work to refill the hole to the proper depth.  And to this day he loves telling the story of his maliciously compliant son.",

To see the photos click the link below. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rqq213/boss_fired_me_for_being_pregnant_and_then_didnt/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\n\nThis last year during Covid had been a tough year for my family. My husband went from six figures supporting our family on his salary alone while we pocketed my entire salary to losing his job for 8 months.\n\nI work in political campaigning which means I work on short-term contracts as an independent contractor. In other words if we lose an election I move onto the next race. I made a pretty good name for myself working on the lower levels of a campaign and moving up quickly. In my state this year there were statewide elections and I caught a lucky break and ended up the Campaign Manager on a statewide race. I am the youngest CM  (24F) to run a statewide race in about the last 20 years. When the primary came up we lost the election by 200 votes. While we lost the campaign, coming so close to winning and my age made me kind of a superstar in my field. After we lost I had offers from all over the state for jobs. The problem is I had just bought a house and wasn\u2019t looking to relocate (like you often have to do in politics) or the positions weren\u2019t high enough coming off being the top dog as the higher positions were already filled.\n\nI got an offer to join a local campaign (so no relocation) but the salary was lower than what I was used to, I would however, be the CM again. \n\nHowever, I learned quickly my boss had a \u201cholier than thou\u201d personality. She made several comments about how \u201creal\u201d women breast feed and have natural births. I would later be able to do neither and it really screwed with my emotional well being. I don\u2019t have time to list all the red flags but I was literally just waiting until my husband got a job to exit.\n\nThe campaign hadn\u2019t been built out at all. There was no one other than the candidate. I ended up building out our entire team, consultant, fundraiser, staff, ect. Luckily I have made a lot of powerful connections in my time. I signed my contract and sent it in with the salary we had agreed on with the stipulation that if we raised enough money 3 months down the line my salary would be raised but could not be lowered at any point.  Just a few weeks prior I had also found out that I was pregnant and my due date was the week of the election and just a week after joining the campaign I was also in a serious car accident. Luckily my pregnancy was safe but I herniated a disc in the car accident and due to my pregnancy there were very few things that could be done as far as helping my back or pain management. If I did my job right that shouldn\u2019t be an issue because my job can essentially be handled from home and staff could do the rest.\n\nI had The team working in lock step and I was proud of the work I was doing even though only about 10% of my views aligned with the campaign. Then we hit a snag. The candidate\u2019s husband got deployed to a rather dangerous place for a month and she completely checked out. She stopped fundraising, which means that everything comes to a halt in campaigning. She stopped putting in the leg work to win. We also lost our only lower staff member during this time. We knew she was worried about her husband so no one on the team tried to push back very hard. Eventually her husband came back and it was go time. There wasn\u2019t a minute to waste and I was back to getting our operation working full speed.\n\nOne day she calls me up to tell me how 20 years ago her first job as a private school teacher was making as much money as I was now. I also live in an expensive DC suburb, not the backwoods where she grew up. I have multiple college degrees and this job offers no benefits unlike teaching. Not comparable at all. This is when I realized there might be a problem.\n\nA couple weeks later, I told her I would need to take a step back from doing the other staff members job (mostly door knocking) because of my injured back but that we would hire someone. Unfortunately, due to the lack fundraising it made it hard to pay anyone else and those duties fell on her. CM\u2019s do not typically door knock. We had a team meeting with the entire team and I started pressuring the candidate about all the things she wasn\u2019t doing and there was a legitimate meltdown. She started yelling at me about how I wasn\u2019t doing my job and her my pregnancy wasn\u2019t her problem and how I was the reason everything was failing and then hung up on the entire team.\n\nThis is where the malicious compliance comes in. After this I decided to take a step back from doing all the duties that are typically handled by lower level staff and just focused on doing my job duties which weren\u2019t being appreciated. I pretty much went radio silent and she kept nitpicking at everything. Everyone on the campaign started to grow uneasy but I told them to just hold out.\n\nWell sure enough she calls me up and says, \u201cSince you are pregnant and can no longer door knock you can either work for (state minimum wage) or you can find a new job.\u201d Mind you, she knew my husband had been out of work for 8 months and thought I had no options at this point but what she didn\u2019t know is that my husband had gotten a job offer that exact day. So I stopped her right there and thanked her for the opportunity and told her I would be working my contractually obligated 30 day notice at my current salary and then leaving the campaign. She then began to scream at me about how she wasn\u2019t paying me a dime more and started listing off a list of issues she had with the way I was doing my job. I stopped her. Thanked her once again and told her all of my finishing tasks would be completed when I received payment for the last month I worked (Yes, she was a month behind on paying me) as well as payment for the 30 day notice that she was legally required to pay me whether I continued working or not.\n\nI waited a few hours and she never finalized my termination in writing so I sent her a termination letter thanking her for the opportunity and once again repeating everything we had discussed on the phone. She sent me a nasty email again reiterating that I wouldn\u2019t be paid for the previous month or 30 days and listed about 10 things that I had done to be terminated, including that I didn\u2019t wear make-up to work every day.\n\nI decided to send this email to the rest of the team and sure enough everyone quit except for the consultant. In 5 minutes she lost everyone she had. Then a friend of mine offered me my dream job working for him so all in all it worked out in my favor within 5 minutes of being fired.\n\nWell, here where things get tricky. I realize that my contract that obligates her to pay me for the 30 days\u2019 notice isn\u2019t signed and I\u2019m screwed. Well sure enough in her fit of rage she starts emailing everyone talking badly about me the only problem is I still have access to the campaign email and I\u2019m seeing every email she is sending. Emails saying that she wants to keep me on staff but that I need to take less money, and that I shouldn\u2019t have been \u201cdishonest\u201d about my pregnancy, so clearly I wasn\u2019t doing my job that badly, she just wanted to pay a pregnant woman less. She also asks the consultant for a list of things that I did wrong on the campaign so that she will have cause not to pay me my contract. I notice that the consultant never replies to this email. He tells her that if she want to fight it to send him a copy of the contract and he will have a lawyer take a look at it. Well sure enough she sends him a signed copy of the contract and once again my contract is valid and she now has to pay me my severance. She has given me every piece of ammunition I need to get paid at this point as well as wage a discrimination suit for referencing my pregnancy as a reason for termination.\n\nI hire a lawyer. She continues to pester me about turning over all of my work, the thing is since I\u2019m an independent contractor I only owe her a final product if I get paid. I reiterate that she isn\u2019t getting anything until I\u2019ve been paid and she can take it up with my lawyer. She begins slandering me to everyone I know and continuing to send emails about me that I\u2019m just collecting. She then starts calling every friend she has to bully me into giving her what she wants. My response to all of them is, \u201ctalk to my lawyer\u201d.\n\nIn one final ditch effort she has the consultant call me begging me to turn over the stuff, the problem is that the consultant and I are personal friends and he\u2019s really unhappy working for her but has contractual obligations. I tell him to tell her the same thing, \u201ctalk to my lawyer\u201d. Five minutes later I get a call back from him saying that she has fired him because he refused to throw me under the bus and make up excuses for my termination when he believes I was wrongfully terminated. She fires him too and now he\u2019s out of his obligations. He also tells me that the lawyer she sent the contract over to said to pay me.\n\nIn a matter of two weeks she is once again at square one with no one on her side, she is out of money and struggling. She finally emails me at 11pm that she is willing to pay me. Its nighttime and I don\u2019t work for her anymore so I decide I don\u2019t need to respond at that moment. Well she starts calling me incessantly and texting me, all of which I\u2019m ignoring. By the time I wake up in the morning I have 20 texts and 5 missed calls. I tell her that I will need to talk to my lawyer at this point and I\u2019ll get back to her after he responds.\n\nWell, she goes nuclear. Twenty-minutes later I get a call from the police. She is claiming I have been embezzling campaign funds and stealing her data. I have to get my lawyer on the phone and explain the whole situation and why this is a BS claim. I offer the bank account information for the funds she claimed I stole and proved that they were sitting right there in her account she just doesn\u2019t know how to access them because I\u2019m usually the one who does that. The police officer thinks she is nuts at this point\u2026 because she is\u2026 but then informs her that it considered larceny to withhold my pay and asks me if I would like to press charges. I say \u201cIf she refused to pay then yes\u201d. Within two days I received a check in the mail with my payment and I turned everything over. The funny thing is that my 30 day notice pay was actually more money than if I had finished out the contract with the reduced pay she wanted to pay me. I got an extra $700 and didn\u2019t have to work for her for the remainder of the time.\n\nShe ended up losing her election in a swing district by 15 points.\n\nEdit: for those of you wondering I left campaigning and will never go back. If you want to hear my thought on politicians check out the link posted above. I am not proud of my job nor did I love it but a girls gotta eat and good luck finding a company to work in America for that isn\u2019t at the very least morally questionable.\n\nEdit 2: thanks for all the upvotes and awards guys, I didn\u2019t think it would get this much attention, I\u2019m just tired of women being treated like they can\u2019t be good employees and moms. On the plus side more people have upvoted this post than voted for her on Election Day.",

Then there are those who get into it for the perks and benefits. You have the professional politicians, people who love the  political system and being a politician, they run for low level office when younger and keep running for new ones as they get older. Lastly you have the do-gooders, much rarer and about 50% get corrupted in office and become part of the other mentioned groups. \n\nThough I cant imagine working for someone I only agree with on 10% of issues.

The problem was they had so many staff pregnant at once, some couldn't continued in their nominal positions due to the chemicals used so needed alternative position to work at full pay until maternity leave as week a a temp to fill their position and then once on maternity leave they needed cover and keeping full-time staff more than 3-6 months was a challenge let alone agency staff which they were loath to use because it cost them so much more.",

        "selftext": "This is without a doubt the best outcome possible from a bit of Malicious Compliance I could have achieved. I was only aiming to support my wife's good deed, but this paid me great dividends. This is a bit detailed as it covers a long span of backstory with a very rapid response once the malicious compliance was engaged in. A TLDR is attached at the bottom.\n\n**The backstory**\n\nI've had a shoulder injury for over a decade, when it occurred I had an MRI and was told the cartilage was fractured and tendon torn, whilst healthcare is free in my part of the world the lack of income while I would be healing prevented me from doing anything till 2017 when I figured I had a well-paying job and plenty of sick leave available. So, I started the ball rolling on getting it fixed, I was initially put through physio to try and fix the problem (or at least strengthen the shoulder). I completed the physio and as expected the shoulder was still an issue (albeit stronger now). Forward to the start of 2018 and I had an MRI, I was told I'd hear from them in a few weeks to have a review....\n\n...\n\n...\n\n6 months later after extensive nagging from my wife I finally called the hospital to see what was happening. Nothing like being told that the case had been closed. After a few firm but polite words my case was returned to the waiting list. Wife was happy, I was content to be back on the list (although rather confused that I'd been removed)..\n\nSo, I waited...\n\nand waited...\n\nand waited...\n\n**The Setup**\n\nMy wife is a loving woman and I'm damn lucky to have her. After her nagging for me to chase it up falling on deaf ears (although this is also because my work hours make me unable to contact the hospital during their office hours) this tremendous woman decided to sort it out for me and find out what was happening, i.e. am I still on the waiting list? After all it was now almost 18 months since the MRI had been taken.\n\nMy wife contacted the hospital and after being transferred a few times was connected to the right department, unfortunately she got stuck with an absolute Karen. The first response from Karen after hearing from my wife was to tell her she's not authorised to discuss the case with her (I've made it very clear in the past that my wife is authorised to act on my behalf, I could only assume later that this may have been due to the reactivation of my status via phone). My wife tried convincing her that she didn't require any details, all she wanted was for Karen to confirm if I was still on the waiting list. Karen however wouldn't give up so easily and continued to block my wife's request. Could Karen call me to inform me of my status, No, blocked. Could Karen email me, blocked. As you could imagine my wife was getting a little frustrated by now. Finally, Karen did something useful, since she wasn't going to contact me, I could contact her. My wife reminder her that calling during office hours wasn't possible. Karen countered stating that's ok he can email us...\n\nWife: Thanks Karen, what's the email address? There isn't any on our paperwork.\n\nKaren: That's ok, it's on the website.\n\nWife: I have a paper and pen could you tell me the email address.\n\nKaren: It's on the website, you'll find it there.\n\nWife: Whereabouts on the website?\n\nKaren: You'll find it on the website.\n\nWife: I understand you're telling me it's on the website, what I'm asking is where on the website is it? What should I be looking for?\n\nKaren: I told you, it's on the website.\n\nAt this point my wife was frustrated and tired from trying to jump through Karen's hoops. She thanked Karen for her time and finished the call. Frustrated my wife contacted the local member of parliament for advice on how to resolve the situation.\n\nDuring my evening drive I was listening to my frustrated, annoyed wife. She regaled me with the pointless call to the hospital and then her markedly better call with the local MP (member of parliament). I felt anger and annoyance. My wife had tried doing something lovely and had copped poor treatment from the hospital. My told me when I got home I was going to write an email to the Minister of health as that was the MP's recommendation... after a moment's thought I told my wife no.\n\n**The Malicious Compliance**\n\nI arrived home and told my wife that I was thankful for her time and effort, but it was alright I would take care of the situation now and I'm sorry that she'd had such a hard time that day.\n\nI opened my laptop and downloaded a program. This program is designed for marketing, it will scour through a website and pull any contact details (email address, name, title, contact numbers, etc) and compile them for people to then cold-call employees of a company.\n\nI typed up an email; detailing my case, history, being dropped off and returned to the waiting list, my concerns about the validity of an 18 month old MRI for surgeons and the supportive albeit succinct advice from Karen (I identified her department and name dropped her a few times in the email).\n\nReturning to my email spider program I found a healthy 768 email addresses. :-)\n\nAfter some thoughtful reflection I removed any email address that didn't belong to the hospital, leaving me with a still rather healthy 300+ email addresses. Copy, Paste into the To field. Then to continue to up my game I CC'ed in the department for the minister of health, the minister of health, shadow department for the minister of health, shadow minister of health and then the local MP.\n\nI returned to my email and thanked the MP for their assistance, emphasising how thankful I am as we are in the middle of an election (It's amazing how helpful politicians are around election time).\n\nI re-read the email one more time to make sure I had captured everything I had wanted... hmm, it needed just one more item to highlight the importance of the email.\n\n*\"I would like to thank Karen from Support Liaison for the limited support she was able to offer my wife despite her not being apparently authorised. I would also like to thank Karen for her clearly perfunctory instructions that the email address I needed to contact was on the Hospital website, albeit with no additional information as to the location of the email address I had to do some searching. Having followed Karen\u2019s instructions I had found this email on the Hospital website. Admittedly it is only one of the 319 @hospital email addresses I found, I\u2019ve presumed one of the remaining 768 email address not belonging to @hospital is not the one I am after (although I\u2019ll assume no response from this email as an indication perhaps it is, or perhaps I should be trying the other Hospital sub-domains and associated websites?). If for some reason Karen\u2019s instructions have resulted in this being inadvertently sent to the wrong email address please forward this to the correct department or Karen from Support Liaison (I\u2019m sure with her cursory instructions she\u2019ll be able to direct this appropriately). \"*\n\nWith that little extra added I smiled and hit send.\n\n\\*\\*As an amusing aside, I found over 3000+ email addresses when I included the sub-domains (I should point out that the Hospital is a large group of hospitals covering a large region)\n\n**The Outcome**\n\n***Week 1***\n\nThe following day I returned to work, in my lunch break I did my usual catch-up on emails. Except I noticed I had a few calls too.\n\n9:11 - Missed Call\n\n9:18 - Missed Call\n\n9:25 - Email 1\n\nDear cyberphobia\\_au,\n\nThanks for you feedback and I just wanted to update you and let you know that I have spoken to your spouse and given her the following information at this point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I have logged your complaint and sent it to the Head of Unit for Ortho and Referral Management for investigation and response.\n* I can confirm that you are on the Orthopaedic waitlist and have been since the 27.4.18.\n* I have put a comment on our database under her details as emergency contact that states \u201c*All information about appointments can be given to Mrs cyberphobia\\_au as per      direct permission from Mr cyberphobia\\_au.\u201d*\n* I will follow up and escalate the complaint about lack of support given to your spouse by the Patient Relations Coordinator she spoke to.\n* I will keep your spouse and  you updated on the outcome of the Orthopaedics appointment as soon as I am advised.\n\nI have a couple of questions I just need to ask you in relation to your concerns raised.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Do you wish to have any response or outcome from Hospital about this complaint relayed to the office of Hon. Local MP?\n* May I please have your permission to put your email address on our database?\n\nPlease feel free to contact me if you wish to discuss anything further.\n\nRegards,\n\nNot\\_Karen\n\n11:23 - Missed Call (an appointment has been booked)\n\n1:16 - Email 2 - Appointment Details\n\n*\\*\\* I received an additional 38 automated email responses and another 5 responses from various individuals/departments wishing to contact me.\\*\\**\n\nI responded to the email from the Not\\_Karen and stated that I did not believe the details needed to be relayed to the MP at this point in time.\n\n***Week 2***\n\nI attended my orthopaedic appointment. The expected 2-3 hour waiting room experience was a brief 30 minutes to see the surgeon.\n\nAs expected surgery was the outcome.\n\nI make my way to the desk to provide my details to be put on the surgical waitlist. The nurse behind the counter makes a quip about it being a priority.... *that's strange? I'm not in urgent need for this, I've lived with it for the last decade.*\n\nI get told I should have some details sent out to me in the next week or so detailing my priority.\n\n**Week 3**\n\nI receive a call about my availability (standard sort of stuff), can I attend same day if they have a late cancellation (I need a few days at least to ensure transition for my work) .\n\nOn the Friday I receive some paperwork detailing that I am a priority 2 and should expect the surgery to occur sometime in the next 9 months.\n\n**Week 4**\n\nMonday morning, 9:20 - Missed calls\n\n9:30 - Message from my wife - Call me\n\nI call her during my lunch break, as she answers the phone I ask her 'So when is my surgery?'\n\n**Week 5**\n\nThursday morning, I get stabbed, jabbed and arthroscoped. Kept in for observations and then released today on Friday. Only to come home and submit my first reddit post (typing this one handed has been a challenge)\n\n*\\*\\* My wife received a call checking up on things and to inform her that Karen has undertaken a review of procedure and if my wife would like a formal apology from Karen... Whilst my wife was frustrated by her actions an apology wasn't needed, knowing she had been updated on how to handle things so others wouldn't face a similar situation was enough for us both... not to mention my exceedingly short turn around for surgery.*\n\nTLDR; So, because I am defensive and supportive of my wife and she was told for me to email the address on the hospital website. I indulged in a little bit of malicious compliance and emailed 300+ email addresses from the website with a clear indication of sending it to a few thousand if I received no response. I not only found out I was on the waitlist, but I was seen to, I was seen to in record time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT -**\n\nA huge thank you for the upvotes and awards.\n\nDue to popular demand and to save people trawling through the comments;\n\nThe program I used to secure the email address was '*Atomic Email Hunter*', there are others like it out there too.\n\nI am also based in Australia, despite the similarities to UK and Canadian healthcare.\n\nFor those who think Karen was let off easily I doubt the multitude of people who she works for/with who received this email would be thinking the same.\n\nAs an amusing/concerning side note the most interesting response I got from this was the Sexual Assault and Family Violence Counselling service. It took them 2 days before they responded, sure my email had nothing to do with that, but if it had a 2 day delay is a bit sad.",

After spending half a day trying to talk to someone without any success my boss said fuck it, grabbed every single email adress from their adress book and emailed them a message detailing the situation, listing all our Fortune 500 and Fortune 100 clients and explaining that we were currently telling all of our customers that the reason they couldn't access their expensive software was because of said security company's screw up.

Everyone always wants us to release private health information to anyone and everyone at the drop of a hat, but if ever we did release that information to someone you didn\u2019t want us to, it\u2019d be our necks on the line. \n\nNow as far as the email - I\u2019m guessing Karen actually didn\u2019t know who to contact. Maybe she was new, maybe she didn\u2019t know her job, or maybe she\u2019s not permitted to give that specific detail out to non-patient, non-authorized third parties. \n\nHowever it was scummy that your case was dropped and delayed several times.

            "The sad thing about this is, clearly Karen was in a position to know exactly how to help. I am a nurse, and despite the time pressures I have everyday, answering calls that come through to the ward is something that needs to be done quite often. Sure... A lot of stuff I can't help with, but it's not hard to help with what you can.\n\nWe have some Karen's at work who transfer people to our ward who have access to the same systems we do, so know the same stuff I can find out also, despite this we have people trying to track down loved ones and end up on our phones telling me I'm the third person to tell them their loved ones aren't there. It might take me 5 minutes to find someone or find out something, but that 5 minutes is nothing for the people on the other end of the line trying to find out even where their loved ones are at the least. We even have people sent to our ward from the main reception...

            "The true secret weapon of the customer is the ability to email some asshole's supervisor, and that person's supervisor, and that person's supervisor.  I have an expectation that anyone who is hired to do a job has an implicit responsibility to do that job right, and that means working to satisfy the customer's service requirement within the scope of your position.  It does not mean following a process flow to the end of that flow and abandoning the customer regardless of whether or not the process satisfied their request.  Unfortunately, far too many entitled pieces of shit look at their jobs as doing only what is required by their employer, instead of doing what is required of the task, and so you end up with people completely unwilling to help people because of a policy they can use against customers that allows them to sidestep actually doing work.\n\nI had a similar problem.  I got into a not-at-fault accident.  Police came, filed the report, told me it would be available on their website the next day.  Called my insurance company, filed a claim, and was told I would be contacted within 72 hours.\n\nSeventy-two hours pass, no response.  So I called my agent, who said she had yet to receive the police report (which is provided to them by some service they pay for and not an explicit task that a claims agent does, according to her), and that the other person in the accident had told their insurance a story contrary to the police report.  I inform my agent the police report is available on the county sheriff's website and give her the information, she said she'd pull the report and follow up with me the next day.\n\nOne day passes, no phone call.  Next day passes, no phone call.  My car doesn't run, and my insurance is supposed to cover a rental, so this is now a problem.\n\nI call back the agent, who gives me the same exact story despite earlier telling me she can pull the report from an official source.  So I decide to escalate the issue.\n\nI downloaded the accident report, attached it as an email, and sent it to her, her direct manager, and the regional manager for the insurance company.  I explain firmly that unless I am immediately provided with the service I pay them for; which is to insure my automobile, I will lawyer up and visit a doctor.\n\nAfter I hit send on that email, it took them less than one hour to call me, waive my deductible on my claim, arrange for a rental car, contact the shop I had left the car at to authorize the repair, and receive an apology from my \"former\" agent's supervisor for the substandard service I had received by them while processing my claim.\n\nWhile in the end they made it right, this was the second time I had a problem processing a not-at-fault claim from this insurer.  They're no longer my insurer, and they likely never will be again.\n\nI used to be like this too, I'll admit.  But I've long since learned my lesson that it's more important to make your customer happy then it is to save your employer a few bucks by blocking a customer's legitimate complaint or request.  Your employer doesn't notice when you use policy to prevent a customer from receiving a refund they're probably entitled to.  They **do** notice when that customer leaves a glowing review of the service you provided to your manager for helping them get what they were trying to get.",

He comes here, wearing a colored shirt and apologizes to me, I'll consider it.\"  \n\n\"He's not going to do that\"\n\n\"Fine, not traveling to that region, I'll talk to people on the phone, I can do my job that way just fine\" and walked out.  Called my sales droid and said we'd work on the phone, not coming back up.  Droid not happy, but understood.\n\nWeek later reception calls that I have a guest.  Go to lobby and there is my director and the regional VP of sales wearing a BLUE SHIRT.\n\nBest apology ever!!\n\nEdited to add: /u/Striderfighter asked why it was such a fast apology.  \n\nSo in the 80's network stuff was crazy expensive.  The networking part of the deal was worth ~$1+ million tying customers existing mainframes (fast host to host connections were new and a big deal) and some new mainframes; together so all in all $4-5 million.  And it wasn't going fly without some help.  So commissions for sales droid, manager, upper manager and VP of sales.  So a ton of money on the table for them.  \n\nThey got the deal.  And I got a surprise bonus. But I still had to go to Boston.\n\nEdited to add:  Wow, this got huge overnight.  Thanks for all the awards!  And the points!!! And especially thanks for all the great comments!!!!",

            "Even if you worked for the VP, he was a jerk for calling out a person in a big meeting over a shirt color. It was a big power move to show everyone who is the boss (he failed in this case) but I would never want to work for someone that is big on showing off his authority.",

Engineers don't need sales drones.\n\nA sales VP is much more replaceable than any mid level engineer who has been good at their job for more than a couple years. A SME engineer is worth a lot more than that.\n\nAs a IT guy, this malicious compliance is delicious.",
            "At this point, he knew he fucked up and the only thing he could do was wear a blue shirt and apologize.  Give him props for doing that.  Also props to your director for being understanding.  I'm sure he had to deal with shit from the VP before the VP gave in.",
            "Working in government procurement.  For decades wore dress pants, shirt and tire.  At lunch I would take the tie off and put it back on.  Since I worked in a cubicle, no one really saw me outside of fellow employees.  Stopped wearing the tie after lunch.  Then a notice came out that there was no dress code.  Already had my wardrobe, so kept wearing the same stuff but skipped the tie unless I had a meeting with a vendor or being interviewed for a promotion.",

As an artist part of his style was to wear tweed jackets, corduroy trousers and non white shirts. He looked professional and business like, but still looked like the artist.\n\nThere was the one company however where he figured out he needed to blend in. He has a dark suit and a set of 5 starched white shirts. They only came out when he was headed to Armonk or the 100 Percent Club events.\n\nIn the 70s when streaking was a thing he had a joke...  \nDid you hear about the streaker in the executive wing at Insanely Big Mega Corp?  \nA guy went running down the hall with no jacket and wearing a blue shirt.\n\nWhen I cleared his closet after he passed away I found the set of 5 white shirts. They are in perfect shape.",

            "Reminds me of a tech I contracted for a while when I was an IT manager. That guy knew his stuff, but also had a backbone shinier than the sun.\n\nHe dressed in jeans and hoodies. I was fine with that - he was a tech, and my country is not big on dress codes outside law and finance.\n\nHe told me he was a tech and an investment firm (finance) and showed up in jeans and hoodie. The CEO of the firm told him he needed to show up in a suit, white shirt and tie. He refused. The CEO insisted.\n\nHe went \"Look man, you sit in a chair in front of a desk all day, that is not taxing on a suit. I crawl under desks in the dust and dirt, handle sharp edged hardware and heavy servers. My suit would be ruined in a few months. Unless you are going to pay me the cost of a nice suit every six months, I am not wearing a suit.\"\n\nThe issue was quietly dropped after that, and he continued to wear jeans and a hoodie when he worked at that place.",
            "So I'm guessing you're in your mid-60s and worked for IBM at the same time I did, late 70s to early 80s, and this was a big sale of 3705's and SNA to somebody like State Street. If I remember correctly, you were based in the Raleigh-Durham area. Am I right?\n\nI was recruited into Sales in Central NY. With a degree in Computer Science, I expected them to hire me as a Systems Engineer, but instead they hired me as a salesman. I bought a suit and a sport coat and slacks from a discount store, and a couple of shirts, one brown and the other blue, both striped vertically. With a couple of nice ties, I figured I was golden.\n\nDressed like that, I got beat up and embarrassed at my first training session in Endicott, NY. They then assigned the worst territory in the branch office to me. It was spread out all over Central NY with customers that had been unhappy with IBM for years. That territory sucked my soul out of my body through my anus.\n\nEnd of story: I ended up with a closet of white button down shirts, blue suits, red ties, and black wingtip shoes two years later. I finally started hitting some numbers, because I was now an acceptable \"droid\" who deserved some resources like you. Saved a year's worth of commissions, resigned when the sales manager in Santa Barbara asked to transfer me and my branch refused to grant me an inter-office transfer, and moved to CA. Never looked back.",

They reach a meadow and sales droid says, in order to avoid any real work, \"You put up the tent, and I'll go look for some bears.\" SE is almost finished pitching the tent when he hears a blood-curdling scream. He looks up and sees the sales droid running full speed at him with a growling bear in hot pursuit. As the sales droid runs past the SE, he yells, \"You skin this one, I'll get another one.\"",
