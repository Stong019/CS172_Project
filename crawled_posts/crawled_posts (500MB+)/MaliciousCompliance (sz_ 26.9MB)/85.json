        "selftext": "So I was a trucker for a while, and that comes with plenty of stories of crazy things in so many places. One of my favorite stories, however, comes from a piece of malicious compliance that came together just perfectly.\n\nThe setup:\n\nI tend to be a bit on the lazy side when I can get away with it, and I searched for quite some time to find a company that would keep me far away from unloading the trailers myself. I found a good one that had a 95% drop and hook rate (Drop off a trailer full of goods, then grab a new one that's either loaded or to take to the next pickup). 4.9% of them are either handled by the receiving dock or by lumpers (dockworkers hired by warehouse companies specifically to unload trucks). That .1% is a list of places that just want to watch you work, or be convinced that you really shouldn't operate their lifts.\n\nIn my contract, I saw that there was a place where your hourly rate for unloading was stated. Not for the hours that you were sitting and waiting to be unloaded but for when you were the one unloading your own trailer. I also saw that the contract allowed for alterations to be made to the price of this service to be charged to the customer. As a joke I put in not one, but two extra zeroes. $1500 an hour for unloading a trailer? Should deter most people. Most people saw that, got a good laugh, then pulled in someone to unload for me.\n\nThe event:\n\nMost people, like I said, were smart. This run was set to arrive at 0300 to a certain clothing store in the mall, let's call 'em I.B. Nickeled. I'd been to this store a few times before and it was always the same manager, Mr. Dime, receiving me, and it was always the same runaround. If I wanted to get unloaded I had to wait for someone to get there, then I'd have to sit and wait while the poor kid back there got the load off, then I'd have to wait for traffic to ease up to get out since it was always almost 1030 by the time I finally left, leaving me with only a couple of hours left on my clock to get to a truck stop for the day.\n\nI got there and, yep, Mr. Dime had come in to accept the load. It was always hard to be smart at 0300, and I can only imagine that was part of Mr. Dime's usual runaround. This time was a bit different for a few reasons. One, he smelled like there was a bit of an herbal calming remedy about him to settle his nerves for the night. Two, he said that he was completely understaffed and there was no one around to unload me, so I'd have to do it myself. Three, I couldn't stay to my usual time because he had to leave before 0500.\n\nTo be fair to him, I did try and say, \"sure, but my contract says-\"\n\n\"I don't give a damn what your contract states! I don't have anyone in until the store opens, and I've got an appointment that's more important than some trucker's contract! Just unload it yourself!\"\n\nI considered it for a moment and went back up to my truck to get my tablet (This was in 2019 before the virus and the company had just swapped over to tablets for certain things, like signing off on expenses or getting permissions.) Mr. Dime was fuming when I came back and handed him the tablet. \"Just read through and sign with your finger.\"\n\nHe didn't read through. I had twenty pallets at one and a half thousand pounds each. The only available tool to unload was a manual pallet jack. I started my work clock and began unloading at 0315. At 0500 Mr. Dime looks on in satisfaction to see me about three quarters of the way through as he's out the door. At 0515, Mr. Dime's replacement, Mr. Quarter of the day shift, comes running in with his face white as a sheet to see me taking off the fourth to last pallet.\n\n\"Please tell me that I'm reading this wrong,\" he pled fruitlessly.\n\n\"I wish I could,\" I lied, knowing that Mr. Dime was about to be up a muddy creek with a spoon. \"I even tried telling Mr. Dime what he was getting into, but he just skimmed and signed.\"\n\nHe slumped. \"Wait here. I need to call my district manager.\"\n\n\"Better be quick. I want to be out of this lot by 0630 to beat the morning rush and get a good breakfast.\"\n\nHe ran back and I continued unloading. When I finally got the last pallet off at 0550, I turned off my time clock as the district manager came in, We'll call him Mr. Dollar just to keep consistent, followed both by Mr. Quarter who was looking somewhat relieved and by Mr. Dime who was somewhere between terrified and furious.\n\n\"You're Mr. Aero?\" Mr. Dollar asked, holding a printout and looking to it for the name.\n\n\"That's me,\" I agreed. \"I take it they sent over the contract Mr. Dime signed?\"\n\n\"Yes, and that's just it. Mr. Dime is accusing you of forging his signature on this since there's no way he'd sign off on a multi-thousand dollar contract just to unload a trailer. Especially since he claims you insisted on unloading it yourself.\"\n\nI whistled. \"That's a heck of an accusation. Hey, is that CCTV I see up in that corner over there?\" I asked, knowing full well that the entire loading dock was covered by a slew of cameras. The one I pointed out was positioned just right to catch the whole conversation at the door.\n\n\"Mr. Quarter, get the footage,\" Mr. Dollar said. \"We don't have audio but we do have visual on them.\" Mr. Dime lost his fury and now just looked petrified.\n\nThe Fallout:\n\nOne review later and I was grinning like a loon back to my truck. I called my manager, booked some home time, and walked away with enough money to last to the end of the month. The next time I went into that IB Nickeled there was a new, much more sensible manager who always had a man on staff to unload the trucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdits: Some typos. And to clarify a few things:\n\n1: Yes, I milked it a bit, though not as much as some people might think. Like I said, I was regularly there from 0300 to 1030 at the latest. Throw on top of that the fact that I've never been the healthiest of individuals and it took me that long to keep from hurting myself. This was during the summer in SoCal, and even at night it was still \\~90f outside, hotter in the trailer without any air conditioning. A fat man with no AC is going to take all the time he wants.\n\n2: Why didn't Mr. Dime do any of this himself and why did he lie? Truckers tend to get the short end of the stick, even when we're regulars to a place. This was the fifth or sixth time I'd been there spread out over the course of four months or so, so I was familiar enough that I was recognized at the dock but not so much that they really cared to keep track of it. The manager figured he could probably get away with shafting me since he claimed I didn't like how long I was waiting. I feel like he's made other truckers get to that point but none of them had hourly rates like mine on their contract. He's just one of many that thought he could get away with blaming it on 'that damn trucker' when it went wrong for him.\n\n3: What happened while we watched the video was pretty anticlimactic. The recording was on Mr. Quarter's phone when he came back and was pretty low quality, but you could still make out that I argued with him about unloading for a minute before coming back and he did indeed sign it.  Mr. Dollar said, \"You can go, Aero. Mr. Dime, go wait in the office. Now.\" I got going while the going was good.",

When we're sitting on site with our thumb up our rear, and can't do our job, we're losing money. So the company charges accordingly. $100/hr charged for standby to the client, at the standard labour rate division (roughly 50/50 split between me and the company).",

So I started a lumping llc with business licenses and forklift certifications is all the states we regularly needed to pay for lumping.

            "Years ago I used to be the nightfill boss of a hardware store. \n\nA guy in the trades department asked me to put something right up in topstock for them. I was required to do the task as my machine, a walkiestacker (like a cross between a forklift and an electric pallet jack) was able to get in much closer to this particular rack and the item being put up there was quite expensive. \n\nHe told me the position was prepared with gluts and braces for the racks and ready to receive the pallet. \n\nIt wasn't. \n\nI managed to save the load with the tips of the fork tines of the walkiestacker without damaging anything and my spotter/witness said it was the most amazing bit of maneuvering they'd ever seen. \n\nGet to the office, sort the paperwork for the morning shift to review and process. Camera footage isn't available for the upper corner of the trade department so it's going off witness accounts. Just me and my spotter with all other nightfill staff in other parts of the store and unable to comment. \n\nThe guy from trades lies and told them he never told me to put it up there. Only he wrote a note and left it on my desk. \n\nShowed the bosses the note. \n\nHe then claimed he never told me the area was prepared and that I should have checked before placing the pallet. \n\nNormally, very true. However this was in his department where I was almost never working as they had their own fillers, drivers and machines and no less than three people, two his own staff, saw him tell me it was all sorted and I just needed to lift and place with my machine to ensure a safe lift. \n\n\nHe got fired.",

Asking someone to do a bunch of manual labor after trying to stay awake and alert for hours and hours of highway driving, then get back in the truck and go somewhere to grab a bite and catch some sleep is unreasonable. There should always be people available to unload, even if that means that Mr. Dime is doing it himself. In fact, I see no reason why he wouldn't. I would.\n\n2. You handled it perfectly.

            "I worked in receiving for 14 years, was in charge of getting trucks unloaded for the last 9 of those. Most of the truck drivers were great, although you would always get a few bads ones now and then. Most of them would tell me how that we unloaded them faster than any other company they delivered to. I always said I knew they wanted to get out of there  and get home, so there was no reason to make them wait longer than necessary.\n\nAfter reading this, I can see why they were impressed with our unload times. I can't believe it took their workers that long to unload you. Depending on what the product wss, we would have had you unloaded and back on the road in about 15 - 30 minutes. That includes the time it would take to unload the pallets and verify everything against the packing list. If it was one of the many times that I was short handed and had to do it all myself, maybe an extra 10 - 15 minutes.\n\nI will never understand people that lie when they know there is proof they are not telling the truth. Those few bad truck drivers I mentioned earlier, I had more than once where they would tell their dispatch that we refused to unload them or they sat for hours waiting to be unloaded. Security logs the time in and time out for each load, with the driver signing each. So we had a driver that said we took over 3 hours to unload him even though his own signature on the logs shows he was only there for 30 minutes.\n\nAnother driver told his dispatch he got there at 7:00 PM, but we refused to unload him and he had to wait for first shift to get there at 6:00 AM to get unloaded (we did not have a third shift). The next day, there were emails going back and forth all day wanting to know why we had refused to unload him. No one had an answer until I started my shift. A quick call to ask security to check their logs showed that he had actually signed in at 11:30 PM, not 7:00 AM; a full hour after our cutoff time.",

            "Reminds me of a late and unlamented driving job; today a whole cadre were picking up maybe fifty pensioners and dropping them off in a small bus depot with one street entrance only. I got there first, delivered the passengers, then crucially DROVE BACK OUT ONTO THE STREET before unpacking their bags into the waiting busses. Second up was a right nob end I'll call Mr Cool. Mr Cool drove on in, his passengers got out and he started going to the boot for their bags. I suggested he maybe wanted to DRIVE BACK OUT ONTO THE STREET but he totally knew better and wasn't really good about it either. I helped him carry their bags from his car to the bus. So, all finished and he went about his day? WRONG! Another ten cars proceeded to pull into the small depot through the only entrance, nose to tail, disgorging octogenarians and drivers struggling to help carry their bags. I ran back and forth helping the other drivers and thus speeding up the total process, Mr Cool did not. Then I left on my next job by the simple expediency of walking out to the street park and driving off, I'd estimate he was there for another hour until the unimaginably slow elderly people and luggage was out of that last car in and the gate unblocked. \n\nAnd the really funny thing? This was milk money for me, he was a career driver. Like, he should have been telling me the short cuts, not the other way 'round. And certainly not throwing it back in my face.",

I could bring my own along or hire any schnook standing on the street to unload the trailer. Or I could do it myself and keep the stipend. If the load was simple pallets that I could pull off with a jack or forklift then I usually did it myself. A full 53' trailer holds a maximum of 30 pallets sideways, 28 pinwheeled, or 26 straight so it was no big deal. But if the trailer was a floor load where you'd have to pick up each item by hand, Fuuuuck that.

        "selftext": "I had a landlord in the past who slipped a 90 day notice requirement into the rental contract after I had signed it.  I was house hunting, so at the end of my lease I asked to go to a month to month lease to make it easier to leave when the time came.  Landlord and I agreed on a higher monthly price to compensate them for the lack of security, and I signed the contract at the office of a business they also owned downstairs.  Landlord wasn't actually present, but one of their employees handled it.  So, contract is signed and they go to make me a copy for my records, but are \"having an issue with the copier\".  After a few minutes they ask if they can text me when they get it to work.  I naively agree, and head upstairs.  30 minutes or so later, they text me saying they got the copier to work, and I come pick up my \"copy\".  I didn't think to double check everything at the time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, for the next few months I just pay my monthly rent while I look for a home.  Finally found the right place, and the closing date was about 4 weeks out, so I immediately notified my landlord that I would be leaving on said date.  Landlord responds that it's nice I found a home, but I would be responsible for the next 2 months rent after that as well due to the 90 day notification requirement in the contract.  I'm totally confused, so I go check my copy of the contract, and sure enough, there is a stipulation in there about that.  I also notice that my initials from the top and bottom of each page, verifying that I have read that page, have somehow mysteriously shifted to being doubled up at the top of the page after this stipulation, with none on the bottom of that actual page.  This was because they had inserted 2 lines of text detailing the 90 day reporting requirement, after I had already signed the paperwork.  They didn't notice the formatting error it created, which was a dead giveaway of what was going on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI inform the landlord of this, and notify him that this is not a legally binding contract due to this issue, and state that I will not be paying any further rent beyond this month, and expect my deposit back without penalty.  Unfortunately he persists with stating that this is a legally binding contract, and he will pursue it in court in addition to withholding my deposit if I fail to pay, blah blah blah...  I know I am legally in the right, but I don't want to have to deal with courts to settle it as that takes forever, so I come up with an alternative plan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe one thing he hadn't thought about was the fact that the contract included all utilities, as the unit didn't have separate meters, and did not have any language forbidding excessive use of them.  It just so happened to be a particularly cold winter, so I informed my landlord that if he wanted to persist with his demands, I would be inclined to leave all of the windows open, crank the heat as high as it would go, open the refrigerator door, run the water 24/7, etc, and if he entered the apartment without my permission to turn any of these items off, I would report him to the police.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI got confirmation that he would not pursue the extra month's rent or security deposit within 20 minutes.  :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:  Just so everyone knows how the story ended, this happened around December of 2016 if I remember correctly, and I did get my security deposit back, etc.  Didn't pursue legal option because I didn't think it would end up being worth the time and trouble, though I understand the sentiment.",

When I walked in the back door, sure enough my dog was sitting in front of him with his back to the door. If he so much as twitched his finger she started growling and showing teeth. He tried to say that I would have to cage the dog as it was his house and he should be able to come in whenever he needed to. I let him know that he must provide 48 hours notice before entering the property and the next time I would take it to court and win. Bought that dog a fillet that night. Good girl!",
            "My last apartment was an individually owned unit managed by a crummy management company, inside a highrise that also had crummy management of its own. There was water damage from the unit above that caused our kitchen to be torn out. We eventually learned that it would be months before the kitchen would be replaced (fault of the building, not the company we were renting from). We complained multiple times to the management company we rented from that we shouldn't have to pay full rent because we don't have full use of the apartment. They kept denying it saying it's not their fault (which was true), but shitty because it definitely wasn't our fault and it should be the owner not the renter who suffers in a case like that.\n\n After a month of back and forth, we made an official complaint to the city, an inspector came out and said that our unit wasn't up to code, and that our landlord was going to be fined something absurd like $200 a day until it was fixed. Our landlord started BEGGING us to leave as soon as possible, but we had a lease so they couldn't force us to. They ended up paying us like $6k and fully refunding all deposits to get us to leave ASAP mid month. \n\nSucks to suck for them.",

            "I had an absolutely terrible landlord in the past. When we viewed the rental at first it seemed okay, good enough for some college students. But needed a lot of issues fixed. Downstairs bathroom cabinet was rotted out, side screen door had no handle, bug problem, detached garage had no electric hooked up, nor did it have a functional lock, and more. On top of this, apparently this house was in a flood zone. Landlord had installed a French drain around the foundation. Never told us of flooding issues despite two bedrooms being in the basement. I live in a state that legally the renter has to be notified of this. Naturally, being naive we didn\u2019t notice any of these issues. \n\nCome July of 2018, the house floods. Somewhere around 10 inches of rain overnight. Basement floods with rainwater first. The landlord had installed a French drain, but no backup sump pump in the basement. Once the water became too much for the city drainage system, the sewage backs up into the basement too. You read that right, sewage. I was the only one home at the time. Also was living in the basement. A friend came to help me get what I could out of the basement. But large things were all destroyed. Lost thousands of dollars worth of furniture. And thanks to the landlord not informing us of a flooding problem, none of us had flood insurance tacked onto our rental insurance. City was claiming it as a disaster, insurance wouldn\u2019t cover because it was \u201crainwater\u201d and considered and act of god. \n\nBetween the time of roughly 3am and 8am, the basement flooded with nearly three feet of rainwater and sewage. Landlord\u2019s friend comes and drops off a sump pump. Doesn\u2019t plug it in. Landlord asks me to plug it in and route it to the alley. I told him no. Landlord\u2019s father shows up hours later to plug in it. Now they are pumping sewage into the alleyway. Once the water has cleared, everyone leaves. Including my father and a roommate that drove over four hours each to get there that morning. I on the other hand had been up about 24 hours at this point. \n\nCome back the next day, landlord had already thrown anything that was sitting in water away. Anything that seemed salvageable, they put to the side. Seemed like they were being nice. He then starts out about how he will have the basement fixed, and in the meantime we can live in a hotel. I ask if he plans to pay for that. He declines, imagine that. I explain to him the house in uninhabitable, and that breaks our contract. He reluctantly agrees, and says he needs a written notice of why us roommates are moving out. I give him that. Should have been the end of it. \n\nIt was after the water was drained out that we could see the full extent of the home we were living in. After they stripped the Sheetrock, there was visible black mold behind it. Obvious signs of bug infestations. Previous signs of flooding. Cracked concrete. \n\nA couple months go by, and he sends us a bill. He charged the other three roommates rent for two months while the house was uninhabitable, despite my notice including their names.  He charged each of us a \u201ccleaning fee\u201d after the flooding. He also charged us two downstairs for the disposal of personal belongings. The belongings that were soaked in sewage and needed to be taken out by people wearing hazmat suits. He then left utilities in my name as the home was being fixed, but did not bother to forward me a single bill. I found out through the utility companies. \n\nI also happened to find out he listed the home for sale within a month of the flooding. \n\nRemember when I said I worked for a contractor previously? I knew that after a disaster such as that flood which ruined countless basements and flooded so many homes, there would be no way he could get the home inspected, and fixed in that amount of time. No chance. I had photos of everything. The water coming through the drains and toilet. The sump pump routed to the alley. The black mold in the basement. I texted him, and said this bill is unacceptable, and that I expected a full refund of each of our deposits. He gave me an angry text explaining how ungrateful we are and how he gave us a deal on it. That\u2019s when I hit him with it. I told him if we didn\u2019t have checks in our mailbox that fully compensated us for the deposits, I would go to the city with every last thing I had. And he could expect to be served with a suit for allowing us to live in a home such as that. Even had lawyer give him a phone call. \n\nWithin a week, we each had the deposits back. We still lost money, but we were just glad to be out of that shithole. I can still smell that water/sewage. I still think of the fact we were wading around in it to get stuff out. Still think how we could\u2019ve died that day had we not flipped the breakers off. Haven\u2019t stopped thinking about the fact I happened to be up still when the water started to come in. To say the least, I was just thankful to be out of that house. \n\n\nWorst landlord ever. If we weren\u2019t broke college kids, I would have taken him to court. Still wish I could to some extent.",

            "Kinda shocked at how much attention this little story got.  Glad some folks found it interesting.  I omitted a few details from the original post for the sake of brevity, I know, it's not like the original post was particularly short, but it would have been a good deal longer had I laid out the whole thing, so I chose to pair it down to what I thought was the core of the story.  There have been a lot of questions about the parts I omitted though, so I guess I should make a couple things clear.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRegarding my reasoning for not pursuing legal options.  Firstly, I didn't believe there would be any big pot of gold at the end of that rainbow, and I was pretty busy with renovating my new house at the time, so I just didn't feel it would be worth my effort given those realities.  I understand the comments to the effect of \"the landlord can just do it again if you don't hold them accountable\", but there were also some reasons I wasn't too concerned about that.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst, the landlord didn't have multiple rental properties, so I wasn't concerned about this being a massive issue down the road.  The apartment I was in was the only one on the premises, and supposedly the only one they owned.  The owner claimed to be a first-time landlord, which I believe to be the truth based on my experience with them and the fact that the bought the property shortly after I originally moved it.  They were generally pretty accommodating the few times I had an issue prior to this.  Broken washing machine, blown fuse in the heat pump, that sort of thing.  They sent someone out within a reasonable time for the issue, and got it taken care of.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe second reason I wasn't worried about the future tenant, and really the primary one, was because the future tenant was the very store manager/landlord's employee to whom I actually delivered the ultimatum.  The very one who pulled the switcheroo with the contracts.  He wanted to move in to that apartment to save himself the commute to work, and had even tried to convince the landlord to cancel my lease rather than allowing me to go month to month so that he could move in.  Landlord chose to allow me to go month to month instead.  I figured Mr. store manager was well aware of, and almost certainly complicit in the fraud attempt, if not even possibly the primary driver of it.  Any case, I wasn't worried about him getting ripped off.  Rather, I would have been totally fine if he did.  LOL!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope that clears up things for some folks who had questions.  Sorry I don't have time to individually respond to each mention of the issue.",
            "Yeah - I had a landlord change a lease.   Total makes the lease unenforceable.",
            "Damn i'd still have TOTALLY taken his ass to court. We heard so much of this sort of shit in our contract law case studies, and my own landlord even tried to pull this crap when i was at Uni except instead of what happened to you, it was that they'd agree'd to have a 3rd person move in (my gf and i were looking for a place together) when university term started and the rent would be split between the 3 of us. We even interviewed candidates and found one we liked, then when we told the lawyers acting on behalf of the landlord, they said she'd changed her mind and wasn't going to allow anyone else to move in and my gf and i would have to pay the full rent between the 2 of us for that year (rent in Aberdeen is the 2nd highest in the UK, with London being top).",

        "selftext": "Excuse any formatting. TL;DR at the bottom. \n\nA bit of background, I work in marketing and manage a number of client accounts for the business and I'm in charge of a team of account managers. I'm a minority shareholder in the business so, of course, it's in my intetest to ensure that the business operates efficiently and effectvely. As one of the longest serving employees, when given my last promotion, as part of the package I was offered shares in the business, as I would be one of the most senior members of staff. It works out that I own about 5-7% of the business (can't recall the exact share division). \n\nAs a shareholder, you'd expect that the managing director (let's call him MD) would understand that I genuinely want the best for the business, but instead, does not take me seriously at all, and frequently goes out of his way to undermine me. \n\nSo last week I was supposed to come back on wednesday following the Christmas break. Unfortunately, the week I was due to come back, I fell ill and lost my voice (as well as other issues that meant I couldn't make the journey into the office). I did the standard and messaged the MD as well as HR to inform them of what the situation was. We'd recently upgraded to a new project management system that needed a little bit of manual TLC in order to make it work automatically (if that makes sense?) So I figured I'd take advantage of my illness and just vegetate in bed and work on this project management system.\n\nAt about midday I get a text off of the MD which read: 'Hi u/benisaboringname, as you know, I would like to bring [insert name of large travel company] on as a client. As they'll be your future client I would like you to jump on a Skype call with them this afternoon.' \n\nThe subsequent (paraphrased) conversation: \nMe: I couldn't possibly do that, as you know, I have lost my voice and I'm currently in bed working on the project management system. \n\nMD: No I need you to do this. It's very important. \n\nMe: I have already advised you that this will not be possible. I don't NEED to work on this system today as officially, I'm ill and have no requirement to work at all, as you're aware, so what you're asking is unacceptable. \n\nMD: I don't care. You may be a director, but you're still an employee. Im sure your dividends are likely to be affected if we were to lose one of our largest potential clients. \n\n\nNow, finally (I know, I'm sorry) its time for the malicious compliance. Obviously I don't want my dividends to be affected in the next quarter, no matter how much of an open ended threat that was, so I call the procurement manager of this large travel organisation. I don't turn my camera on and I explain via text input what the situation is. We try our hardest to communicate, them talking via the microphone and me communicating via the chat function. We mutually agree that this is going nowhere and they agree that I shall call them back when Im well. \n\nHowever, the next day, I'm still ill and get a message off the MD saying that I need to go in the office for a 'priority one' meeting. Essentially, what that means is that even if you're on your death bed, you're expected to dial in remotely or go into the office. As I walk in, the MD, the HR Director and the Business Development Director are sat waiting for me. I immediately know that this is regarding yesterday...there's no other reason for the HR Director to have crawled out of his cave. \n\nI'm told to sit down and the MD looks incredibly unhappy. He shows me an email thread from the procurement manager of the travel firm essentially calling the MD unprofessional for making me go on the call. And saying they are having second thoughts about using our services. The HR Director, who has obviously been lead astray by the MD asks how I can explain this and why I didn't raise this as an issue. I ask to link up to the screen and show the HR Director the texts between the MD and myself from my phone. After a grilling, we all leave, putting it down as a 'learning experience'. \n\nFast forward 6 days, yesterday I contacted the procurement manager of this travel firm and he explained that he would love to become a client but as long as all correspondence went through me \"rather than the dickhead MD.\" \n\nAlls well that ends well I guess. \n\n\nTL;DR: Managing Director made me do a skype call with a large potential client despite having lost my voice. He threatens my income, so I have no choice. He gets called out by the potential client for his unprofessionalism after I explained the situation to them. Now they'll only deal with me directly and called him a dickhead. ",

After hearing nothing back for a week and a half, I get a call out of the blue asking if I can come in for an interview. Only problem is, I\u2019ve been incredibly sick and could only speak in a whisper. I tell the lady this, and after having to repeat myself a couple times, she says \u201cOh...well can you come in anyway? We have to get through all interviews today.\u201d So, knowing I wouldn\u2019t get the job if I didn\u2019t go, begrudgingly said yes.\n\nI show up there and the sales manager is interviewing me,  and seems incredibly concerned that I came in to the interview sick but goes through with the interview anyway. He asks me to repeat myself many times throughout, and eventually gave up and probably didn\u2019t hear half the answers to the questions.\n\nIn the end, I got the job. They were either very desperate or impressed that I came in. I like to think it\u2019s the latter but it\u2019s retail, so probably the former.",

If you were \u201creally\u201d sick, you wouldn\u2019t even be able to sit upright in bed and concentrate on work. \n\nI\u2019m not saying they were in the right, far from it, but you need to understand your rights in the workplace and protect yourself from situations like this, because there are plenty of employers out there who will take a mile if you give them an inch.",

I feel like the meeting could have been basically framed as \"Hey, we had this meeting scheduled, and your business is really important to us. So, even though I'm sick right now and can't actually speak, I thought I'd at least make an attempt to touch base with you via text here and see if there's anything we can do to \\[accomplish the goals of this meeting\\] now. \"\n\nHow did MD's dickheaded behavior even come up in conversation with the potential client? \"Oh, I'm sick and can't talk to you, but my dickhead of a boss says we have to have this meeting anyways...so let's give this a go, eh?\"\n\nI just feel like any airing of internal dirty laundry (like dickhead boss behavior) is rather unprofessional and possibly counter-productive to the idea of giving a potential client a good impression of your company's ability to accomplish their goals.  \n\n\nINB4 \"Found the dickhead boss! Hurhurr\"",
            "I mean, yeah very uncool from the MD, but Malicious Compliance is not how a director of a company should be acting. The real motive of the call was not to discuss business, but to form a personal connection with the client and reassure them that if they sign, they will be taken care of by the account management department (who are the ones doing the actual work). The role of a Director is to come up with solutions, not to create more problems. The correct way to deal with this would have been to get in touch with the client directly via email and explain the situation to them and re-arrange a time for a call, offer to help with any questions by email, etc, with plenty of professionalism and enthusiasm thrown into the email. Then you tell the MD that you've reached out to the client to re-arrange the call for when you get your voice back. If the MD bugs you, you ignore them. You have fulfilled your duties to the best of your ability and they can't fire you for being sick.",

I was actually happy that I could listen to loud music and the neighbor wouldn't mind since they were also noisy. Well, to my surprise, in a few days I get a very angry building manager telling me that the neighbor complained I was too noisy, even though I was careful to never make noise between 9pm and 10am. Of course I then complained about the stomping and got told that other apartments also complained about that, but neither he nor the police could do anything about natural noises from normally living in an apartment.\n\nWell, from then on every night and early morning I would play very loud and dirty porn, and whenever I had a *guest* I would tell her she could be as noisy as she wanted.

Our last night there I could hear the kids in the room above us loudly running around and jumping on the beds.  At 9pm, while it was annoying, I felt like that\u2019s just one of those things you have to accept at a place like that. At 11:30pm, enough was enough and I called the front desk and had someone ask them to stop. It stopped and I went to sleep.  At 2:30am, I woke up and they were doing it again.  I called the front desk again and soon after it stopped for the night. As I checked out that morning, the hotel\u2019s system obviously kept records of customers calling in. The woman apologized, and proceeds to tell me what happened.  When a hotel employee went up the second time, he told the kids that he needed to speak to the parents.  The kids said they weren\u2019t there. He then said, \u201cCan you call them?\u201d  The kids said they couldn\u2019t.  The parents left, the kids didn\u2019t know where they were, and they were young enough that they didn\u2019t know their cell number(s).  The hotel had a contact number in their system and eventually got a hold of the parents, who were drunk at a bar miles away. The hotel sent their van to go pick them up.",

Both of us ride motorcycle and both motorcycles belong to me, but my roommate rides one to get to work.\n\nShe accused me of using my second bike to get a defacto reserved a parking spot when nobody in the complex has one, and said that what I'm doing is not fair and it's cheating.\n\nI said \"Ok, I'll stop parking both my bikes in one spot.\"\n\nShe seemed satisfied with that and left.\n\nAn hour later I had all 7 of my motorcycles, 5 of them from inside the garage I rent but it's half way across the apartment complex, sitting in front of the apartment building taking up every prime parking space infront of the walk way to to my hall in the building.\n\nShe went to straight to the management to complain.\n\nThe management came out and knocked on my door.\n\n\"We can't have you using up every parking space\"\n\n\"Let me guess, Karen complained?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Yeah she told me I'm not allowed to have two bikes in one parking space to reserve a space. I'm not doing it to reserve a space. Both my roommate and I ride both of the bikes we park in that one space, all the bikes belong to me but I gave the keys to one of them to my roommate to ride for commuting to work. The other one is my bike for going where ever I need. We park both in one spot to be nice and conserve parking spaces so other people have somewhere to park. I was just showing Karen what would happen if I'm only allowed one bike per parking space. The other 5 bikes are generally in another parking space, in my garage where I keep the bikes I that *don't* ride frequently.\"\n\nThe apartment manager said \"I understand. You made your point and I'll talk to her, please put the other 5 bikes back in the garage.\"\n\n\"No problem\" I said.\n\nIt's been a few weeks, haven't heard from Karen.\n\n(EDIT)\n\nSince so many people are inventing details not in the story, assuming those details are true, and then getting upset over what they imagined, let me clarify something.\n\nThis happened at 1 in the afternoon on a day both my roommate and I had off. Most people are away at work during this time. What's more, with the exact topography of the apartment complex, there are only 2 apartments per walkway without going up stairs on my side of the building, but 4 on the other sides because it's up a level and the building is built into a hill. What this means is that MOST people park on the other side of the building, leaving  MOST of the parking spots in front of my building free and open except for very late at night.\n\nHow the heck do you think I took up the 7 closest spots with all 7 bikes if the parking lot was full of people trying to park? Think about it for just a second before you assume details that aren't spoken just because you want something to be upset over.\n\nBOTH BIKES are away from the apartment complex AT THE SAME TIME for a MINIMUM of 4 hours a day. We didn't engineering the situation where my roommate gets home between 3 to 4 in the afternoon and thus gets first pick of the parking spots. We also could both be driving cars instead of riding bikes. Then there'd be two spots taken up instead of 1. I could just choose not to rent a garage and park all 7 out there forcing people into overflow parking, but I don't.\n\nAlso the garage is beyond the overflow parking. It's not fair to expect me to always park in the garage and walk even further because you don't want to park next to my bikes and have all of 2 extra feet to walk to reach the concrete walkway to the building.",

            "This reminds me of a story I once heard. I can't find a link, so it may be apocryphal.\n\nThe story goes, San Francisco was trying to increase revenue from parking meters downtown, so they passed an ordinance saying only one motorcycle could be in each space on the street, instead of doubling, tripling, or quadrupling up as was normal.\n\nSo the riders coordinated to all bring their bikes downtown on the same busy weekday and each took up one space, filling up every space in the downtown area for miles around. As you can imagine, it was chaos because none of the car drivers could find street parking and had to opt for much more expensive garages, and/or driving around for hours looking for a space.\n\nNeedless to say the ordinance was repealed.",

            "In downtown Toronto, you can park multiple motorcycles in one on-street parking space, at a 45-degree angle, backed in, and none of the bikes need to pay for parking. \n\nWhere are you going to safety display your paid parking stub? It would either blow away, or someone would just take it for their own parking space.\n\nI asked a Cop about this, and he had to call into the station and ask for a parking enforcement staff member to confirm it. And it was confirmed. \n\nAnd yes, I took the officers badge number, and he recorded the interaction in his notebook, just in case the Parking Authority officer (we call them Green Hornets, cause they hover around and sting you with a fine and wear green uniforms) decides to give out tickets. Then we have some paper trail to fight the ticket. \n\nOccasionally, some do-gooder will squawk that we need parking passes. A quick mind your own business, it's legal, look it up, is not enough for these ass hats. But, we just walk away.",
            "At some point in the '90s, NYC decided to 'crack down' on motorcycles sharing spaces- apparently they felt these bikes were avoiding parking fees that the city was being cheated out of.\n\nIn response a huge mob of bikers descended on the City at 5am, and parked one to a space in midtown, effectively taking up all the parking. I participated, even though I didn't work in the city.\n\nIt was generally considered the only time that the Giuliani Administration backed down on a 'Law and Order ' policy.",

            "In a similar vein there is a motorcycle only designated spot in downtown Fort Worth. It's a fairly prime parking spot, you can back 5-6 bikes easily. As one could expect there is quite frequently a car parked there, it's a $55 fine but they won't get towed. \n\nI've heard more than one person complain about motorcycles parking in car spots. We still pay to park, I still pay for registration and insurance. Just because some dick bag can't read a sign and police won't tow them doesn't mean we're a lower class. I can park in the same spots as cars and when I do I'm going to do my best to make sure another car doesn't try to park in the same spot. \n\nI've seen people try to start fist fights over those spots.

            "I'm not a frequent driver (working from home since 2020), while my gf uses her car every day. So we decided to use a single spot for both cars, mine in front and hers at the back - the reasoning being: a) if we're both going somewhere we use her car; b) she's away every working day from the early morning until evening, so if I'm going somewhere alone her car won't be there to block mine; c) if I ever need to drive somewhere alone while she's home, I could always use her car. The cars were at a particular point in the lot where there is a \"shift\" in the spots, so my car was in the regular spot and hers was aligned with the next car in the lot, it was a perfect arrangement and nobody was inconvenienced by it. On the contrary, this way we didn't waste a parking spot.\n\nOne day I started noticing that every time both cars were away, a certain car would be in \"my\" spot when I returned. I would wait until the spot freed up and move my car there. This went on for a few months, until \"somebody\" called the police and had my gf fined for being parked irregularly. We explained the thing to the police guy and he removed the fine, because he understood that we were actually doing something good, but he advised not to do it anymore. That woman had probably called the police a dozen times over the \"irregular parking\" o\\_O",

            "When I was doing my Graduate Certificate, I had to travel down to Sydney for a week. I decided to ride my motorcycle down. Most of the week I left the bike parked at my B&B as it was easier to walk to my course. However, on the last day I rode my bike to the college as I had all my gear packed and ready to head home straight after the class. I parked it in a metered parking lot and went to get a ticket from the machine. There was a parking cop sitting on the curb having a smoke. When he saw me, he told me not to bother getting the ticket as there was no place to display it. I walked behind a hedge that separated the parking lot to buy a ticket.

Being a junior meant I was eligible for a \"C\" parking pass as opposed to the awful fringe parking passes that had parking lots somewhere in east jesus, with no bus service.  Problem was the parking office had me listed as a freshman, and also told me it would take about a week to sort anything out once I showed them my enrollment forms, showing that I was a junior.  Meanwhile, what I had noticed was that the interior parking spaces of the interior floors of the big parking garage were dim as heck.  (In hindsight, probably unsafe, but oh well.)  Also that the C stickers were the same red as the then Hardees drink cups.  Scissors, a cup, a Sharpie, and some tape later, and I had a passable parking sticker until the parking office saw fit to issue me a real one.

One day I was running late and it was raining really hard so I decided, screw it, I'm going to pay for parking in the parking garage right next to campus. The parking garage was for faculty and visiting families, not students, but there was no attendant, it was just the arm that raised up and down after you put in your ticket/money . When I was leaving I witnessed the car in front of me bump the arm slightly, and it just raised right up and the car proceeded without paying. The arm dropped back down and I slowly nudged forward and made contact with it, and it immediately shot up! From that day on I parked in the garage for free.

We had an open campus (meaning we could leave for lunch) and a popular lunchtime event was to go to McDonald's in a larger, nearby town. We had a 45 minute lunch period, and in 45 minutes, you could drive to McDs, go through the drivethru, and stuff your face on the way back.\n\nOf course, there was also a school cafeteria. However, this cafeteria wasn't actually at the high school -- it was at the middle school, and it served the middle school, the high school, and an elementary school, bussing students in to eat their lunch.\n\nMy senior year the administration set up a new schedule, and one thing that it did was shorten the lunch period by five minutes. Maybe not a big deal for some. But the folks that drove to McDonald's? You could do it in 45 minutes. You could not do it in 40.\n\nThey complained, it fell on deaf ears. So, someone (and I really wish it had been me) came up with a brilliant idea: eat at the school cafeteria.\n\nSo, suddenly, where about 30% of the high school students ate at the cafeteria, that number nearly doubled. The effect of this was that the elementary school, who ate *after* the high school, had to stand and wait because the cafeteria's schedule was based on how many students they expected to show up.\n\nSo we are eating in the cafeteria, and then nearly a hundred kindergarteners are just standing outside, waiting to come in. There wasn't anything the cafeteria could do -- they just didn't have the capacity for more students. And there wasn't anything the school could do, because they can't tell us not to eat at the cafeteria -- they're legally obliged to provide a lunch to the students that want one.\n\nIt was very effective, and they restructured the high school's schedule less that two weeks into the year to add those five minutes back so that they didn't have dozens of hungry five year olds.",

            "I loved the lunches at my middle school the first 2 years until they started busing and moved the classes around (late 1960's). The school had homemade sandwich buns and made their egg salad. Basically, any bread was made fresh, including pizza crust. I quit eating lunch room food when I found (gross out warning) the pudding I got was more a mass of hair with a bit of pudding on top. The kitchen staff wasn't happy since a \"black\" high school was broken up and school was made a middle school.",
            "One of my elementary schools, the lunch ladies actually cooked real food. The kitchen was down in the lowest floor of the building, the windows  would release delicious smells to the P.E. fields.  Think real homemade beef and noodles, chicken pot pie, vegetable soup and mild chili. The chicken noodle soup tasted so much like my grandma\u2019s, I thought they stole her recipe. And the desserts! Sheet cakes with actual fudge or vanilla frosting, pineapple upside down cake, and real puddings (especially the butterscotch)! This was early 1970s,  in the South.  And also edible vegetables, usually cooked from fresh, not canned. Real green beans (with bacon, this is the South), stewed tomatoes and rice, Fresh corn on the cob. Real corn bread. My mouth is watering now.  Fried chicken day was epic.",

            "Me and a group of friends, about 20 of us used to all eat at one table in high school. One admin took our table away because we were the weird kids and he didn\u2019t approve. We ranged from freshman to senior, and decided to eat in the un-used senior courtyard just outside the cafeteria. The first day he told us to come in and we explained that he took our table and we had no were to sit, he told us to split up. We went to his boss and they told us we could eat in outside thus begun the weird kids eating outside much to his displeasure.",

        "selftext": "I worked for a major (U.S.) telecommunications company for over 10 years.  One of the jobs I had there was as emergency overnight tech support for our major accounts.  I'm talking about accounts like emergency services, traffic lights, the FBI, NASA, and the White House (I personally fixed the White House Chief of Staff's phone twice).  All of this was handled by 11 people in a call center that was one of two in the country that were open all night (mainly for customers who were overseas).  Because we were such a small team, and the people we dealt with were the overnight I.T. people at their various companies, we were on a first-name basis with many of the techs who called us.\n\nThen, one day, the VP of our company decides to step down as VP and take a job as the head of another call center.  His brilliant idea is to make HIS call center the ONLY call center for all business and government accounts in the country--including the ones my team handled overnight.  Naturally, this meant dissolving my team.\n\nWe were all very upset.  We liked out job.  Only the absolute best techs got to be on our team, and for good reason.  When something we handled went down, it had to be taken care of FAST, and some of the systems we dealt with were so obscure or old, that no one at the company except us and our daytime colleagues even knew they existed.  This also meant that we had to be ready to answer at a moment's notice, so we spent most of the night doing nothing, just waiting for a call.  The companies and government entities paid extra for this quick response.  Even so, over the years, my team kept getting assigned more and more little jobs to do \"between calls,\" which we handled easily because, well, we were the best.  It was almost my dream job.\n\nSo when we get word that our jobs are going to this other call center that, until now, wasn't even open overnight, we were upset, yet most of my team was still pretty supportive.  We offered to train the new techs at the other call center, some of us even offered to travel there for a week or so to do it, but we were all turned down.\n\nOur last week on the job comes, and we're there mainly as backup for the new team in the other call center.  We're not being routed calls, but we're ready on chat if the new guys have any questions.\n\nThe questions start coming in, and they're NOT what we expected.  Instead of asking about obscure, outdated systems that no one but us even knew about, the new team is asking us about things like how to fill out a time sheet for a shift that starts before midnight and ends after.  And this was their supervisor asking me.  We end up answering really basic questions that anyone at our call center, much less anyone on our team, would have known, and we all got a bit worried.  Then the supervisor who asked me about the time sheets asks how many calls we typically get in a night, and I say \"oh, between two and five per person, usually.\"  Then he asks how many people were on my team.  \"Eleven,\" I say, \"Eight to ten on any given night.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" the supervisor says.  \"We have thirty-three.  I wondered why we were getting so few calls.\"  They didn't have to do the little tasks my team did between calls, either--they couldn't, they weren't even trained for the calls they were getting.\n\nThe next week, my team was transferred into the normal overnight call queue, handling boring calls from people who didn't read or listen to the directions we gave them about how to make their phones work while overseas.  Sigh.\n\nA week after that, other regular overnight reps start asking me and the other former elite reps questions about systems that only we would know about.  Suspicious.\n\nA few days later, I get a call transferred to me, and it's one of the overnight I.T. guys from the major accounts.  I ask how he got hold of me, and he says that the first guy he talked to transferred him to me.\n\nTurns out, of course, that the untrained reps at the new call center were still untrained, so they were just dumping the calls into my call center's general queue and hoping that out of the 60 or so techs working there, the one who'd pick up would be from the former major accounts team.  Since three of our eleven people had quit when our team was dissolved, the odds of that were pretty damn low, which meant it took multiple transfers, which meant they weren't getting the help they needed in the time frame my company was contractually obligated to provide.\n\nI went to the director of my call center to let him know about this, hoping it would mean that since the new team was failing THAT hard, the company would see reason and reinstate my team again.  Nope.\n\nMy director informed me that the team would not, under any circumstances, be reinstated at our call center.  I could tell he was not happy about this at all.  So then came the malicious compliance.\n\nMy director told me and every other overnight tech at my center that if we were transferred a call for a major account, we were not to touch it, as we were not authorized to handle those accounts.  The next night, the accounts wouldn't even open for us, because our \"security clearance\" had suddenly been revoked.  We were to transfer all such calls back to the correct queue.  We were also instructed to forward any correspondence sent to us from the new major accounts team to our supervisors, whether chat or email.  In a few days, the transfers to our center stopped.\n\nNow, I wish I could say that the company saw the error of its ways, my team was reinstated, and everything went back to the way it was, but it didn't.  Instead, the company hemorrhaged major accounts like crazy.  We lost accounts whose MONTHLY bills were in the millions of dollars due to our failure to keep the terms of our contracts.  Barely a month after it was created, the overnight team at the other call center was disbanded, and the jobs outsourced.\n\nThen the outsourcers started transferring the calls to my center.  Again, I went to our director, hoping against hope my team would be reinstated.  Nope.  But the transfers stopped.  Again.  And the company lost even more multi-million-dollar accounts.\n\nLast year, the company announced the layoff of tens of thousands of employees.  I wonder why...  I saw the writing on the wall, and got the hell out with the best severance package I could.  So did my call center director.  He was no fool, either.  All because some idiot executive had a \"bright idea\" and not even the slightest clue how to execute it.\n\nEdit:  Thanks for the votes and awards!  I especially love how people have listed basically every major telecom in the U.S. as a possible example of this level of idiocy.  Just goes to show that it's a systemic problem.  I was afraid people might find this story too boring or depressing.\nIt has a happy-ish ending, though, because thanks to my generous severance package, I am now able to pursue my actual dream job of being a professional writer.",

Instead of asking about obscure, outdated systems that no one but us even knew about, the new team is asking us about things like how to fill out a time sheet for a shift that starts before midnight and ends after.\n\nThis really struck a chord with me. I am recently going through something similar (though not anywhere near as prestigious). My company has just negotiated an extension of our contract with the client. Ink not even dry yet and they decide that they are shifting all UK based teams over to India (by that I mean they are firing all their UK techs and replacing them with Indian ones). We are expected to do some knowledge transfer, thinking it will be things like processes on this client, how the AD is set up, what jobs we do and how to go about them. Instead we get asked basic questions like how to reset a password (generally dealt with by frontline anyway so such issues should not come to us), how to do a profile reset. In one case, we even had to give them an entire overview of PSTools, and basic CMD commands (tracert, ping, net use, etc). \n\nSo we are going from a well trained team who are frequently one of the best teams on this client and replacing them with (from my experience so far) people who don't even know how to do basic frontline stuff, never mind second line. \n\nI suspect it is going to go to shit, the other teams are already in serious trouble (we have to have a weekly call with all teams, SDMs, ODMs, etc involved to go over every team's queue, see where they are going wrong, and try to fix it. Problem is, even basic stuff such as the strike process or putting the ticket on hold have an 80+% failure rate) and now they are replacing the second line team, and the incident management team, with a single Indian team (conflict of interest much? Incident management should not also be the second line support team). Sorry for the rant.",

        "selftext": "Not my story, written for dramatic effect but  not exaggerated or fabricated, TL;DR at the end.\n\n---THE BACK STORY---\nFather in law works for a heavy equipment manufacturer; highway making equipment, machines for gold and gem mining, etc. The machines aren't really relevant to the story; only that they're big and scary enough that everyone is VERY strict about safety. Well, almost everyone...\n\nThis company has one \"IT guy\", he does everything from web admin to the \nID badges to \"the printer isn't working\"...so obviously he needs an office with a computer. Only problem is, most of his job is keeping the ancient assembly line machines on life support; so he's constantly on the factory floor fixing error code TI-86 on machine C-137, etc.\n\n---THE PROBLEM---\nOne day, one of the VPs of ass-kissing deigns to leave the plush veneer of the C-level suites to enter the \"plebian\" office... and takes GREAT offense to the IT guy wearing jeans, boots, and a high-vis vest in their \"STRICTLY suit and tie\" office! Protests about his job duties fall on deaf ears; and since the IT department of one person doesn't have an official C-level officer, VP of ass-kissing decides to write a new dress code for the IT department. Suit and tie at all times. No exceptions.\n\nIT guy shows up the next day in a suit and tie, tries to fix an error on the factory floor, and (rightfully) gets turned away at the door  for lack of safety gear. He spends a few days in his office goofing off while the errors on the factory floor grow and grow.\n\n---THE FALLOUT---\nFinally, around 3 AM one night, BIG production line X goes down. This is a HUGE contract for the company; the company might go under if this client goes elsewhere! As such, emergency procedures state ALL C-level execs and even the owner MUST be notified immediately if this line stops at any time for any reason... so the upper echelon of the company (including VP ass-kisser) assembles in the board room to prepare for their firing spree!\n\nAround 5 AM, IT guy is ordered to the boardroom where they really lay into him before they fire him. Threats of blacklisting him in the industry, threats of lawsuits for damages, etc. Of course, there's the condescending \"Now what do you have to say for yourself?\" question.\n\n---THE MIC DROP---\nHe unfolds a few pieces of paper from his pocket and puts them on the table in front of the owner. \"THIS is why I have to wear a suit and tie no matter what, THIS was my objection because I have to do my job properly, THIS is the safety officer refusing me entry for lack of safety gear, and THIS is the record that VP ass-kisser got my e-mails but never responded.\"\n\nNot a pin drop or a cricket chirp could be heard, just the faint ruffling of pages as the owner read. Finally, he spoke. \"Your so-called dress code is officially revoked. VP ass-kisser is no longer allowed to have any authority over you. Please put on safety gear and fix machine TK-421.  The rest of us will stay here all day until I'm convinced that this problem will never happen again.\"\n\nVP ass-kisser kept his job (he was very good at his namesake, after all), but he was transferred to VP of a division that didn't exist and a workforce of one; only him. Rumor has it he's related to the owner somehow, but at least his self-righteousness can't ruin the actual work being done!\n\n---TL;DR---\nIT guy needs to wear safety attire to do his job on a factory floor. Random VP is furious he wears that gear in his own office, and makes a company policy requiring him and him alone to wear a suit and tie at all times. Policy backfires because IT guy can no longer fix the ancient manufacturing computers, and production screeches to a halt; potentially costing the owner his entire business.",

The order went out that all IT employees **had** to wear white shirt suit and tie. IBM style  clones.   Disciplinary and sackable offence \n\nWe protested to our manager but it was out of his hands. This was orders  from the very top down. \n\nBut then a couple of months later the managing director wanted to come and look over  his shiny new flagship contract. Through the airline we got him appropriate passes to visit all the parts of the airport  where the airline had IT that we worked on.\n\nHe turned up and we started the tour. Through the aircraft hangers with all the engineers wearing boiler suits. Clambered through the baggage hall with miles of dusty and oily baggage belts with  baggage handlers in work type trousers, polo shirts and safety boots. Visited the outside to head of stands with everyone else wearing inclement weather gear. Wandered through  Cargo hall  with pallets of goods being split and repackaged in a warehouse style area, again with everyone else in work clothes and boots.  And several more areas with no-one else wearing suits - because of course not. \n\nOnly after that whole tour, and somewhat disheveled, dusty, oily, salty and rather damp  did  we then take him  to the airline's admin offices with their clean, air-conditioned and carpeted areas   and  people working in suits and skirts. \n\nTo be fair to the man he followed us gamely (even enthusiastically)  and never once complained throughout the whole day,  but just days later there was a new instruction direct from his office that we could now use \"best judgment\" for what to wear according to the \"local environment\"",

But they kept coming onto my machines safety zone (Lines on the floor you are not supposed to pass without permission + safety gear) and even touching parts, so obviously I had to keep it powered off. Sounded like a sales pitch though, so I just kept quiet and looking busy.\n\nTeamlead: That's probably for the best. I'll do my best to keep the suits away so you can work.\n\nMe: Thanks.\n\n^(So I was testing a new feature in untested software on untested hardware, which has the possibility of quick and sudden movements.

I had a medium format camera and decent lighting kit - four light stands, off-camera metering, the works. As soon as a machine was completed and tested, they would call me across town to the plant to do the photos. On those days I would wear jeans to avoid ruining anything nice.  Sometimes the machine wasn't ready that day and I would have to wear jeans a second day - which for some reason infuriated my boss.  \n\nOne day she decided to accompany me on the shoot to show me that I could do this work in office casual.  Within the first hour, she had snagged her slacks on some raw steel and got grease on her nice shoes. She soldiered through. When I started breaking down the lighting she grabbed a cable to wind it up like a garden hose - between her hand and elbow. Because a factory floor is always covered in welding slag and forklift tire dust, I usually used a rag to wipe the cable as I hung it in loops to make a loose coil.  By wrapping it around her arms, my boss ruined her shirt and had so much grime on her hands and face she looked like a street urchin.\n\nThe next day she told me the jeans were fine and if I wanted, I could call it a day after a photo shoot so I could get a shower.",

        "selftext": "As the \u201cnew person\u201d at my job, I was told multiple times that I was expected to provide donuts for the entire office. Normally, that\u2019s not a big deal... but two people in particular were rude and relentless about the donuts all week. Others joined in also. Apparently, these people recently extorted two boxes of Krispy Kremes from someone else. \n\nExamples of the behavior  - mentioned buying donuts 20+ times, name calling, interrupted meetings, powered off my computer (losing my work), refusing to answer legit work questions until I buy donuts, on and on.  \n\nHere\u2019s the problem, I was hired in as a Sr., 30 years old, and I was not necessarily loving the idea of being told to buy donuts over and over. Hazing really did not seem appropriate at this point of my career (or for anyone else). I didn\u2019t want to be a \u201cbad sport\u201d my first week, so I played along. I politely said that I will not have time this week but will get to it eventually. In terms of the workforce, I was mature, but I was not very mature as a person overall. I needed a creative way to address this problem. \n\nOn my way to work, I decided to pickup a cheap bag of small powdered hostess \u201cdonettes\u201d donuts at the gas station.\n\nI distributed the donuts one by one, desk by desk, making sure to do so bare handed from the bag. I presented the donuts extremely politely, careful to mask my passive aggressive \u201cF U\u201d to the whole forced donut process.\n\nThe reaction from the staff was a lot of the \u201cdeer in headlights\u201d looks.  People had no idea if I was a \u201creally nice, but clueless\u201d person, or if I was totally saying \u201cF U\u201d to the entire donut idea. Most people took the \u201csafe\u201d choice of being pleasant in return. Some people tried to refuse, but I mentioned the \u201cbig deal\u201d about buying donuts, and still left a donut on every desk. \n\nI had originally considered providing a donut to everyone except the last two idiotic pushy people. I started verbally setting it up where they would not receive a donut. However, these two idiots were still openly verbally complaining about donuts, as adults. I could tell that this was not going to go away - they could not take a hint to back off.\n\nMy idea to passive aggressively snub them was no longer good enough. This had to be more direct.\n\nI decided I was 100% done with these guys, regardless of the consequences. I told them I had another idea.\n\nI grabbed a plastic knife from the breakroom, and cut the remaining donut in half the long (horizontal) way, so I still had two circles. The yellow cake was now visible. Then - the most brilliant idea of my life. A new way to hold donuts. One donut on each middle finger, with my middle finger in the center hole of each donut.  \n\nI stopped at both desks. The first guy had his choice of two half donuts on my middle fingers. That\u2019s right, I was able to give him a double donut middle finger. He now understood that I was completely done with his BS, but he never  grabbed a donut. I explained the donuts are actually quite tasty, and urged him to take one, but Im sure I looked like a complete psycho. I was no longer able to stay in character.\n\nThe good news - his refusal to take a donuts from my middle fingers ALSO allowed the opportunity to provide the last guy a double donut middle finger!! I mildly snapped, and had a shitty fake grin on my face. I looked him right in the eye. Double Donut middle fingers up, no longer saying a word.\n\nThe reaction of the last person is best described as completely frightened. That\u2019s right, I reached a complete breaking point over donuts, and scared the hell out of someone. \n\nAnyway, after this incident, I was never asked to buy donuts again.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nEDIT BELOW due to more responses than I expected, and I cannot reply to all.\n\nThanks for reading and the (mostly) great responses.\n\nFor the possible donut hazers, I don\u2019t know how to explain it further. These guys were way, way over the top. This was not normal office behavior. In fact, these guys were in trouble with management also. This is not a normal \u201cteam building\u201d this was two total idiots that pushed and pushed.\n\nI do not need you to go back YEARS to try and retroactively change my behavior. This was a \u201cmalicious compliance\u201d story that I thought was humorous enough to share, nothing more. I snapped, and acted crazy, but I\u2019m quite happy now in a good career and this was YEARS also.  It\u2019s all good now!! I do not need career advice here. Again, all good. In no way am I saying that I acted properly lol. In fact it was terrible office response, but I wasn\u2019t fired. I ended up taking another position 3 months later.  Some of the people in the office actually appreciated that I stood up to these idiots, so it was \u201cteam building\u201d in a way. There\u2019s definitely different ways I could have handled this, but it\u2019s over now. Even if I handed it differently, generally \u201cnice ending stories where nothing happens\u201d are not considered malicious compliance. Is that really what you were looking for here?\n\nI\u2019ve purchased food/etc for the office many times since. Ive had team building exercises. I\u2019ve never run into idiotic hazing like this since back then. \nAgain thanks for reading . I did not intend to annoy anyone that does FRIENDLY or NORMAL team building. That type of thing would not have caused me to snap, that\u2019s very normal.  \n\nOK. Signing off.",

If we hit that goal, each month, I want $200 in discretionary spending to use as incentive to have the staff keep it there.\u201d\n\nBoss agrees, you go to staff.\n\n\u201cI appreciate as your new manager, you feel like I owe you a little welcome aboard gift as is tradition. I\u2019ll do you one better. Help me raise this metric I\u2019m responsible for, and EVERY WEEK that we perform at this new standard, I\u2019ll buy you donuts. EVERY single week. But only if you can hit this new metric goal.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t a made up thing. I did exactly this working for a clothing retailer; the performance indicator we had to hit was based on our loyalty programs (email capture, rewards cards, and credit card sign ups) and we went from NEVER hitting the corporate target to smashing the target and being district leaders practically over night. \n\n(Wasn\u2019t just donuts though. We agreed on a $200 Visa Gift Card each month, which we spread to $50 a week to stock the break room with drinks, snacks, and suggestions from a clipboard we mounted in the break room)\n\nStill, incentives work.",
