        "selftext": "I'd like to preface this post by saying that both my ex and child are in a very comfortable situation - money has never been an issue and my kid is well looked after, fed and generally very well cared for. At no risk whatsoever.  I have also never missed a child support payment, nor do I intend to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy ex and I have been at odds for a couple of years now about the custody of our kid. She's repeatedly lied to the court, made fake reports to the police, filed for restraining orders, the whole 9. None of this has worked - I've been battling it by being consistent and defending myself.\n\nOne of her tactics has been to set her lawyer after me to demand every penny for every little thing.\n\nI started a new job back in January, with which came a nice pay rise. I told my ex of this, she did nothing - she would have received the increased child support payment following the next tax return anyway, so no bother. However, in the most recent conflict we had, her lawyer picked up on my \"change in circumstances\" and demanded that I adjust the child support payable with immediate effect, as opposed to at the end of the tax year. I am not legally obliged  to do this, however I comply - like I said, I'm happy to pay child support and it'll reduce conflict.\n\nNow here's the kicker. I've just received my annual pay rise: 2.1%.\n\nGiven my ex's stance that I absolutely must inform her of any change in circumstances, I have sent these details over. However this equates to roughly only $2 a month difference. What this has done, however, is cost her about an hour's worth of time with her lawyer to calculate the difference, at roughly $300/hr.\n\nThe time to recoup this legal cost with increased child support?\n\n12 and a half years.\n\n\nEdit: a lot of comments about 2% being only $2 so I only pay $100. No. My annual salary has been increased by 2%, not my child support payments. It just so happens to work out to a $2 difference. Believe me, I pay a LOT more than $100 a month!",

            "My ex is the same. She got a letter from her lawyer to avoid paying $30 towards a musical instrument for our son. They exchanged 3 e-mails plus he wrote the letter. He also charges well over $350/hour. ",
            "I'd like to ad a similar story\n\nSo for a while I was dating a girl who had a child and her baby daddy was a real jerk about child support.  From what I remember, support is calculated based on the difference in pay between the two parents.  It was a simple formula the court used there was no arguing what the amount should be.  She got a new job that came with a small raise.  This got him excited thinking he would get to pay less in support.  To get any change in support both parties share the last few pay stubs and support is recalculated.  When he takes her to court because of her raise he failed to realize that he had also got a raise since that last calculation and his support payment went up not down.  ",

            "So much yes! My uncle's ex was like this. Wanted EVERYTHING split, and even took him to court to get him to pay half on a car FOR HER because \"the girls will drive it someday\". The local family court had to finally tell her to stop filing for everything and grow the fuck up. I mean the lady would send receipts for vacations her and her new husband took the kids on, groceries, etc. Expecting him to pay half, since their divorce decree said that since they had 50/50 custody, they would split expenses related solely to the girls. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was a long 20 years for my uncle, and he's so far behind in his own life with his wife and kids because of this woman.",

            "My dad recently passed away and I been thinking about some things lately. I lived with both parents off and on after their divorce, I was passed between them and used as a bargaining chip so they could manipulate each other and try to get more money out of the others. I moved away when I was 16, went and lived with a friends family two towns over and commuted to school every day. I was lucky I got out when I did. My mom, she\u2019s a child - still at 52 she\u2019s a kid. She\u2019s never grown up, it\u2019s all about her. My dad was a tool, chain smoker, big man but weak minded and can\u2019t say no. I remember vividly when I was 7 after a Christmas play, they stood apart from each other and made me choose which one I wanted to live with. I picked my dad, and my mom got into crack and got an abusive husband, he put me in the hospital one evening when I was visiting - he cracked my head open by smashing it into the corner of a windowsill. I still have the dent in my head, I\u2019ll forever have the headaches. I don\u2019t talk to my mom much, my dads family hasn\u2019t contacted me in 18 years. Ugh, parents who only use the kid as a way to attempt to make life difficult for the ex is the saddest thing - you never realize who the REAL victim is.",

            "I'm not gonna comment on your choices or situation but it definitely rings a bell with me, too.  Ex cares more about screwing me out of visitation and kids no matter the cost.  I've always paid, I've paid when I was going to school and I paid when I got out.  I paid more, I paid more often, anything that needed to happen.  All she cares about is trying to screw the kids out of their father.  I did the \"malicious compliance\" and fighting thing one time when we were getting a divorce.  It cost us both tens of thousands of dollars we didn't have.  Now I'm all done with all that bullshit.  Be as petty as you want, I literally don't care about you.  Just my kids.  Helps me focus on the days where it seems like nothing is going anywhere with her.  Do what you can, stay strong.",

            "My ex and I divorced with two daughters in 2015. 50/50 custody, week on week off style, holidays are alternating except i get all christmas eves and she gets all christmas days after 10am.\n\nNo child support either way, we make similar amounts, within 3k a year or so. My only requirement is to carry the girls on my health insurance and we 50/50 medical bills and basically everything else.\n\nI was an awful piece of shit husband at the end, and she was an awful piece of shit wife, but we are good parents who love our children.",
            "When I got divorced, I used our state's online guide for calculating my support payments. I included my annual bonus and came up with a number. Their online calculator also said to not count what I paid for the child's medical insurance. It even had field where you filled in what you paid and it deducted it from the payment automatically. I talked to my HR department and they told me how much it was to cover just her. I pay a little over $400 a month for both of us and her part was like $230. So I said I was only paying $230 on their calculator. I took this amount and started paying.\n\nFast forward a couple of months and my ex's friends tell her that medical insurance shouldn't be included (even though everyone I talked to at the state and their website as well as websites of local divorce lawyers say it is). She kicks off an automatic re-calculation of child support with the state.\n\nI have no input in this process other than to try to dispute the results at the end. So the state contacts my company and they send over what the state asks for. My monthly wages and my insurance payments. But my bonus isn't part of my monthly wages (it's a fluctuating annual, non guaranteed bonus). And they ask for my total insurance, so they get the total that includes me (which is over $400 paid). \n\nSo my payments dropped a couple hundred bucks a month because she didn't think she was getting enough and her friends tried to tell her something that wasn't correct. I could've contested the results at the end, but I had tried to pay the other amount once and the state said otherwise. Who am to argue with what they found? \n\nBesides, that letter from the state saying \"support order contains a valid order for medical insurance coverage\" to prove her wrong after months of arguing that insurance is part of support was worth more than the financial savings.

            "I could be wrong about this as it was a long time ago and 5000 miles away, but I recall my brother was paying child support to his ex \"under the table\" for awhile. She, being one of the least likable people I've ever encountered, was demanding more. When she \"threatened\" to get the courts to rule on it, my brother was all for it - because it turned out he was paying her *more* than she was legally entitled to. Didn't work out how she'd planned.\n\n",
            "Reminds me of my friend's deadbeat dad not wanting to pay child support so he takes his mother to court and wins.  However, during the proceedings he notices that he owed about 10K in not paid child support. \n\nMy friend was 17, I'm pretty sure it wouldn't have amounted to that much even without lawyer fees.",
            "I worked in family law and dealt with a man who's ex girlfriend would file as many motions as she could come up with in hopes of raising his attorneys fees so high that he would just give up and give her what she wanted. (she wanted full custody and about 90% of his paycheck for child support.) It got to the point where she paid people to lie and say they saw him assault her to try to gain sympathy from a judge. In the end, her friends decided $100 wasn't worth the potential perjury charge and admitted they lied, she went to jail and dad wound up with full custody. He ended up racking in nearly $1,000,000 in attorneys fees. He didn't have to pay it all back as we gave him lots of discounts and he traded construction labor with the attorney and remodeled her house. \n\nAll these years later the mother has started up again. The child is ten now, hadn't seen his mother in years before she demanded visitation.  She showed up three times before flaking out and he(the child) is furious with her for doing this to him.",

Whenever he had a productive month,  he would give what he considered excess to his son, \n\nThe ex, however, got greedy and wanted even more, so she got a lawyer and went after him.\n\nNow my friend has to pay 200$ legally because he doesn\u2019t have a steady job, and rarely pays that \u201cextra\u201d",
            "One of my ex girlfriends was going through boot camp.  We had been dating for 4 years prior.  I went up for her graduation and we spent the day together.  She had told me that she will \"reward\" me for waiting the 3 months or what ever it was.  She rewarded me quite well.  Through the rest of the day she kept hanging out with her battle buddy and conversing with him more then me.  Being the naive moron I was, I thought it was just a bond they had formed.  Turns out it was a different bond.  I didn't find this out until I broke it off like 2 months later.  She had been a complete ass recently and I said fuck it, I ain't gonna be yelled at over the phone because I didn't call her the night before after working a 16 hour shift.  A week later she's engaged and pregnant.  A lawyer gave me a ring calling for child support, claiming that I had gotten her pregnant that day during graduation.  I got my own lawyer and fought it.  She continued to fight it for about a year.  Now, my lawyer was a close friend of mine, practically a family member so he was fighting this pro bono.  About a year into it after the kid was born, she requested a DNA test.  Test came back and proved she was having an affair with me while in the military.  She spent every penny she had, and proved that she had been cheating on me, in a court room full of both families, after a year of being full of herself.  My lawyer friend told me the outcome was better then paying what it should have cost me.  I'm actually now dating her ex best friend.  We had met during the court battles and hit it off when she bought me an apology beer.",

She married the other guy, \u201cex\u201d-gangsta coke dealer from CA.\n\nShe has gotten restraining orders, she lied in court documents about his income so he had to paid more, took away all visitation, had the two oldest (daughters) both get emancipated, she refused to show up to court hearings if he was present, and claimed all four children on taxes(against court orders for 21 years total from when the oldest were children to the two youngest who are still in  high school).

He was my step-dad for a long time but I never liked him. My mom\u2019s lawyer discovered my sibling\u2019s dad had been paying less in child support than what he was supposed to for all these years (his calculations were 32k less or something.). My mom tells him and he says he\u2019ll give my mom 20k, and give my sister 10k who is going to college. My mom says no and takes him to court. Well their calculations were off and he only owed her 16k. And now my mom has to pay court fees. ",

        "selftext": "  \n\nThis happened about 13 years ago. I was a field service engineer for a national retail chain. Basically, I was the IT guy who drove around in a company vehicle, servicing the computer networks in the stores. The way the company was organized, there were \u201ccorporate\u201d employees and then there were \u201cretail\u201d employees. Being a \u201ccorporate\u201d employee, I received corporate stock as a small part of my salary. And my starting pay was three times the rate of any store manager. Because I was always \u201cputting out fires\u201d I often found myself in the awkward position of dealing with store managers who honestly thought that they were the store owners, and that I was just the hired help\u2026\n\n(This was truly ironic, as I actually did own a very small piece of the corporation, whereas the average store manager did not.)\n\nOne day, I got orders to replace a server in a store not too far from my house (I worked out of my house, but kept parts in the truck...and also the back room of another store nearby). So I show up to the store where the server needed to be replaced. It was my 2nd stop of three scheduled that day. I walk in the store wearing my very obvious corporate uniform and name tag with logo. The store owner (errrr\u2026retail manager) instantly DEMANDS to know WTF I am doing in \u201cher\u201d store. I get this all the time, nothing new. I calmly explain that my boss wants me to upgrade one of the store servers (hardware replacement) and I even show her where it is that I will be working. I explain that it will take about an hour, and that the (POS) registers might go offline for about 5 minutes. \n\nShe isn\u2019t happy, but she reluctantly allows me into the room where the server is and I start working. When I\u2019m just about done, the (POS) registers go down as I am switching them to the new server, which is not fully hooked up yet. It was at this point where I realize I have forgotten to bring in a couple of cables that I need to finish hooking the new server into the store network. So I RUN out to the truck to get the required cables. I\u2019m gone about 2 minutes.\n\nWhen I get back the store manager is sitting at the table in front of the server, and she\u2019s got food spread out all over the table. The server is under the table. I tell the store manager I need to finish hooking up the server (gesturing under the table). The store manager tells me I\u2019ll have to come back in an hour, after her lunch break. I\u2019m shocked into total silence. Then a cashier bursts into the room, panicked that the registers aren\u2019t working\u2026and the checkout lines are getting backed up.\n\nI explain to the manager that I have to fix the server now, or the registers will not work. The manager tells me I should have thought of THAT before I started working in her lunch break area\u2026\n\nI calmly tell the store manager that she\u2019ll have to take a break later, or find somewhere else to eat her lunch. She tells me I\u2019m rude and incompetent and DEMANDS to speak to MY MANAGER, immediately.\n\nHokey Dokey\u2026\n\nI call up my manager using my corporate-issue iPhone, and quickly explain the situation, and then walk into the server room to hand the iPhone to the store manager. While she\u2019s on the phone with my manager, I head out to the front of the store to explain (and apologize) that the registers are going to be down for a few more minutes. I can\u2019t hear exactly what the store manager is telling to my manager, but I can tell that it\u2019s a heated conversation and I clearly hear the word \u201cfired\u201d mentioned a few times. It\u2019s clear that the store owner (errrr, retail manager) wants me to be fired for daring to try to interrupt her lunch break. Unfortunately for her, my direct supervisor was about 5-6 levels above the retail district manager. So the store manager was complaining loudly about \\*interrupting my work\\* to the manager of her manager\u2019s manager\u2019s manager\u2019s manager\u2019s manager\u2019s manager.\n\nA few minutes later the store manager walks out of the room awkwardly balancing bits and pieces of her lunch spread. I immediately go back to work getting the new server up and running and re-booting the POS registers so that they will sync on the new server and cashiers can get back to work! Everyone is happy now except the store \u201cowner\u201d, because her lunch break was ruined. \n\nThe main part of my task is done now, but it takes me about another 15 minutes to clean up my mess and re-organize my truck to get ready for my next stop which will be about a one-hour drive from my current location. As I\u2019m doing this, I see the retail district manager (I\u2019ve met her before) going into the store. She walks back out of the store with the former store manager, who is carrying a box of her personal items.",

            "When freshly installed as a supervisor I had my entire labeling and inventory tracking systems go down at 3:30am on a weekend. I wasn't familiar with the \"movers and shakers\" associated with IT at the time, and my production floor was getting a bit beat up with parts(around 25k parts per shift, 30-ish operators) so I hail-Mary'ed the IT group email.\n\nGot a response from CORPORATE CEO the SEE-E-OH of it all. A billion dollar company. He explained that the outage was from Mt. Olympus and I should have been informed of it by my managers and things would be back before 6:00am. When I saw who he copied in the email I just about shit myself. My plant manager, HR manager and my direct manager....none of which were terribly happy that I had poked the biggest bear of them all.\n\nI met said CEO a little later and he was a sweetheart and got a good chuckle out of my description of my reaction when I saw his email back to me. I think he likes to rattle the cages of the despotic manager types at his companies. I now have a direct manager that will answer the phone at any time, any day when he sees my name pop up. I don't know what the CEO said but it sure left an impression.",

            "I was mostly with you until you got greedy at the end.  That this single incident would lead to her firing without any formal report or investigation is not believable - corporations like this have specific procedures in place to minimize liability when an employee is terminated, and those procedures wouldn\u2019t be circumvented because she pissed off one manager, no matter how far up the corporate chain they are. Even if this was a fireable offense - which for most companies it wouldn\u2019t be - the turnaround simply wouldn\u2019t be this quick.\n\nTo say nothing of the fact that the odds that her district manager was able to drop everything in the middle of the day *and* was within a half hour or so of the store are pretty slim to begin with.",

If I were the manager and some stranger came in wanting access to anything containing store data, I don\u2019t care if they have the store logo tattooed on their forehead, I would be on the phone to corporate in a hot second while a trusted employee babysits the stranger, not letting them out of their sight. I would always give corporate a piece of my mind for their sloppy security procedures.

You\u2019re a hired hand, a cowboy riding the line, assessing the herd, mending fence and making sure things are kept up the way the owner/corporate wants it.  You are no more an owner than a store manager is (if they are employees rather than franchisees), who very well may be getting profit sharing and stock options.  \nThe main fault lies in corporate\u2019s sloppy management and your hubris.

If you tried to take a nap during his class he would just keep talking, walk over to the ammonia bottle, wet a rag, and drop it beside your head. All while acting like nothing was going on.\n\nCharlie, for quite some time, would let students have fun on the last day before break - until the principal told him that he HAD to teach the kids something. So he complied. He set up an experiment for that day. The ingredients included: sucrose, glucose (in solution), protein pellets, and (I had to look it up) 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-benzaldehyde.\n\nAs the students happily performing their experiment, the principal sticks his head in the door to ensure that Charlie is actually having them do something productive and is happily surprised. Charlie fills him in on the experiment (in big scientific words). As the principal is about to leave, he remarks, \"why does it smell like peanut brittle in here?\"\n\nAnd every year after that, we made peanut brittle on the last day of class for the semester.",

We had one guy who could really get it running well and turn out nice looking pieces.\n\nWhenever he would be out sick for a day, or god forbid, go on vacation for a couple of weeks, the production manager who had the brains of a ferret would start optimizing the process.  He would crank the temps on everything up and speed the conveyor up.  He would be happy as a pig in sh\\*\\* until QA had a look at the boards,  Normally most of them would be fine and a few would get little red arrow stickers pointing at things the folks in re touch would have to fix.  And most of the boards would pass test and troubleshoot.  Not after he tuned it though.  Every board would have tens of things that needed to be cleaned up by hand and many of them would fail on test and troubleshoot, and they sucked because most of the time it was not component failures, but solder splashes, some of which could take a long time to find.\n\nHe got 20% more boards over the wave and he had like a 70% failure rate that cost much more than just doing it right the first time.",

Other guy works at 1/5th the speed, meaning one part takes 5 hours, but he never has errors.\n\nWith a 1 in 10 failure rate, that means on average 9 parts take 1 hour and the 10th takes x hours.

It's still manual labour, so eventually you'll get up to speed, but this time without placing people who will use these parts in risk by your \"fast\" approach. Just raise the price for your work",

            "Salaried vs hourly trade offs are crazy, are there salaried positions in your field? If so, that might be an option where your skill would be valued more than just the number of hours put in.\n\nSalaried: get paid the same amount regardless of hours (although still expected to work a minimum # of hours), incentives based on meeting performance metrics not hours. Downsides: if you need to work more hours to meet the metrics, you don't get paid more. Upsides: stability, valued for skill over seat-filling (in theory anyway).\n\nHourly: get paid the same per hour regardless of effort (although still expected to produce a minimum quality), incentives based on number of hours worked. Downsides: less stability, may have required overtime, situations like this post happen all the time. Upsides: overtime pay. \n\nEither one can get exploited - in a salaried position you can get told 'produce X results, by next week' and if that means that you end up working an 80 hour week that's tough shit.

        "selftext": "My job is 12 hour shifts with a flexible start time. You must show up before 7, but you can start as early as 6 if you want, and most people opt to show up before 6:30. The last person is usually in before 6:45. We let people go home at the end of shift on a first-in-first-out basis. In theory you should be able to go home after you've worked your 12 hours, but in practice there is usually a disparity of arrival times between the outgoing shift and the oncoming shift. For example, I may have started at 6:15 as the 4th person in, and I'm relieved by the 4th person in on the next shift, but that person might show up at 6:45, making me stay 30 minutes late. I can't complain to that person because it's their right to show up at 6:45.\n\nI talked to my supervisor about this because it had been happening pretty frequently. She said the company won't pay me for the extra time because, according to her, it's my choice to arrive earlier than 7 and that's just the risk I take in being early. She also said she's not willing to move any people around to cover my role to get me out on time, even though they regularly do that to let people take unscheduled bathroom breaks and do training. She said it'd be different if I wasn't relieved by 7 because someone is really late, but before 7 they don't care.\n\nSolution? I show up at 6:59 now. I'm always the last one in. I leave later than everyone, but I'm also guaranteed never to work a single extra, unpaid minute. It also means that the person I relieve is having to stay late because again, the last person usually shows up before 6:45. It *also* means I usually get relieved earlier than 12 hours. I still have to stay in the building until I reach 12 hours (tracked with badge cards), but ultimately they're still paying me for 10-15 minutes of wandering hallways or reading a book.\n\nSo basically they went from regularly stiffing me 15-30 minutes of pay to regularly having to pay me to do 15-30 minutes of nothing.  \n\n[edit] a lot of people are asking about the unscheduled bathroom breaks. Probably sounds worse than it is. So we get 15 minute breaks every 90 minutes, and generally if you have to use the bathroom, that\u2019s when you go. You have about 8 opportunities throughout the shift to do it. And then on top of that, you can still go between breaks if you really need it. That\u2019s what I mean by unscheduled. We get paid on these breaks, it doesnt deduct from the 12 hour time card.",

            "Same thing happened to me. \n\nPrevious job, I was a supervisor, and not technically allowed to \"work\". So I'd come in an hour or two early, punch in, get everything shipshape and organized for the day, and then when my staff came in I'd revert to my supervisory duties. I also never took breaks as I found they interfered with my day.\n\nStarted a new job, and started doing the same thing, but I noticed I wasn't getting paid for it. I was in shipping, so the extra hour or two early meant that we could have our freight at customers' doors right when then opened, as they often requested. We'd also have trucks call and ask if I could wait around an hour or two after hours because they'd been held up at the border or whatever. Otherwise, we'd be paying them to sit overnight in the yard until we came in the next day.  Did this for about a year, and eventually went in and asked if I could be compensated for the extra hours I was putting in. I didn't mind the extra hours, but it was pretty irritating to be surrendering time with my family for free. \n\nThey told me it was my choice to stay beyond my scheduled hours (even though I was saving them a ton of money by doing so), and that they wouldn't compensate me for it. \n\nSo, from then on every single punch card I had read 7:59 am - 4:30 pm and I took every single break available to me, whether I wanted it or not. There were plenty of times where our service team would call and ask if I could stay 15 minutes extra to wait for a truck or get a load out because a customer was dying for it *right now*, and my answer was always, nope, you do it - my day ends at 4:30. Quite a few times I walked away as trucks were backing up to the door at 4:30, and many times customers were SOL on early morning deliveries.\n\nWhy? Is it because I have a bad attitude, or don't care about customer service? Hell no - I've always gone above and beyond at every job I've had. \n\nIt's because I'm not a goddamn slave and I'm not giving up time with my kids to work for free. \n\nHappy to say I don't work there anymore.

Yes, the first-in-first-out rule was a thing, but sometimes you'd encounter a situation where you relieved someone at 5:30-5:40 to \"be nice to them\", and you'd pay for it 12 hours later when the person you were being relieved by (who may not have *always* been the same person you relieved) had the philosophy of getting in at 5:57. It got to be frustrating, and some of us eventually got a little petty about it; if we were relieved \"late\", we'd pointedly say \"*See you in 12 hours*\", and make sure that we didn't show up until precisely 12 hours had elapsed. That often didn't work because someone else would end up relieving our counterpart, and their behavior of arriving \"late\" and getting to leave early would just be reinforced. Sigh.",

Here's a general rule of thumb for everyone. \n\n\n\nIf you're paid salary you are usually classified as \"exempt\" meaning you are exempt from overtime laws. It's *supposed to be* a mutual understanding that that means you may be required to work overtime and you may not be, but that you're compensated fairly to cover the occasions where you need to stay late. \n\nHourly employees are classified as \"non-exempt\" meaning they are subject to overtime laws, and anything that they do over 40 hours, or more than 8 hours in a day depending on the state they are in, they are to be paid additional wages.\n\nNow there is a loophole here: if it's the company's policy that anything over your scheduled shifts won't be paid accordingly, and it's written down in either your offer letter or in the handbook that you received, then your basically SOL because they made the policy known prior to your employment and you agreed to those terms when you onboarded. \n\nThis is just a layman's explanation to give people a general understanding of their rights.

        "selftext": "I work in a highly specialised field, where it's very difficult to find and train suitable personal. By pinching pennies and not holding his promises about pay grade changes, my boss successively drove away the three specialists working in the department I led. Right before the last one put in her notice, he argued that a 2 person department didn't justify a leadership position and demoted me, and we were integrated (on paper) to another department. This was done outside of any legal framework and with a one week notice, which is illegal.\nDuring the reorganisation, the manager of the department we joined was assigned to R&D, and another manager and his deputy promoted to lead the department's daily business. We effectively had no less than 3 supervisors, all of them lacking managerial training and technical knowledge about the duties of our now defunct department (and only one of them can read the language in which 50% of our reports are written).  \nRight after the reorganisation, I was granted one last meeting with the boss, where I pointed out that several of my duties cannot be bestowed upon the mere foot soldier I had become, nor taken over by the new leadership. He answered that his decision was final, I was to revert to my previous job description and take up any future matter with my new supervisors.\n\nI did just that, and some more : I read the state law and ordinance about state and university employees (should have done it earlier, in hindsight). I discovered that :  \n- the illegal move by my boss doesn't carry any penalty, so there's fuck all I can do legally  \n- I'm allowed to take on private mandates for anything that is not explicitly mentioned in my job description (it's a gift normally meant for professors)  \n- I get to take up to **15 days of additional paid leave** per year to hold a public office  \n- the pay grade I reverted to doesn't match my responsibilities today, even excluding the absence of leadership position, and there's an independent procedure with state HR to reevaluate the pay grade  \n  \nThe kicker ? My old job description that dates back to 7 years before is short, to say the least : 3 lines that don't even cover 50% of what my duties in the last seven years consisted of. And I have a side gig as a retained firefighter and fire instructor for which I used to take vacation days. This counts as a public office according to state law.  \n  \n*The fallout*  \nMy new managers both signed the authorisation to take on private mandates and public office without understanding the implications. I used all of the 15 days, where I legally get paid by the FD and my employer at the same time. I took on several private mandates totalling nearly an additional month of salary for 4 days of work. And the pay grade reevaluation has brought me back to the same income as with the previous leadership position. Oh, and since my speciality now has a bus factor of one and my new supervisors have been unable to staff the open positions, it was very unlucky that I fell ill at the time where I had to submit paperwork for a research grant, costing the institution 30'000$ in lost research funds.  \n  \nTL:DR : my boss demotes me and dissolves my team. I find several legal loopholes that allow me to work less and get more income, without my boss even noticing and with the naive blessing of my new leadership.\n\nEdit : I used the expression \"private mandate\", which is a direct translation of the state law legalese and seems to confuse a lot of you. Think of it as taking the contract in my name, as opposed to in the institution's name, and working on it outside of my regular hours. It's not exactly like a contractor though, because as a  member of the institution, I'm still bound by some rules that don't apply to contractors.  It is very weird and would not be possible if the transition had been planned and managed properly, with an update of my job description for example. /u/Dif3r explained it well :  \n>Faculty at universities will sometimes consult on the side. I've heard of engineering and marketing professors doing design or doing research and writing internal white papers for companies before. Or collaborating on a research project under their own name/lab as opposed to the universitys \"brand\". \n\nEdit 2: some of you were hung up on the lost research fund, so I want to clarify 2 things :  \n1) this was no part of the MC and I really caught a potentially serious disease. But since I had been warning for months about the lack of substitution or cross training, this came as a vindication  \n2) no grad student or junior researcher were impacted. It just erased part of what the institution gained in not staffing the open positions",

He would then get paid his normal salary in addition to fees for holding the classes. Since there are a lot of laws that govern how these offices are run I'm pretty confident he made a concerted effort to know them and take advantage of them where he could. He certainly knew them better than the head of the department. In a pretty chaotic office he was a steady dude who knew how to play the game.",

I was convinced to become manager of sales support because I had sales experience.  Find.  Same salary, etc.  However.... I was reporting to the guy who took over my product line.  Strange because in the past, sales support managers reported to the vp of sales.  OK.\n\nThings went along and I started getting more and more work piled in on me - work that was supposed to be done by the product manager.  I kept on keeping on.\n\nOne day, my new \"boss\" came into my office and sat down and told me I needed to clean my desk off at the end of every day.  \n\nThat was it.  I quit on the spot.  At the end of the week, I was escorted from the building by a security guard.  \n\nA month later, I returned to the company for some reason or other and the guy who replaced me greeted me with  kiss on the lips.

Anything that had their logo/letterhead on it, he shipped out. His department also did the internal mail for their national headquarters. They laid off 2/3 of his department, told him and the other employees that in 4-6 months they would all be laid off, and said no more overtime. He and his department worked exactly what they should and not a minute more. Funny thing is that after a couple of months someone from the international office flew to his office just to ask him what his job was. When he finally got laid off, he started work at a company right across the street that was contracted to do the job he was doing for the original company. The new company had him doing exactly the same job with more pay and benefits while allowing him to have much more flexibility.

        "selftext": "So in my early 20s (21) I start working as a Phlebotomist (I drew blood in a large hospital). I had just moved and knew no one and also just didn\u2019t know the area/city. I worked evening shift 1300-2130. After completing the training I was put on my normal shift with my fellow workers who to my surprise were all my age or younger. We became fast friends! Great peeps!\n\nFast forward a year, our shift is the busiest shift for STAT draws and Traumas in ER, the pace is tough but we\u2019re great friends and we handle it and help each other out a lot. All the hospital staff for the most part know us and love us for our hard work and professionalism. \n\nOur boss let\u2019s call her Karen, solely works day shifts and has no idea really what it\u2019s like on our shift. She loves to nit pick about silly things and she doesn\u2019t feel like she is accomplishing anything unless she is telling you where you\u2019re wrong and how you can improve. \n\nOur shift is 3 guys and 1 girl, we all dress in scrubs with a T-shirt underneath. We usually wear any kind of T-shirt as long as you can only see a solid color and it matches/ looks ok. \n\nKaren one day notices and reminds us all that the handbook specifically says that our undershirts have to be white, and that with colored undershirts we are very unprofessional. \n\nI make a remark about all of crazy colored/printed/ graphics of the scrub tops on dayshift( who are all female) and how I don\u2019t think having our undershirts are any more unprofessional than a spongebob scrub top. She explicitly says they are permitted in the handbook but our undershirts were not and we better fix it ASAP and the next person to show up to work without a white undershirt will be sent home to change. \n\nSo later that night I have a solid idea and propose it to my awesome evening shift cohorts, let\u2019s all go out and buy white undershirts, along with the most outrageous and ridiculous scrub tops we can find. My idea is praised and we all go shopping after work. \n\nThe next day me meet in parking lot and all walk in together, my buddy Jonas is sporting a black scrub top covered in vivid red smooching lips, Will is looking very professional in a white top with strawberry shortcake cartoon images all over, and I\u2019m wearing a baby blue and pink Dora the Explorer scrub top, all with white undershirts. \n\nWe walk in and there is lots of laughing and yelling and we draw a crowd in the lab, in walks Karen. Her face turns red as we proudly display our commitment to professionalism and our 100% handbook dress code compliant outfits. She mutters a thank you and scurries off to consult the director who is awesome, the director laughed and said \u201cwell, you won Karen, they\u2019re compliant\u201d \n\nWe became famous all across the hospital for our Malicious Compliance and occasionally wore our fun scrubs to work for the rest of our time together.

            "I used to work in a creamery that sold cones or cups by the scoop, prepackaged half gallons, or hand packed pints and quarts.\n\nIt always annoyed me when people purchased by the pint or quart, because hand packing hard ice cream is torture on my wrists. Also, it took a long time and held up the line that was mostly people wanting 2 scoops on a cone.\n\nMost of the time, people who purchased pints or quarts were requesting unpopular flavors that didn't come in half gallons, but we had one repeat customer who swore she got more ice cream in 2 quarts than she would get in a half gallon, because we hand pack it.\n\nI tried packing her quarts as loosely as possible so when she opened the quarts at home she'd be disappointed and finally buy half gallons, but it just made her come back sooner and insist that we pack it better.\n\nOne day I told her my opinion and begged her to just buy a half gallon. I pointed out it was literally cheaper to buy a half gallon than a single quart, so she was wasting her money. She explained that was because the half gallons were filled by a machine but the quarts were filled by me, so I should be happy she's paying me instead of the machine.\n\nI said, \"I get paid by the hour regardless of what you order, even on days that you don't come here. Either way, I collect your money, put it in the register, and the owner of the company gets the profits. Not me. If you want to pay me directly, I have a tip jar right there.\" She argued that the more time it took me to fulfill her order, the more I'd get paid.

The ice cream was made in batches and frozen in 3-5 gallon metal containers. You could get them for parties and stuff but not by just going to the window and placing an order. They needed atleast some notice to prepare/pack as ice cream wasn't made everyday. You also needed to return the metal containers or you'd lose your deposit. \n\nI assume the place you went splits basic flavors into single gallons when making the ice cream to avoid the scooper having to pack a gallon by hand which could be brutal for them and time consuming during a rush. You order that stuff ahead of time and we'd throw in the cups/spoons/cones and maybe even some sprinkles...\n\nAlso, despite being technically correct four hand-packed quarts likely sells for more than a gallon would. We could also pack them light or heavy depending on the customer interaction. Our large ice cream cup (to-go) was a 16oz drink cup with a lid. 16oz is a pint, but a pint was way more expensive (and packed heavier).",

        "selftext": "When I was in college I took a class with this gem of a professor. On the first day of class he asked how many people thought they would make an A. This being a tough engineering school where a C actually was average, something like 5 students out of a class of 60 raised their hands. He then announced that's how many A's he would give out that semester.\n\nAll of our tests for that class were multiple choice exams we took online. We were allowed to refer to our notes during the test and we were allowed to study from old tests as long as we didn't refer to the old tests during the exam. Fair enough.\n\nI studied for the first test but didn't have access to any old exams so I did fine but not great. By the time the second exam rolled around I had made a friend who was in a fraternity that had multiple copies of old exams from this professor. We and a couple of others took advantage of the rule allowing us to study from old tests. We quickly discovered that on these 50-question tests the professor had a repertoire of about 75 questions he pulled from. On the first copy of the test we studied from we took the time to work through the answers to make sure we understood. By the time we got to the 4th copy we could answer before we even finished reading the question.\n\nExam time rolls around and, just as with previous years, he pulled from the same pile of questions. I think it took me 12 minutes to answer everything correctly. In hindsight I probably should have let the clock run for a bit (we had an hour) but I went ahead and submitted it because I had other things to do. I checked in with the others I studied with the next day and all of them had gotten 90%+. Sweet, definitely using that plan for test 3 and the final!\n\nThe next day we all received an email from the professor letting us know we were being reported to the Dean for an honor code violation. He claimed he had never had anyone make better than an 80 on one of his tests before, so the fact we all made 90%+ was clear proof in his mind that we cheated.\n\nThis being an engineering school we were all nerds who were pretty scared about receiving such an email, but we agreed the best course of action was to talk to the professor before he went to the Dean to tell our side of the story and see if we could sort things out. We reached out to him and he agreed to meet with us after class.\n\nWhen we met with him and laid out our case he was surprisingly receptive to our explanation; I think in reality he didn't want to go through with the hassle of reporting us to the Dean. So we left the meeting feeling pretty good and agreed within our study group we would keep studying from the old tests.\n\nWell, about a week before test #3, this guy announces to the class that because some of us had found the previous test so easy, the next one would have twice as many questions in the same amount of time. Being the cheeky SOB I am, I asked him as I was leaving class what would happen if someone made a 100 on this test. \"God help you on the final\" was his response.\n\nSo we used the same approach in studying for the test and found the same pattern of a limited set of questions. Of course, in addition to the extra questions he had promised all of the questions on this test would be new. So while we again got to the point we had the questions and answers memorized, we tried to make sure we understood the concepts as much as possible to deal with what we expected to be his wrath.\n\nTest day comes around and lo and behold 87 of the questions are pulled directly from old tests. 10 are from a guest lecture where he basically pulled the question and answer directly from the slides, and 3 were filler questions like \"1 + 1 =\" and \"The Earth revolves around the Sun, True or False.\" I knew I had everything right. I also knew I didn't want to screw myself and everyone else for the final. I purposely answered the filler questions incorrectly so if he looked at the results he would know what I had done. I got my 97. I never heard from the professor about that third test, but I like to think of him rage scrolling through the results.\n\nI don't remember details about the final, but do remember the format being the same as what had been announced at the beginning of the semester. My study group also worked together on a group project which we also made A's on, so if he really only gave out 5 A's that semester, we received them all.\n\nEdit: 1 hour in and this is by far my most upvoted post and my first awards.

            "This is actually really fascinating story about the interaction between hard work, privilege, and broken systems.\n\nLike, the fact is that OP and his friends were extremely smart, competent, diligent people. He humbly tells the story like he found an exploit, but the fact is they spent an incredible amount of time studying and learning the material and working together and memorizing hundreds of questions. Most people would likely not have been able to pull this off even with the previous tests.\n\nOn the other hand, they were able to use their personal connections to get access to a study guide that was essentially 5x better than any other study guide.  Why TF did this happen??  Is previous tests were fair hand, couldn't the professor just have made them available??  Why does a random subset of the class get access to a monumentally better guide for essentially no reason?\n\nThen there's the fact that the grading system is shot to begin with.  \n\nSo OP & friends needed BOTH hard work AND privilege to win at this 'impossible to ace' class.\n\nIt's like, I dunno.. an especially sharp example / microcosm of his this dynamic works.",

She made sure that we knew the concepts so even if some of the questions were new/different, we could figure it out.\n\nHer final exam was pretty much setup as the AP exam (timed sections, extra white paper if we needed the extra space, ect). She graded us in the same style (1 - 5 with 5 being the highest, 3 as passing, and 1 as failure). I was the only student with a 4 with everyone else at 5.\n\nIt freaked me out a bit when I actually took the AP test, but push come to shove, I received a 5. I can't thank that teacher enough.",

The department only offers class 1 in the fall, class 2 in the spring, and you need to pass both class 1+2 to take the senior project class next year. There are rumors that people changed major after failing class 1. \n\nThe teacher would curve the overall grade so top 10% (2-3 students out of 20) got A. Professor is a weird guy. He held the final a week ahead of the schedule and use the university assigned final time slot to discuss grade with students. It is his tradition and he has it on syllabus on day 1. Basically, students line up outside his office, come in for a 1-on-1 session where he asks everyone the same question \"here is your grade, you are at the borderline of 2 letter grades, tell me why you deserve the higher letter grade\". Students hate him because they thought he enjoyed playing with their minds.\n\nI made above 90% for class 1 without the curve so my session with him went well but 4 people didn't make it to the second class. There was a guy who failed the class the previous year and barely made a D in our class. We were in the study group together and he couldn't get the subject as fast as us. Final time came and we worried for our friend so we hatched a plan. We gathered the average of our class, simulated the final grade, and realized that the top people need to not perform so there would be a larger curve that benefit people with lower grade like my friend. With that, I purposely left the answer for question 1 blank and ended up with the overall grade of 85.6%.\n\nThe grade discussion date came and I asked to be the first one to talk with the Professor. He asked whether I see the page with question 1 on exam date and gave me 5 minutes to solve it for half of the credits. I declined the offer, showed him our grade simulation and our proposed letter grade cut so it followed a Cauchy-Lorentz distribution. The professor laughed hard at the end of the presentation and asked me to email the grade simulation to him on the spot. Later, I was informed (by my study group) that everyone got the proposed grade on the simulation. My friend made a C and graduated next year with us.",

Third test was all problems from the book that he had recommended we do and not one question from the old test. I bombed that exam.",

I had a feeling that taking the final at our place of work cost everyone one letter grade. \n\nIn one other case, high school biology, we got a long term substitute that asked for our opinions on his teaching in a questionaire very close to the end of the year. I honestly gave a scathing opinion since he taught off of index cards, but while turning the paper in down the row a fellow student signed my name to mine. I asked why he was laughing and he told me. The teacher made a comment about my honesty filling out the questionaire preceding the next class. It cost me a letter grade, or two, as I had virtually memorized the book.",

Professors do not supply their old tests as a study guide, but they do assume students have access to them, and adjust difficulty and grading accordingly. Students who are not part of that fraternity get the harder tests, but not the specialized study materials, then likely suffer lower grades. \n\nFraternities set their own entry criteria, often involving a pledge term, typically charge extra money, and at least at the college I went to have incredible independence from school oversight because frat alums are on the school board of directors\n\nNot a criticism of OP, just trying to highlight entrenched institutional unfairness",

No midterms no final no quizzes just 4 tests that are open book open note.  There were about 40 kids in the class.  Myself and my fraternity brother and 3 guys from another fraternity were who I knew on day 1.   Well as we are about a week away from test 1., we went to our fraternity archives.  We found a test from two years ago from a Roger who was our bar manager.  Not our brightest brother.  We looked at the questions first and were worried since we didn\u2019t even understand the questions.  We open up the blue book answer sheet and he got a 100.   In fact, he got a 100 on all 4 tests.  We go back farther and there is another set of exams from 2 years before that and another and another.  We found 4 sets of identical exams over a 13 year period.   So on next class we ask the other fraternity guys if they know what the tests are like.  They laughed and said we just found out last night and we\u2019re going to tell you guys.  So we take the test. Exactly as we expected.  So 10 minutes into test, someone gets up and asks a question. The professor tells everyone an explanation of what question 1 is looking for.  So everyone in class starts writing that down.  Everyone but us 5 in fraternities.  Same thing for each question.  So next class he gives out the results.  First kid got a 20, the next a 25 then a 15 all grades woefully failing.  Then he gets to us 100, 100, 100,100,100.  After the first test we get to know more people in class.  By the second test over half the class has the old exams. So over half the class gets a 100 and the rest fail miserably.  The third test comes but I have something going on at work.  I ask the professor if I can take test in his morning class about a week before test.  Turns out no one in morning class knows about his tests. I walk in get my 100 then leave half way through the test.  Turns out he changed the questions for afternoon class and everyone fails miserably.  Now we are all panicked.  Turns out fir 4th test he gives us old test and we all get 100.  I\u2019m only person that semester to get a 100 average.  Lol",
