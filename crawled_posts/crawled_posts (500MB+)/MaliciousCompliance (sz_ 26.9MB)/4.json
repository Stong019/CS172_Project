            "Pretty sure it's staged. The timing of it is perfect. The camera's angled exactly to the time when the car arrives and the car exactly pulls out right after it happens. Next clue is the lack of hesitation from the guy's friends. They almost instantly get on a running car without any second thoughts. Another thing is that the camera zooms in on the exact position. It could be coincidence that the camera holder was randomly filming a street intersection but the fact that the camera zooms in on the car before anything actually happens shows that the person filming was positing it because he knew something would happen.Also, people that do this are usually the ones that would either get out and cause a scene, move their car while the last person is on the hood or at least honk. A lot of times they don't even realize what they did wrong and just see people walking on their car. Yet here they willfully back up as to instantly realize their mistake. I could be wrong but this feels staged.",

She started yelling and screaming about calling the cops and suing me and how her cousins brother knows a guy who's related to the chief of police and I'll be arrested. \n\nShe calls the police and they come out, I show the officers the vehicle and they understood the safety concern. They told me to just put the car down and let her leave. I did and even made her sign a statement declining crucial safety repairs. \n\nShe left with the most \"haha, I told you so\" smug grin on her face... Until she left the property, got pulled over and her car impounded. They also gave her a ticket for reckless driving. \n\nI was so happy seeing her car get towed.\n\nEDIT FOR CLARIFICATION.

The girl gets out and laughs at me while giving me the finger.\nThis was a free standing store so as there was no other business around I figured she was heading to my store that wasn't open for business but still in the hiring phase.\nAs we entered the store at the same time, with me a few steps behind her, she asked the first person she saw, \" Where is the store manager I want to apply for a job\".

She resorts to this behavior now (like the lady in the story) so that she won't get taken advantage of again, and it's worked for her. I'm not condoning this behavior, but saying there's likely an understandable reason for it. Imagine being terrified of being taken advantage of, given a bill, and then told you can't get your car back until you pay for it. For someone who doesn't trust mechanics, it would look like extortion (even though the OP had perfect reasons for keeping it, the lady who didn't trust him might think he was making it up to try to take advantage of her).

During the date they kept talking to each other in Cantonese, usually while looking at us, then at each other and laughing.\n\nWe asked them a couple of times to stop, they said they would, then went right on doing it.\n\nMy friend's mother was a German immigrant... so we switched to German for the rest of the evening.  The ladies started asking us what we were saying and wanted us to stop.  We would agree, then go right back to our conversation in German.\n\nNeedless to say, there was no second date, but we had fun that night.",

If I had a Dollar for every single time I got called that derogatory term that white folk gets called because of their association with POC, I would have a nice retirement fund. \n\nI never told any of my friends about what I was going through with the racist jerks at the time. One day I was asked my science teacher to tutor my friend J during class. Well 2 of these jerks were in our class. I was bullied about my choice of friends and these 2 were the worst. I am talking car window busted out, almost ran off the road, and other threats about \u201cmaking me see the light about my choice of friends.\u201d As J and I were going over the days lesson, within a few minutes of each other, the both walk by us and call me that name. Now J heard this and almost went nuclear on them. I put my hand on his shoulder and said \u201cSticks and stones Dude. Let it go.\u201d He started asking me about it, and then asked if our friend D knew any of this. Now D and I had been very good friends for years. He lived around the corner from my mom and I. He did yard work for us for some spending money. Sometimes we just hung out with each other. Our moms worked together and shared the same first name. \n\nNow J was truly concerned about my well being. He said he was telling D and the others about this. I begged him not to, but he did anyway. I got a visit from D that afternoon saying that they had a plan. It was gonna be handled. They came up with a schedule for each one to meet up with me and walk me to my classes. I was never going to be alone. They also caught them after school and told them if anything else happened to me, it would be over for them.

            "> Apparently this made that Native American granny's week, because she went all out and really taught him quite a lot.\n\nThis reminds me of the time I was in China about 15 years ago.  I was touring the Great Wall with my family, however they weren't physically able to do the larger stairs, so I went ahead by myself.\n\nI had previously tried to learn some basic Chinese like \"Ni Hao\" (hello), \"Ni Hao Ma\" (how are you) and \"Xie Xie Bu Yao\" (no thank you) to talk to the locals, with the latter saying to tell pushy tourist vendors that I wasn't interested (which worked surprising well!).\n\nAlong the wall there are a bunch of \"shops\" (tables/blankets) setup by the locals on the wall itself.  It is a surreal experience, the mixture of modern and ancient, but I enjoyed it none the less.\n\nI stopped at one of these shops where there was an elderly Chinese woman by herself selling some tourist trinkets.  I initiate with Ni Hao and she was surprised I spoke Chinese (I'm not Asian).  I told her in English that I learned some Chinese while touring and thought it was fun to learn the local language on my travels (even if it is only a few word/phrases).  She thought this was awesome (I guess not many tourist had interacted with her in Chinese).\n\nNext thing I know, she has taken out a notebook and begun scribbling down some English and Chinese phrases for me to learn.  She pulls me aside and starts teaching me some more phrases!  It was such an amazing experience - learning Chinese from a local on top of the Great Wall of China.  We chatted for about 15 minutes and I would've stayed longer but my tour group had to be back at the bus at a certain time, so I had to leave.\n\nI think elder people everywhere want to see their culture/language/history passed on but not many people take interest in this stuff until they are older, which is why these people get so excited when someone actively wants to learn from them (especially if they are young).\n\nTL;DR: If you are young and reading this - engage with the elderly in your life.  I am nearing 40 and I have missed the chance to talk to my grandparents / other elderly about their history/life/stories before they passed.  I now regret not knowing how they grew up, what were major milestones in their lives, and what they are proud of (besides \"family\").  You'll appreciate this knowledge when you get older and the people you talk to will be super happy that you took interest in their stories/lives!  Win win!",

My wife made some damn good chicken soup, but the kids were complaining that there were veggies in their chicken soup, they hate veggies, veggies make them sick, and they wanted my wife to pick them out of the soup.  We tried to tell them that good chicken soup needs veggies to taste good, but they were being stubborn.  I'm sure other parents can understand.\n\nI told the kids \"if you really hate the taste of veggies, I'll make soup tomorrow, and you guys can make sure I only put stuff in you like.\"  They liked that idea, at the time.\n\nThe next day, I get the pot filled with water, all the typical soup ingredients out, and gathered the kids.  I asked for their approval on every item.  Chicken - yes, salt - yes, black pepper - no (gross, too spicy), celery - no (I can't even stand the smell), onions - NO!!!  It went on with that, with them rejecting parsley, bay leaves, and other veggies.  The total contents of the pot ended up being:\n\n--- Chicken, water, salt, noodles\n\nAfter the soup was done cooking, I served it up and they excitedly started to eat.  A few funny faces later, and one of them said \"it tastes weird, this isn't very good\".  I said \"but I only put in everything you guys approved.  I think, from now on, I should make the soup, right?\"\n\nThey looked at each other and said \"can we have mom's soup instead?\"  Since that day, they haven't complained about finding veggies mixed in the food.  Sure, they almost always eat around a carrot or green pea, but they understand that it adds flavor.",

            "Back when I was a server at a restaurant we had an amazing lentil soup that this regular's kid adored, but the kid claimed he hared lentils. So the regular (kid's dad) and I would talk all about how I spent so much time picking the lentils out just for him! Of course I did no such thing, it was just a regular cup of soup, but the kid didn't know what a lentil was, so he was always happy to get his \"lentil free\" lentil soup.",

So I decided to let them pick whatever they wanted from the grocery store, then eat whatever, whenever, they wanted at home. \n\nI\u2019ll never forget their joy that first morning as they were having ice cream and Mountain Dew for breakfast. It took about three days of no \u201cfood rules\u201d for the stomach aches and poopfest to kick in. My children literally NEVER complained about food again.",

He ordered online and only got rice, ground beef, and cheese and wondered why his burrito was so small when the place has pictures of massive stuffed burritos. At thanksgiving, he also threw a tantrum over the fact that the rice had carrots and broccoli mixed in, in front of extended family and friends.\n\nIt's good to teach kids while they're young, or you'll end up with a manchild.",

What kid doesn't want to help dad do stuff?\n\nIt turns out that, at least in her case, the entire reason she wouldn't eat most food was because she didn't recognize what was in it.\n\nAnd you have to admit, not knowing what you're eating is a turn-off for anyone.\n\nSo she helped me make several dishes from scratch and saw that when onions cook for a while, they become translucent, basil (and other herbs) wilt, carrots become mushy (she never did learn to like that), and so on.  When she saw what went into the food, she realized no one was trying to poison her.  She learned that things like vegetables taste completely different when cooked properly (especially in Italian sauces).\n\nThen I asked her to go on Instagram and find some things SHE wanted to make for dinner.  She found some pretty weird stuff, but it all wound up being great.\n\nNow, not only is she no longer (as) picky an eater, but she's a damn good cook!

I think our parents either lucked out with us, or had some sort of magic skill. TBH, I can't stand raw celery, but I'll eat it if I have to, lol.

I'm in Canada and preferred students from south America because generally they would eat most things I made and I didnt have to adjust my cooking by very much. When I helped them with orientation, I always asked several times if there are foods they cant or dont like so that I can at least be somewhat accommodating.\nLast year I had a very entitled 20yr old student from Panama. When I asked her about food preferences it was no vegetables. I had to ask the question again because I didn't understand. She literally didnt want any vegetables. I told her quite simply i dont know how to cook with no vegetables. Its flavour, texture, nutrition. I can cut down on vegetable, but not cut out 100%. But she said tomato sauce was okay. ??? How? Apparently her father would mince all of the veg into a juice to incorporate into the sauce. From that point on, nearly everything I made she threw in the garbage because she could detect a hidden vegetable. I was not about to puree my life away.\nThis lasted 3 weeks until she requested a transfer. I was none too surprised because her father came to canada to help her adjust and in that time, he changed hotels 4 times.  No love lost. I tried, but in my house there will be vegetables.",

            "I was a very picky eater when I was a kid.  And one of the things that stuck with me is that I'm not a fan of mushy tasteless veggies.  Especially in soup.  \n\nI would always ask for simply broth, chicken and potatoes and it was never an issue. My grandmother would also blend onions into dishes and always serve  a small portion of fresh veggies with lime, salt and pepper with every meal.  \n\nYou could say that they all catered to my taste and you wouldn't be wrong.  But as I grew to love cooking myself I realized that is exactly what cooking \"with love\" is.  You don't have to follow a recipe like it's written in stone.  You tweak it and tailor it to fit the tastes of the people you're serving.\n\nI make tons of soups.  I could even say it's a bit of an obsession of mine. All the veggies and spices go into the quick pot to give their flavor and nutrients to the broth, I often save scraps from other dishes and salads to avoid waste as well.  Then the broth is strained and the soup comes together.  If I decide I want veggies in my soup that day, I blanch them just to get them tender while they still retain some crunch. \n\nYou could try experimenting with your picky eaters and find ways to prepare the things they don't like in a way that could open up their tastes so that they don't just eat around veggies and let those things go to waste.",
            "Very nice.  I usually blend most of the veggies up (once their a bit soft) and add it to the base.  Kids pick out vegetables and don\u2019t know they\u2019re still getting vitamins.",

With my kids I just agreed to chunk up anything they didn't like fairly large and they could pick out whatever they wanted. Except meatloaf. I used to put pureed veggies in meatloaf but I never hid it. They even liked to help me make it. \n\nAround the time my kids started the picky stage there was an article in a science magazine about changes in taste buds over a person's life. I made sure to show it to my kids and just explain well my taste buds are at a different stage so of course I'm going to like different things a bit to what you like. Then I encouraged them to keep tasting things periodically to see if perhaps their perception of them had changed since last they tried whatever it was. Other than that, I never made them eat things. They could always go make their own peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but I wasn't going to cook anything specially just for them.\n\nNow they are grown with their own kids going through picky stages. One of them won't eat tomatoes which she says is a textural thing, but loves ketchup on fries and spaghetti and pizza with tomato based sauces. The other ones I don't know of anything they won't eat. They willingly try most anything. They love sushi, most vegetables, beans, and all things seafood. \n\nWorking on getting the grandchildren to that point now and I will definitely pass on your approach. Who knows?

        "selftext": "I rented a car for five weeks while my car was being repaired from a car accident. The rental company had a couple great policies- no cleaning fee no matter how gross the car was, and unlimited miles. Ideal for me- I live in the country and going anywhere is a drive. \n\nWhen my car was finally scheduled to be finished (a Monday evening) I called the rental car company on Sunday. Asked about return details. They said return time would be 530pm Monday, but I could just leave it at the shop and leave the keys in the shops drop box. I said sure, and next night I went, got my car, left keys in the box. Got in my car, and check engine light is on. Fuck. Staff says come back tomorrow and we will fix it. I go home thinking that I will be sitting at the shop all Tuesday because no other ride. \n\nTuesday morning I wake up at 7am to the rental car company very angry and saying that they can't get into the drop box and shop doesn't open til 9. I tell them I just did what they said to do. They told me that they would be charging me an extra day. At that I'm furious. I leave my house later and arrive at the ship at 850. Rental car guys aren't there. I sit around and shop opens, I grab the rental keys and give them my car. Right on time, rental car guys appear. They demand the keys and I ask if I'm still getting charge for an extra day. One guy is inspecting the car while the other tells me yes, I'm getting charged an extra day. Guy inspecting it comes over and days car looks good, it should be ready to rent out immediately. I had cleaned it the day before because I didn't want to be a dick. Well, I refuse to give him the keys. \"Since I'm getting charged an extra day, that means it's my car until 530 today, right?\". At that he gets nervous. Says they need the car back. \"I will give you the keys now if you don't charge me an extra day. But if I'm charged an extra day, I'm using it.\" He refuses to bend so I leave. \n\nAt this point I'm petty and angry. So I go straight home. I own a farm and it has been raining like mad lately. I get to work. By the time 10am rolls around, the car is COVERED in mud. Like, this black car looks painted brown. I didn't trash the inside, because I'm not that petty. I hop in the car and drive to the rental place. I'm pretty covered in mud at this point, I had put trash bags on the front seat to limit it. I walk into the rental place looking like I fell into a mud pit. The guy who refused to cancel the charge looks horrified. I tell them \"this car is great for mudding! I'm gonna go mudding for the rest of the day. Just swinging by to ask where to put the keys at 530\" I'm all smiles and dripping sweetness. I watch the life leave him, his shoulders slump, and he says if I return the car now they will cancel the charge because they need to rent out the car. I give em the keys and take an uber to the shop, where my car is ready. \n\nNo cleaning fee and no extra day charge. Ha!\n\n\nEdit: \nAlright, might as well address the few things yall are bitching about lol. \n\nThe uber- I called the uber after I walked out of the rental car place. It took half an hour to arrive. I had brought extra trash bags, so I stripped down a bit (shorts and undershirt) and put on 2 trash bags that I cut holes in. Put my clothes in a bag. Let the mud on my exposed body parts flake off. Did I look absolutely ridiculous? Yes. Did I get mud in some poor strangers car? No. \n\nI didn't want to actually ruin the day for some kid getting minimum wage. That's why I only mudded the outside. That's a pretty easy clean. I didn't wanna wreck anyone's day- even the asshole that charged me. My goal was to make the car messy and shocking enough to get them to not charge me because they were desperate to get it back. \"If the outside is that bad, what did he do to the inside?\" \n\nThe car was 91 fucking dollars a day (first 3 weeks 39 a day and then went up for last 2 weeks to 91) and my insurance did not cover it. I was not willing to let 91 bucks slide. \n\nThe keys were left at the auto shop, in the auto shops key box. That key box was not open at 7am when rental car company went to get the car. When I went around 9am to drop my car off, the auto shop opened the box for me and gave me the rental car keys. Rental car people appeared a few minutes later.  \n\nSorry if spelling and grammar ain't great. It isn't a thesis.",

            "I had a similar experience with an apartment. State law says landlords can't double dip: they can't charge an early termination fee for breaking a lease if the apartment is leased to a new tenant. I go and give my notice and I discuss with them how I'm going to look for a new tenant. They agree. I find a perfect couple with great credit a day or so later. I send them to the apartment to do the credit check and they come back and tell me that the landlord says the unit isn't available.\n\nI go to the landlord. I'm told there's another unit on the other side of the complex that is being remodeled. It was already rented out and was behind schedule. The apartment can't take my tenants because the people for the remodeled apartment are going to stay in my apartment until theirs is ready.\n\nGreat! I say. Since you have a tenant, I don't have to pay an early termination fee.\n\nWell no, the landlord says. I found this tenant, not you, so you still have to pay.\n\nI remind them of the state law, which does not specify who finds the tenant. It just says they can't charge me and charge the new tenant for the same days.\n\nLandlord starts to look shifty and says they aren't collecting rent from the new tenant. This makes me believe the new tenant was either their friend or they had screwed this new tenant over somehow and were trying to make it right by pulling a fast one on me.\n\nI told them I found a tenant and they had violated the agreement by refusing to even run their credit and that I wasn't going to pay a late fee. If they were leasing out the apartment for no money, that wasn't my problem. \n\nThere was a lot more bickering before the end. We moved out without checking out or leaving a forwarding address, we just left the keys in the apartment. They called me a few days later bitching about a bunch of damage that didn't exist and how I owed them money and, \"This isn't the last you'll hear from us!\" I've had the same phone number for many years since then, but I've never heard a thing from them.",

They did and I drive off happy, even though I know my checkbook is about to be sodomized by the dealership.\n\nFast forward 5 days.

The car lurches forward and I end up side swiping a concrete support column on the driver side.  The car is fuuuucked!  Neither driver side doors open.  I limp it back to the dealership and walk into their Enterprise rental office to tell them about the damage.  They take the car and give me another.  I drive off happy again, but check it thoroughly for bees.\n\nAbout 2 weeks later I get a demand to pay from their Enterprise Loss Dept.  They want $11k for the damages.  I politely told them that the dealership is the one who rented the car for me and they had a collision damage waiver.  Told them to contact the dealership.   Thinking all was good, I didn't think about it any further.  Two more weeks pass and I get a collection demand from them, threatening to sue if I didn't pay them.  I was furious at this point.  I marched my happy ass down to the rental office and ask for a copy of the damage waiver.  I also tell them to fax it to the lady in their loss dept that was contacting me.

When returning, fill the car full and take a picture of the fuel gauge + milage, save the refueling receipt, time stamped (visible rental office is even better)\n\n6. If anything happens (extra insurance charge, fuel charge, etc.) always reach out to the customer service instead of the rental office\nThe customer service works based on proof and evidence you provide, when a customer sent in a proof they will be happy to refund the customer without involving the rental office\n\nBut also consider that most customer service offices are understaffed, under trained and overwhelmed especially during summer high season so you'll need to have some patience waiting 1-2 weeks until its fixed\n\nI guarantee if you follow these steps nothing will happen to you that can't be fixed\nUnless you get in an accident of your fault or really steal that dang car",

            "I used to work at local, non-airport Enterprise location (approx. 3 years ago) and here are a few good tips to be aware of for them or things were heard about from other car companies to be aware of and to have a smooth experience if you need to rent again (for any reason!):\n\n1. At Enterprise you are billed for 24 hour periods for the daily charges. So if you pick up at 8am, you'll be charged until the next day at 8am (if returning on the weekend, as they are open then, but they open at 9, MOST branches will waive the one hour charge since they weren't open before then. This may have changes since COVID. More on this later)\n\n2. Enterprise will never charge you for a reservation. Some places do, if that worries or bothers you make sure to ask/check around if they charge ahead. We only charged once you picked up the car and signed the rental agreement. I saw a few comments were people still got charged for cars they didnt get, we saw this a LOT unfortunately so shop ahead.\n\n3. Most rental places work with local dealers/shops, if you picked up the rental at the dealer/shop you can absolutely return at the dealer/shop, but here is the kick, we often were told we need verification it was dropped off not just your word. This meant if you brought it to the dealer/shop at 4pm many times the dealership/shops we worked with called to confirm the vehicle was in. You can verify with the place your car is at to confirm they do this, if not specify you left the keys with \"x\" and they can call to confirm and send someone to get it. If they dont work with that dealer/shop this might not happen, but you can always call and ask how often they work with them. Most customer service people in the branch will be honest with you on that cause we love our dealers.\n\n4. At Enterprise, you may randomly get a survey at the end asking you to rate your experience. We only pass if you are \"Extremely satisfied\" anything else means a mark against us. So, we WANT you to be extremely happy, they wont necessarily comp your rental BUT get an extra day cause we didnt pick up the keys until the next day? Explain your Extremely dissatisfied and you will likely have that that day comped. Its easier to keep you happy then get yelled at for not meeting our criteria every month.\n\n5. At Enterprise, if you need a rental for a long time note that our contracts are good for a month. So as long as you stay in the same car or same sized car, you are locked in at the same rate for a month (this excludes any weekend rental type prices as after the 3 days it will adjust to the normal pricing as of the date the contract started and usually does not include weekly deals. Beware!) After then we had to renew the contracts, this means we need to close out the current contract and open a new one. This has to be done at a branch unless your insurance is paying your rental, as we refunded any current deductible and charged a new one for the new contract and then your rates may adjust.\n\n6. Some rental companies run a credit check if you are paying with debit vs credit. If you are concerned about this call ahead and ask. Enterprise never ran the credit checks but ask for 3 references to call if we cannot contact you. This is only if you pay with a debit card, if your using credit then you were usually fine.\n6.5 on a similar point, while Enterprise took both credit and debit cards they are processed differently. On a cc we only place a \"hold\" for the amount for the rental plus the refundable deposit that will show as pending on your statement then only charge for the rental at the end. Thus \"releasing\" the hold on the additional amount for the deposit. On debit cards we had the charge the whole amount and refund the deposit at the end. However, certain cars (usually the most $$$$ cars) could only be rented with a cc. Some companies may vary slightly on this but it always sounded like it was similar to this\n\n7. At Enterprise, you could get charged extra fees. Never for mileage (unless you get a weekend deal) but the most common were cleaning fees and gas. Now our cleaning fees were for any smoke or pet hair primarily as we considered it anything we needed a professional/deep cleaning. Gas fees get applied to any levels below what it went out at but we ALWAYS charged more than local gas stations as we have to send someone to get gas. The exact way it prices this is an estimation of gas used (in gallons) and charges $x times x gas used accordingly. Refer to tip 4 on the gas as thats usually a cheap comp for us too. Usually cleaning fees were non-negotiable especially for smoke BUT if you noticed a smoke smell in the car after you drive off or the next day, call the branch. They can note it on your file, even if you don't want to swap cars and you can avoid being charged for someone who previously smoked in the car.\n\n8. (And last!) At Enterprise, ALWAYS call the local branch before making any reservation. There are only so many cars we have but the reservation teams may make reservations that we don't have enough cars for. I can't tell you the amount of times I was a \"bad guy\" for this very issue and I always told people to call us before anything was made cause we can answer honestly. This saves YOU a lot of time running around scrambling because you know you have a car and didnt go to pick it up to find its not there. I can't speak if other rental companies will be honest but I know our local locations always were so we didnt waste your time.\n\nHopefully this helps people avoid a similar situation. Glad you got the one up on these guys! They dont sound ver nice!",
            "My Mum did something sorta similar. She took her car in for a service, & was given a \"loaner\";it had barely enough gas to limp to the gas station. Since she ended up with overnight service, when she took the loaner back, the low-fuel light went on as she parked. She paid her bill, & said she left more fuel in the loaner than when she got it. The lot jockey said it needed refueling. Eventually, the service manager got involved, and she explained she'd limped the loaner to get fuel. I heard later that the lot jockey was supposed to be keeping the loaners filled. He got fired after the manager found out from other customers that it was a regular occurrence."

If she would come back into the kitchen to try and complain, I'd immediately change the subject to dogs or gardening, the two things she loved most.

One time she pissed me off so bad I almost quit. I have been getting LEEP procedures to remove cancerous cells on my cervix. Now, the LEEP procedure doesn't take very much downtime - a week at most on some low dose painkillers. Except this was my 3rd LEEP procedure and I had talked to my doctor about what this means, what to do, etc. We both decided that the best thing to do is if he found SEVERAL cancerous cells again, he would remove my cervix. Scary, but I'd rather it be removed than deal with cervical cancer. So when my manager came to talk to me about some \"maybe time off\" I talked to the owner about, I told her the story and that if it was a LEEP procedure I'd only be out the rest of the week, but if he went in an saw too many cancerous cells, I'd be out 6 weeks or more and I'd have my mother or boyfriend call when I was out of surgery with the results. She tried to shut me down, say that I couldn't take 6 weeks off for a procedure that only had me out a couple days, etc. She kept \"forgetting\" the info I told her about a possible cervix removal, tried to complain to the owner, other managers, and other workers. I ended up having to call the owner because she was talking to other workers about my medical problems, a problem I only felt forced to talk about because she was harrassing me. I liked my job so only told the owner if she continued to talk about my problems to my co-workers, I'd be forced to contact legal aid. Owner put a stop to it asap.

        "selftext": "I work in a hot sauce store in a busy outlet mall. We're a well-liked locally owned business and have many loyal return customers, but at this particular location we also get a lot of tourists who are curious about our challenge items, or \"Hot Ones\" products. \n\nWe have a large variety of samples available every day. Literally like 100 hot sauces, 50+ bbq/wing sauces just out on the table and we can pull another 50+ bottles or so from the fridge if one's open. \n\nEvery so often we get people who come into the store and ask to try the hottest sauce. They love jalapenos in their burritos and have eaten habaneros straight and they're ready to enter the ring, swallow some sauce and gain the admiration of a couple friends and bystanders at the cost of a stomach ache. We usually try to guide them to the 10th hottest sauce in the store, burn them with it, and move on to something mild or medium suited to their taste.\n\nToday while I was selling items to people who were actually paying for things, a 10-or-so year old boy enters the store. I always get wary when children enter the store alone because it is full of glass bottles. They usually dart straight for the shelves and pick something up, but this child came barreling towards me like a bullet. \n\nWhile I make change for the couple buying some sauce, he calls out to me, \"Excuse me!\", in a horrendous whiny pitch. I ignore the rude interruption and continue my conversation with my customers. He parrots it again twelve times or so back to back as I thank these people and get them out of the store. Finally, I turn to him, \"How can I help you?\". Where the fuck are this kid's parents.\n\n\"Hi can I try the hottest sauce in the store.\" Not this shit again. I am not dealing with this, not with a 10 year old kid. I explain to him that the hottest sauce on the table is Hellboy: Right Hand of Doom. It's spiked with a 6.66 Million scoville extract, and honestly if you're not experienced with this kind of stuff more than just a tiny bit can really mess up a good part of your day. Take my word for it.\n\nI explain to him he has to be 19 years old to try it and sign a waiver (which is bullshit, but I'm off in 30 minutes so fuck this kid), and instead guide him to a tasty fermented habanero that he coughs his eyes out on before explaining to me that he could handle the Right Hand of Doom because his dad eats spicy peppers with him all the time. \"Okay.\" I say. He leaves, thank God.\n\n15 Minutes later I'm interrupted by another customer. This time a gigantic woman, in a blue blouse, she's set next to my sample table like a giant blueberry blocking up 20% of my floor space. \"Excuse me!\" Apple doesn't fall far. The customers I'm with are polite and excuse me to speak to her. \"You didn't let my son try the sauce!\" \n\nI explain to her that it has extract in it several hundreds times hotter than anything he has ever eaten and that it can cause him severe discomfort and that I will not let him try it in my store. I explain that she is free to purchase the sauce and have him try it at home if she so wishes. She explains to me that she married a Mexican man and that I wouldn't believe the things we ate in \"New Mexico City\" where he grew up. When I asked what they had eaten there she told me \"Things hotter than anything we have in the store\". \n\nAt this point her daughter interrupts our conversation, I shit you not, \"Excuse me!\"\n\n\"What?\" I'm getting annoyed. I was annoyed from the second I saw the kid and now he's back 20mins later with three of him. \"Why do you sell Valentina it's not even a hot sauce?\" Jesus Christ. Aren't you from Mexico? It says fucking Salsa Piquante on the God damned bottle. It's 5:50, I'm off at 6. I've had enough.\n\n\"How about this, you can try the sauce and if it's as mild as you think, I'll let him try it.\" She agreed and grabbed her sample stick. I reached for the Right Hand of Doom, and unscrewed the cap. It's nuclear aroma sending memories of aches to my stomach. As she goes to dip the stick into the sauce, I warn her to \"only take a small amount\". She grins at me and dips the stick all the way into the sauce. Trap card, bitch. She slaps it into her mouth.\n\nImmediately she looks uneasy before she throws herself into pure agony. She is coughing, swinging her head back and forth, trying desperately to speak, but she cannot muster any words. She dropped her sample stick in all the chaos. After a solid few minutes of coughing and dry heaving, she manages a single word, \"water.\" I explain to her that water won't help her now. My relief walks through the door just in time to witness the finish.\n\nShe tells me that the only reason she is coughing is because \"it went down the wrong pipe.\" She then immediately vomits into our garbage can. She apologizes for \"spitting up\" like she didn't just rocket launch half a litre of chum into my trashcan and then leaves without saying anything else.\n\nI tossed out the trash with a smile on my face and clocked out.",

            "I have a story in a similar line. \n\n\nI love heat. I have a fun collection of sauces, ranging from novelty farmers market stuff to name brand like Mad Dog and Blair\u2019s. I love pepper-infused salts too, look up \u201credneck seasonings\u201d if you are into that. I have eaten raw ghost peppers before (was not fun), and frequently put habaneros into whatever I\u2019m cooking. \n\nMy SO wanted to get me something fun for Christmas a few years ago, and managed to track down \u201cBlair\u2019s Ultra Death Sauce.\u201d The bottle comes in a coffin and everything.\n\nCome Christmas morning I open my gift and thank her for it. I pop the top and taste it. It\u2019s not the hottest I have ever had (I think Satans Blood takes that place), but it\u2019s thicker than most. If you tried to take any real amount you would have to chew on it. It really does not taste great, or even good, but if you want to quickly take a bowl of chili from 0-100 a drop will do just that. \n\nMy SOs folks definitely don\u2019t do spicy things, but they wanted to pass it around and give it a sniff and see the bottle. As it\u2019s going a cousin about 6 years old asks if he can try it. I firmly tell him no, he cannot handle it. He insists that he is tough but thankfully his mom stops him before he gets any into his mouth, but sadly what he did get was far worse.\n\nHe grabs the bottle angry that he can\u2019t taste it and snorts it. Shit you not, snorted it. There were several seconds where he sat there unsure of what to do with himself, repeating over and over again \u201cI\u2019m ok, I\u2019m ok.\u201d He was not ok.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the story of how I ruined a 6 year olds Christmas and had to listen to him screaming and crying in the bathroom for a half hour.",

        "selftext": "This happened sixteen years ago. \n\nWhen I was about 20 years old, I was a department manager in a big box hardware store. People said I acted 25, but I didn\u2019t even look 18. As a young female, I saw my fair amount of sexual discrimination, but the worst always came from women. This is the story of one such woman. \n\nI managed the paint department. I had three associates who worked for me. They loved me as a boss because I bought them a department radio, took the shifts they didn\u2019t want. (worked Friday close and Saturday mid so my two younger guys could have time to have fun on Friday nights and the older gentleman took early Saturday mornings so they could sleep off their fun. In trade, I gave the older gentleman his ideal schedule.) My team was awesome. \n\nOne day I was in the department alone and a lady came up and asked me where she could find the five gallon oil based primer. I let her know that my location didn\u2019t carry the five gallon size of that primer. She told me that we did and said that it was shelved \u201cright there\u201d while suggesting I was too stupid to remember. (Her husband gave me an apologetic look.) I let her know that another location had what she was looking for and that it was in fact in that exact location in that store. She let me know how stupid she thought I was for thinking she could mix up stores. Then, she began yelling and loudly insisting that I get a MAN out there to help her because she wanted someone competent and not a stupid little girl. Her husband actually tried to step in at that point but I just smiled and let her know that a male paint associate would be clocking in any minute and that I would be happy to direct him to her as soon as he is on the clock. \n\nI smiled and waited for Joe to clock in. Joe was great and I knew he could handle this or I wouldn\u2019t have put him in this situation, but Joe was also new. He was learning things super quick, but still relied on the rest of us for help. When I saw Joe walking up, I quickly said that there was a customer who needed help. I let him know that she was upset and asked him to do his best to answer her questions. \n\nJoe walked up to the lady. She said, \u201cFinally, a man!\u201d She asked her question, explained where the product SHOULD BE, and waited. Joe calmly let her know that he had never seen us carry five gallon size of oil based primer, but said he could check with the paint department manager. She was happy and loudly said she was happy to be getting some REAL help. \n\nJoe walked up to me and started to ask me about five gallon oil based primers. The lady quickly walked up and asked him what he was doing. He turned and said, \u201cThis is my manager. She runs this department.\u201d \n\nThe husband laughed out loud, the woman stormed off, and I bought Joe lunch!",

            "I\u2019m an attorney and, also, a woman. Yep, they let us do that these days! :) When I have a deposition, I will set out a pitcher of water and water glasses in the conference room because pretty much all of what happens in a deposition is *talking,* and people get thirsty. On one such occasion, I was doing this after I had already brought my notebook, exhibits, binders, and computer into the room. (It was just my chair that was empty, because I was setting out water.)\n\nAll the other attorneys, and the witness, were men who had never met me before. (NB: The court reporter was a woman, and she knew who I was.) As I was finishing up with the water, one of my all-time favorite opposing counsel, a real stand-up guy (/s) and total choosy beggar says something like \u201cDon\u2019t you have anything better than water, Sweetheart? Like soda or coffee or something?\u201d  I specifically remember the \u201cSweetheart\u201d part because I wanted to deck him. \n\nNo, we don\u2019t have soda or coffee for you. There\u2019s a soda machine down the hall; we can wait for you to go get your own beverage of choice. \n\nHe declined, and then proceeded to complain about the amenities (mind you - it was me personally, not my employer, providing these things, at my own personal cost, as a courtesy) and started in on feeling inconvenienced that the deposing attorney (that\u2019s me) is \u201cnot there yet.\u201d \n\nThis is when I realize that because I was setting out the water and glasses, he thought I was my assistant, and therefore \u201cbeneath him.\u201d So gross.\n\nSo I smile, say nothing, and sit in the empty chair so we can get started. I start to open my notebook of exhibits and he asks me if I should be touching these things because \u201cthey might be exhibits and get all out of order.\u201d\n\nI inform him they are indeed exhibits and ask if he and his client are ready. He gives me some passive-aggressive response about being ready just as soon as my boss graces us with \u201chis\u201d presence. I tell him my boss will not be coming; he is not needed here. Without waiting for his response, I tell the court reporter we\u2019re ready. Bless her, she\u2019s on it! \u201cThank you, Ms. [My Last Name], I\u2019ll now swear in the witness.\u201d\n\nIt took him that long to realize the attorney\u2019s name on the pleadings might belong to a woman. \n\nI won that case. And, just for the record, my assistant is a woman, and she could mop the floor with that guy.  To bastardize a Jack Nicholson quote, sexism and elitism can shampoo my crotch.",

            "Once upon a time, I worked in a call center selling flood insurance. Flood insurance, through FEMA, is federally regulated - it is the same price at every single company everywhere, provided it\u2019s the FEMA insurance and not a private company. I was also the top selling agent, and at this point had been with the company 8 years - I knew my shit. \n\nI had a man call in, I answered, and he immediately asked for a guy to work with. I assured him I could help him, and as we were a call center that was in-bound only, I couldn\u2019t transfer him. We didn\u2019t have extensions. He absolutely demanded a male agent, or he\u2019d cancel every policy he had with us. I put him on hold, told my (male) manager what was up, and he rolled his eyes. Manager came over to my desk, picked up, and after listening to the guy have a cow about how women didn\u2019t know anything about insurance, proceeded to explain to him that I was the top agent, had been for 7 out of the 8 years I\u2019d worked there, and then read the little name plates on the awards I had on my desk. He then told the guy that he was sorry to hear he\u2019d be cancelling his (one, single) other policy and that he\u2019d let the auto department know, and then hung up. \n\nI was freaking flabbergasted.

Saturday mornings, when we had 4 or 5 people on, I barely left that area because there were so many questions. \n\nOn day a guy comes in, I ask him if he needs help, and he asks if there is someone older that can help him, not some college kid. \"Sure\" I say and go and grab my manager. I tell him what the guy said and he heads over. \n\nThe customer asked a fairly easy networking question, and my manager said \"I was a union electrician for 30  years, but I don't know this networking stuff that well, let me grab the guy who knows it best\".

So I'd grab a new associate we just trained and stand nearby so they can ask me all the questions. \n\nSometimes the customers woiuld make eyes at me that let me know they'd had enough and I'd take over but that was rare.

            "I used to have this all the time as a retail manager when I was young.

On most planes my knees are often very close or right up against the seat in front of me.  This makes it impossible for the person in front of me to recline their seat, which usually isn't a problem once the person in front of me sees how cramped I am in those tiny seats.  \n\nHowever for this particular flight, the man in front of me was not having it.  He tried to recline his seat, but couldn't because my legs were there.  He turns around and sees what's happening and asks me something along the lines of, \"Do you mind letting me put my seat back?\"  \n\nI respond with, \"I wish I could but I physically can't.  I'll do my best to give you as much space as I can, but it won't be much.\"  At this point he starts to get angry and just starts pushing as hard as he can back on his seat.  Needless to say, this was not particularly pleasant for me.  I ask him to please stop, and he says, \"I'll stop when I can put my seat back.\"\n\nI decide I'll just wait him out; he'll eventually get tired.  After about 10-15 minutes of this, he calls a flight attendant over and proceeds to demand a new seat.  The flight attendant tells him there are no available seats and he will have to deal with it.  He demands to speak to the pilot.  \n\nSo the flight attendant goes up front to talk to the cockpit.  Keep in mind that throughout this he is still pressing with all his might against my knees, with only short breaks to yell at the flight attendant.  After a couple of minutes, the co-pilot (he wanted to speak to the pilot and wan't happy about this) comes back and tries to explain to the man that he can't change seats because there are no other coach seats free.  The man continues to demand a seat that is able to recline, give me an upgrade, this is unacceptable, making a scene etc.  \n\nThe co-pilot finally gives in and says while looking at the man, \"Sir, would you like to sit up in business class?\"  \n\nThe man stands up and mutters something similar to, \"Fucking finally.\"  To which the co-pilot responds, \"Sir, sit down.  I wasn't talking to you.\"  He turns to me and repeats, \"How would you like a seat in business class?\"\n\nI have, to this day, never seen someone as furious as the man as I walked past him to my new business class seat (with free drinks).",

            "Im 6'4\" and travel extensively internationally.  I have yet to be on an overseas flight where I couldnt stick my feet under the seat in front of me, allowing recline.  Honestly, i would not be happy not being able to recline on a long flight.  I never complain when the folks in front of me do it.  Yea, it reduces the area for a laptop but a little propping and it works fine.  If not available for free, I'll typically pay for the more legroom seats (economy plus, etc) where its simply not a problem.  That said ive flown chicago to tokyo, shanghai, beijing, seoul, hong kong, lax to sydney etc in regular econ with my legs stretched out under the seat.  I can see if you're 6' 7\" but I honestly dont get why reclining is such an offense.  \n\nEdit:  just remembered one overseas flight where i coudnt get my legs under.  KLM 747 combi freighter, last row.  Amsterdam to Chicago.  That was a bad one...",
            "Ahh, seat drama.  I had a guy on my commuter bus who always reclined all the way and got aggressive with people if they complained.   He looked like Lawrence Tierney so people just let him win.  One day he did that to me, I'm 6'2 so I locked my legs and let him strain.  He got puffy but I won that one.  He took that shit personally and gave me dirty looks on other trips.   One day I was already sitting in an aisle seat and he got on, gave me a nice long look and took the seat in front of me, so I was like fuck this, and I slid over one to the window.  Other people were boarding, so this super-frail old lady took the seat I just vacated.  Lawrence Tierney didn't notice this, he was still settling down.  Then he reclined his seat violently.  He thought I was going to block him and he gave it his full effort.  The seat snapped back so hard it missed the old lady's face by like two inches.  She yelps, and everyone around is like what the fuck is this guy doing?  Tierney swings his fat head around, sees where I am, is visibly surprised and starts to stammer \"That guy, that guy, the seat\".  Out of nowhere this other dude comes charging up the aisle and grabs Tierney by the neck and yells in his face \"You asshole! You almost hit her what is wrong with you?!\". Now other people are up, it's going to be a rumble, no one likes Lawrence.  Commuter feuds have a long boil.  \n\nEveryone calms down instantly, the aisle guy makes sure the lady is ok, we all sit there for another two hours and that's the end of that.  I never see the guy again.  ",

Never mind that since 9/11 cockpit won't open until flight attendants secure the pathway to the bathroom.\n\nAlso assuming there's any truth to this story, a 16 hour flight without being able to recline is a pain the in the ass, you're naturally tall I get it, but another passenger is suffering for 16 hours because they got unlucky enough to sit in front of you.

When I showed him my ticket it turned out we had both been assigned the same seat so he called a flight attendant and demanded I get out of his seat. The flight attendant looked at both our tickets and told me to come with her. I got a first class seat and had filet minion and a bottle of red wine and passed out for the entire flight.

When I was about 12, I went to the UK with my mom, step dad, and two half siblings.\n\nFour of the seats were next to each other, but one was several rows away from everybody else. The ticket I got was for that far away seat, but who was assigned to the seats they had purchased was at random.\n\nMy siblings were too young to be without mom, and I was hoping my step dad would trade with me, but he refused. He had HIS ticket, and he wasn\u2019t trading.\n\nSo, I\u2019m sitting several rows away from everybody else, scared of the long flight and very unhappy. That\u2019s when the flight attendant comes up to me and says they need my seat and I\u2019ll have to move. We were in premium economy and I was convinced they were moving me to coach. I start grabbing my stuff and turn to head to coach when she says \u201cno, this way,\u201d pointing to first class. So, I walk by my stepdad with a massive grin on my face as they take me up to the full reclining heated chairs and warm face towels.\n\nIf my step dad hadn\u2019t been such an ass and traded so I could be with my siblings and play on my gameboy with them, he would have been bumped up to first. Instead, he got to sit and stew as I got better food and a more comfortable ride.",
            "On a recent flight back home I was sitting behind this total she-beast of a woman who did much the same as the dude in front of you did. Only issue was the flight was fully booked and people had already been bumped to business and first class if they were full-fare.\n\nThis lady managed to catch me off guard with my legs apart and finally jammed her seat down with my knees straddling it. I got up to use the restroom at some point and when I sat back down, I did so with my knees in the back of her seat. She turned to face me with the shittiest look on her face and was like:\n\n\"Excuse me, do you *mind*!?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do, ma'am. I'm six foot four and my ass is already glued to the back of this seat. There simply isn't any more room. You'll have to make do.\"\n\nShe left her seat reclined and my legs went numb over the last thirty minutes of the flight.\n\nAs we descended, passengers were instructed to put their seat backs up and this bitch totally didn't. Plane of probably 300 passengers and one seat was reclined during descent. Figures.\n\nI pushed the call-button and no steward(ess) came to my rescue. Felt bad, man.",
            "The party to blame here is really the airline.\n\nIn order to maximize their income at the expense of the passengers, they pack them in like herrings in a tin. \n\nIf this continues, flying will comprise getting to the airport, being stripped and being handed paper coveralls, sedated and then stacked like cordwood in the plane. \n\nNot to minimize the assholeishness of the recline-demander... he could have been nicer about it but shit, who *wouldn't* be pissed at having to sit bolt upright for 16 fucking hours?",

Years of sport and manual labour meant my calves and quads were pretty thick, so I moved all the stuff out of the pocket in front and spent the rest of the flight on the tips of my toes to dig my knees into her back. She complained to the stewardess, who saw I couldn\u2019t have given her room even if I wasn\u2019t being spiteful, and told her there was nothing she could do. \n\nThe stewardess quietly asked me if I wanted to move, but we only had 90~ minutes left on the flight, so I told her I was good with a smile, and I think she got the situation and smiled back. End of the flight, lady shoots me a huge greasy, to which I simply said \u201cMan it\u2019s tough sleeping on planes, ey?\u201d. \n\nShe was also about 5\u20193\u201d, so a complete gronk cunt if there ever was one",

The woman behind me (I was in the middle seat, my mom on the aisle), interjected and said \"my husband is 6 foot ~whatever~ and you cannot recline your seat!\"\nMy mom, total pro, says nothing. Hits the call button. When the flight attendant comes over, she says, \"this woman behind us told me I cannot put my seat back because her husband is 6 foot ~whatever~. I wanted to sleep some on this flight. Do you know if there is any other open seat I can move to?\" \nFlight attendant goes off to see if there are any open seats.

A few minutes later the stewardess returns with the good news, which she delivers to the lady, who cannot help but look at the people around her with a smug and self satisfied grin: \u201cMadam, unfortunately, as I suspected, economy is full. I\u2019ve spoken to the cabin services director, and club is also full. However, we do have one seat in first class.\u201d Before the lady has a chance to answer, the stewardess continues \u2026 \u201cIt is most extraordinary to make this kind of upgrade, however, and I have had to get special permission from the captain. But, given the circumstances, the captain felt that it was outrageous that someone be forced to sit next to such an obnoxious person.\u201d With which, she turned to the black man sitting next to the woman, and said: \u201cSo if you\u2019d like to get your things, sir, I have your seat ready for you\u2026\u201d",
