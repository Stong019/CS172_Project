        "selftext": "This just happened maybe 5 mins ago and I think it's hilarious.\n\nI'm the facility manager for my building. Everything that happens and goes wrong, is my responsibility. So I make sure everything runs smoothly. My boss had made it clear: It's MY building and I was hired to not only keep people in line but run everything. I'm not a dick but I hold people accountable, forcibly but politely. There was no facility manager for a long time before I came along and both clients and employees ran amok, with no order. In the 4 months I've been here, my boss has praised my performance and has gone to bat for me countless times, she's the best boss I've ever had. I've got a firm but fair approach and my reputation reflects that.\n\nI've got a Karen in the building and trust me, the name stereotype applies, who's just a counselor for family services, has nothing to do with our group. She likes to complain about everything and gives my boss a headache almost daily. She shares an office with another women, who's unfortunately, picking up on her Karen tendencies (Karen In Training), I've been doing a keycard audit all week and I knew to leave Karen's keycard alone because she's the only Karen in the building, so her name stands out. I am missing 75 keycards, lots of former employees having all door access, dating all the way back to 2015. Can't have that so I deleted a lot of them, especially if it had a wacky name or just a room number.  However, I did delete \"KIT's\" card information because it wasn't under her name. She just came to tell me her keycard wasn't working and Karen happened to be passing by and overheard it.\n\nI went and fixed \"KIT's\" keycard and we went to go check to see if it worked or not. We found Karen outside the office waiting, complaining to my boss that her keycard didn't work either. Karen wandered away and my boss rolled her eyes and I smiled and I told her I would take care of it. After checking to make sure \"KIT's\" keycard worked, I went downstairs to check the system, looked up Karen and wouldn't you know it, her keycard was completely fine. In fact, it showed she had a MASTER keycard. So I changed all of her permissions and limited her back to just her room ONLY.\n\nI went upstairs and got my boss's attention because her office is next door to the ladies and I mouthed LISTEN and pointed. I opened their door and was all, \"hey Karen! I went and checked your keycard in the system. Everything is good to go. In fact, it said you had a MASTER key to the building and per the company orders, since you're not a contractor or a company employee, I can't give you that access. So I had to revoke your status to just this room ONLY. Can't have you bugging people on official business *Wink* Thanks for bringing your keycard to my attention.\" She started to object that she needed the master keycard because XYZ and I was all, \"yeah sorry. Maybe before but I'm the facility manager and you don't need access to everything except this office and if you do, it's outside your pay grade, so you'll have to come get me. Ok? Cool thanks byyeeeeeee...\" And then just closed the door on her mid sentence. My boss was quietly laughing her ass off in her office and gave me an air high five.\n\nTLDR:\nKaren complained her keycard didn't work, when it absolutely did. In fact, she had master key access and had she not said anything, would still have it but made me check and I revoked her status completely to just her room only.\n\nEdit:\nTo be clear, I'm not talking down about my coworkers. They're fantastic people and no I'm not a suck up. They work in education and bend over backwards to help students and customers get the information and help they need. The building mostly got shut down and neglected and customers got lazy due to the C-word. We offer free classrooms to those who need it, including a computer lab, by a reservation 1st come, 1st serve basis. The problems we ran into was that the previous FM passed away suddenly and the replacement was temporary. Coupled with the C-word and this was our problem. My coworkers weren't able to enforce rules and regulations and rooms were left destroyed and neglected, keys stolen, etc. Since my arrival, I've enforced the rules and allowed the staff to resume their normal duties, without having to clean up after and babysit customers. Karen isn't staff, she's just renting an office. She has no business having access to our materials, supplies or workspaces. Especially when they're handling students private information.",

            "Dealing with keycards is a PITA. One job I had also included managing their keycards and system, the whole smash. What a mess. Their controller and software was so archaic, it ran on 98. They REFUSED to upgrade, saying they had no money. Uh huh.\n\nAt another job I was using keycards, and building management decided to upgrade. Well, the alarm company sent out a 90 day wonder that did nothing but all the wrong things. First he killed all the keycards, forcing management to disable all the sensor pads on the premise, including the skywalk that the vagrants love to use to sleep in. THEN he attempted to resolve that issue, only to WIPE the entire database, effectively bricking EVERY keycard that was on hand, including the inactive ones.  Of course, the goober didn't back it all up and there was no active backup in place.  SO, guess what? A mass email went out from building management that EVERYONE needed to bring their keycards down to the front desk to re-register them.  Talk about a goatrope. I told the manager they had a full platoon of IT pros in the building, why did you not ask us???\n\nNo answer.\n\nGo figure.",
            "I love when that happens. \n\nI was doing security upgrades at a VA hospital replacing doors and lock sets and in some places removing handle altogether. \n\nWhen I went to remove the lock set from the pharmacy emergency door the pharmacist tried to stop me because that\u2019s how she came in and out every day. I don\u2019t know how she got a key for the door but she had been doing this for about 10 years or so.\n\nCut too a few days later. She went to complain and it turns out that accessing that door for non emergency use is a felony. So she has been committing anywhere from 6 to 12 felonies a day for almost 10 years.\n\nI never did find out what happen to her but when my boss told me about it . He said this was not the first and with well over 200 doors in. the project it won\u2019t be the last.",

Ten or fifteen times per day I've been tracking him down to open an office for me, and he's finally relented and given me back my master access!",
            "Hats off to you!  I used to have to do key card audits and it was a giant pain.  Every time I had to remove an individual\u2019s access, it turned into a nightmare.  The individual\u2019s manager would get an email to approve the changes which meant I ended up with multiple phone calls or emails asking me to justify the removal or to clarify what I was attempting to do.

He came in one morning, logged into his computer, and was confronted with a screen telling him that a keystroke logging program had been installed. Cell phones were in use, but maybe not so internet-usable at the time. I was amazed the company let them know they were being monitored instead of keeping it sneaky. \n\nSo he went and warned his coworkers to quit doing personal things on their work computers.

My co-worker asked if he peed his pants. The kid said no, his brother did it. \n\nBut the keycard thing reminded me of a place where I worked for 15 years, over time I had various responsibilities and my keycard access grew and grew over time. None were ever revoked. My last year I stepped down from my former role to a part-time front line worker, no authority at all. My keycard still opened everything it ever did all the way to my last day.  Main secure computer room to the loading dock to the engineering training lab. I can easily see how tamping down on keycard permissions is a tedious and boring thing to deal with.",

Incentivized reviews are against federal law unless you reveal within the review that you received an incentive to do so.   \nSo you are actually covering yourself by going back and adding that back into the review.   \nYou should take it one step further, document everything, and start sending it directly to the FTC as well.    They will not harass you, they will crawl down Amazon's throat and the seller will get in some trouble as well.    Amazon can easily stop sellers from doing this but they choose to turn a blind eye to it.   What ends up happening is dangerous products end up with incredible ratings and sell even more.   Honest sellers go out of business while the manipulator's thieves and Chinese sellers grow and get stronger.   It is absolute bs. \n\nJust recently the FTC put a lot of pressure on Amazon to suspend a group of giant powerful sellers from China over manipulation. Combined they were doing over a billion in sales on Amazon.  The FTC put pressure on Amazon so they suspended them.   The story is that the Chinese gov put pressure on Amazon to reinstate them.  One was back in less than 7 days.  Then Amazon got more bad press and suspended them again.   They are back but under slightly altered names.  All of their reviews have been removed and they photoshopped the brand names out of the images.   Amazon does not care about buyers, safety, policing the platform or anything of the sort.  They only care about profit regardless of anything else.  \n\nAs far as the review being removed, it is against TOS because it is not about the product, but then the seller would be exposing your review directly to amazon when they request it to be removed which is very risky on their part.   I'd probably post it to twitter and tag amazon in the tweet because what they are doing is harming the buyer and honest business people,",

If a seller you review a product from gets banned, your account gets suspended from writing reviews.

My reviewer rank was ~12,000  at time of ban. It really sucked to have all of that time and effort taken away, and to have no recourse. So please OP, be careful.

        "selftext": "Disclaimer: Nothing in this post is legal advice. I'm a lawyer but not your lawyer. Please do not take legal advice from internet randos.\n\nBackground: I mostly work in a niche-ish area of law called discovery. Basically when someone starts a legal proceeding each party gets to ask other parties for certain documents relevant to the case. Sometimes parties refuse to produce certain documents because of reasons like attorney-client privilege. I argue why my clients' documents are properly withheld or the other sides' documents are improperly withheld.\n\nOne day I see a job board post from a local law firm looking for a research/writing position with required experience in discovery disputes. This raises a red flag for two reasons. First, local law firms normally do not need to hire full time R&W people because >95% of that firms cases are very similar (i.e. a personal injury firm normally only handles personal injury cases, so keeping a full time researcher is not worthwhile when all your cases are basically the same). When these local firms need something researched they either just do it themselves or pay someone else for a few hours of work.\n\nSecond, this local firm hired a friend of mine by telling them \"start here, work hard, and move up to senior associate in a few years\" before promptly letting them go after a few busy months.\n\nI go ahead and send my resume over and get scheduled for an interview pretty quickly. During the interview I gave them a fairly high salary ask which they agreed to almost instantly (itsatrap.jpg). Then the partner hits me with the following\n\nPartner: \"We ask all candidates to provide a writing sample before the final interview.\"\n\nMe: \"Sure thing. I thought I attached one to the application, but let me grab my phone and double check.\"\n\nP: \"Oh not that writing sample, that is too generic for evaluation. Here is a legal question that we want you to research.\" \n\nM: \"I see. More than happy to do that at an hourly rate.\"\n\nP: \"It should be fairly quick work. No other candidate has asked us for writing-sample-compensation, and this makes it seem like you won't be a team player. If you aren't interested in the position just tell us.\"\n\nM: \"Let me think about it.\"\n\nSo I go home and search a couple of local court dockets and **wouldn't you know it** this firm is involved in a case with a hearing set on *exactly* the discovery question they want me to produce a free 'writing sample' on. hehehelizard.gif.\n\nI send an email back saying sure thing I will make the writing sample, as long as it guarantees consideration for the R&W position. They say yes. I write a fantastic memo and send it in.\n\nA few weeks go by and I email asking for an update on the final interview. No response. Then I check that court docket and **wouldn't you know it** they straight up copy/pasted parts of my memo in the response. alwaysunnyyoudumbbitch.jpg.\n\nI send a demand letter for payment + fees. No response. I file a lawsuit for fraud. Oh baby *THEN* I got a response. A frothy, salty response. Frothaltly. I got called some **names**. They went on and on about how I was going to lose AND after I lost how they were going to counter sue me.\n\nI said \"sounds good, can't wait to lose. I guess you did hire a full time R&W attorney. I mean, it would be like baby-town frolics easy to win if you never hired for that position. Actually, it would be even easier if you never even had a final interview for the spot. I'm sure you aren't that dumb though.\"\n\nGot the check 30 days later.",

            "This reminds me of a story from one of William Shatner's memoirs.\n\nGene Roddenberry came up with the concept of a TV series about a starship with relatable human characters encountering other civilizations, as a sort of antidote to the very campy \"sci fi\" movies of the 50's and early 60's, featuring radiation-enhanced monsters and aliens in gorilla suits. He shopped the idea around various studios.\n\nIrwin Allen asked him to come in for a pitch meeting, and showed a great deal of interest. They kept him there for hours explaining his concept, especially his \"similar Earths\" theory, that evolution would follow similar paths on other planets, resulting in civilizations resembling our own. The practical upshot would be that the producer could save money using ordinary costumes and sets, rather than breaking the budget every week on ever more impressive aliens.\n\nIrwin Allen thanked him for his time and said they would get back to him. They never did. However, as you have no doubt guessed, a new series premiered embracing many of his concepts - named, of course, **Lost In Space!**\n\nShortly after that, DesiLu picked up his ideas, and Star Trek was born ...",

No further work was ordered. \n\nYears later, as a trial approached, I was deposed by opposing counsel. Prior to the deposition, we had reached out to the client, reminded them of the preliminary nature of the work and its inherent limitations, and requested a pre-deposition meeting with our client. All were ignored. \n\nDuring the deposition, opposing counsel pulled the preliminary work apart like salt water taffy, which was exactly the thing we warned the client about. Law firm that hired us hit the ceiling, and screwed us over on the bill, daring us to sue them for a measly $3000 invoice. Client law firm had won many many many multiples of that amount in the case. \n\nPetty revenge part - they came back around years later after I had left the company and wanted to hire an expert again.

        "selftext": "This happened a few years ago, I was working at a large national chain restaurant as a Manager.   I was asked to temporarily re-assign to a location in a city about an hour away, and accepted...they put me up in a hotel, the whole 9 yards.   \n\nThe first weekend I was there, I discovered that the GM had screwed up and not ordered any change (small bills/rolls of coins) for the safe, and that the local branch of our bank would be closing in the next hour.   I also happened to have a personal account at the same bank, and had, in the past, gone and gotten change from the branch back home.\n\nSince time was tight, I quickly looked up the address of the bank, grabbed $800 dollars, and jumped in my car.   I get to the bank, wait in line, and then ask them to make change ($400 in $5 bills, $300 in $1 bills, and $100 in assorted rolled coins).   The teller tells me that the bank doesn't make change.   Me, thinking it was because they didn't know me, informed her that our restaurant had an account she could look up.   She then told me, \"No, we don't make change at all.\"    The thought going through my brain was, \"WTF? You are a BANK!!!\"   I tried explaining the situation, but was quickly shot down.   I left, went back to my car, then had an idea.   \n\nI went back inside the bank with my personal checkbook.   Got to the front of the line, and (luckily) the same teller.   Before she could even greet me, I told held out my checkbook and told her, \"I would like to close this account, since this bank is no longer customer service oriented\".   She kind of rolled her eyes, but went about my request.   Then she asked how I wanted my cash back (an automatic response, I'm sure, and one I was counting on).    I said, \"$400 in $5's, $300 in $1's, $70 in rolled quarters, $25 in rolled dimes, $4 in rolled nickels, and $1 in rolled pennies.    The rest can be on a cashier's check.\"   No reason for her to deny it, so I got my change.\n\n\nAnd the following Monday, I returned, closed out the other 2 accounts I had there, and I opened accounts at a different bank where I have been banking ever since.\n\n\nEDIT:   So, wow, never saw this exploding this much....I have only read a few comments and won't be back online until tomorrow to read the rest, but let me clarify something from the comments I did read... I did not open or close any accounts for the business.    I closed my personal account and took the payout in small change to help the restaurant, then kept the larger bills for myself.    In essence, I made myself into the bank...I made change for the restaurant.   On Monday, I closed all of my personal accounts with this bank, and opened new accounts at a different bank, and deposited the $800 in large bills along with the money from my accounts.    Also:   this was 15 years ago, so banking at the time was not all done on a Smartphone, and none of my bills were autopay, I still wrote checks.\n\nEDIT 2:   Thank you so much, kind strangers!    My first Gold ever!   And I think it's only my 2nd or 3rd time getting silver, don't honestly remember!   Seriously didn't expect this to take off this way...",

I'm sorry. I didn't realize I would need to do that for such a small amount.\"\n\nThen she asked if the change was for me.  I said no; it was for work. She asked if the business banked with them, and I said no.  She said that she couldn't help me because I didn't call ahead, and the company doesn't bank there.  I asked if I could just do it through my account but was told no because there might be a fee.\n\nI just stared at her for a minute. I replied, \"so...you are telling me that even though I bank here and just did a transaction, I cannot get $100 in change because I did not call ahead and my company doesn't bank here.

Now, you want me to get in my car and drive across the street to your competitor instead.\"\n\nShe said, \"yes ma'am.\" We stared at each other for a few seconds: me incredulously and her very arrogantly. \n\nI went across the street, got change, went back to my bank the next day on my lunch break, and closed 3 accounts I had with them.

            "I had a similar experience many years ago where at a college I took a bunch of rolled coins to Big Bank 1 in the student union.  I had been doing this for years, and was never challenged.  Mind you, I did not have an account there, but the bank had a unique monopoly on the campus and a mandate to serve the community.  I escalated to a manager, being very polite the whole time, mentioned their special role.  No dice.  No account, no change.  At the time it was the start of online banking and I had an Amex bank account which had no actual brick and mortar locations.  Okay, so I went to local Big Bank 2 and told them about my problem.  They gave me a free account and asked if I could recruit any other customers.  \"Maybe.\"  I wrote a letter to the editor in the school paper and told my story about campus Big Bank 1 (and some other issues I now forget), and extolled the virtues of Big Bank 2 and noted they also had an ATM right on the campus.  Coincidentally this letter was published in the summer issue which was packed into every student orientation packet.  Apparently Big Bank 2 got a huge response, as they followed up and gave me a bunch of incentives.  Campus bank was way down on new accounts and the manager was *pissed* and asked a mutual acquaintance if they thought I timed the article for orientation on purpose.  \"You think!?\"  Ironically, that manager was long-serving, not a bad person, and years later got downsized.  She admitted to the mutual friend that I had actually been right in my criticisms.",

You can say it about yours all day, but not mine. So I flipped it back on her. \"Okay, if it's only $5 then waive it. No big deal, right?\" Nope. Okay, so adios. I closed every account.",

What my duties where, was to pick people up from the camp (where they lived for a certain amount of time, I was two weeks in, one week out) and take them into the plant and drop them off at a variety of dropoff areas (depending on what their job was), then pick up anyone that was returning to the camp for their rest period.\n\nNow, there where certain designated areas for the buses to pick up and dropoff (you know, a bus stop) and only buses where supposed to be parked in those areas. The issue was that people would keep parking their work pickup in the bus areas and block us off. We kept asking them to not do that, they kept doing it and eventually it all boiled over when a higher-up in the company started giving us shit over picking people up out of the designated areas (because people kept blocking the areas with pickups), we explained why we did it and the higher-up promised to do something about it, but never did.\n\nThe second time that higher-up gave us shit over picking people up out of our designated areas, my manager told us (the bus drivers) that the next time this happened that we should let him know via radio and then just leave. So that's what I did.\n\nNow, we didn't just spring this on our passengers. We made sure that every single one of them knew, that the next time it was blocked off, that the bus would just continue on it's way and leave them behind. When I spread the news to my passengers I heard a lot of laughter and could tell that they didn't believe me.\n\nHowever, the next day, it happened again. There where pickups in our areas once again and like the good little minion I was, I did as I was directed, got on the radio to my manager, let him know what was happening, and left.\n\nI understand that there was a number of interesting phone calls afterwards.\n\nBut we never had a problem with pickups in our areas afterwards.\n\nEDIT: Jesus Christ everyone, I make a quick post, go away for a few hours and come back to this.\n\nI am officially overwhelmed.\n\nThanks though.\n\nEDIT 2: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAA.\n\nWhy so many upvotes and comments and awards, you all have broke my brain.",

They were pretty large spaces so I said would you like me to park your truck for you? Or you can watch your neighbor park his he has a bigger truck than you right? Obviously he was angry about those comments but I had had enough of his shit and I just kept going until I basically told him to get a Prius because he didn\u2019t actually need a truck.

So I start calling him at 11am saying I'm ready for a pick up, he'd say the truck is being used and give him 15 minutes. Ofcourse I give a call after that and he'd say the same thing \"give me 15 minutes\". After awhile it was 5 minutes left till 12pm I'd give him a call only for him to say \"call the wildlife monitor to give you a ride\".\n\nFor the next three days I'd repeat it, give him a call at 11am and him saying give him 15 minutes only for the truck to be used by the kitchen crew.\n\nAfter three days of repeating he finally said I could start calling the wildlife monitor to bring me to work.",

Usually I am so busy with work while onsite or I am stationed somewhere with food options I don't want to waste my calories on and I don't eat anything the whole day or just buy a coffee.  \n\nOur employee expenses policy at work is $30 a day which is mostly fine. But there are some high cost of living cities and sometimes my meals go above that policy because there is not many options, especially if I want to eat healthy which is important when you are constantly on the road. Plus so many airports have completely shut down their food courts and haven't reopened them yet so there's hardly any options but fast food.  \n\nSo I submit my expenses one month and I have gone $1.50 over the daily limit because I treated myself to a coffee that morning as well as a lunch because I was tired after the god awful early flight I had to take.\n\nThe company had recently changed their policy and now a different set of people are approving expenses. The previous people didn't mind going over by a few bucks because it balances out with trips where I didn't eat anything but this new group are absolute sticklers and rejected the expense citing I was over the daily limit. \n\nI tried to argue I had 10 other visits that month in which I didn't eat a single thing but they still weren't budging. It really left a sour taste in my mouth. \n\nNow every single visit I force myself to spend as close to $30 as I can because fuck them. My husband is happy because it means I now bring back (slightly squished but free) food for him. I feel bad for wasting food but often I just buy a meal and eat a few bites and throw it in the bin.\n\nHowever, the expense policy is $30 a day and by god I am going to stick to it now. \n\nWhile in the past I might have billed $100 for the entire month because I didn't bother to eat, I am now billing twice or three times that. I also used to push myself to keep working all day but now I religiously take my 30 minutes to go and buy some food so that's 30 mins less work they are getting from me too.",

Then he'd ask for a gift card for random amounts of money, like $28.79, and charge it to his company card. He told me he uses the gift cards to take his wife to dinner on date nights.",

If you spend more (in this case, covering any work-related expense, not just over-limit food), the customer just has to sign off on it (since they're billed directly) for that to be claimable as well.

And even then if we were in a higher-end market (Vegas, NYC, etc) we could go over about 10-15% - the \"system\" would \"red-flag\" our expense, but our managers could authorize it.  You're getting a bad deal!",
            "Can I just say that I could have written this! Same job structure flying/driving out to sites, same billing/expense logging except we have a $60/day limit. Again like you, I just want to get the job done and tend to forgo lunch most days, opting to have a nicer dinner if time permitted. Always a coffee and muffin in the morning.\n\nHowever there's now an external auditing company that checks that side of the business and they have questioned the discrepancies between travelling engineer's trip expenses. I've been asked to spend close to the daily amount when I'm on a trip by my manager to keep things \"even\" across the board. You would think they would be happy you're saving the company money????\n\nWhere this gets interesting is that it's 60USD no matter where in the world you are. I live in Australia so our daily amount increases automatically regardless of the exchange rate...\n\nAnyway, something I do everytime I'm in Singapore is stay with my sister (her apartment is closer to HQ than the preferred hotels and she enjoys the company). Since my overall trip expenses will be significantly cheaper than my colleague's, I end up splurging on dinner (some times breakfast too) for both my sister and I every single day. Still no way near the daily limit allowed... though my sister is quite happy with the arrangement.",
            "The last company I worked for just gave me a credit card and said \"Don't abuse it!\" I had days where I would take a customer out from breakfast, another for lunch and a third for dinner. Sometimes it was a customer and his son or wife. One day I walked into a restaurant and one of my good customers was there with all the managers, about eight guys. I went over and talked to them and they told me to join them. I bought them all lunch on the company card, over $200. \n\nI bought food at grocery stores and had feasts in my motel room. Sat in bars and ordered a pizza, shared with with whoever was sitting nearby and bought a few drinks.  \n\nI never did find out how far I could go, never got a complaint from the owners. I seriously don't think anyone ever looked at my expenses, other than the secretary to entered it into the system.\n\nI was tempted to buy something strange to see if anyone would notice and then just claim it was an accident, grabbed the wrong credit card.",
            "We had similar in the RAF. We used to get incidental allowances which we didn't have to account for when we went on detachment.  The daily rate varied from trip to trip depending on the price of dinner at the hotel and the highest ranking officer on the trip. One trip I was given \u20ac120 a day for food.\n\nEveryone knew we would eat at the cheapest place close to us then spend the rest on alcohol.  This then changed. It changed to \"actuals\" and we had to provide receipts for our food to get the money at the end of each week. We were allowed two alcoholic drinks with our main meal which could be included in the receipt. \n\nIt didn't take long before we found a loop hole in the system.  We went to the same place each year and with that we became known. Some restaurants and bars would just print us receipts if we asked.  Some people even went around McDonalds just lifting loads of receipts as the admin staff couldn't prove that we didn't eat 14 big macs each.  We ended up getting back to incidental allowances very quickly after that.",

You should do the same.\" Cue malicious compliance: any work trip after that I only bought one coffee, but made sure to buy breakfast, lunch, and other beverages as well. Suddenly my expense claims were up to about $20 each trip. \n\nI also took great delight in reminding her she only needed one coffee if I ever saw her getting more than one, especially on business trips. I genuinely hated that bitch, and I don't think I've ever hated anyone like that. Fuck Carolyn. \n\n(She was always doign stuff like this.

        "selftext": "So this happened about 10 years ago when I worked at the box office of a movie theatre (before automated machines were the norm). Adult tickets (14+) were $11.99, kids (3-13) were $9.50 and kids under 3 were free.\n\nI had a woman come to my till with two kids. Now, these kids looked to be about 15, though it can be hard to tell sometimes. As many kids don't carry any kind of ID, the rule of thumb was to sell either a kids ticket or adult ticket based on how old the adult told us the kids were. Many people would abuse this and say the kids were 13 in order to save a few bucks. Typically, I didn't care as I understood the prices were pretty high and this was a big chain so a few older kids getting cheaper tickets wasn't a big deal. What was different this time is that the woman was very rude throughout the whole transaction. \n\nWe have a series of questions we have to ask throughout the transaction (loyalty program etc.) and we would randomly get scored by mystery shoppers to ensure we were following the script. This woman was annoyed and short with me throughout the whole transaction when I was being super friendly and just trying to do my job. When we got to the part about what kind of tickets she needed, it went something like this:\n\nMe: How old are the kids?\n\nHer: Why?\n\nMe: So I know whether they need kids tickets or adult tickets.\n\nHer: What is the difference?\n\nMe: Adult tickets are for 14+ and are $11.99, kids tickets are for 3-13 and are $9.50.\n\nHer: Oh, they're 13.\n\nMe: Okay, and which film would you like to go see today?\n\nHer: \\[whatever film it was, I can't remember anymore\\]\n\nMe: Okay, no problem, for 2 kids and 1 adult that will be $30.99 total.\n\nHer: Actually, I am not going with them, I am just dropping them off.\n\nMe: Unfortunately, this movie is 14A, which means you have to be either 14 or accompanied by an adult to see it.\n\nHer: Well, they're 14.\n\nMe: You just told me they're 13.\n\nHer: They're actually 14, I just didn't want to pay the price for adult tickets.\n\nMe: Unfortunately you told me they're 13. Unless you have ID that shows they are 14, I have to assume what you first told me was correct and cannot allow them to watch this movie unsupervised as it is 14A.\n\nHer: This is ridiculous, so what are my options?\n\nMe: They can either go to a different movie that is not 14A, or you will have to buy a ticket and accompany them to this one.\n\nAfter a lot of back and forth about options, she finally decided to bite the bullet and buy an adult ticket to accompany them. I like to think she spent the next 2 hours reflecting on how her attempt to save $5 ended up costing her $11.99 and 2 hours of her time. Realistically, she likely bought the ticket, accompanied them into the theatre, and then left them there to watch the movie while she went shopping. Either way, it still cost her the extra $11.99 for her ticket!",

        "selftext": "I work in a major pizza delivery chain that has so far been unsuccessful in out-pizzaing the hut. Our store is in a college town, and everyone is bored as hell right now for obvious reasons. So we've gone from maybe one prank call a day to at least 3-5. Which isn't much but still really annoying with how much more business we've been getting, again for obvious reasons. \n\nThe worst part is how uncreative and low effort most of them are. At least 80% of them are \"Can I get a boneless pizza\", or \"is this the Kristy Krab\", with the occasional *insert GTA fast food order copypasta here*. \n\nThis had been going on way to long so I took up the habit of just hanging up whenever someone starts saying some stupid shit. The boss wasn't too happy about this but didn't care enough to say anything until an incident where I hung up on someone who wanted that boneless pizza and he called back pissed because he actually wanted to order. \n\nSo I get a stern talking-to from boss man and he sends a message to the company's group chat app saying: \"I know we've been getting more prank calls than usual, but please don't follow in certain people's footsteps and just hang up on them. Take the calls as seriously as possible. If they order something we can't make, calmly explain it to them and offer them something we do actually sell. We want to try to make money off of them even if they're acting dumb\"\n\nSo the very next call is where the fun starts.\n\"Thank you for calling, what can I get you\"\n\"I'm soooooo hungry, can I get an extra-extra-extra-extra large pizza with tripple every topping\"\n\"I'm sorry ma'am, we can only go up to one extra and double each topping\"\n\"Hmmmm ok then. Can I get twenty XL's of each meat y'all have. So like 20 pepperoni, 20 sausage, etcetera\"\nThese people are obviously high as hell and giggling in the background the whole time\n\"Sure, give me a sec to ring it all up... Ok so that's 180 pizzas, the total will be $1000 (don't remember the actual price but close enough) and it'll take about 3 hours\"\n\"Awesome thanks! We'll pay with a check when we get there *dial tone*\" \n\nSo I place the order, and not 30 seconds later I hear \"What the actual fuck\" from the boss and he runs to the computer. \n\"How are they paying for this?\" He asks me.\n \"they said with a check, we do still take checks for orders over $200 right?\". \n\"They can't have been serious, was this a prank call\"\n\"Not sure boss, you said take all calls seriously\"\n\nHe just grumbles and picks up the phone and calls the customer, and all I hear is super loud laughter as he hangs up. \n\nMeanwhile, other employees have started actually making the ridiculous order not noticing anything weird about it. So by the time the boss finishes the call and cancels the order on the computer, there are already five XL pepperoni pizzas in the oven. So we got free dinner for everyone working that night as well as another message in the group chat app simply saying \"in regards to my last message, please just use good judgement when taking orders\"",

            "My dad hates having pizza delivered to him, I never figured out why. But he loves to call ahead and then drive there himself.\n\nOne time shortly after we moved into a new town (well, village really) we noticed there were only three pizza places. When trying them all out, I drove to one of them with my dad. He had obviously called ahead with our order and they said we should pick it up in 30 minutes. We were there 32 minutes later to pick up three pizzas. They apparently fancied themselves more of a restaurant than a pizza place, but they certainly weren't having a busy day. They greeted us and began working on our pizza. Didn't think too much of it, and the pizza was good, so we went there again two weeks later. Same thing, they say 30 minutes, we arrive on time, they just start making the pizza as we arrive. We ask why they're only starting on the pizza now that we're here when they said it would be ready in 30 minutes, and they kinda sorta apologize but can't seem to think of a reason. We try a third time, long story short, yeah they start making the pizza right as we ask for it. We just left and never ordered there again. We don't need disrespectful service even for good pizza. \n\nTL;DR don't tell the customer to pick the pizza up in 30 minutes, if you're just going to start making the pizza once they are there anyway",

            "Had a friend who smoked pot for the first time and remembered boneless pizza and in his munchied little mind he had to have boneless pizza. He called like 5 places before someone realized what was happening and talked him through his order. He eventually got a buffalo chicken pizza with the boneless wings put directly onto the pizza. \n\nI got all of this second hand, so I may have fuzzy details, but I do know that he was a black listed number by at least one of the places he called. \n\nIn conclusion all pizza places need to have a social worker to answer the phones.",
            "Am I the only one here wanting a pizza with boneless wings as the topping now?\n\nBoneless pizza sounds awesome. \n\nBBQ sauce and garlic parm. \n\nFuck it. I\u2019m calling Pizza Hut to see if they\u2019ll make it for me.",

            "Wow I would kill for pizza right now thank you.",
            "Surprised there isn't a policy in place for phone orders requiring a credit/debit card. Or a central phone service to handle the calls, as well as online ordering. Without those three things a pizza chain can't even consider out-pizzaing the Hut.",
            "Just ask for credit card information for orders over a certain dollar amount",
            "I had the same type of thing happen at the bakery I worked at. They learned their lesson after this and switched to requiring all online orders to be paid for before they would be submitted to the store and they switched to iPads for our registers so that online orders would just pop up on the iPad, so I guess it worked out. \n\nBut basically our store was so outdated that when a customer ordered something online it would come to us as a fax and they didn't pay for a separate phone line for the fax machine so we'd lose orders sometimes because not all employees were informed that if you hear a robot type noise that you need to hang up and not answer the phone when it rings again. \n\nSo an order comes in about an hour before we were to close for 10am the following day for 20 of our largest sheet cakes and they're double doozies, which means its two cakes with a layer of icing between them. So actually 40 cakes to bake. We roll out our cakes ahead of time so we can just pop them in the oven when they get ordered but with the sheet cake we generally only keep about 10 on hand as they are a low volume seller. The request for some is like half with blue icing between the cakes and others with pink and some with half blue and half pink. It seems like a prank order to me so I call my boss to see what he wants to do.\n\nHe tells me to call the customer and try to collect payment. I call the number given and it's not a real number. I tell my boss this and he tells me to try and send an email since they have to provide an email. Same thing, get an automated reply back saying it's not a valid email. My boss then says \"Well go ahead and bake them, I just won't decorate them in the morning and if they show up then I'll explain that we tried to contact them and ask if they would mind waiting.\" I was PISSED! I didn't get out of there till about two hours past closing because my co-worker was a minor and couldn't legally stay so I had to weigh and roll out 30 large cakes and bake them. And, as you can guess, the person never showed up.",
            "Used to work at a local Wings and Sammiches place in the college town where I lived, as a driver, while I was between jobs.  We closed at 1130, sharp.  I realized, very quickly, that the drunk/high people who would call in at 1125 for \"10 wings, all flats, extra crispy, etc\" for pickup, were not going to make it in by 1130.  Furthermore, we had several sketchy areas in our delivery zone that we just DID NOT go to, regardless of when the delivery was (several drivers had been robbed).  I got into the habit of answering the phone, late nights of \"Thank you for calling xxxxxxx, we're closed.\"   Management got pissed for a minute, until I reminded them that the kitchen was already almost broken down, and that there was no way we were going to make that order happen, and that I'm not driving ANYWHERE after closing for a $10 order.   Management agreed.",
            "This reminds me of my senior prom, where the catering place had noted the wrong date so when food was supposed to arrive, nothing came. Our teachers and principal suddenly had to rush-call any nearly pizza place in the capital and let some 400 pizzas roll in as they arrived. There was something wonderfully and magically comical about nine classes with each ~25 students about to graduate, standing around in their best dresses and smokings, having arrived in limos, semi drunk in champagne, now eating pizza and burgers from wherever they could grab them. They ordered so many that several students sneaked into the teachers lounge long after midnight when most people had gone home, to take a few untouched packs of pizza for hang over food next morning.",

        "selftext": "The malicious compliance in this story is not mine; it's my brother in law's.  Some of the details may be slightly off, but the overall story is true.\n\nMy brother in law grows avocados in California.  Several years ago, a portion of his ranch was ravaged by a wildfire, or so he thought at first.  When the smoke cleared, it became obvious that the fire was caused by an electrical line that was blown over by strong winds and had landed on his fence, catching it on fire.\n\nSince he had been planning on diversifying his crops anyway, he decided he'd simply replace his fence, replant, and move on.  To that end, he called up the electric company that owned the downed line and asked them for about $10K in compensation to replace the fence that had been destroyed by their electrical line.  They denied any and all culpability in the matter and told him that he should sue them if he didn't like it.\n\nWhat the electric company didn't realize was that my sister, his wife, works full time as a corporate attorney for one of the largest utilities in California, defending against cases just like this one.  At first she was concerned that this utility was a subsidiary of her employer, in which case there would be a massive conflict of interest.  Apparently legal departments frown on their employees when their husband is suing them.  Go figure.  Thankfully, after some investigation, she realized that the utility in question was completely independent of her employer, and at that point the gloves were off.\n\nMy sister didn't represent her husband because she's typically on the other side of these cases, but she did advise him on everything he needed to bring to court to win his case, and she helped him find a very reputable lawyer with a solid record of winning cases like these.  Not knowing what they were up against, the utility persisted in refusing to negotiate, hoping that by forcing my brother in law to trial, he would simply give up and go away.\n\nSpurred on by my sister's insistence that he had a solid case, he called their bluff and went to trial.  As it turns out, California takes agricultural damage very seriously, and the court conducted its own independent investigation.  It estimated the total damages at around $335,000, which is over 33 times as much as my brother in law had asked for initially.  Furthermore, there is a law in California that awards triple damages in cases where agriculture is impacted, so the utility that had been unwilling to negotiate over $10K was now on the hook for over a million dollars in damages.\n\nWhen all was said and done, my brother in law confided to me that he would have gladly settled for the $10K in arbitration and that it would probably have taken him over a decade to even sell a million dollars worth of crops.  The utility had to have their day in court, though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate:  So as I mentioned at the top of the story, and others have pointed out, I had some details wrong.  I spoke to my sister last night, and I got a refresher.  Rather than editing the original story, here is a list of things that I messed up in telling the story:\n\n1. This happened about 10 years ago.\n2. My brother in law's original settlement offer was 60K, not 10K.\n3. While they initially thought that the downed power lines were owned by a utility (possibly the one my sister works for), they turned out to be privately owned by a quarry, and that's who he ended up suing.\n4. The quarry didn't go to trial with this.  They ultimately settled in excess of a million dollars, so there is no way for them to appeal this.\n\nHowever, as I stated earlier, the overall story holds true:\n\n1. My brother in law initially offered to settle for tens of thousands of dollars, and they refused.\n2. He lawyered up with my sister's assistance.  My sister knew he was going to win this because as a defense attorney for a large utility in California, she'd been settling cases like this all summer long.\n3. After my brother in law lawyered up, the quarry ended up having to pay out in excess of a million dollars to settle the case as opposed to the tens of thousands that he was initially willing to settle for.\n\nHere are a couple of commonly posted misconceptions that are flat out wrong:\n\n1. This was an act of god, so no one should have had to pay, and my brother in law should have just sucked it up.  He didn't have to suck it up because the owners of power lines are responsible for ensuring that damage to the power lines doesn't impact nearby infrastructure.  They're responsible for placing the lines in a manner that ensures they are a safe distance away from flammable objects.  Failure to do that is negligence.  He didn't sue over \"acts of god\" like the loss of power or the damage to the lines.  He sued because he could prove that their downed lines caught his property on fire, and he could also prove that this was preventable by following the pertinent building codes.  See [https://www.pge.com/en\\_US/safety/yard-safety/powerlines-and-trees/laws-and-regulations.page#:\\~:text=General%20Order%2095%2C%20issued%20by,designated%20High%20Fire%2DThreat%20Districts](https://www.pge.com/en_US/safety/yard-safety/powerlines-and-trees/laws-and-regulations.page#:~:text=General%20Order%2095%2C%20issued%20by,designated%20High%20Fire%2DThreat%20Districts) for details\n2. My brother in law will never see a dime of that once the lawyers take their cut and the appeals are exhausted.  The fact is that because they settled in arbitration, no appeal is possible.  He received the majority of that money and used most of it to pay off the mortgage on the ranch and to repair the damage from the fire.  He sank the rest of it into the sizeable mortgage on his house.",

            "Super similar story near me. A farmer had a field bordered by the railroad and there was a drainage culvert that kept water off the field that ran underneath the rail. One year we had heavy rains and the field didn't drain like it was supposed to. Water stood in the field long enough that his crops drowned. After some investigating the farmer learned that the culvert had become plugged due to a cave in underneath the rail. He went to the railroad and told them about the collapse in their culvert and just asked them to fix it. They said no and told him he would just have to sue them for loss of crops whenever it flooded. He took the matter to his landlord (who owned the field) who was also the DA for the town. They sued and the railroad apparently never even showed up. He was awarded damages totaling the whole field (only about 20% of the field was lost) and ordered the railroad to fix the culvert anyways. They drug their feet again and the court fined them every day they didn't with the payout being split by the farmer and the landlord. After nearly a year of this, the railroad finally replaced the culvert. The farmer likes to joke that he made more off the culvert being plugged than he could've with it being clear.",

            "I'm going to have to call shenanigans until some concrete details/links are given. First problem is that why would a utility be held responsible for what is an act of God under the law? Did the utility company make the wind blow? I think not. If there was negligence (poor upkeep on the electrical line) why is it not mentioned? That too isn't a slam dunk because you would have to somehow prove there was something faulty and that they ignored it. This has happened with utility companies before but no mention of it here.\n\nLastly, the damages. There would have to be extreme negligence for a punitive judgment that extreme which is unheard of when there is no loss of life or some other immense loss. The purpose of lawsuits is to make you whole, not come out with a windfall.\n\nThe only story I can find after a short search about a California utility having to pay out in the millions for its neglected electrical lines is about the fires in Northern California that destroyed whole towns, not a fence and an avocado farm. But people died in those fires and whole homes were lost. That's when you get those types of numbers for damages.\n\nLots of problems with this story but I would love to know the real facts if something like this actually happened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Also, who asks for $10k when an independent investigation apparently estimates the real damages to be more than 30 times that?

I explain to her that hot fudge is indeed served hot but she insists so I make her a new sundae with magic shell topping instead and let her keep the hot fudge one. \n\nBy the time I return with that, this customer is stirring her spoon through another cup of cream ice (kind of like a sherbet) she ordered, obviously about to complain about it. The flavor she ordered was called \u201cgraham crunch\u201d and she proceeded to tell me that there wasn\u2019t any graham crunch in it. That she orders this flavor all the time and she knows that I am intentionally stiffing her. I tell her that this is just how the flavor is and I don\u2019t name or make the ice cream, but she isn\u2019t having it. She wants me to \u201cfix\u201d it. \n\nWe\u2019ve got some crushed graham cracker topping in the back, so as she is berating me I just walk away from her and grab the entire container and come back to the window with it. At this point, we\u2019ve got a line of people down the block because this lady has held us up so there are lots of witnesses to what I was about to do. \n\nWithout breaking eye contact with her as she continues to tell me that I\u2019m wrong about the ice cream I scoop 6 days a week, I open the lid of the container and empty the entire thing over her cup of the offending ice cream. Graham crackers are everywhere. Her ice cream is now definitely crunchy. \n\nShe loses her mind at this and starts yelling at me she knows the owner and will get me fired. I tell her \u201cYeah, Steve is a nice guy\u201d and she responds with \u201cI\u2019ve known Steve a long time\u201d to which I respond \u201cwell his name is John. Get out of here and don\u2019t bother my employees for free ice cream again.\u201d \n\nNow sufficiently embarrassed in front of the long line of customers, the lady leaves in a huff and indeed never returns. The next few customers left us $20 tips in the jar to make up for her, so the kids who worked for me left with quite a bit more in their pockets than they normally would and realized that their manager had their back.",

It was half the size(melted and refrozen) that it should have been, as it is made in a 5-inch deep bowl and it's about 18 in diameter... It should also have a cone dip on it and extra cone dip to serve as extra cone dip, I guess... \n\nThe waiter is asking the kitchen for cone dip when he should be asking me for cone dip as I'm the expediter and no one talks to the kitchen unless they go through me... That sounds familiar... But I digress... As he's waiting for pantry to give him cone dip for his illicitly gained dessert I hold on to the plate he's holding on to which now becomes a tug of war object... He grabs the cone dip from pantry, another illicitly gained object from the kitchen and he asked me to let go of the plate and I refuse which turns into a heated battle of Me versus him, he said and I said and a manager came out to qwell the fight...\n\n The manager asked me what is going on as this is my territory, my domain, my jurisdiction, my kitchen, if you will... I tell him the server is not going out of the kitchen with an improperly presentable dessert meaning it is trash.. in the meantime this is going on over a trash can... both of us are not giving up the plate... The manager winks at me and looks at the waiter and says go get a proper dessert out of the freezer... Waiter looks disgusted... huffs a bit... Has he lets go of the plate causing me to let go of the plate and the entire thing ended up in the trash... Seeing the trash can have just been emptied and a new liner had been placed, it crashes when it hit the tile floor but was contained inside the trash can... My manager says I applaud your effort thank you for keeping up the good work...",

            "I had a friend Billy who moved every year or two. First it was because he and his girlfriend decided to get a place together. Then there was a kid and they needed more space. Then another kid. Then another. And another. So he would ask us for help and would buy food and alcohol for us afterwards.\n\nThere was one particular friend named Kelly who had a habit of showing up at the end of the move, maybe just in time to carry a lamp into the house, but would then would stay for the free meal and beer. Every single time.\n\nSo when Billy needed help moving yet again we decided that the dinner would be on Saturday and the move on Sunday. Except we didn't specify which day we were doing what when we told Kelly. We just said the move was expected to take an entire day, so we were going to do the move one day and the meal another day. Then we asked Kelly what he was doing Saturday and Sunday.\n\nPredictably, Kelly said he had plans Saturday that he couldn't cancel but was free to hang out Sunday. Billy said that was fine, he could just show up Sunday around 1:00 pm.\n\nKelly shows up Sunday. On time for once. He sees a moving truck in the front yard as he drives up. He sits in his car for a couple minutes just looking at us talking in the front yard by the moving truck. He finally gets out and walks up to us, says hi, then asks if we didn't finish moving everything yesterday. Billy is grinning as he tells Kelly the move was always planned for Sunday, that yesterday was when we met up for beer and pizza. He told Kelly it's nice of him to still show up and help today even though he missed out on the free dinner.\n\nKelly kind of just walked around looking busy for an hour, not really helping move anything, then decided he had to leave.",
