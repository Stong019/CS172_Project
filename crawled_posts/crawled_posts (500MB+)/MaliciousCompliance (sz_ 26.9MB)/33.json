        "selftext": "A few years ago I worked at a physical media chain in New England. My location was new so when I was hired I was interviewed by the district manager and a higher up because the manager hasn't been hired yet.  When i applied I  made a very small window for availibility, but I was also willing to close or work later shifts and work all weekends, so they agreed, and even though it was a set schedule I did come in multiple times to cover someone else. The manager they hired was an absolute control freak, it didn't start bad but it got ridiculous. She HATED the fact that I had a set schedule, not because I was needed at other times, I was working the least desirable shifts,  it was because she didn't control it.  She even said that. About a year and a half of working there, and her dropping hints that \"we might need to renegotiate my schedule\" again, for no actual reason,  she scheduled me to come in 4 hours earlier on the day before my weekend \"just to shake things up\". I brought it up and she told me to make plans , essentially just get over it.  I was mad but I did just that,  my wife and I planned a date night when I would have normally been working. On the day in question I get a call saying that the person who was closing that night instead of me (she swapped me with a less reliable employee)  had called in sick and I needed to come in my normally scheduled time.  I was so happy to tell them that I was sorry but couldn't change in such short notice because I made plans. \n\nThe assistant manager (who was just as giddy as the manager was to tell me about the shake up) had to do a split shift and cancel a tinder date because I did as I was told and made plans instead of being upset.",

            "Hah, I love this.\n\nSomething about management in retail seems to attract control freaks.\n\nI have a similar story - for the longest time, my schedule was fairly normal and I had nothing to complain about - I'd often work morning or mid day shifts. Sometimes I'd need to close, then open but it wasn't really a problem since it didn't happen very often.\n\nThen two things happened. First, the person in charge of scheduling moved to another store, and second I started having to travel by bus. Neither of these things was a problem *at first* but it quickly became apparent that the new person in charge of scheduling *really* wanted me to constantly close and open two or three times a week. Since traveling by bus meant that I spent an average of an hour or longer traveling between home and work, I actually could not *get* an eight hours sleep between shifts.\n\nI spent a good month trying to explain the problem to her in a way she'd understand, and she kept telling me it was just a temporary thing from one week to the next. Finally she got tired of my complaints and told me that this was my problem and she just didn't care. She would not budge, or do anything to help me period.\n\nShe made it my problem, so I solved it. I changed my availability so I couldn't close on any day. Angrily she told me I couldn't do that, that I *had* to be able to close or she'd cut my hours. I called her bluff. Aaaand, yep. She did. For one week. Turned out, she couldn't afford to *not* have me do earlier shifts after reassigning people to close.\n\nHaving a stable schedule where I can sleep regularly is a lot easier on me, I gotta say.",
            "I can relate. Lol.\n\nI was a full time employee at a job and the manager would cut my hours AND ( very immaturely ) would put all the employees names on the schedule in order of who he liked best to worst. One of the last times he fucked with the schedule was when he dropped me from a 5 day week down to 2. When I complained to him I got a \"sucks to be you\" answer back. He scheduled very unreliable people to work 5 days a week for the next 3 weeks. \n\nAll the people he scheduled flaked on him. One quit. One was not even available to work the hours he scheduled, but he did not check. I guess he was just too excited to take my hours, and demote me to the bottom of the schedule.\n\nHe then texts me that I am now on the schedule at 5 days. I shot back a text telling him I was not available, as I took hours at my pt job when he cut my hours. He was pissed. Lol\n\nFelt great",
            "I had a similar experience with my second ever job, working at a movie theatre.\n\nI specifically took a night off of work to go watch an opening night movie with my dad. The thing with about my dad is that we don't really have a whole lot in common, but we both love superhero movies. It's basically the only thing we bond over and it means a great deal to me.\n\nSo we were going to watch one of the earlier MCU movies, and I booked the night off about a month in advance. I okayed it with my direct reporting manager and the location manager. I told them that it was going to be an opening night for a widely anticipated movie and I wanted to make sure that there wasn't going to be an issue. I got the green light.\n\nAbout 3 hours before the movie started, my direct manager calls me and asks if I can come in as the two other people working my shift came were both sent home due to being ill (nasty flu that was going around the theatre at the time).\n\nI told him that I had the time booked off a month in advance and that both him and his boss signed off on it. \n\nIn no uncertain terms, I was told that if I didn't come in that it \"may be seen as you not needing the hours and therefor they could be given to someone who was more in need.\" At the time I didn't really realize that I was being blackmailed into coming into work or getting fired.\n\nI ended up going in and covering the absolute hellish nightmare of a shift that was left for me and my dad went on to see the movie without me, which really pissed me off because (and this rings true to this day) I have seen every MCU movie on release night with my dad, with the exception of this one.\n\nMuch to my manager, his boss and corporate's chagrin, I had already covered someone elses shift that week and was already over 40 hours. Now, considering I was \"part time\" (in this case, it means keeping me at a solid 39 weekly hours as to avoid giving me benefits), this meant that I was entitled to overtime. It seems like nobody bothered to double check this schedule because I had a total of 60 hours that week due to shift coverage and the impromptu last minute call in.\n\nMy manager was fired after corporate called and gave his boss hell for scheduling me well over my hours for that week. Due to the aforementioned bug that went around the theatre, it meant that I also couldn't reduce any upcoming shifts I had as I was one of the only ones crossed trained across all of the different areas.\n\nAt 16 years old, seeing that next paycheck be nearly double what I was used to seeing was a bittersweet moment, although I still would have much rather had spent that time with my dad.",
            "I remember working for a  company that insisted everyone sending in a availability sheet before being hired. Well I  gave them one that said I was available 24 hours a day 6 days a week except for one day where I was busy for a 12 hour period, in the evenings of a day in the middle of the week. One day when I allow myself to be free from anyone's commitment.\n\nThing is, they never gave these availability sheets to the schedulers. First 2 weeks,  they'd ask if I could work that day and I would say no, why can't they see my available hours?? Turns out that management never hands those sheets in to those that need the information. Needless to say I never really lasted long there",
            "As someone who had to do scheduling, I appreciated those that had a set and reliable schedule as that provides fewer shifts to worry about.  It actually makes the job easier and more predictable for everyone.",
            "I worked for a copy center and the owner of most of the Arizona locations decide that from now on, everyone needed to punch in within the 60 seconds of their assigned time. If they didn't, they were considered late.\n\n8:00 on schedule, at 8:01 you were late and docked 15 minutes pay. Two late arrivals would result in a write-up.\n\nHere is some background, prior to this policy, most employees stayed later than scheduled to take care of customers or orders they were working on. It was commonplace and employees did it without any concern or question and customers loved it.\n\nAfter about a month & a half, every employee at every location was written up except my store and one in Ahwatukee. (Ahwatukee was the store closest to the owner)\n\nMy store was visited by the owner who was proud to say her idea was proving to be working at my location. I then informed her I had altered the timeclock, so it was 7 minutes slow. I explained that I only docked pay if they were 8 minutes late.\n\nShe wasn't happy and I was expecting a potential termination with my disclosure. She asked why would I do that against her wishes, and I replied that her policy was anti-productive and destroying store moral. I also added it created a danger that was going to, \"*likely get someone hurt or worse rushing to work*\".\n\nNo termination, but she had a habit of delayed retaliation, A week goes by and Ahwatukee has just 1 female employee who is the last employee left without a write up (also the owner's favorite employee). She was running late and called into the store to have someone unlock the backdoor so she could slip in as quick as possible.\n\nThe girl at the store was confirming that she would unlock the door when she overheard the car the girl was driving being hit by an 18-wheeler after the car ran a red light. She continued to listen as the girl in the vehicle drew her last breaths and died.\n\nThe timeclock policy the next morning was rescinded, all write-ups wiped away, the owner paid for the store workers mental health counseling and covered all the funeral costs.\n\nI know when the owner heard what had happened, with all the details, she could remember our conversation, hear my words of warning and feel their sting.\n\nEven with rescinding the policy and erasing any effects, she had changed the employee mindset forever across all her stores. No one and I mean no one would stay past their scheduled shift. The productivity fell 10% - 15% or more because employees passed work on rather than finished it. The norm became that the last 15 minutes of an employee's shift was used to shuffle 30 - 40 minute of work to the next shift.",
            "When I left retail hell for a better job, I told the boss (who basically pushed me to quit with his micromanaging bullshit) I would be willing to work part time from 4:30 PM to closing time, *Wednesday through Sunday*.\n\nI explicity told him I would not come in on Monday or Tuesday-those were my days off at my new job, and I was going to have two days to myself no matter what. \n\n\"Yeah, sure, okay!\"\n\nThe very next Tuesday, the phone rings.  \n\nMe: Hello?\n\nCoworker: *Wellread!  Where are you!?*\n\nMe: At home, in my living room.\n\nCoworker: *Are you coming in tonight!?*\n\nMe: No... why *would* I?\n\nCoworker: You're on the schedule!\n\nMe: Nope.  I told [Manager] I wouldn't work Monday or Tuesday.  I made myself pretty clear.\n\nCoworker: Well, he put you on the schedule!\n\nMe: Well, then he's on crack, because I'm not coming in!\n\nCoworker: Well, what am I gonna do!?  I have a doctors appointment at 6 o'clock!\n\nMe: What time is it now?\n\nCoworker: It's 5:50.\n\nMe: Well, you'd better get going if you're gonna make that appointment!\n\nCoworker: What about the store!?\n\nMe: I really don't care.  It's not my problem.\n\nCoworker: ...\n\nMe: ...\n\nCoworker: ...\n\nMe: [CLICK]\n\nIt felt great being in a position where I could finally basically tell those jerks I was working to live, not living to work.",
            "My first ever job was as a cashier at Walmart.  Started end of June, was starting college in August.  I handed them my class schedule, said i needed at least half an hour on each end in order to get from the college there.  All my classes were between 8 AM and 4 PM.  I worked 10-7 all summer.  Then suddenly, the first week of college, im scheduled 8-4, M-F.  Went to management and said they had my class schedule, why did they schedule me -only- during class?  They said i wasnt allowed to change availability within 90 days of starting, despite that being my availability listed at my hiring.  Then said the only one who could change was store manager, who conveniently went on vacation first week of college.  Yea, i never went back",

I arrived at work looking and feeling rough, she pulled the schedule to show me I was due in, I argued with her that the schedule had been changed.   \n\nShe was so sure she was right that she got the master copy, oops she was wrong, someone had changed the schedule, it was my day off, I didn't get an apology but I did get reimbursed my travel costs and got paid a 2-hour shift at time and a half.

            "I never understood why scheduling was so hard. When I finally got to a position where I was doing the scheduling, it was incredibly easy as long as their weren\u2019t too many PTO requests.

I let them know at least a month in advance. The schedule came out, i was on it, i told them, they told me to find a replacement, i told them i wouldn't per the contract, they told me i would. \n\nI didn't. They called me surprised as fuck because i was an awesome worker, but still chewed me out over their mistake. Told them i had scheduled that day off well in advance and that they messed up by not scheduling someone. Told me I was disrespectful, off all schedules and essentially fired unless i came in to grovel and apologize - i told them something like \"gotcha\"  and hung up. Decided i was done working there,  ignored all their calls trying to reach me, and enjoyed the rest of my senior year of high school without a job.\n\nShowed up like a month later to buy a smoothie and the general manager basically begged me to come back and that they had made a mistake, and he apologized to me for what the store manager had done.

Next few weeks go the same way. Scheduled on a day & time I clearly outlined as NOT AVAILABLE. Assistant manger that kept fixing my schedule quits, new manager takes over.

            "I just love when this shit backfires! \n\nKinda unrelated but it just reminded me of my first job. After I became part of a work council my boss tried to make me quit my job since he couldn't legally fire me and I was a serious pain in his ass.\n\nI didn't leave for another year and a half. He started not paying me on time or only partially in an attempt to finally get rid of me. Didn't work. \n\nThen he had the (bad) idea to double my hours in a final attempt to make me quit my job. He knew I couldn't work full time, he couldn't even force me to work more than my contract said. However, to his surprise, I gladly accepted the new workings hours and payment - trap card activated! \n\nBecause due to not paying me on time repeatedly before, I was already in contact with a lawyer since I wanted to resign prematurely (with substantiated reason). I did so the first day of the next month when my new working hours applied. When resigning prematurely with substantiated reasons you immediately stop working for your employer but still get paid for as long as your period of notice is, in my case: 3 months + the remainder of the month (basically another full month). He had to pay me for double the hours and I was loving it.\n\nBut that's not all. Because additionally I then got a compensation fee for him doing all these shenanigans as well as payments for unused holidays (I had 2 1/2 of unused holidays). And guess what? That payment scales according to the payment from the last 3 months of employment. You know, the time when I didn't work a single hour but got paid double the money. \n\nThat all was not at all apparent to him initially until my lawyer sent him my legal claims. He was furious and even threatened me over the phone which cracked me up (my lawyer was VERY upset about my behavior in that instance, I said some things I shouldn't have said tbh). But well, it all worked out fine, I got a better job while I was still getting paid by that idiot and even met him a few years later in a business meeting. I decided to not be a dick about it.

            "I was working at a franchised McDonald's location and, to be fair, when I hired on it was being managed very well by the franchise owner's son.  Very 90's style management, encouraging enthusiasm, but mostly treating employees fairly.  Cost of living was cheap in the area and the \"fifty cents over minimum wage they offered was sadly competitive for the area.\n\nI'd been working there about eight months when I decided to go back to college.  I was too old to qualify for most of the McDonald's scholarships, but I was still highly encouraged to do this by the store manager and I was promised, in writing, that I would always have the ability to restrict my schedule as needed to accommodate my classes.  I thought it was excessive considering this was a stupid part-time, minimum wage job.  I only held on to the paperwork because I thought it was silly.\n\nAnyway, a year rolls by and Franchise Owner's Son gets promoted and a true witch takes his place.  The worst kind of middle-management control freak that you've ever seen.  She treated the store as if it were her own little kingdom.\n\nAt the time (I don't know if it's still done this way) the store manager in a given location within a franchise got a big end of year bonus that was related to both the total profits earned by the store and by how many \"milestone\" type goals the store hit for both store improvement and community betterment.  It's a tiny store in a dinky town so it's never going to show much profit in dollar amounts, but if she can show on paper that the store is going above and beyond in self improvement and community improvement, her bonus gets bigger.\n\nSo while she really pushed us to take advantage of getting a small bonus for filling out a form saying we took so many credit hours.  But, at the same time, she wanted to \"promote\" all of us as much as possible to Crew Trainers and such.  You get like and extra nickle an hour but have a lot more responsibilities, including requiring an open schedule.\n\nI'd already been there almost two years by that point.  On top of that, I was twenty-five years old, I wasn't one of the ignorant high school kids that she was used to dealing with.  I just wanted to do my job and earn enough money to pay for my books.  I didn't give a crap about her games.  I had a perfect record and the store had a policy of never firing anyone, anyway.  They would just stop putting them on the schedule until they eventually found another job.\n\nShe tried that with me, but since she hired people for reasons other than their reliability, they always ended up short-handed and several of the other managers liked me.  So I'd get my ours and then some by being \"called in\" more often than not.\n\nI had classes from 4PM to 11 Monday through Thursday, so she deliberately scheduled me to close Sunday night and open Monday morning through Thursday morning.  Ironically, this pissed a lot of other employees off because it gave me every   \nFriday and Saturday off.  Had to or else I'd go into overtime.\n\nWe eventually reached a detente, due to events that were a much longer story.  Suffice it to say, I eventually quit by storming out in the middle of lunch rush and vowing to never set foot inside the building again.  Over-dramatic, yes, very much so.  But it felt really good at the time.\n\nAnd the really sad part is that she's hardly the only manager I've seen to commit themselves so deeply to these petty power games.  And she had more motivation than most.  Some don't even have money on the line.",

            "This reminds me of a story a lawyer friend told me about a pregnant lawyer. Apparently, even if you're visibly pregnant, you're still expected to dress professionally, even though a properly fitted set of professional garments is only going to fit comfortably for a relatively short time for a pregnant woman. \n\nThis pregnant colleague of my friend had to give some important talk (outside of court) while dressed professionally, and standing for the talk. When the talk was over (I want to say it was at least 1 hour, perhaps more), her boss caught up with just as she had hurried back to her office. He said he had something important to share, but she retorted \"I am changing out these clothes right now. If you want to talk while I change, fine by me. But I'm not spending another second in these clothes\" and proceeded to start changing clothes with her boss in the office. Her boss fortunately got the hint, and left the office quickly to give the pregnant woman her space.",
            "She definitely has me beat, but I'll share my story from the opposite gender.\n\nI got some grief from a judge for wearing nice shorts, the kind you expect to see at the golf course or Church. It was late June in southern Arkansas, so hell if I was wearing pants to deal with an expired vehicle registration.\n\nSo she starts with, \"You know, shorts *really* aren't acceptable attire in the court room.\" I found this ridiculous, considering the perfectly \"acceptable\" presence of low-cut sun dresses and open toe shoes on women.\n\nSo I replied, \"My apologies, your honor. I'll be sure to wear a skirt next time.\" The bailiff beamed at me and stifled a chuckle, but sadly I think the judge was too distracted by papers to really register my snark.",
            "This reminds me of my absolute favorite interaction with a judge I like a lot:\n\nIt was a Friday last fall, one of the first in months I didn't have any cases, and it was warm enough that I came to the office in cargo shorts and a polo shirt because I just had some discovery review to do. At like 10:30 am I get a call from this judge's clerk, who tells me that my client had tested positive for cocaine on a random urine screen that morning and because it was his third positive test in a month or so the Court didn't want him to leave the courthouse and wanted to address the bail violation. Since he was in person, I had to be too. So I figured \"No big deal. This is why I have a backup suit at my office\" . . . only I had forgotten I had dropped it off at the dry cleaners because it had been a while since I'd done that. So I call the clerk back and say \"I wasn't expecting to come in. I can be there in shorts and a polo\" and the clerk checks with the judge and gets the OK. \n\nSo I come in to the courthouse, talk to my client briefly, and then we head into the courtroom where they're finishing off another hearing. The courtroom is pretty deserted; outside of the court staff and us, there's one other defendant and his lawyer on the record with another ADA, and then my ADA. The judge smirked as soon as I walked into the courtroom, but finishes the case in front of him. As soon as the case ended, as the other parties were getting their stuff together, he went \"Mr. \\[Last name\\], if you want I can have my bailiff take a report from you.\" Confused, I went \"What do you mean, Judge?\" to which he replied \"Well, it seems like someone stole half your pants. That's an injustice that I imagine you can't stand for. Or probably shouldn't, anyway.\" The entire courtroom burst out laughing.\n\nI'd like to think that softened the judge up not to take my guy into custody, because it sure wasn't any legal argument I made!",

        "selftext": "This happened several years ago, and I am forever relieved I don't work in a restaurant anymore. Solidarity to all kitchen workers for the endless bullshit you have to deal with.\n\n***\n\nAt the time, I was working in the kitchen as an \"assembler\". This can be one of the most clutch positions on the line, as you take all the food being prepared by the other cooks and organize it into tickets that can be taken out into the dining room.\n\nAccordingly, it is often a bottleneck for food leaving the kitchen - if you have a slow assembler, cooked food dies under the heating lamps. Grilled salmon dries out, fries become soggy, linguini alfredo hardens into concrete, really horrific shit. It is **imperative** that food not sit in the window.\n\nI was working a weekday lunch shift, which is normally pretty slow. We must have provoked the wrath of the restaurant gods on this day though, because out of nowhere the store got hit with a tsunami of customers.\n\nI could just barely make out the other cooks through the clouds of shrimp scampi, fryer grease, and cheddar bay biscuits flying through the air. I knew the shit blizzard was headed my direction, and began putting empty plates up in the window with the \"shape\" of each ticket that was to leave the kitchen, a technique I had learned to help survive bullshit like this.\n\nOn the other side of the window, coordinating the servers, was my manager, Cuntface. Shouldn't use his real name, actually, let's call him \"Bob\" instead.\n\nBob was a bit hyperactive and had an irritating tendency to micromanage kitchen processes, a problem compounded by his not knowing how the fuck to run a kitchen. When I began putting empty plates in the window so that the incoming, Interstellar-sized wave of seafood had something to land on, he stopped me.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Bob asked.\n\n\"I'm putting the plates and their sides in the window because we're about to have a very high volume of food coming through\", I replied.\n\n\"Well, this is Red Lobster, and here we do the things the *Red Lobster Way*. We plate the food when the food is ready, and we don't put sides on early.\"\n\nI tried explaining that the *Red Lobster Way* was designed by sentient suits and ties physically incapable of holding a spatula; that our sacred *Way* (as dictated in the Good Book of Employee Training) had died in the trenches of last year's endless shrimp special; that, while I appreciated the job, I wasn't prepared for an honorable death at the hands of this rush to uphold its most obscure tenets - but he wasn't having any of it. Bob insisted that I take the plates out of the window and *only* pass him plates and tickets that were 100% completed.\n\nKnowing full well that Bob was flying us by-the-book into a storm of shit, I put on a feces-resistant raincoat, rubbed some Vick's under my nose, and braced for impact.\n\n30 minutes later, the window was chaos. Finished food was left dying in the wings of the window, while I - swiftly enough to avoid reprimand, but with the fatalistic, mechanical motion of a flood pump removing water at a fraction of the rate at which it's arriving - plated up one finished ticket at a time.\n\nBob was equal parts confused and furious, like a toddler whose toy was suddenly taken away. \"What's this food waiting on?!\", he cried, gesturing towards a shriveled up steak and its associated sides.\n\n\"Well, that order is waiting on some fried shrimp, and I need to wait for the ticket to be complete before I plate it up.\"\n\n\"*Why* is the ticket missing fried shrimp??\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, I'm not manning the fryer, sir, so I don't know.\"\n\nThis continued for the better part of an hour. It seemed like every ticket was missing one little thing that kept it from leaving the kitchen.\n\nAfter the rush had passed and I was dumping its precipitated, liquid shit from my galoshes, Bob approached me with the twitchy, nervous energy of a coked up boxer. Well, that, or a hyper-caffeinated, insecure manager who needed to assert his dominance over the underpaid crew of some bunk ass seafood restaurant.\n\n\"Can I, uh, speak to you in the walk-in for a moment, /u/namesrue?\"\n\n\"Sure thing.\"\n\nWe walked to the cooler as I struggled to remember how to fight off an attacker armed with a kitchen knife from my days in dish.\n\n\"So...what happened back there?\" Bob asked, arms folded, shifting his weight from one foot to the other.\n\n\"You said we should follow the system, and we did\", I replied, mentally noting that he was standing in front of the walk-in's only exit.\n\n\"But there were a lot of missed items on those tickets. We had food dying in the window.\"\n\n\"I saw it, yeah. It was pretty bad.\"\n\n\"So why was the food missing?\"\n\n\"I don't know, I wasn't cooking the food, I was assembling it. I am the assembler.\"\n\nThis line of questioning continued, with Bob trying to somehow pin the catastra-fuck of the last hour on my willingness to comply with his orders, while I blithely insisted that I did exactly what was asked of me. After not being able to move past this point for several minutes, Bob made some sweeping statement about \"doing better next time\" and left.\n\nIncidentally, the next time I was assembling and Bob was on the other side of the window, nothing was said about the *Red Lobster Way*, and the rush went smoother, albeit with some hotter plates and servers having to return for delayed items. I guess we ended up doing better, after all.",

            "One of the best stories I've read here.  I had quick glimpses of the kitchen as I was reading it, seeing all the plates of food coming up, waiting to be plated and trayed to be carried out to the floor.\n\n\nThe only restaurant work I've ever done was at a Pizza Hut that did carry-out and delivery orders only, so I wouldn't know the first thing how it really goes down.  But your story is one of the few that I actually imagined seeing myself doing, including having the \"chat\" with Bob in the walk-in.\n\n\nWhat managers fail to understand is sometimes the \"correct\" way isn't always the \"best\" way, especially in a rush.  As long as food is still properly cooked, orders are plated, and customers are happy, then don't fuck with perfection.\n\n\nI imagine the \"Red Lobster Way\" is fine for a normal rush, or what might be considered a normal volume during peak times, but when you have a HUGE influx of customers, especially during certain times of the year (Mother's Day, Father's Day, and Christmas seem to be very popular), it'll still work, but you're going to have a fuckton of angry customers.",
            "I was working Breakfast Shift at the hotel and it was rather quiet, so I was doing some of my side prep and getting stuff ready for the next day along with some misc prep for the lunch crew. All of the sudden we get a rush on in the front along with seating a 40 top and soon the ticket machine was spinning non stop.  \n\n\nI abandon my side prep and start staging in preparation of getting rolled over. Word travels fast and the pastry chef flies over in a panic to 'help'. It's just me on the hot side and another cook on the cold side and you would think that any help would be welcome but...  \n\n\nI had seen our pastry chef 'help' on ihe line and knew the chaos and clusterfuck wreck he left behind wherever he strayed. So I exclaimed, \"OMG, YES! I just got finished prepping a round of gravy and it is dying in the hot bath. I need to get that iced down and put away as soon as possible before anything else!\"  \n\n\nTo which his eyes popped wide and the ran off to get to THE MOST IMPORTANT THING EVER!  \n\n\nAs soon as he got off the line, I jumped in and rocked out everything that came through. I had worked with the wait staff for 6+ months at this point, so they knew how best to work with me and everything went as smoothly as things could while on fire.  \n\n\nAbout midway through, the Sous Chef popped his head around the corner to ask if I did actually need anything. I thanked him but said we had it covered. He nodded and went back to getting the catering ready.  \n\n\nPastry chef came back in a flurry shortly after everything died down to see what was next. I said, \"Oh thanks! It died off pretty quick, but you were a lifesaver taking care of that for me!\" To which he left with a satisfied smile.  \n\n\nI proceeded to clean up my area to get it ready for the lunch crew and took my carts back into the cooler. I also cleaned up the scorched earth mess that the pastry chef had made when I sent him on his task. And with everything done, went to go check with the banquet guys to see if they needed anything before I left.  \n\n\nSous chef said, \"Yeah, I want you to tell if you actually needed the pastry chef to do that for you or if you sent someone who is TECHNICALLY a supervisor to you on a wild goose chase to get him off of your line when facing a rush with a surprise forty top.\"  \n\n\n\"Well, you have seen how he helps.\"  \n\n\n\"Yeah...see you tomorrow.\"",

            "Fuck this restaurant. Red Lobster is a death trap. I saw employees slip on tile and get concussions and broken ribs. But of course they were just shy of full time, so no health insurance. \n\nWhen I was 20, my arm landed in the frier. All the way down, I felt the metal hardware at the bottom:\n\nI had just finished washing my hands and there were no towels, so my arm was completely soaked in water. As I was coming down the line to get a towel from the dish washing area, one of the employees spun around and slammed the basket down over my arm as I was mid-stride and down into the hot oil it went.\n\nThis was during a dinner rush and the entire kitchen gasped as I yelled (out of surprise) and pulled my arm out and wiped it across my clothes (while realizing halfway that if I was burnt, my skin would be coming off.) \n\nAnd my arm was steamy, missing some arm hair, and completely 100% OK. Not a single blister. Nothing. \n\nThe managers door has line of sight down the line, he saw the whole thing. I walk over to him, roll up my apron, and told him that I respectfully quit. I told him I probably won't get lucky a second time and I'm not testing it. He was still in shock at what he saw and finally mustered a nod. \n\nThe restaurant we were at was run flawlessly (it was located down the street from the local health department), the food was perfect, and fresh.

Some of 'em would have obscure-ways of dressing the same \"steak 'n eggs\" platters so they could charge different amounts, usually amounting to \"how much of the diced onions/peppers did you put on top of the steak and/or eggs\", coupled with their chosen sides.  (Fries are 4 minutes, onion rings 4.5, diced potatoes on the griddle were 6, AND those had the option of more peppers/onions/cheese.)  I was hired as a *cook*, but they'd frequently try to lump in \"...oh, and also you're prep, and the window (if one of our servers isn't there right-that-second)\".  Blaaaaaaaaaah.  (extra bonus points if they schedule you x4 others, and specifically tell you \"Oh...we brought you in today to be the DISH WASHER.\"  I *might* have had the same look of disgust, as Jason Lee did in \"Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story\".)\n\nThe last day I worked there, they had me on the line (and had a call-in on the prep/dish station), so I was furiously trying to ensure steaks were at mid-rare, while the sides came out on time (granted, only 2-3 orders at a time)....but ALSO trying to be the \"assembler\", all the while juggle in pre-portioning more potato chunks, tossing in more sweet potatoes into the large \"de-skinner\" thingy we had, AND occasionally running a rack of cups/plates through the dish machine.\n\nAfter 8 hours of it (10pm on a Friday), my boss had the audacity to tell me A) \"some customer thought your steak was perfect, and wanted to kick-a-buck to whoever cooked it\" as they handed me a singular dollar.  Secondly.... B) \"....our overnight guy got popped for meth, is there any chance you can fill in for the next 6 hours?\"\n\nKnowing FULL AND WELL THAT THEY JUST MADE HALF THE KITCHEN DROP IN THE PAST WEEK....I said \"No, I'm afraid I still have friends waiting for me\" (a blatant lie, as I have no friends), took off my apron, and tossed it onto the flat-top as I left, *kinda* hoping it'd somehow catch fire and burn the place down.  \n\nI get it, you're looking to get rid of the druggies, while keeping the people that *can* do the job (and that you believe you can bully around, and \"convince\" them to work longer hours until you find more people to fill less-important slots), but...naw, fuck this, I've seen THIS enough to know when I should cut out too.\n\nInstead, I was called (many times) on Monday asking when I'd be in, and that I'd need to pay for the apron I let \"expire\" due to \"....oil-related burns.\"  I told 'em I ran outta gas on the way in, payday wasn't for another week, and I'd be out-of-commission until then, so they'd best find *someone* to handle their cooking.",

Bob Evans was first for about a year, then I left and went next door thinking I would like it more. Hell no. The staff was much more stressed out, some of my hostess coworkers were uppity and my manager was a real hag, who went absolutely apeshit on me in front of the uppity coworker and some guests when I smiled a little too big for her when she offered me an early out. I told a BE coworker and she talked to my old manager and he immediately offered me my old job back if I was miserable at RL. I put in my two weeks at RL, and started back at BE the next day after school, alternating between the two until I was done at RL.\nThere were the usual bad days, but realized that my coworkers and most managers at BE were more friends/family and actually cared about each other. That store eventually closed and became an IHOP and after graduation I moved to a different state and ended up working at a Bob Evans there for three more years. I met my husband there, too",

        "selftext": "I like to keep fit. So after my work day, I usually go for a run in the nearby park. (I have stayed away from gyms, especially during COVID.) When my day is over, I slip into the women\u2019s room to change and then leave immediately. Except there was this one day, a few weeks ago, when someone (\u201cBecky\u201d)  on another team was having trouble running macros in Excel. I don\u2019t know the specifics of the document, but suffice to say, it was the final piece of the puzzle for a big account.\n\nSo, having changed and on my way out, I hear Becky call me over and asked for some help before I left. She\u2019s a good kid, new to the company. So of course I stop to explain a few things. That\u2019s when her team leader (\u201cLouis\u201d) stops me and says that I shouldn\u2019t be in the office working in my workout clothes. I\u2019m not wearing anything too immodest, but I am wearing clothes suited for running, so sports bra and shorts. I don\u2019t want to brag, but I am in good shape and rather...well endowed. Louis is sort of a middle manager who isn\u2019t powerful enough to be a kingmaker, but just powerful enough to cause a stink about company policies. He\u2019s also a repressed prude.\n\nI explain that I was on my way out, not just hanging out to work, and stopped to help Becky. Louis is nearing none of it. He insists that I either change back to my work clothes or leave the premises immediately. I\u2019m not going to let Louis push me around, so I apologize to Becky and leave the building.\n\nLater on, I learn that night was a deadline for some client deliverables and Louis\u2019s team didn\u2019t make it, costing the company the account and lots of money. (Low six digits annually.) Louis was fired for losing the account\u2014and for making Becky do a part of the project that she wasn\u2019t qualified to do, and that he was supposed to do himself.\n\nBecky\u2019s still with the company, and she and I are now paired in a mentorship program. I wish I could say that I jog past Louis sitting on a bench in the park every evening, but things don\u2019t always tie up that neatly!",

So fancy hotel got a new loading dock manager. Hubs showed up and started unloading the 375 cases that they had ordered, there was a wedding there that weekend. Well new loading dock manager threw a fit that he wasn't in a suit and tie. Told him to leave. He called his dispatcher explained the situation and waited outside for it to be resolved. It wasn't resolved by hubs delivering the alcohol as ordered and needed. The new loading dock manager refused to allow him to unload in a t-shirt and work pants, so dispatcher canceled the order. Well 2 days later, the big politico's daughters wedding happened and guess what...no bar because none of the alcohol was delivered.

        "selftext": "When I turned 14 years old, I got my first summer job and had one of the best bosses I'd ever had. I recently found out that unfortunately my mentor and someone I would consider a friend, John, passed away. Although its been well over 20 years I still use the lessons learned and the work ethic he passed on to me, although at times he could be hard he was more than fair and always did the right thing for those that worked for him. This is the story of John vs. the new president. \n\nBefore I get into the story I need to give some background and context on John. John was the textbook 'all American boy'. John had attended a prestigious boarding school somewhere in New England and eventually attended Yale back in the late 50/60's and was not only a scholar but a three sport athlete. He played football, he boxed and was a captain on the track and field team. Fast forward to when this story takes place and John was still in phenomenal shape for a late 60's early 70's man. \n\nJohn opted to move out to the country, start a family to follow his passion which was teaching at the local high school and coaching high schooler's in various sports. Obviously he was the high school football coach, taught track and field, he was an outstanding shotput athlete and could run the mile and many other long distances. \n\nAs a teacher, he had the summer's off and became a lifeguard at the local town beach, eventually becoming the captain of the lifeguards.  Over time he developed standards for the town/county/state lifeguards to pass. He really transformed what was a rag-tag style of lifeguard's into a full fledged official lifeguard corps, training academy and set the standards for what is still used today.\n\nJohn was eventually hired to run the lifeguards and manage an entire private beach club instead of working for the town beach. One of the biggest challenges of this, since it was a private beach club, John now reported into a President of the beach club who 'oversaw' how things were run. I started working for John as a helper on the beach and then eventually a lifeguard and for the first couple of summer's things were great. The President of the beach club took pride in having the best staff and making sure that lifeguards were well paid and to his credit safety was the upmost priority. This private Beach Club, certainly catered to the more 'wealthy' clientele who wanted a nicer club instead of going to the public beach. Some of the advantages were the amenities which were lockers, cabana's, private parking, a very nice restaurant that served great food and drinks. This was one of the few beach clubs that also had the ability to serve alcoholic beverages.\n\nOne of the good things John had instituted was that any returning member of the staff from the previous summer's automatically got a raise, this ensured that staff returned the next summer avoiding a lot of re-training and as you can imagine 'growing pains' with a new staff. What was even better was that if you returned multiple summers you still got an additional raise. Most summer's this was a dollar or two. As an example I started at 7.25$ at 14 years old (this was back in the late 90s) and by the time I was in college I was making almost 15$ an hour. \n\nTypically the president of the club serves a term which is a few years and when his term was up a new President was ushered in. Upon taking office the new president loudly proclaimed that he wanted to ensure that the club had 'fiscal responsibility' and he would be personally going over the books with a 'fine tooth comb'. His first order of business was to cut everyone's pay all the way back to minimum wage and fire most of the lifeguards. Now as noted above, the staff was there for a long time, knowing most the members and how to run the place. Prior to the start of the summer upon learning that their hourly wage would be cut, most of the senior staff immediately left and were quickly hired elsewhere. The lifeguards were spared at the appeal of John to ensure safety, although some senior guards left for other beaches and pools, John was able to convince the lifeguards as he would 'take care of things'. \n\nOnto the MC, while John agreed to have the staff take the pay cut, he convinced the new president that any lifeguards with additional certifications would get 2$ an hour on top of the base minimum wage. The new president obviously didn't consider that any of these lifeguards would put in the effort or if it was feasible to get any certifications in time for the summer season and he agreed to the plan. \n\nAs you can imagine, John basically established the process and curriculum for becoming a lifeguard and personally trained and hired most if not all the trainers in the town and county. John was also a volunteer fireman and new all the EMS personnel and not surprisingly had either taught them in school or hired them as lifeguards in their past lives. \n\nJohn quickly called in favors from every trainer and certifier across the county who were more than happy to repay all the favors John had done for them in the past. Most waived the training fee's and expediated the training sessions for the lifeguards and they 'wanted to promote' safety for the community.\n\nPrior to the start of the memorial day weekend and what is effectively the unofficial start of summer, all of us lifeguards and new staff become certified in pretty much every single possible certification that existed at the time. I mean I'm talking crazy complete overkill and unnecessary certifications for a 'regular' lifeguard. We got trained as either EMS and EMT's, although lifeguards had to be certified in CPR - we re-trained and got our CPR certifications again, Lifesaving ocean and pool rescue techniques, Certified Swimming Instructor, Certified Food Inspector (the club had a kitchen), Certified County Pool Operator license, Certified Sanitary Inspector (cleaning the bathrooms), we even had one guy who wanted to learn how to SCUBA, the county's firefighters had a water rescue team who coincidentally were certified SCUBA instructors, most of us guards become certified divers, open water divers, deep water rescue divers the whole works. I could go on and on about all the certifications we got.\n\nThe lifeguards not only went back to their original wage, but in most cases went well above what their previous wages were. At 18 years old and back in the 90s I personally went from making 15$ an hour to $27 an hour all due to the certifications and trainings. \n\nIt took a month or so for the fall out to happen, while the new president tried to renege on the deal, John was smart enough to have a formal arrangement in place and there was nothing the new president could do besides bitch about it. He winded up resigning his position 'to spend more time with his family at the beach'. We rarely saw him around that summer, and I think he eventually stopped coming all together opting to join another club. John made nice with the new president and explained his philosophy on training and keeping staff, the new president agreed and some of the senior staff winded up coming back with the promise of their original wage. \n\nA few weeks ago, I heard from friends and former colleagues that just at the start of the summer season John passed away in sleep of natural causes at the ripe age of 91. He was still working although not as much in the past, it was more of a I wanna keep busy type of thing then a need to work. Every morning he would take out the lifeguards row boat and get some exercise in, after all he was a Certified Rowing Instructor. \n\nRIP John, you were the best.",

            "I used to work with a widowed empty-nester like that. When her kids left the house in her forties she started taking a little bit of everything she could through the local community college. \n\nIn the 90's, when the company got email, the company policy was that you had to include all your qualifications as part of your email signature. She'd been at it for a good twelve or fifteen years at that point, so her email signature was a whole block of acronyms and initialisms almost two lines long.\n\nIt was a really odd bag, considering she was the real estate manager for a computer leasing company. \n\nStuff like flight instruction, phlebotomy, childhood nutrition and marine navigation.\n\nBut there were other ones she actually used. She was a certified fire inspector, meaning she called bullshit every time our sprinkler or extinguisher vendors pulled anything. Office and warehouse spaces were always beautifully lit, thanks to her certifications in industrial and commercial lighting design. Someone fall down and hit their head? She had EMT training, and she made sure our first aid kits were less of an afterthought and more something you'd see in a doomsday prepper's bunker.\n\nHell, when we did our yearly disaster preparedness runs we called her in. Certification in small engine repair and only missing the hands-on for a couple ASEs meant she was better than anyone else at diagnosing a generator no-start.\n\nOh, and the email signature requirement lasted exactly as long as it took for her to send an email to the CEO.",
            "Another quick story I just remembered about John. \n\nLater in life he got really into golf, and being the natural athlete he was, he got really really good. He went from never playing golf to being a scratch handicap in a few years. He also refused to join a country club and only liked to play at the local public golf course with his teacher friends, lifeguards (obviously) and the volunteer firemen. He eventually became the golf pro due to his charismatic nature and obviously his ability on the course. \n\nI asked him why he wanted another job, and he said well I get to play for free now! You could find John most of the week at the golf course either in the pro shop, on the course or if it was later in the day and hot out at the halfway house having a turkey on rye with onion and a cold beer. \n\nAnother golf related story, he let some the SCUBA guys go diving in the various lakes for golf balls, which they cleaned and resold for quite a profit. All they had to do was give John a few of his favorite brand, which I believe were Titleist 2's.",

        "selftext": "TLDR: I used to go in early, coworker tried to use me, I told her no, boss took her side, so I stopped coming in early.\n\nSo this happened back in 2015 through 2016. I (now 28F) was working as a phlebotomist in a local hospital and I worked first shift, which was about 3 am to 3 pm. I loved to come in about 10 to 15 minutes early and just set up my cart. Nothing fancy, just metal wired shelving types and we had our own personal phlebotomist trays that we put in the top section of the cart. I didn\u2019t always restock my tray before leaving my shift, so I\u2019d typically come in early to organize it and get my metal cart ready. (It usually took me maybe 5 minutes to put my tray on a cart and put the handful of tubes I needed back in place, then I\u2019d spend the rest of my time waking up in the break room with coffee)\n\n\nWell, one woman (can\u2019t remember her age) who came in to work a few months after I started and I had issues. I found her lazy and rude. Examples: she would come in and snap at people when they tried to help her. She would take a book with her during morning rush (which was 3a - 6/7a) and sit on the floor to read and not come back to the lab to help after collecting her labs. She would hang out during the nurses celebrations and not come back for hours at a time. She wouldn\u2019t clock in until the last second and then she\u2019d clock out the earliest minute she could. When it was time to start the morning rush, she\u2019d get mad if someone took the stack of labs she wanted and she\u2019d go demanding them. She and I worked the same overnight shift, but I got tired of her attitude and switched shifts.\n\n\nWell, like I said, I liked to come early and set up my cart before I clocked in. And she figured this out quickly, so she would try to hand me the stroke or trauma pager (something that needed to be handed to the next phlebotomist who was scheduled to take it that shift, but she\u2019d try to give me hers even if I wasn\u2019t scheduled for that one), but I refused, saying \u201cI\u2019m not clocked in yet\u201d. So, she just left it on my cart a few times without telling me, which lead to it going off for a call to the ER and I had to clock in early and when I saw her in the lab again, I told her to never do that again, the conversation got heated, which lead to a meeting with me, the coworker, and our supervisor. Our supervisor took her side and said \u201cJust take it and if it goes off, you clock in and then I will adjust the clock in on the computer\u201d, saying she\u2019d shorten my time on the clock.\n\n\nSo I said fine. I set my alarm for later in the mornings and I started coming in the last minute I could to clock in at 2:59 am. Yes, it made me start my rush a little later, but the look on my coworkers face when she saw me later (right before she was to clock out) as she was trying to hand me a pager I wasn\u2019t scheduled to have and I already had the one I was supposed to, was priceless. She complained to the supervisor, who tried to talk to me, but I said \u201cWell I\u2019m not supposed to be here until 3, so that\u2019s when I get here and clock in now. I don\u2019t want my hours messed up\u201d. She didn\u2019t even try to argue. The coworker was very upset. She even screamed through the lab, demanding someone take her pager so she could go home. It was still 20 minutes until her shift was done.\n\n\nEDITS: Added the TLDR and paragraphs as suggested! Thank y\u2019all for the suggestions!!",

It was not unusual for me to work 11 or 12 hours a day though I was scheduled 8. Don't worry, they were editing the schedule so I never got overtime though. Wish I could say I'd quit the job over this, or that I'd reported it to someone, but I didn't know any better back then in the 00's.\n\nAt a more recent job, I was being told to do multiple impossible things by management - one insisted I had to stay late until my work was done every night, one insisted if I was in the building I had to start working no matter how early I was for my shift, etc. Upper management had a snit and told me I couldn't work beyond my shift hours period or they'd start writing me up. So I adjusted my availability so I wouldn't be sitting around for an hour before work, and started immediately leaving after my shift was over. Nobody was happy with that except me, and I got threatened a few times with getting written up because I wouldn't start early/stay late anymore. Unsurprisingly, they didn't.

The last time she did that, I told her I wasn't clocking in until my posted time and if she left, the lab wouldn't be covered.

There also sometimes was traffic problems or paperwork so 15 minutes as buffer was fine. I'd usually be ready 5 minutes before my shift starts. and because I was there, the previous shift could already leave while I changed clothes.\nBut then my coworker T came around. Always trying to control things, and he disliked how I'd be too early and \"collect too much overtime\"..even though at the time I'd end my shifts up to an hour early and actually make ngeative overtime. Anyway T told me to \"clock in on time\", he wanted me to come early, change clothes and only then clock in right before going to work. so if I was 15 min. early I should change clothes and clock in so I'd make less than 5 min. of overtime.\nI did maliciously comply, and ended up clocking in riiight when my shift starts. so my shift starts at 10AM, I'd clock in at 10 and then change clothes slowly, and only then get to work. as result now everyone else had to stay 10 minutes longer. of course people were pissed and tried to give me shit, so I went back to my old system and they stoped complaining.

        "selftext": "Recently discovered this subreddit, and love it. First time poster, English not my native language, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I was about 16 or 17, like any other kid at that age, I desperately wanted to go to a party all my friends went to. All of my friends were older than myself, so they had no curfew, or were allowed to stay very late. My dad, however, was a pain in the ass at that time. Or at least, that was my perception. He wouldn't let me go anywhere, and when I was allowed to go, he'd give ridiculous curfews that held no account with the nature of the event. E.g. going to the movies at 8, but demanding to be back home at 10... that kinda limits your choices, right? And you don't want to be *that* friend who puts constraints onto the group.\n\nSorry, I digress. Anyway, that particular day, I negotiated for him to give me a later curfew. After a while, he stated that 2 AM was the absolute latest I should be home. That sucked, because most of my friends had a 3 AM curfew AND the party was at least a half an hour bike-ride away. So this would mean I would miss more than 1h30 of the party (yeah, severe case of FOMO here). I tried to negotiate some more, but then I realized what date it was. Enter Malicious Compliance.\n\nYou see, it was the last weekend of October, on a Saturday. I don't think this is the same everywhere, but in the larger part of Europe *this means that Daylight Savings Time ends.* At exactly 3 AM, clocks are set back one hour. So I went to the party, not by bike. I asked for a friend to drop me off, making sure that I would be there exactly on time. I made sure that my dad didn't hear me a minute too soon (because then, I would be almost an hour late!). At exactly 3 AM (or better: 2 AM for the second time), I opened the door and got in.\n\nNeedless to say he was furious, demanding an immediate explanation as to why I was an hour late. When I said I was exactly on time, pointing at his own radio-controlled watch, I could see his face turn all kinds of red, and an awesome mix of defeat and anger in his eyes. He sent me to bed, knowing I was right, and I complied, knowing I was very wrong.\n\nNevertheless, it was an awesome victory!\n\nEdit: Some context on the curfew. 2 AM was definitely a reasonable curfew. Not exceptional though: it's very often something like 1AM for 16yo, 2AM for 17yo, and as of 18 you're legally an adult, so do whatever the hell you want.\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for the awesome reactions (and for the silver, wow!)! I always assumed this was the kind of story where everbody would know somebody who pulled this off.\n\nEdit 3: Holy \\*\\*\\*, this kinda exploded overnight. Thanks for the replies, upvotes and even my first gold! And to all those commenting what a sh\\*tty kid I was to my dad: of course this was an inconsiderate move to make. But first: kids will be kids. Second: this subreddit is called r/MaliciousCompliance. Not r/GoodyTwoShoes  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\n\nEdit 4:   \nI live in Belgium. Judging by most the comments, the curfews mentioned in the story and in my first edit may look ridiculous for the average American, I didn't realize this. But really: these are pretty average for a European country.\n\nAs for the \"18, do whatever the hell you want\": this comment obviously applies to curfews. Once you reach the age of 18, a lot of parents here don't give curfews anymore, yes, even when you're still living in their house. Basically: \"Bring breakfast when you get home by morning, and don't do anything stupid\".",

The youth center's permit allowed us to stay open until 2 AM. You can see where this is going I suppose... we went on partying until 2:59, then ended it at 2:00 :)\n\nIt probably helped that our parties had a good reputation, even with the local cops. They stopped by earlier in the evening and they usually would also show up around closing, except that one year.

        "selftext": "Back in the early 2000s I was a management trainee for a manufacturing company in the UK, and I was responsible for quality control and production management. I was 22 years old, keen as punch and ready to change the world.\n\nAbout 11 months into the role, I got a new boss, let's call him \"Fred\". Fred was also the company owner's son, and was basically a 45 year old fuck up who had only ever been a drug dealer/DJ and now stood to inherit the entire company. His management style was, let's say, 'interesting' and he would deviate from \"screaming at you for the most benign thing ever\" to \"I can't deal with the pressure so I'll go home for the day\" in a matter of hours. He also thought he was a manufacturing GENIUS. His ideas were batshit crazy, but he would scream at anyone who questioned him.\n\nThere was a 52 year old machine operative, let's call him \"Roy\", who has worked on the same machine for over 30 years. Roy could tell when his machine was 2 weeks away from a breakdown, just because it sounded different. He was truly at one with his machine.\n\nFred decided that we would modify Roy's machine so that we could extend the range of products we could manufacture. In order to do this, he decided that we would add an additional spindle to the machine. The problem was that each product would finish at a different time and you would need to remove a product from the machine while the other one was still spinning.\n\nRoy protested and said he'd never use it, but Fred went ahead and modified it over the weekend with a subcontractor.\n\nOn Monday, Roy said \"you must be joking, I'm not using that\". Fred said \"you will use it, or you'll be looking for a new job tomorrow.\" Roy said \"it's not safe and I won't use it. If you try to make me I will report you to the HSE.\" And then Fred said \"if you report me, I'll make sure you don't find work ever again\".\n\nSo Roy smiled and said, \"ok, fine, I'll load the next job but you can run it first.\"\n\nRoy loaded on his next job, and took two steps back...he also looked at me and said \"stand back\".\n\nFred started the machine and all went well.... for about 30 seconds. \n\nThe first job had reached the diameter required and Fred pressed 'stop', however he now had to lean over the other job that was still running at 2,000 RPM. I didn't see it happen but I heard an awful scream and then saw blood squirting everywhere. Fred fainted onto the machine, narrowly missing the spindle with his face and greasy long black hair. We pressed the emergency stop and picked him up, and it was then I spotted his fingers in the machine. I picked up two middle fingers and gave them to a colleague to put into a freezer bag, which was a waste of time because they couldn't reattach them, they were too mangled.\n\nFred never came back to work. Apparently he told his father he wasn't cut out for running the company and I also left about 6 months later. I saw recently that it was bought out in a management buy out and good old Roy was the operations director. Good for him!",

        "selftext": "This took place during the first summer of lockdown where I live. \n\nSome context for you- My town is basically on the edge of nowhere. We have a medical centre for basic stuff but a full hospital is 30 - 40 minutes in any direction depending on where you chose to go.  With that in mind, we get people from a huge surrounding area that go to our town centre for tests , simple medical exams , etc. Maybe as many as 50 small communities use our centre on a daily basis so it is constantly busy. The centre itself is quite small compared to hospitals in the city. The various clinics and a basic ER take up most of the space with an area by the front doors for the public to sit in if they are waiting for a ride or someone visiting a doctor. It is that waiting area that is the cause for my story today.\n\nOne day during the first summer of lockdown here, I had to go to the medical centre for tests. Some things to know about me. I am challenged with multiple disabilities. I am legally blind, have significant mobility and balance issues and a rather severe heart condition. As such I use a walking frame and travel using the cities provided disabled transports.\n\nThat particular day, I had finished my tests early and had 45 minutes to wait until my transport was scheduled to return to pick me up. I figured - no problem, i will just sit in the waiting area and - well - wait! haha. I shuffled over to the seats with my walker plainly evident and was confronted by a new sign. STAFF ONLY.  Say what now? I looked around at all the empty seats and vacant tables and turned to the clerks at the entrance. \n\nMe- Can I please have a seat in the waiting area until my transport come back?\n\nClerk- (coldly) NO its staff only. YOU need to wait outside! \n\nMe- uh I cant stand for 45minutes waiting for my transport (gesturing to my plainly apparent walking frame that i was clearly leaning heavily on) \n\nClerk- Not my problem! There are benches to sit on outside . \n\nMe- The benches are full and we are supposed to be social distancing not cuddling up to random strangers on a park bench!\n\nClerk- If you want i suppose I could let you take a wheelchair out and sit in that. \n\nMe - And how am I to manage a wheelchair AND my walking frame at the same time?\n\nClerk - again , not my problem. If you want you can call centre management when you get home. Are we done here?\n\nMe - I guess we are done huh. And went outside to find a spot to wait.\n\nWell I stood outside for the 45 minutes while the sun beat down on what turned out to be 104 F day. As I stood there , I noticed that there was a line of patients growing steadily longer also standing outside in the heat waiting to be let into the building. Some looked fit but lets face it- nobody comes to a medical centre because they feel 100%! Most of them looked quite ill and some were looking pretty faint by the time they got through the doors. By the time my transport arrived, I was badly sunburned , thirsty as hell, exhausted and feeling more than a bit faint myself! My driver was shocked and insisted on walking me to my front door when he got me home to make sure I was ok. (shout out to all transport drivers you guys ROCK!)\n\nThe rest of the day was a complete loss. I spent it drinking water, sleeping and nursing the burns on my shoulders and face lol. I was a right mess! The next day, however, I was pissed. I had plenty of time to recover and to think and I kept coming back to that line of patients standing in the heat. The more I thought about it, the angrier i got!\n\nMalicious compliance.\n\nThe words the clerk so smugly said- you can call centre management when you get home if you want- danced through my sunbaked brain like a mantra. I called centre management. What followed was a half hour conversation with the SWEETEST lady . She was SO nice and so upset when I told her all that went on the day before. She was especially concerned when she found out about the line of people waiting outside one what turned out to the the hottest day we had that summer. After our talk, the manager promised to look into it and get back to me. Now normally that's sort of a brush off, right? Not so with this lady.\n\nTwo days later, she called me back. Turned out, she had spent the day before sitting at the clerks desk observing things that went on. Things like\n\n\\- Patients being forced to stand in the rain waiting to get into the centre\n\n\\- Patients being poorly spoken to by the same clerk.\n\n\\- And the cherry on top? At one point a tiny, elderly lady tried to sit down in the waiting area and the SAME clerk ran over and rudely shoved her aide and snapped STAFF ONLY!  With her boss sitting right there!\n\nThe Manager went over , tore down the signs, apologized to the lady and helped her to a seat then took the clerk into her office for a - chat. \n\nThe Results\n\nThe centre was immediately restructured.  Staff were moved into an unused gift shop , the waiting room as returned to the public and best of all? The registry desks were moved so patients no longer had to stand outside waiting to get into the building! \n\nI never saw that clerk there again. \n\nI know this isn't as exciting as most stories on here but knowing I was part of making things so much better for so many still makes me happy !\n\nDangit I am proud of my mini- coup Hahaha Vive La resistance and all that crap!\n\nEDIT to add- THANK YOU all for all the positive feedback and awards!  You really make this human feel loved. \ud83d\ude0a",

            "A delivery driver was giving me a hard time at work the other day, yet I just make the orders in the order they show up on my order screen, then I bring it outside, call out the order number, and hope the driver pays attention to their app notifications (I press \u201cdone\u201d on a tablet and it\u2019s supposed to notify them to come to the door). \n\nSo this one guy is just constantly ringing our doorbell. He\u2019s not new, he knows how we do things. I ignore him and eventually bring out my next order. He\u2019s in my face. He\u2019s telling me this and that, asking why it\u2019s taking so long, when he can see how fucking packed my drive thru is, plus the other delivery drivers around him. So I just said, \u201cI\u2019m making them in the order they show up.\u201d Then he pulls out a second phone, and tells me \u201cI have another order, get that one next.\u201d Now, the app/delivery service he works for does not allow their drivers to take more than one delivery on at a time, and he\u2019s gotten a second phone to work around this rule. \n\nI don\u2019t use DoorDash a lot because they have the multi-order feature for drivers, and I\u2019d like to get my food delivered directly from the restaurant, so this place caters to people like me. So after I go get his second order, something that I\u2019m normally too busy to deal with (reporting him to the app means I have to spend a bunch of time on the phone/at the computer when I\u2019m needed elsewhere), the phone rings. \n\nIt\u2019s the delivery service support. They seem flustered. They\u2019re asking \u201cwhere is order # 123? The driver says they\u2019ve been waiting for a while.\u201d \n\nI quickly recall, hey, that impatient guy with the two phones had order # 123. \n\n\u201cSo I just sent that order out, but the reason he was waiting so long is because he\u2019s using two phones to take more than one order at a time, I know that\u2019s against your policy, and he would\u2019ve been able to leave for his delivery on the first order pretty quickly had he not stuck around for the 2nd one.\u201d She immediately changed her tone from flustered to concerned and she assured me that they would address it. \n\nSo buddy decided to call support and talk shit, and got himself reported when I wouldn\u2019t have had time otherwise. Way to go buddy.\n\nYour post just reminded me of that whole ordeal last night, where someone tries some bullshit when they\u2019re clearly in the wrong and it backfires on them.",
            "My guess is that this began at a high level because of recommendations (or restrictions) coming down from federal health entities which stipulated patients may not congregate in waiting rooms.

I shrugged my shoulders and just stayed there.\n\nAround 2am I was seen by a overly exhausted ER doc who took one look at the gaping would I had in my side and loudly demanded to know why I kept getting pushed down the list. That same ER worker got a bit green looking at the red/black/yellow/green fluids that stained the insides of my uniform and just replied, \u201cshe wasn\u2019t complaining\u201d\n\nThe doc asked how much pain I was in and i again shrugged. I had had that pain for two weeks, I didn\u2019t know how bad it was anymore. Then he poked my insides and I cried. Got me some morphine, a room, and surgery at 8am.",

            "Those people are the worst and don't belong in healthcare, I can sympathize! \n\nLast year I had a pregnancy scare (was not pregnant, just stupid bloodless period, see explanation below) and the planned parenthood clerk (OB for Obstructing Bitch) asked a lot of pointed questions about my intentions. When I told her I would definitely not be continuing a pregnancy *if tested positive* she cancelled my appointment *for the pregnancy test* and told me to contact a different PP location to arrange for testing, this same place would do termination procedures if test returned positive. Now, this was in the middle of covid so already I had waited two weeks for this appointment. The other location not only told me I'd have to wait another two weeks, but also, they told me straight up that what I was told by the OB was 100% wrong.\n\nSo I called Planned Parenthood headquarters. The lady I talked to was very upset about what I was told by the OB and arranged an appointment a few days later, no waiting two weeks for me. The person I talked to at this new appointment (same location the OB worked at) didn't ask ANY of the questions the OB did, nothing about what my intentions were, it was a completely different experience that aligned with what I had originally expected.\n \nMy guess was OB was some pro lifer who infiltrated PP with the intention of sabotage. It's the only explanation I can think of to explain her behavior and the extreme differences between these two visits. Those people are scum and I hope OB miscarriages and is refused adoption or foster because no child deserves to suffer her as a \"mother.\"\n\n__________________________________\n\nBC Explanation: for those wondering, I do take \"birth control\", but really all it does is control my menstruation by making my hormone levels fall within normal. My periods, without the medicine, is so extreme, that with birth control I have *normal* cycles, with only the occasional bloodless periods - girls with normal periods tend to have no bleeding at all or only the occasional spotting when on birth control. In fact, according to my doctor, with birth control I am more likely to get pregnant than without it, but without it well, it's a really awful painful experience. When I was a teen I'd cope by taking triple doses of Tylenol/Ibuprofen until I passed out. I'm surprised my liver still functions.\n\nI finally have money though that I can consider permanent procedures to completely remove my risk of pregnancy.",

A bunch of rules, it\u2019s government after all. They can only have 22 beds, no icu, 72 hour stay or be transferred to a bigger hospital. A bunch more. \n\nAnyway, people will come to our ER because you can get right in for treatment. If you need to be transferred to a bigger hospital you go by ambulance and get right into their ER because you are a transfer. The doctors in the ER are good, because if they aren\u2019t they don\u2019t stay long. The nursing staff cares because they know you or your family. \n\nYou seldom have to wait for lab or X-ray. Register, go to the department and get right in to have blood drawn, your X-ray or CT, etc. They would never make you wait outside. That\u2019s just a lawsuit waiting to happen. People come from the city 30 miles away because the service is so much better. If it\u2019s something the hospital isn\u2019t capable of treating you are taken by ambulance or helicopter to larger hospitals. \n\nIf possible, you might want to look into small hospitals for routine stuff and if it\u2019s not life threatening emergencies it might be faster to drive to a small hospital for treatment.",

            "I honestly didn\u2019t even think of how my doctors office handled patients who used a transport company to get to their appointments. They had us sit in our car, call in and talk to the nurse, they\u2019d ask the questions they would already ask in the exam room that can be asked over the phone and then had you come to the door for the temp check. Normally, I  am in the waiting room for a minimum of 25 minutes past my appointment time (so sitting for 40 minutes minimum in the waiting room) before my doctor is finally able to see me. The three? I believe times i went for my script appointments I called in and one phone ring, a few questions and a temp later I was in a room. No idea if they cut down on the amount of appointments allotted daily to do that, or if I just got ungodly lucky for the first time in YEARS of being with my doctor to get in right away the few times I would\u2019ve been waiting in my car.\n\nYeah, my point was I wonder how my doctors office handled transport patients during that time.

The day after they discovered that I had it, they went right in and snipped it out. (This led my nephew to refer to me from then on as The Semicolon.)\n\nWell, that wasn't bad at all! They sent me home a day or two later and I convalesced. \n\nThen came chemo.\n\nImagine you've got one of those \"shotgun houses\" -- constructed in such a way that if you shoot a shotgun in the front window, there are openings such that some of the shot hits the back wall.\n\nWell, this chemo is like that. They've cut out all the tissue that they think has cancer cells, but just to be sure, they're going to shoot a chemo shotgun into my body over and over and over, expecting that if there are any little cancer cockroaches crawling around the house, sooner or later they'll all be killed by the huge amount of shot.\n\nEvery two weeks I got an infusion of chemo, which took about six hours and totally drained me of energy. I then would make my way over to the waiting area, where my wife would pick me up. She was anywhere from zero to fifteen minutes from the waiting area.\n\nThe waiting area? The outside waiting area. (Or the inside area, where I might miss my ride.) Well, the weather was not horrid, but still, I was tired. There were no chairs of any sort outside the exit. But wait -- there was a nearby area enclosed by a short fence, just perfectly placed so I could see my ride arrive.\n\nThe sign on the gate said SMOKING AREA. Again, this was a dozen years ago. There was always someone in there.\n\nAfter the third or fourth time of being discharged and finding I had to wander around on shaky legs, waiting for my ride, I made up my mind to go home and write a letter, tearing them a new one for making me toddle around while so wiped out.\n\nAfter I wrote the letter, I thought better of it and wrote a letter designed to elicit sympathy while pointing out the stupidity of the situation.\n\nThings never changed.\n\nBut six months later I had to go back there for a checkup, and I was greeted outside the hospital entrance by several rows of chairs, some placed in the shade, some in the sun, right where they were needed.\n\nIt was a good feeling, and I hadn't had to blow up.",
            "For those who can't see it...\n\nThe malicious compliance is as follows: The clerk said \"If you want you can call center management when you get home.\"\n\nOP does so and an investigation was opened resulting in the firing of the clerk.",
            "Great story of justice! That clerk is a literal scum. Good that she got what she deserved. Kudos to the manager as well.",

I am so glad you did your mini revolution for that centre.",
            "Sometimes you can't ignore a justice boner.  Well done.",
            "That\u2019s what I don\u2019t get. It doesn\u2019t take anything to be nice. Not a thing. Kind words, gesture, accommodation it\u2019s just plain free. Sometimes not doing anything is a positive/nice thing. BUT being mean, disrespectful and obnoxious takes a lot. You need to make an effort to do that. I just don\u2019t get it. Like man you want to sit here, have a cup of water? Sure thing. Doesn\u2019t bother me, takes no time at all, is a right thing to do and it helps you out.

            "This is awesome.\n\n\nOne trick in situations like that is to ignore someone like the clerk and just sit down anyways.  I know it's a hard line to cross, but once you do, it almost feels like magic.  My rule is if I don't feel it is unreasonable to do so, ignore the rules if it suits me.  Life becomes so much easier, and nobody is harmed in the process.",

This is why workers are supposed to go to their superiors and explain what they see on the front lines so that problems can be fixed.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere have been so many times where I start a new job and notice a MAJOR issue that could be fixed easily, but when brought up to my coworkers they say things like \"Oh, the manager knows this is a problem because it has always been a problem, so I don't bother telling them it's a problem\".  Then when I bring it up with the manager, they are SHOCKED that this is a problem, because they have never ever done this exact job in these circumstances, and are overjoyed that they can make customers' and workers' lives easier.  Most managers aren't purposefully cruel with their operation requirements-many of them have simply never worked a job that wasn't a management job.   (I was also shocked when I learned that most managers these days don't go \"through the ranks\", they are hired AS MANAGERS for their first jobs out of business school)",
