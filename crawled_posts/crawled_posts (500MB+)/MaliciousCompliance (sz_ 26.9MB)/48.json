        "selftext": "I live in a german speaking country and we are known to be very strict about closing times and time limits at our gouvernment offices.\n\nI happened to witness some fine malicious compliance in one of these offices.\nI work as some sort of engineer and went to an office which is dealing with formal requests regarding gouvernment issued assignments. If you want to get such an assignment you have to bring in paperwork in person up to a specific date. Because of the form and many things that happen in my industry it is quite common to bring in the paperwork on the last possible day. \n\nIt was close to closing time and I was waiting for someone when a woman entered the room, obviously in a rush, heading to the counter where paperwork has to be put in.\nThe counter was empty at the time. While she rushes across the waiting area her paperwork slides out of her arms and falls to the ground, spreading all over. As she is trying to put all together a man, who looked middle eastern tried to help her but when he touched her she let out a shriek and told him to get back where he belongs and to not touch her paperwork. (Obviously a racist remark, telling him to get to his country of origin, a quite common statement here)\n\nWithout a word he gets up and behind the counter the woman was heading for. When she finally finished picking up her papers she heads to the counter, realising that he is in there. Just as she reaches him he puts up a sign saying \"closed\" and points to the clock which had just reached closing time. Her face went blank as she stammered to please make an exception but she surely knew from the beginning this was a pointless request. \nIf she had let him help her, I'm sure she would have been able to put in the paperwork.\n\nI just can make an assumption that she either wasn't able to put in the paperwork at all or at least had to come in again the next day. Surely not what her boss was expecting.",

            "I worked at a state University in the USA for many years.  As a public institution, we had some really strict rules though other times there was some wiggle room.  Students generally knew this, without always knowing which was which.\n\nDuring a late registration period -- back in the day where you had to go to each Department for late registration (no online registration for students) -- some girl came in and had a Hold on her registration that she'd have to go to another office to clear up.  Nothing we could do.  \n\nIt was a regular thing that came up occassionally and most students were upset to find out but just left to take care of it.  She was SUPER-crappy to everyone in our office about it, even though we'd calmy told her what she MUST do to clear the Hold and then she should come back.\n\nRegistration \"officially\" ended at 4:30pm every day, though you could still register people after that.  Our office also closed at 4:30pm, but sometimes I stayed late to finish a few things up and would generally keep the door open and help sny stragglers I could.\n\nWho comes back at 4:35?... Yeah, THIS chick.  As she was explaining what she needs, I said, \"Yes, I remember you.\"  Instead of being apologetic, she went into bitch-mode again and one of the things she said was, \"You have to do your job!!!\"  \n\nAnd I pointed to the big clock on the wall and said, \"My job ended at 4:30.  I just happened to still be here so I left the door open, but I can 'Do my job' and lock you out.\"\n\nWeak denouement:  She started apologizing profusely and I  s l o w l y  walked over to my desk and I did register her but said something about hoping she learned a lesson from this and EVERYONE remembered how crappy she had been all day and I did NOT have to do this for her, now.  But I did. \n\nEver wonder why some government workers walk So Slowly?   Ha ha ha, THAT is why.  Sometimes I use it elsewhere, but that's where I learned it!  And why.",

None of us check our phones while busy and if they do, will always get called out for it by other staff. \n\nWe were all recently in a meeting where we were told we are no longer allowed to have our phones on us, as it is a distraction and against policy, meaning not to be used unless we are out of the unit or off hospital grounds. \nA few people piped up and said they had young kids in care where their phone was the direct communication for the carers, or there are issues at home that they needed to have their phone to have quick contact if needed, even if it was left in their hand bag and could be checked on breaks. Not only that, but we have a half hour unpaid lunch break where we should be able to use our phones as we see fit, but this was also denied as it's still in a healthcare setting and could cause WHS issues. \n\nNow I know working in healthcare and personal mobile phones don't mix as it really is against policy, however the issue with denying us complete access was a total over reaction. The issues with requiring quick and direct contact with home or other outside work contacts was brushed off and we were told if the issues were that bad at home, we shouldn't be at work. Many people were a bit taken a back by this saying a lot of the home issues are resolved by a quick text back and not allowing us access to our phones while at work was a bit unreasonable. \nOur manager said if that is the case, we can give people her direct work number and for contact to go through her and she will relay the message to us or give the phone to us to talk to whoever is calling. \n\nSo, cue malicious compliance. We all gave our at home/spouses/carers/schools/etc, the direct work line to call for any reason if they are unable to get in contact with us directly, and the phone started ringing continuously. \n\nFirst was a lady who's husband needed approval for a big financial decision at home. The next was a vet calling to tell a co-worker their dog needed to be put down. I got a call from my children's day care saying my son had been bitten and was bleeding (mandatory reporting policy). There were several other phone calls within the span of a few hours with my manager running to find us to relay messages or pull us off the floor so we could speak to the callers, wasting more time than if we were allowed to shoot through a quick text or take a quick phone call while on our breaks. \n\nThe next day we were told we can have access to our phones while on break and to please tell our home contacts to stop calling the managers phone. It took a few days for everyone to get the message, meaning there were still many unnecessary calls coming through, but it made it obvious that the need for communication lines to be open at home was important.",

By the time they told me, school was already out.  I called her, she was in the nurses office for two hours.  They eventually convinced her to call her mother, a methamphetamine addict without custody of her (and I had given them specific directions that she was NOT allowed to pick up my daughter), my daughter apologizing and saying she told them repeatedly that she wasn't supposed to have mom pick her up.  \nFortunately, mom could not be reached.  Eventually they convinced her she was ok to go back to class and finish her day.\n\nI was furious with both my work and my school.  I let my anger loose when I talked to the school over them telling her to call a non-custodial parent who they were warned was not safe.

Fortunately they had empathy and they told me I could have my phone in the contact center as long as I kept it on silent and out of sight - which was what everybody else did despite it supposedly being a firable offense.

Obviously, the judge, the lawyers and the court reporter weren't available to talk. We were busy in trial.  \nI was a court reporter. That's the person that sits in front of the witness stand and takes down everything the witnesses say on a stenograph machine. It's different from a journalist reporter.  I once called a doctor's office on a break to find something out.  The girl at the doctor's office assumed that everybody sits at a desk shuffling paper and answering the phone, that has a desk job.   I needed to talk to the doctor directly and she asked if I would be available later.  I said, \"No, I'm on break, we don't stop trials to answer the phone\" and she seemed to be shocked by that as if she'd never heard of anyone not being available at work. This was long before cell phones.  She was mad at me, but I hid under the clerk's desk on a break to get some privacy on a call about my medical condition.   \n\n\nOne of the visiting judges said \"They don't answer the phone in court in Dallas.

As long as the patients' needs are being met, I don't see an issue with healthcare workers having their phones on them. \n\nI can remember a time when there was concern that cellphones would interfere with the function of medical devices. I was actually in the hospital with a serious condition and my dad's cell phone rang. He had forgotten to turn it off. He ran out of the building apologizing.

We have some fairly strict medical privacy laws in place, and a violation of that would certainly bring about the loss of the violator's job and probably a lawsuit as well. But simply having a cellphone shouldn't constitute a violation. (Now, taking that phone out, snapping pictures and/or taking a video of an unwilling patient certainly would. But disallowing healthcare workers to carry cellphones would not stop someone who wanted to do that. They would simply hide the phone, do the dirty deed, and be on their merry way.

This happened at least once a week.\n\nMy friend (Valerie) got a customer who insisted that he speak with a man before even mentioning his problem, saying \"No offense, honey, but I just don't think you're qualified.\"\n\nIf a customer ever requested to speak with another technician for whatever reason, the policy was to tell the customer to call back. When told this, the customer demanded to speak with a supervisor.\n\nSo he did.\n\nHe spoke with the only female supervisor (Liz) on the floor (who LOVED getting these kind of escalations) who asked the customer why specifically he felt the technician who transferred him wasn't qualified to assist him. Apparently Liz had a habit of letting any female new hires know that if a customer wanted to speak to a supervisor because they demanded a MAN, they are free to let her know.\n\nIt gets better.\n\nLiz had told me that normally these calls end with a very resigned and defeated customer being transferred back to a different (and FEMALE) tech to resolve this issue.\n\nBut the customer that had escalated from Valerie refused to believe that ANOTHER WOMAN would be in any position of authority in our company and demanded to speak with *Liz's* boss. Liz told the customer that she was the final point of contact he was going to get and if he didn't like it, he could call the corporate office. The customer assured Liz that he would do so and hung up.\n\nA week later Liz finds out that the customer actually DID call corporate to complain. However, unlike tech support, the customer interaction department of the corporate office was MOSTLY WOMEN. When the VP of Customer Service got wind of this guy, she made sure that the few male members of her staff were suddenly unavailable to speak with him, and even spoke with the customer personally.\n\nUnfortunately ignorance often knows no bounds, so the customer continued to call back and harass the staff (using choice language and vague threats) until he finally managed to speak with a man - a representative of the company's legal department who let the customer know that all calls with him had been recorded, that they consider any future attempt to contact them to be harassment, and he can expect a cease and desist letter in the near future.\n\nLiz said it was the first time she had ever had the legal team follow up with anything she had did before.",

It didn't take long to recognize the pattern so we'd just look at the caller ID and ignore it. If someone picked up the call on accident we'd tell the customer \"Sorry, that ticket isn't in my queue, let me transfer you to someone who can help\" then transfer them back to the female CSS.\n\nEventually she trained up to be a really good tech which probably infuriated these customers even more.\n\nWe also had one particular customer who wouldn't let his wife (she was technical) talk to us.

            "I worked with a great female engineer (RIP Meghan... brain aneurysms are scary) whose first job was selling forklift trucks. And she dealt with misogyny with a simple bet...\n\n\u201cI bet you I can flip a dime with the tines of your forklift and call it in the air. I win you buy this lift AND buy me a beer.\u201d\n\nShe was awesome in sales, never bought her own beer. She was a damn artist with an industrial forklift.",
            "I'm male.\n\nI used to run a tech support department. We had a person who took all calls, triaged them, and either put them in the queue or forwarded them to an appropriate technician. This person was a woman, so when you called you had a 100% chance of getting a woman. She was ultra competent, and when I left we were talking to her about whether she'd like to take the next technician job to come available or stay in her role.\n\nWe had a very simple procedure: if anyone gave her any sexism, she was to take down his contact information and tell him a man would get back to him. (Yes she was entirely capable of doing it, but we felt that this shouldn't be made her problem. As the boss, it was *my* problem.) Then she was to send it to me, I'd find out who his boss is and have an in-person chat with him. (I'm very persuasive in a private business chat.) The sexist guy would then probably be fired, or at minimum he'd have to do all interactions with our department though someone else because I'd ban him from ever calling us again. (I never actually followed up to find out which.) If he did, I'd block his phone extension from making outgoing calls and have his email turned off, and demand he be fired at once. (It never came to that.)\n\nIn only one case I was called upon to throw somebody out of the office when they went nuts at my staff in person. It wasn't sexism, we had just declined to provide her speakers so she could listen to her music on her computer. (MP3s were banned from all computers we owned, and we didn't *have* any speakers to give her, but she threw a tantrum when I told her that.)",

            "Worked at an isp recently and most of the people in the tech support area are now female. Including supervisors. My last supervisor was a wonderful woman who was a sweet boisterous woman. But if you got on her bad side she knew how to make your life suck with a cheerful and smiling attitude the whole time. \"kill them with kindness\" to the extreme. It was fun to watch.\n\nI think we may have gotten fewer of those \"let me talk to a man\" situations because so many of our techs were female. I did get plenty of the \"let me talk to a supervisor\" types though. Mine times out of ten I would be able to kindly ask \"and what will I be telling the supervisor you are calling for?\" and get them talking so I could just fix it. There is always that one stubborn person though.",

Whenever a got a woman they just spoke to me like a normal person.",
            "Similar thing happened to me doing printer support. Sat to the right of a smart and capable woman who would get calls saying stuff like \"well what would you know?\". One day she leaned over, asked if she could transfer a call to me because they don't want to be helped by a woman. Thought it was bullshit to ask to get transferred to a man, but she never asked before so I figured she was having a bad day and didn't want to get into an argument with the guy.\n\nI quickly realised I was out of my depth (new machine that wasn't my specialisation) so I would have to transfer it to someone on the team who had the training. She was sitting to my right. Very satisfying for both of us to transfer him back to \"our teams expert\". She got it fixed too. Let's hope he learned his lesson.",

            "My husband used to work in a customer support center for technical issues for a large US television provider. \n\nHe would laugh at the people demanding to talk to corporate after getting a very nice compensation offer from customer support. So if someone called to complain about an outage, customer support would apologize profusely and offer them a $10-20 credit on their next bill. That wasn\u2019t good enough, so they called corporate. \n\nCorporate would calculate the exact amount of time the outage was, and calculate that as a percentage of their total bill and they would end up with like $1.30.",

It got to the point i stopped correcting people when they called me maam or guys were being a bit creepy, but every time they asked for a man i turned off the customer service voice and repeated my name to them.

            "When I worked in tech support one of our best techs was a woman. She was especially knowledgeable about networking - probably our top networking tech. \n\nOne day I was just about to go to lunch when she asked me to help her. She had a customer who was debating to speak with another tech. While he didn't say it, in was obvious this was because of her gender. Normally, this would get escalated to our managers (half of whom were women, and the entire management team preferred to have the women handle it, as it was even more entertaining for sexists to get shot down by a woman). Unfortunately, the managers were all away that week. So instead of going to the cafeteria, I grabbed a few snacks and went back to my desk, as my coworker added my phone as a consultant. However, we had a plan.\n\nEvery time he'd say something, I'd repeat it back to my coworker (live on the call where he could hear it). She'd respond and I'd relay that back to the customer. I honestly don't know what was wrong other than the fact that his Windows machine had some network issue - I was too busy focusing on my scavenged lunch to pay more attention than just repeating words, and frankly I was trying not to pay attention so I didn't come up with any ideas myself and get tempted to share them. The entire call became practically a game of telephone, although everyone could hear everyone else. Eventually he got frustrated and asked why I was just repeating everything. So finally I got to say something of my own. \"Well sir, [coworker] in our best networking tech and knows more about Windows than I do, so since we have her on this call a thought I'd use her skills for this. I wouldn't know how to continue debugging this without her if you'd like to continue talking to me I'll continue to require her help. But if you don't mind being transferred back to her, I'd be happy to leave you in the safe hands of our best networking tech and a Windows expert. If you have trouble with a Linux system, I'm sure she'll have to problems escalating to me, as that's more my area of expertise.\"\n\nWhen the managers got back I got a visit from one of them.

        "selftext": "Had forgotten about this story until the other day when I was chatting with a friend I went to high school with... it's silly, but I think it fits. (tl;dr at the end.) \n\nIt was the late nineties, I was still wearing too much flannel and continuing my historical trend of keeping books from the library much too long. I had a paper due for my sophomore Global Studies class, so I naturally took out more books than I could read, wrote the essay, and completely forgot about the books piled in the corner of my bedroom. After a series of overdue slips sent to my homeroom, I eventually did return the four or five book one sunny afternoon in the anonymous drop book during a study period. Promptly moved on to bigger and better things.\n\nAbout two weeks later, I was called down to the assistant principal's office in that space of time before classes officially started that was reserved for one thing and one thing only - the reprobates and delinquents were in trouble. I walked the halls thinking that surely this was just a timing mishap and I was being summoned to receive congratulations for some kind of award I didn't know I had entered into competition for. Yup, he just wants to prepare me for the surprise ticker tape parade. I was wholly unprepared to hear that I was receiving lunch detention, to start immediately, because I had not returned a single book, that I still remember was slim and had a white and red cover, from my GS paper research. I tried to argue that there was a mistake, since I was sure, like I am sure that I have fingertips, that I had returned it. But he could not be moved, and I was sentenced to indefinite lunch detention until I either returned the book or paid the sixteen bucks to replace it.\n\nI left the office, late for first period, defeated, but kept my head held high at lunch later that day as I walked past the entirety of cafeteria, which held a couple hundred of my peers. Plastic food try in hand, I went down the hall to the old shop classroom that had since been moved and the awaiting detention. I checked in with Mrs. Brown at her desk in front and took an inconspicuous seat in the back. Staring down at my canned peach slices, I braced for the worst. A murderous ruckus were going to break out any minute, I could tell. But once my ears stopped ringing, I discovered that it was really a calm escape from the crowded and rowdy lunchroom. I eat slowly that day, enjoyed my young thoughts in blissful quiet, and wondered what kind of heaven was this.\n\nTo be fair, I did search far and wide for that book that first day. Attempts to find it in my locker, bedroom, and backpack were fruitless and the general consensus in my home was that the school was being ridiculous. I certainly wasn't going to pay for something I didn't lose. So the next day, considering my brief brush with the law and the invisible stain already attached to my reputation, I went armed with a book and my lunch past the maddening crowds to the detention room.\n\nI sat there, day after day, for nearly two months of lunches.\n\nIn retrospect, to this day those remain some of the most relaxing lunch breaks of my life. I had around forty solid minutes to recharge in (mostly) complete silence with my reasonably priced lunch and whatever book I was currently reading. I had to recount my origin story a few times, since no one could figure out how the quiet bookworm of a girl who had never been in trouble before had landed in the wilds of detention, but I was mostly left to my own devices in this newly found peaceful retreat.\n\nI was friendly with Mrs. Brown, who had worked for the district of my small town since I was in elementary school, and even hooked her up with a sweet Horse Whisper poster that she loved from my family's mom and pop video store. She must have felt bad for me, because somewhere around the one month mark she started up a collection to cover the cost of the book. She added the initial donation, but teachers who would stop by to chit chat would add loose change to it, and race to buy my freedom was on. After a few weeks she handed me just under seven dollars.\n\nMy love of solitude was no match for the guilt of carrying around that money or my mom who had just started a new job in the school district, so with a heavy heart I paid in full for the missing book and went back to my old lunch table in the thick of the action.\n\nMonths later, during the last week of school, I was called down to the library at my convenience and with sweaty palms forced myself to face the music over what was inevitably going to be yet another overdue book at the end of the day. Well lo and be-fucking-hold, the end of year inventory check had located the book as waylaid in the wrong section of the library. I received a few sheepish looks from the librarians as they refunded the money and apologized in a backward way that still made me the bad guy, as overdue books are the real blemish on one's character, so how were they to assume that I didn't lose the book. Remember my mom's new job in the school? Well she just happened to be walking by the library just as I was finishing up and to say that she laid into them is far too extreme sounding. But she did scold some stern faced librarians into giving me a proper apology. She also demanded that they look into reforming their system and, my favorite part, take the proper measures to expunge my record - she was very concerned about me carrying around the albatross of false accusation apparently.\n\nAnd just like that my life of crime was over...\n\ntl;dr: got lunch detention thanks to a missing library book, discovered I loved it, intended to sit there the rest of my high school career until the teacher running detention took up a collection to get me out. Book was found in the library and my mom chastised women who were likely as old as time itself.",

            "I had a very similar situation and can relate so much! But it was of no fault but of my own.  In Jr high I was the joker of the classroom.  I went to a small private school so all staff and students knew of my antics.  My home room teacher didn't like it at all. \n\nThis home room teacher would make an example out of me for any tiny infraction, giving me a lunch detention.   The bonus about detention is you receive lunch for free. They make you P&J sandwiches served with a milk cartoon. \n\nSo each and every day for the next two years I received a lunch detention.  Once in a great while the teacher would forget to give it to me and I'd remind her in front of the whole class. Thus out of spit she would give me the detention. \n\nI sat in a climate controlled room, normally by myself. Reading a book (loved when the book mobile would arrive) and pocketing the lunch money I was given every day ($4) and I bought many of NES video games thanks to the savings.",
            "The one (and only) time I ever got written up was in Middle School over a stupid argument between friends. I was given one day on in-school suspension. They gave me my work from my classes at the beginning of the day then sequestered me in a small room, all by myself.\n\nI finished the entire day's work within half an hour and broke out the current novel I had been reading. Lunch came and I was allowed to gt lunch, but had to bring it back to the room. I ate, took a nap on the floor and finished most of that book by the end of the day.\n\nThe Vice Principal, the gate-keeper to the room, came and got me at the end of the day. She asked, in a very condescending way, if I had learned my lesson.\n\nI replied something along the lines of, \"Yeah, I did. Today was the best day I've ever had here. I'd like to do this every day, maybe I should get in trouble more.\"\n\nTo say the look on her face fell would be an understatement. I was honestly surprised she didn't faint, but she didn't, and told me that I wasn't allowed to keep the suspension going and that it was supposed to have been a punishment. I told her that when you don't like most of your classmates because they don't care and distract me from my lessons, this is a vacation. .\n\nCoincidentally, about a month later an addendum to the student handbook was circulated detailing the discontinuance of in-school suspensions.",

(How do you tell someone their son gets in trouble for being too clever and questioning asinine policies?)\n\nEventually I got into too big of trouble (I walked out of school in the middle of the day) and she came in to discuss it with the dean of discipline(actual position at my high school)\n \nMy mom POPPED OFF when they had to explain that there was practically no bathroom access throughout the day because students abused that \"privilege\" and it was unacceptable that my solution for that was to just leave.\n\nI ended up with my own bathroom liaison.

For that school year I'd push a kid or do any sort of rule breaking that wasn't serious to get detention. They'd put me in a little room in the office area and I'd be given my work for the day and I'd do it quietly and then read.\n\nThe secretary's at the school ended up liking me so much they let me deliver papers around the school for them and help them out. The P.E coach caught on pretty fast since he was my first period and where most of my shenanigans would happen. Him and I had a lot of fun he'd pull me out of classes for the seldom times I wasn't in detention and get me to help him out through out the school.

            "Holy wow, you reminded me of a story when I was in first grade. My teacher was insistent that I finish my lunch, green beans included.

            "This cracks me up. Not that you got in trouble. But the lunch detention. My son is ADHD and high functioning Aspergers. He doesn't like the noise of typical cafeterias, so he connected 2 and 2 and realized if he had just enough of an outburst, they would giving him silent lunch where no one could bother him. I caught on before the teachers and I told them silent lunch isn't a punishment. Once they realized this, they also realized it could be used as a enticement or reward. And that worked even better. Telling a kid that he had a time for himself in the middle of the day where he didnt have to socialize or be around the hustle and bustle..gave him decompression time. He is now a bit more social, he actually eats lunch with a friend now (to him: lunch, in the past, is only for eating- not socializing) so he has come.out of his shell a bit. I am happy we had a school that realized silent lunch could be beneficial in an aspect that was not a punishment. Not every school gets on board with the needs of kids like this.\n\nEdit typo",

It made a loud clang when it hit the bottom, apparently the box was empty.\n\nAbout a month later I get a call that it was overdue. I explain everything that I said above. I know I returned it. They must have misplaced it. The calls go on sporadically for a few weeks, eventually I manage to convince them to at least waive the cost of replacing the book.\n\nA week after graduation I get another call from them. They found the book. Does this mean they believe me now? No. This guy is furious, he's convinced that I had lost the book in my dorm and had found it while moving out, then had quietly returned it that week, and that I'd been lying to him the whole time. I tried to explain it must have just turned up somehow because I returned it months ago, but he doesn't buy it. There's nothing he could do to me at this point, but was he pissed.",

            "Why was the overdue book such a huge deal? I never understood that. Not until I had kids and they refused to return library books. I ended up telling school that I would NOT, under any circumstances, take responsibility for any library books. My kids were NOT going to check the books out. I would buy ANY title the kids wanted to read, but I would NOT take them from the library. Why? I got tired of paying super-high fees when my kids loved a book and refused to return it. Half the time I couldn't figure out where they hid the books to return them to school. It got tiring to pay $100-$200 in overdue book fines. I am NOT joking about those fees. They got ridiculous. I actually spent far less when I purchased whatever they wanted to read. And trust me, they NEVER went without a book to read - life would have been intolerable if the kids didn't have books to keep them occupied. I don't understand how they hid the library books, but I finally just had to refuse to take responsibility for them. I couldn't afford it, even though school had a bitch fit each year when I refused to sign the library book permission slip. School just had to suck it up because I am super stubborn about some things. \n\nGood for your mom for making the librarians apologize properly.",

            "You really know how to tell a story",
            "Late to the party but found your post while browsing top posts during quarantine confinement. I had a similar encounter back in middle school, I think 7th grade.\n\nI was generally a good kid, taking advanced classes, an athlete, and in band, but back in elementary and middle school, I tended to act out. I was a chubby kid until I filled out in the weight room in middle and high school, so I was made fun of for it. Winning a state championship early in my high school wrestling career put an end to that, but this story took place before that occurred. The cause of this particular incident was a \"fight\" standing up for myself. I put fight in quotations because at the time I was around 5'9, 160lbs, lifting weights 5-6 days a week and the other kid was maybe 5'0, 80lbs. He jumped on my back as a means of attack and I carried him to the gym laundry hamper (the size where an entire football team would drop their laundry after a game) and dropped him on top of a pile of laundry bags before walking away.\n\nThis caused me to miss the next field trip - the early days of zero tolerance where I had to be punished, but before the time where all parties were just suspended, arrested, shot, or whatever they do now. The day of the field trip, a substitute teacher was brought in, everyone was assigned work, and we were to essentially sit quietly and not make trouble. Everyone present was given the same work, but as I was taking advanced classes and the general population of the class was taking remedial classes, I finished well before lunch and decided to read for the remainder of the day. The rest of the class had different plans: they acted out until they eventually caused the teacher to leave the room in tears. The entire time, I sat quietly in my corner reading and generally ignoring anything else.\n\nAfter the field trip, it was passed down that all students that were in the detention class were to write the substitute teacher an apology. Me, being hardheaded, chose this as the hill to die on and refused. I cited that I had nothing to do with the disruption and should not be punished for something I had no hand in. Additionally, because I was an unwilling participant in the fight that caused me to miss the field trip and in fact acted to deescalate it (dropped the kid in the hamper and walked away), I should not have been in that classroom at all (possibly not that articulate, but that was the general message, and a fact backed up by witnesses including the gym teacher - zero tolerance...yay!). But my teacher did not relent and ordered the dreaded silent lunch until the letter was completed. \n\nI continued refusing to write the letter for the majority of the school year. My mother came in at the end of that semester for the parent-teacher night and my teacher told her about the silent lunch and refusal to apologize. After my mother heard my side, she told the teacher it was my decision to make, and that I would not be punished additionally at home. If I felt this strongly and was willing to suffer the consequences of my actions, that was my decision to make, but she wouldn't force or support me either way. Silent lunch didn't bother me as I got my own table but still sat close to my friends and could sneak in conversation. Eventually my teacher just stopped caring and allowed me to talk freely, but would not release me from the silent lunch table (for the sake of appearances, I think). \n\nIn my case it wasn't a collection from teachers that was my salvation though, it was an effort by students. A friend decided to write an apology letter on my behalf. She asked me to copy it in my handwriting and turn it in to my teacher, but did I mention I'm hardheaded? Naturally, I refused - it wasn't that I couldn't write an apology letter, my stance was that I shouldn't have to. Other students told the teacher what she had done and finally the teacher said to give her the one my friend had written and I would be done with silent lunch. I considered continuing my protest, but this seemed a fair compromise, so I relented. While I don't know for sure if any other teachers went to bat for me, I am pretty sure there was some sympathy among the staff of the school. Word got around my grade level pretty quickly, with students supporting me or telling me I was dumb, and I'm pretty sure there were teachers and administrators also aware of the situation and my protest. I was already recognized by many of the teachers and administrators (both my sister and I were successful athletes that were also successful academically), but after a while it seemed everyone knew who I was. I'm sure there had to be at least one teacher that supported me. I'm also confident there had to be a betting pool somewhere on who would relent first. \n\nTl;dr: Middle school taught me about peaceful protests. Also, apparently I wanted to write a novel.",

Middle of next class, I got an envelope with the cash and an order for more toppings. First Friday after Lent?

This plus the constant staff absences from the office due to site and field trips meant that everyone, at all degrees of seniority, came and went from the head office, and \u201cmucked in\u201d and did whatever needed doing whenever they were there.  Eventually however, it came to the point of needing a dedicated office person, for answering the phone, data entry, filing etc. so the specialists could focus more on the medical work, and a girl was hired.  I was away consulting on a site set up when she started, and this is what happened when I came back and met her.\n\nI got back in the morning, and wasn\u2019t planning on working immediately after such a long trip; instead I was planning on (as I usually did on Wednesday when I was in the city) picking up my 5 year old nephew from school and going to the park with him.  We were going to drop off some papers and a case full of medical equipment at the office on the way.  So I arrive at the office wearing jeans, with a child in tow.  This is fairly unremarkable: our job schedule is non-standard and to accommodate this, drop-ins at all hours, in various states of sometimes casual dress are frequent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe: Hi.

Just get them out of my way!\n\nMe: *takes a deep breath, remembers she has no way of knowing who I am, or my role with the company* Actually these need to be entered in the computer, so should I just hand them to you or do you have an in tray?\n\nOG: How about you do your work and stop trying to slough it onto me.  And that child shouldn\u2019t be in here.  (My nephew, who has been in the office many times, looks startled at this, and a bit upset.)\n\nMe: I understood you were taking over in the office...(she cuts me off again)\n\nOG: That\u2019s right.  And as the manager, I need to tell you that in future you need to dress appropriately and do the work you\u2019re given.\n\nMe: *another deep breath, trys to muster sympathy as she\u2019s new and possibly hasn\u2019t realized the jeans, and the child, aren\u2019t out of line for a quick drop-off. I summon a smile, for a final attempt at making the encounter more pleasant* You know, I never finished introducing myself.  I\u2019m\u2026\n\nOG: (to my nephew) Don\u2019t touch anything.  Just because your mother (she meant me) lets you get away with coming in here doesn\u2019t mean I will put up with it.  In fact you can go and stand outside. (nephew is confused and distraught at this attack, and bursts into tears)\n\nMe: *suddenly not giving a damn if she\u2019s new, and losing all sympathy and the smile* No, I don\u2019t think so.\n\nOG: If you don\u2019t like it you can take it up with the CEO.  I\u2019m a close personal friend as well as the manager here, and he\u2019s happy for me to run the office as I see fit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTake it up with the CEO she says?  Malicious compliance time.  I know he will be in shortly, so I decide to wait and do just that.  Soon he comes in the door:\n\nNephew: Daddy! (runs over and gets hugs)\n\nCEO: (to me) Oh great you\u2019re back!  Have you met OG yet?  OG this is Dr <*name that is part of the company name*\\>, my business partner and sister.  I hope you\u2019ve been treating her well.  He takes papers off me and hands them to her. Then he looks closer at his son.  What\u2019s wrong kiddo? Has someone not been nice to you?\n\nWe didn\u2019t fire her, she just didn\u2019t show up the next day.  Don\u2019t know what happened to her after that; she never contacted us for a reference...\n\n**TL;DR** Office girl gives herself a promotion to manager, claims a non-existent friendship with CEO, lies to and trys to bully one company owner, and makes other company owner\u2019s child cry. Spoiler alert: does not have long career.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Wow! Silvered! (And now gilded!) Many thanks, and I'm glad if people have got a laugh out of it.\n\nAnd now platinumed? platinized? platypussed? Thank you, benefactor!  I'm a bit stunned at the reaction, but happy if this story has brightened peoples day a bit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit again: I was asked for a few more details, and to put them up here. (the following is posted in a down thread reply)\n\n \n\nEverything after seeing OG realize quite how deep a hole she was in is a bit anticlimatic.\n\nOnce my nephew had been reassured that he wasn't in trouble, he was over the whole encounter, and really just wanted to go to the park as promised, and I wasn't anxious to upset him again. So when his Dad arrived, instead of the boy answering him about someone 'not being nice to him' (a paraphrase, since this was about 3 1/2 years ago) I simply said there had been a misunderstanding about nephew visiting the office, and that OG, my brother and myself needed to have a chat to clarify office policies, duties and the like. (She may have gone a little paler at this idea.)\n\nI was deliberately underplaying things due to my nephew's presence, and wanted to calm down myself a bit too. OG knew that wasn't the end of it by a long shot. My brother knows me fairly well and could read between the lines that 1) something serious was up and 2) I wanted nephew out of the line of fire before discussing it. So he suggested the three of us meet up first thing the next morning, and I chimed in that as he had work to do in the office, he could lock up for OG, if she would just leave her keys.\n\nHim having work to do was fiction, and her leaving her keys wasn't about him locking up, and \"getting them back to her when she comes in tomorrow\" was never going to happen, and we all knew it. But she was out of options, and I was out of \\*\\*\\*\\*s to give.\n\nI was prepared to meet with her, give her a chance to put her case etc, document what happened, pay her whatever was owed, cross every i and dot every t, though the outcome was dead certain. I wanted it all by the book because she wasn't going to be given any grounds to do anything but go away quietly. Or loudly, for all I cared. But she was going away promptly, comprehensively, and permanently. However she didn't bother to show up the next morning (or tell us she wasn't going to), and that was the last we heard of her.\n\nShe was only with us two weeks, and my brother says her work was OK. To be fair, she does seem to have been polite enough to the very few clients she had any contact with- perhaps she didn't see them as office rivals. I think her behaviour was about establishing an office pecking order, and that's why she was so aggressive and tried hard to inflate her position and importance, despite being so new. Wow, did she misjudge that! It would fit with comments from the other staff who met her, some about being pushy, and disputing what was her work. I don't know why she paid out on me in particular. Because I was the only woman? (There was/is another, but she was on a site and OG didn't meet her.) Because of the jeans and child? Maybe she really did just have a bad day and handled it unacceptably. Douche level behaviour, but if she'd been a polite douche during this one sided pecking order contest, and apologized after, she might have had a second chance, and survived her second week.",

            "I used to work for a family company in which two parents and three adult children were employed in various positions - the father was the boss, the mother (an absolute harridan of a woman) bossed her husband around and took care of the admin side of things, the eldest son was general manager, the second son was the supervisor and the daughter worked in the office.\n\nDue to the nature of the business, the company attracted some attention from specialist industry media and was reasonably well-known around the world; this led to visitors from overseas just showing up and asking to have a look around. This was not for any business purpose, this was for the personal entertainment of said visitors.

        "selftext": "I got my first \"grown up\" job while I was finishing my bachelor's degree. I was just getting started in a highly technical and emerging field. Very few people back then were doing this kind of work, and I seemed to have an aptitude for it, which is probably why I got a job before I had any credentials. \n\nThe department I was hired for was brand new and had the potential to take customers from other departments, while also generating net new business. Interestingly, the other departments had been offered the opportunity to start the service themselves but refused, even actively trying to prevent it from happening. \n\nThat's the reason I ended up in a malicious compliance situation. The leaders of all the other departments conspired to prevent me from getting an office. I didn't understand at first because at that age I didn't imagine professionals did petty, immature things. \n\nWhen I realized what was happening I knew they'd get exposed if I went along with it. So I happily did my job wherever I could find a place, which often ended up being in the mail room.... where lots of people would notice. I hoped maybe the leaders would start to feel guilty or annoyed and change their minds. Or... they'd be caught by their bosses. Either way, problem solved for me without a fight. \n\nLittle did I know how well it would go. I started to be well liked by a lot of the leaders because I helped them with their computers. There was one leader who still inexplicably hated me. I never spoke with him, not even one word. But he continued to insist I did not need an office. I wasn't even \"the level of a secretary,\" according to him, which I took to be a dig at my lack of a degree. I heard about him saying that from a friend who was in the meeting when they talked about changing their minds. \n\nIt's too bad for them they didn't change their minds, because the President came through the mail room multiple times and finally stopped, clearly annoyed, \"Why don't you work in your office?!\"\n\nThat was my golden moment. I had complied politely with not having an office. I sweely told the President, \"I don't have an office.\"\n\n\"What?! Why not?\"\n\n\"There isn't room. No space available.\"\n\n\"According to whom?\"\n\n\"Mr. [So&So].\"\n\n\"But you've been working here for, what, 3 months? They could have found space for you by now.\"\n\nOoooo the President was beet red at that point. I just smiled and said my understanding is there is no space. The President literally stomped upstairs to the offices of Mr So&So. I distinctly heard the yelling from downstairs. People outside probably heard it!\n\nThe President came and brought me upstairs to the conference room where the leaders were all seated looking down. There was a pile of keys on the table. I was afraid at that point. Was she having me pick someone's office to take? While that might have been sweet revenge it wouldn't have been good for my working relationships with any of them.\n\nBut no. She handed me a key to the conference room and said, \"This is your office.\" She scooped up the rest of the keys, which I learned later were all their copies of the key to the conference room, and said, \"Your office is the largest office on campus. Even bigger than mine. Enjoy!\" And she walked out.\n\nThat was probably the best Drop-the-Mic moment I've ever seen in my life. And the story ends with my compliance not only winning me that office, but all the other leaders, except Mr So&So becoming great colleagues.\n\n-\n-\nEDIT followup:\n\nI mentioned in the comments there was another chapter to this story that I guess sort of puts a bow on it. \n\nOne sunny day about six months later Mr So&So passed me on the stairs outside the building. I was leaving and said good morning to him. We were the only two people, or so I thought. I wouldn't pass by a coworker like that without a polite greeting.\n\nI was in my office quietly analyzing some data about an hour later when the once-again a furiosuly red-faced President stormed into my office. I swear she was 12 feet tall in her anger. She demanded,  \"What is going on between you and Mr. So&So?\" \n\nMy heart was racing at probably 150 beats per minute and I couldn't comprehend her question. \"What do you mean, 'What's going on,' I have no idea what you're talking about.\" I started to imagine she was accusing me of having a relationship with the man. And just... ewww!\n\nShe said she wanted to know why he just said what he said about me. I was flummoxed. \"I'm sorry, I still have no idea what you're talking about. I never have more than a greeting to say goodmorning worth of conversation with Mr So&So. I can't think of anything whatsoever he would have to say about me.\"\n\nShe told me that my sibling had just burst into her office raging about Mr So&So. Turns out when I walked by him and continued on, the next person he encountered was my sibling, but he didn't know that. We both worked for the same company but I was married and we had different last names. If he bothered to get to know me at all he would have known that.\n\nHe walked right up to my sibling and said, \"There goes a bi+c# with her head up her a&&.\" He assumed, I guess, that everyone else hated me too. He barely knew my brother but felt comfortable saying that.\n\nSo, my brother walked right into the President's office, interrupting a meeting and repeated what Mr So&So said. The President assumed I was aware. But my brother hadn't gotten to me yet. And I didn't realize just how much Mr So&So hated me. I told the President I genuinely didn't believe it was really about me. It couldn't be because we never spoke. It had to be about what I represented, which was a major change to the organization.\n\nShe walked to his office. Then more yelling ensued. Pretty soon they were back in my office. He apologized and I repeated what I told the President, that I didn't believe it was really about me. Mr So&So agreed. \n\nLater on I had a project with him and he started to trust me. We ended up being able to work together with no further issues.",

There were just maintenance related activities for systems still in operational use.  He was in a large open plan office and management kept rearranging the office, moving his desk ever closer to the door.  They were hoping that he would take the hint and leave but he knew that, with all those years of service, he would be entitled to a substantial redundancy package - so he stuck it out.  In the end, they actually moved his desk outside the office and into the stairway. It was bizarre, he would be sitting at his desk with people passing by to use the stairs. But he still held out.  \nThen, out of the blue, the company won a new contract, which had a need for his skills - so management moved his desk back inside and put him in charge of a team.

        "selftext": "I used to be a chef in a Mexican Restaurant in a small town in Australia nearly 40 years ago. We were modestly popular and I loved working there. One night a young man came in to dine with a young lady. It was very obviously a first date. They ordered a nachos to share with a side of jalapenos for their entr\u00e9e, and he ordered a steak vera cruz (hot) for his main and the young lady ordered a chicken burrito (mild) for hers. \n\nI, as I usually did throughout the night, would walk around the tables and ask if people were enjoying the food. After the nachos I checked on them and the young man informed me that the chilli that accompanied the nachos were not hot at all and that he loved hot food. I was informed that he had travelled extensively and had eaten some of the hottest food in the world and that no one had ever made a dish too hot for him. He reiterated that he wanted his steak main extra hot. To be honest I found him to be pompous and rather obnoxious in the way he was speaking down to me and found myself taking a disliking to him. \n\nI will add at this point that the young lady was looking a little uncomfortable and I got the impression her date was not going as she had expected. \n\nI headed to the kitchen. I made her a lovely chicken burito while putting together his steak. He wanted it hot?? He was going to get it!\n\nOur steak vera cruz was usually a steak cooked and topped with our house tomato sauce base with some capsicums (bell peppers for you Americans) and onions with a touch of chilli. On this occasion I set to work. Keep in mind this was Australia back in the 80's and we did not get a lot of different chillies back then and a jalapeno was considered hot by most Aussie palates. Hey, we were an uneducated bunch!\n\nI had a few birds eye chillies in the kitchen that were mainly there for the staff and the resident Mexican guitarist's meals so I started with those. I finely diced about 10 of those with their seeds. I then started sweating off my onions and capsicums. I then threw in the chillies and then I added about a tablespoon of chilli powder and about a tablespoon of cayenne. \n\nI soon felt the fumes hit my nose and the back of my throat and my eyes started watering. I ran to the door of the kitchen to get a breath of breathable air as the air in my tiny kitchen was rapidly becoming unbreathable. I ran back to my pan and put a ladle of the house tomato sauce in. I then let that simmer for a few minutes. I then added some chopped up jalapenos from a jar in my fridge and thought why not, and in went a bit more chilli powder. \n\nI then put the flash fried steak in to finish it off in the sauce. I served it all up on a plate with some rice, served up the chicken burrito and hit the bell for the waitress to serve it to the table. \n\nThe waitress came back and told me that as she placed it in front of him he said 'This had better be hot'. She assured him the chef had done as he requested. I went to the door of the kitchen, joined by my waitress, to watch the show unfold, and unfold it did!\n\nI watched with glee as he sliced the steak, took a piece on his fork and with a smug look on his face, he put it in his mouth. He took a chew and then realised his mistake. I saw it. That moment when his face changed but he was trying so hard not to show it. He couldn't. He was on a date and he had bragged so hard and now he had to go through with it. He ate the steak. I could see every ounce of pain on his face. He struggled. He struggled hard. His date watched him with a slight smile on her lips and I got the impression that she was thoroughly enjoying his pain. He went through several jugs of water. He sweated. He barely spoke. He looked damned uncomfortable. \n\nAt the end of the meal I came out of the kitchen and asked him if he had enjoyed his meal. His words? 'Could have been hotter.'\n\nHe never came back. His date? She became a regular and told us he was an insufferable fool and she never saw him again. I have no regrets other than I wish Carolina Reapers had been around then.",

My husband scooped two big piles on his enchilada, took a big bite, and gave a thumbs up to **all** of the waiters watching us.

            "There is this Indian place I go to every once and awhile. They used to have a heat scale for your curry from 1-10. One night I am there order my curry dish, they ask me how hot I want it. I ponder for a moment and decide 8 is acceptable for me. I like it hot, but not enough for my O-ring to burst off. So I tell them the number. They look at me with bewilderment and ask, \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u201d I reply, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure.\u201d\n\nThe waiter brings it out and like 3 other people behind him.

I give them a thumbs up and while I am eating I mutter out, \u201cPerfect\u201d\n\nAll the people in attendance to my personal spicy food competition were both confused and relieved.

The cooks took the challenge, with limited ingredients at their disposal. We were just teenagers, so it didn\u2019t take much to overwhelm my buddy. He was sweating, nose running, chugging water. They came out to watch and laugh at him. He only finished a few of them before throwing in the towel. \n\nYears later when I was working there, I once ate a spoonful of cayenne pepper powder on a dare. It was a lot hotter than I expected, and the whole kitchen had a good laugh. Good times.",

He managed to eat about 1/4 of it before he realized he made a mistake.  His comments were \"this is starting to burn\", \"that pepper was HOT\", his face started turning red in a ring around his mouth and he begged for some relief.

            "About 25 years ago a Chinese restaurant opened very close by. They spoke almost no English, I speak be mandarin at all. I quickly became a very regular patron. I\u2019d help the owner with his English and he\u2019d try to teach me mandarin. I lived their spicy dishes and quickly started asking for \u201cxxx hot\u201d.

One day for lunch I came in and boldly stated that they couldn\u2019t make it too hot. Challenge Accepted!!!\n\nMy food came out and the owner and the cook decided it was break time. They sat at a table across from me to watch the show. It was a good amount of chicken smothered in not only the jalape\u00f1os but also those little Chinese death peppers and some I had never seen before. \n\nAs I struggled to eat it they\u2019d sit there talking and laughing at me.

I don't know if they just forgot to put the seasoning on them, but it was really plain, not even remotely spicy.\n\nAnyway, this new place, I asked if the wings were actually spicy (still slightly incredulous from that last place I went to) and the person at the counter said something along the lines of \"Yes, probably too spicy, I don't recommend the hottest ones.\"\n\nIt's not that I didn't believe them, but I was genuinely curious now, so I asked for a half portion (6 wings) of their hottest to try them out. The server almost seemed insulted that I didn't listen to them but said sure.\n\nWhen my food came, it was with a full portion of wings (12 pieces), hey, I'm not complaining! I got stuck in and yeah... they were hot. Hot enough to burn my fingertips from touching them.\n\nWhen I was a couple of wings in, the music in the restaurant abruptly changed. It was now playing Johnny Cash, Ring of Fire. I looked over at the counter and the server was giggling. Pretty sure all the staff back there were laughing at me, hehe.\n\nTurns out that place was locally famous for its hot wings and had challenge nights and a wall of fame for people who could take the heat.

I said I'd be fine and after she brought them out the entire staff came up and kinda milled about the front counter area watching my reaction as I started eating. \n\nI ate them all without any problem and by their looks of astonishment they were very surprised. They honestly had very little heat. To this day, I think whoever gave me those wings pulled a prank on their coworkers and gave me mild.

            "Years ago I used to frequent a Thai restaurant in central NJ.   We would always order hot, and while it came out hot, it was never overwhelming.  We were there so often, the waiter would make things for us off the menu, and often the uninitiated people in our party would be sweating buckets while eating.  \n\nWe went there one Saturday, and the chef (Who just happened to come back from a month long trip home to Thailand) took our order.  I ordered \"Tod Kratiem Prig Tai\" (Meat with garlic and black pepper) with dark meat chicken, and said \"Hot\".   The chef did the usual argument that I didn't want it hot, and I assured him I was there often and always ordered it hot, and it was NEVER too hot.  \n\nWhen the dish came out, it was obvious I made a mistake, the sauce which is normally a lighter brown was almost black with the amount of red and green pepper he added.     This was as hot as if I was eating raw Habanero.   I worked my way through it, and survived.  The next time I was in the regular waiter let it slip that when people they don't think can handle hot order hot, he makes it medium. But since I can handle the \"Insult the chef\" level of heat, he made mine hot from that point forward.  \n\nIf you are ever in Piscataway, NJ and want to have some Thai I recommend finding this little hole in the wall place on Stelton rd, order their chicken wings (the best Thai chicken wings I have had) but please do not insult the chef.",

Clearly this waiver wouldn\u2019t stand up in court, but more to build the atmosphere around the sauce. Myself and a family friend asked to try the sauce, signed the waiver and got set. The problem was that the employee failed to tell us that you only need a small dab. Instead, he told us to go ahead and fill the small ass sample spoon and go for it. We try it, and at first it wasn\u2019t bad. Then about 30 seconds in, it was like Hell decided to open a portal in my stomach.

The guy earned a new nickname and every emergency worker from firefighters to police to ambulance personnel heard him.",
            "So my brother loves spicy food and will put hot sauce on all his food whether at home or in a restaurant. He went to this little family owned Mexican restaurant and ordered a burrito. He got it and as he was putting house made hot sauce on it the little plastic thing that only allowed a small amount out popped out and poured like half a cup of hot sauce on it. The server saw and offered to remake it but he decided he was a badass, he was going to eat it! He ate it but his eyes were watering, he was beet red and the server offered complimentary milk to wash it down with. Later his girlfriend heard him in the bathroom trying not to scream as that meal made its exit.",
            "We like spicy food and our neighbourhood Chinese proprietor grows his own chillis. He always proudly plops some sliced chillis in a bowl for us. (We bring them lots of fresh fish). Lately his chilli has been so hot. A few times I\u2019ve taken most of it home in a napkin we don\u2019t want to disappoint him. Last time it was nuclear. We finally said, \u201cwow what is going on with your chillis?\u201d He grinned so big and said, \u201cyes lately they\u2019ve been super hot. I don\u2019t know why and I didn\u2019t tell you so you\u2019d keep eating them!\u201d",
            "1978 - fresh out of school, new to Melbourne. I'd heard of 'Vindaloo' and wanted to try one. Found an 'Authentic Indian Restaurant' on Flinders St. across the road from the train station.\n\nIt was hot going in. and hot coming out.\n\nIt started me on spicy foods trail, until after early last year when I had my gall-bladder removed. Now I suffer all night even with KFC Hot'n'spicy :( :( :(\n\nBut gotta admit, it was great while it lasted.",
            "Coulda been hotter is a funny ass thing to say he\u2019s livin his best life lmao",
            "My mom claims not to like spicy food very much, but every time we go get thai food she orders chili noodles and asks for them extra spicy. It\u2019s never enough. One time she got fed up and asked for it \u201cthai spicy.\u201d The waiter looked very impressed when she ate the whole thing and said it was perfect. After that she never had to ask for extra spicy again. They remembered her",
            ">I was informed that he had travelled extensively and had eaten some of the hottest food in the world and that no one had ever made a dish too hot for him. He reiterated that he wanted his steak main extra hot. To be honest I found him to be pompous and rather obnoxious in the way he was speaking down to me and found myself taking a disliking to him.\n\nOP, may I tell you the other side of this story? Because **I AM THIS PERSON** >!Okay not literally. We are not the same human being. But IN SPIRIT... I am this person.!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot in every sense. I'm not rude and I try very hard not to be condescending. edit: though you may disagree reading this post but that's only because the subject gets me fired up and a little pissed off thanks to all the history i have with it /edit And I'm certainly not showing out for anyone. But with all that out of the way, here's why I am him.\n\nWhen I was young, I always liked spicy food a little, and put jalapenos on everything. But my life changed when my mother and I went to a thai restaurant and had a special type of curry chicken called Ta Ta Chicken.\n\nI have no idea what was in it (I have offered the chef 1,000$ for the recipe but as it is a family one, she refuses) but it was the best dish I've ever tasted in my life.\n\nAnd it was so god damn hot that my mother and I were literally crying laughing about it. We would take ONE bite, drink an entire glass of water, suck on ice, drink some milk, shove a piece of bread into our mouths, and THEN......TAKE ANOTHER BITE OF THE FOOD\n\nBecause it was **THAT DELICIOUS** and that extreme heat was part of it. The reason we were laughing so hard was because despite how much it was making us suffer, we couldn't help but keep going back for more. We'd spend ten whole minutes trying to cool our mouths from a single bite and then GO BACK FOR MORE (how could that not be hilarious?)\n\nI ate that dish 3 times. Only 3. Then the damn bitch (lord forgive me but fuck it pisses me off) changed it to Bang Bang Chicken, which she said was virtually the same dish but milder because the majority of her customers complained about the heat.\n\nMeanwhile I'm over here offering her a grand for the old version. Needless to say this new pussified version was not the same.\n\nI said that my life changed due to this because I came to obsessed with spicy things. Essentially I was chasing the dragon (as heroin users say) of that first high which I could never quite find again.\n\nNow i'm the guy who brings his own carolina reaper sauces and scorpion trinidad sauces with him into restaurants because I know the restaurant won't have anything close (oh you've got some texas pete. That's adorable.)\n\nWith all this said, it's not a simple matter of \"hotter = better\". I never completed the \"one chip challenge\" because there is a point where heat ruins things and it just becomes stupid and pain for the sake of pain.\n\nThe beauty of Ta Ta Chicken was not just that it would make you sweat and cry (tears of joy and pain) but that it was HEAVENLY DELICIOUS.\n\nSo to make the comparison between this man and myself crystal clear: I've been the guy who goes into restaurants and says \"You will not be able to make it too hot for me >!without doing something stupid that just ruins the flavor !<because again there is a difference putting a pile of bad tasting hot sauce and canned peppers on otherwise good food and saying \"See if this is hot bondoh!\"\n\nlike yeah it's hot but now you've just made the food gross. Not because it's too hot. But because you ruined the flavor. \n\nThe God level balance, Heaven itself achieved is to find a way to add in that extreme heat while still making it extremely delicious.\n\nSo far all i've managed to find are amazing hot sauces. Most restaurants cannot cook a spicy dish for shit. For the same reason that this cruel woman ruined her own dish when she changed it: Because they decide the spice level based on average people, and average people think jalapenos are hot...i think jalapenos are grapes.\n\nSome real thai/Vietnamese places actually have this thing they called \"white people hot\" where they essentially make their spicy dishes to an acceptable level for us western weaklings.\n\nHowever if a fellow thai person came in, they would offer them the chance to eat it the way it's usually made in thailand which is WAY HOTTER.\n\nSo if I go in and I say \"i don't want it white people hot. Give me the authentic thai hot.\" they're probably going to think I'm being like the guy in your story OP. Like I'm a condescending douche.\n\nBut what choice do I have other than to cook this shit myself?!??!?!?! Because NOBODY BELIEVES ME! Everyone thinks i'm just a wannabe tough guy who doesn't know what he's talking about.\n\nWhen I'm actually a spice connoisseur chasing a level of heat and taste I had a decade ago.",
            "What a lovely story of someone having to put their mouth where their mouth is at so to speak.\nWhat was his thought process here? Did he imagine her thinking: \u201cat first he was just a nice guy, but when he showed me how manly he was by finishing the worlds\u2019 spiciest dish I wanted to strip us naked right then and there\u201d? \nWhat a weird \u201cflex\u201d.\n\nI feel extreme pain when eating something hot. Pain and swelling of mouth, tongue and lips. There is no flavor - just pain! Hours later it still burns and my tastebuds will be completely numbs as well. \n\nThen again I also get itchy mouth from melons and raw pineapple and my mouth swells slightly from toothpaste so I might just have a delicate mouth.",
            "Is it all the more satisfying knowing he had to enjoy it one more time on the way out?",
            "This is freaking awesome. \nWell played sir. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f",
            "Something similar happened to my wife when we were dating. We went to a Thai place and she ordered her food Thai hot. When the server pushed back a little to make sure she really wanted that she said \u201cit\u2019s ok, I\u2019m half Korean so I can handle it\u201d. \n\nClearly they took that as a challenge, because what they brought her was less a curry and more a bubbling pit of volcanic sulphur from the bowels of hell. She was a good sport about it, and in her defense her mom makes some dishes that are absolutely delicious but definitely have violence on the ingredient list, but she was 100% bested by that place.",
            "This is amazing! I am so glad she came back! Your revenge on him was more then likely the highlight of her night!",
            "I have a slightly inverse story from when I was 10.\n\nMy family and I were at some local bar we've never been to.  All I ever order is hot wings, so I find them on the menu and order it.\n\nThe waitress is like \"are you sure?  They're really hot.  I've seen grown men not able to eat them.\" I wasn't a Scoville sadist but it's all I ever ordered so I just agreed.\n\nFinally my wings come and my whole family stares at me.  I take a single bite.  It is the *nastiest* wing sauce of all time.  A healthy mix of vomit and Satan's diarrhea.\n\nI had to eat it though, because nobody would believe me if I said they were just bad.  I made it through *two* wings and surrendered.\n\nI told my parents I couldn't eat them, they taste so awful.  \n\n\"Haha!  Too spicy for you???\"  I already knew that was coming.  I can't be shamed, these wings just aren't worth it.\n\nTo this day my mom tells the dumb story where I ordered wings \"too spicy for me\" and I made them take it back.  No!  They were just disgusting!"
