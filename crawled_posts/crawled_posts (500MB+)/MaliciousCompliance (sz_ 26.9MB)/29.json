        "selftext": "In a previous life\u2014before my world came apart about five months ago\u2014I was the solo pastor of a medium-sized church in a large(ish) Southern city. One unhappy side effect of being a solo pastor is that when your phone rings, you answer it even if you don't recognize the number since you have no idea how important the call may be. It could be a church member's grandkid (whom you've never met) calling to tell you Miss Bessie has been diagnosed with some horrible disease. Or it could be a church member who just wants to talk your ear off for two hours. \n\nSo earlier this evening my phone rings. And since old habits die hard, I answered it. \n\nMe: \"Hello?\"   \nHer: \"Heeeeeey, what are you up to?\" \n\nI want to be clear before I proceed that I don't recognize this lady's voice but I just assumed that she was a former church member, member's kid or grandkid...something. So I was cordial. \n\nMe: \"Not much, honestly. I actually just walked through the door with some food. How about you?\"   \nHer: \"I'm hanging out with {girl whose name I don't know}.\"   \nMe: \"Great. I'm sorry to have to ask this, but with whom am I speaking? I don't recognize your voice and I have no idea who {other girl} is.\" \n\n**Ladies and gentlemen, apparently that was the wrong thing to say.** \n\nHer: \"Darren, you know who this is! This is Jessie!\"  \nMe: \"Well, Miss Jessie, I hate to break this to you but my name isn't Darren and I don't know any women named Jessie. I believe you've called the wrong number.\"   \nHer: \"No I didn't! This isn't funny Darren. What happened? Did you leave your ringer on again and you're worried your wife is going hear us talking?\"   \nMe: \"Ma'am, I'm very sorry but now I *know* you've got the wrong number.\"   \nHer: \"I want to come over there and tell her all about us and how you've been screwing me behind her back for two years. I'm sick of this shit.\" \n\n**Cue malicious compliance.** \n\nMe: \"...you know what, that would be great. By all means, come to my house and wake my wife up and tell her all about our torrid sexual affair.\"  \nHer: \"I'm leaving now.\" *engine cranks in background.*   \nMe: \"Okay. See you soon!\" \n\nFive months ago I discovered that my wife of ten years started cheating on me eighteen months into our marriage. She racked up a grand total of 16 affairs in a decade. \n\nSomewhere in my immediate area a man's wife was just awakened by her husband's sidepiece banging on the front door. She deserves to know what kind of man she married. I'm just sorry I can't be a fly on the wall for the very special episode of the Jerry Springer Show that just started in her driveway.",

            "OP, that\u2019s hysterical! I love it. Justice served. \n\nAs for the cheating wife, it will get better with her gone, assuming/hoping you are divorcing. My husband\u2019s ex wife did the same in a 9 year period ( affair count is higher than he originally knew ; double digits) to include sucking off her own daughter\u2019s boyfriend a few times along with mistreating the kids and destroying the home and finances with over spending, demanding expensive jewelry, not cleaning and hoarding. She did him a favor and left him for the final AP because she had sucked him dry financially and destroyed the house. She even quit claim the deed to the house on her way out thinking she stuck him with worthless property and she just trapped a new meal ticket.\n\nWe got together a year later, married 1 year and a half after that (not as soon as one thinks. We were each others the one who got away from a long time ago and didn\u2019t have any contact until 1 year after this happens to him. We weren\u2019t having an emotional affair or anything during their nightmare)\n\nI share this personal story with you to illustrate it only took him a month to realize her being gone was the best thing that could happen to him. He spent the next year digging out of the financial hole and we spent 2 years repairing the house which we just sold for a profit. Yes two years. We both work and did a majority of the work to save money. This wasn\u2019t normal get a house ready to sell. It was massive amounts of clean out of junk ( he had been working on it and wasn\u2019t done yet) replacing sub flooring (she hoarded dogs not just stuff and allowed them to pee everywhere even though she stayed home while he worked as per their arrangement. So it\u2019s not that he expected her to take care of the house just because she was the wife.) He realizes he should have left long before she walked out, but we have grace for women who stay in abusive relationships and need to acknowledge men experience abuse too and it effects their thinking just like women. \n\nAnyway, you say you were a pastor. Beauty for ashes. Also, I will repay you for the years the locusts have eaten. Quoting to you what may seem familiar and believe all forms of belief systems have similar ideology and they are true. When you throw the toxic out of your life good and positive things happen. My husband is living his best life and you will be too.",

        "selftext": "When I pay my mortgage, I round up and divide in half. I pay half every other week.  So my mortgage got picked up by another company when my mortgage company went out of business.  To do what I was doing with the NEW company was $300 to enroll and an extra $40 EACH PAYMENT.  Oh hell no.  I spoke to my credit union and they had an auto pay that would pay my bills from my direct deposit FREE.\n\nSo nearly a year goes by and I get one of those scary ass letters \"You are in default on your mortgage. Unless we get X payment within 10 days of this letter we will foreclose.\" I was astounded since I had never missed a payment and was actually paid a couple of months ahead.  I spoke with their accounting  department. It seems they couldnt accept \"half payments\" only full payments (even though they had done so for year) so the money had to sit \"unapplied\" until a full payment was accrued. That made sense EXCEPT again, they got MORE than enough and it was always in there in full before the due date so on the due date they should have just taken it and applied it to the mortgage.\n\nSo further digging, the rep says to me \"OH by the way - we have $8200 of \"unapplied funds\" in this account. What do you want to do with it?\" Uh PAY MY MORTGAGE WITH IT?  \"Oh we cant do that.\" So I had to get a check cut for $8200, pay $45 for them to overnight it to me, take it to my credit union, cash it, pay $25 for a cashier's check, and pay ANOTHER $45 to send the cashier's check BACK to them.  I called relentlessly to see when it had arrived and had all kinds of postal tracking, signature confirmation, etc. Remember, I only had TEN DAYS to get this shit straight!\n\nSo they get it and verify that it is applied to my mortgage and that there will be no foreclosure. The rep tells me \"Well your next payment is due in 2 weeks and there will be penalties and late fees applied so the amount is XYZ AND we are raising your interest rate (to nearly twice what it was before).\" Uh no. ALL THIS IS YOUR COMPANY'S FAULT.  She says \"You knew these were the terms and conditions when you took out your mortgage with us.\" Uh no. I didnt take it out with YOU, I took it out with another company and I was ASSIGNED to your company.  \"Well dont be late with the next payment!\" Uh no. I want to speak with a manager.\n\nSo I FINALLY get to speak to a manager and he wasnt much better. His only response \"Well you can always go with another company but good luck with that these days - so many foreclosures and your credit is not very good from missing so many payments.\"\n\nSo I decided to take his advice. I contacted my credit union, explained everything, showed them THEIR OWN payment transfers, AND the mortgage statements showing the other company had received the money bi-weekly like clockwork, and...the credit union took over my mortgage. I got a reduced interest rate AND killed all the fees, penalties, and got the overpayment back (I applied it to the new mortgage payments) etc.\n\nSo when a company acts like they have you over a barrel and tells you to try to go with someone else, DO IT!!\n\nEDIT: This still astounds me even after all these years. I cant imagine any other company - car loan, credit card company, etc - asking \"Hey what do you want us to do with all this money sitting over here?\" and not AUTOMATICALLY concluding \"Oh yeah, lets apply it to the outstanding balance!\"",

SO he took his extra money and asked his loan office what the total was left on the loan, and cut the check that day.  \n\n\ntwo months later he's getting letters saying that he's behind on his payments; in-between him sending the check and them cashing it, one more month of interest was added to his total. He got a few months of late fees on just that interest that was unpaid. My man was fuming after all the BS!  \n\n\nGlad you managed to save yourself from this one, What a terrible company/business world we live in...",

            "What astounds me is that they only gave you 10 days to come up with the money.  I know in my state they have to give at least a month in addition to multiple late/no payment warnings before it even gets to that point.\n\nThen, there's this jewel:  \"Well your next payment is due in 2 weeks and there will be penalties and late fees applied so the amount is XYZ AND we are raising your interest rate (to nearly twice what it was before).\"  They are already charging a late fee and raising the interest on a payment that was 2 weeks away?\n\nIt honestly sounds like you could have taken them to court and easily won a nice settlement against them for violating the FCRA (or whichever act it is).  IANAL\n\nThis also reminds me of my very first mortgage.  We had it set up through our bank to directly transfer from our checking to our mortgage account at the same bank automatically.\n\nA year after the mortgage started, we got a letter in the mail that they were getting ready to foreclose due to non-payment.  It was like 9PM Monday, so there was no way we could reach someone to talk about it.  We got a call the next evening from the bank threatening the same thing.\n\nMe:  The payments have been taken out of my account automatically every month.  Where have they been going?  It shows being paid to the mortgage.\"\n\nHer:  Oh.  Well, it's only been paying against your principal but not the interest.  The amount is supposed to go for the whole payment.  You're short $8,000 which must be paid by Friday before foreclosure procedures start.\n\nMe:  This is your bank's fault.  I'd suggest finding someone to fix it.  Otherwise, we'll transfer everything to another bank.\n\nHer:  Well, let me see what we can figure out.  (long pause)  Okay.  It looks like we can transfer some of the money to the interest payments from the principal.  You're all set.  I do apologize for this issue.  Please, forgive the inconvenience.\n\nMe:  Ok.\n\n12 months later it happened again, even though I had statements showing exactly how the payments were being distributed.  I ended having to take the day off of work to show them the papers in person.  \"There's nothing we can do.  You can either pay the $8,000 or find someone else to service your mortgage.\"\n\nThe next week, we had a new mortgage at another place that specifically did mortgages and had access to 100's of lenders.  APR went from 7.1% variable down to 3.1% fixed with no closing costs.",

            "I ran a small business for a few years. Every spring i would be short on cash and would borrow a few thousand dollars for 90 days to \"get me over the hump\". I worked with the same person every year and never filled out a credit app other than the first year. After a 3-4 years of this I called in one spring for my normal loan and found the person no longer worked there. The new loan officer had me fill out an app, no problem, I understand. Then the next day he called me back and said the loan was refused! I couldn't believe it! I had a history with them and was financially better off than previous years. I had a checking account with them a a pretty good chunk of money in a retirement account with them too. I asked to talk to a manager and he assured me he had the final word.\n\nThat day I went to another bank, told them the situation and told them I would move all my business there if they would give me the loan. They didn't give me a loan, but they gave me an open line of credit that was more than I had asked for, so I could use the line of credit to get money anytime I wanted. I opened a checking account and waited a couple weeks for the checks to clear from the previous bank and went in to withdraw my funds and close my accounts. When I told the teller what I wanted to do she asked me if I needed to talk to a manager, I said no, she insisted. A minute later the gent that refused my loan walked up and asked if there was some issue why I was closing my accounts, Nope, no problems! He insisted and I looked at him and told him I went to another bank that wanted my business and went on to explain the loan he has refused. I could tell at first he didn't remember and the look in his eyes when he realized was priceless.\n\nI have been with the second bank for 35 years, two home loans and several auto loans over the years.",

It was the Friday evening before the closing date and they told her they had to postpone settlement for possibly up to a month. This meant the builder could renegotiate the cost of the home to reflect current new home prices, which had gone up nearly $50,000 since she signed the purchase agreement. It also meant they could charge a higher interest rate and additional fees. Fortunately, she was able to close on time using alternative financing.

        "selftext": "This happened to me a few years ago. I was owed a significant sum of money by the company which handles my doctor\u2019s billing (she worked at a large healthcare system which outsourced billing to this company). For months and months I tried via email and phone to get the money back....but each contact I was treated rudely or ignored. They would either say they are still working on it or would act like I had never requested the money in the first place and needed to start the process over. It was maddening.\n\nOne day after receiving another rude email from this company I decided to leave a Yelp review on my doctor\u2019s page. I essentially said that while the doctor and her staff were helpful and professional, the billing company they used was atrocious and made the entire experience not worth it.\n\nLo and behold, the very next day I get a call from the CEO OF THE BILLING COMPANY. He asks what the problem is and I explain. He says, \u201cOk, I\u2019ll make sure the money gets sent ASAP. Could you please take the review down?\u201d Apparently he was getting angry calls from my doctor and he seemed pretty pressured to get it taken down.\n\nI respond that I can take the review down after I get my money back. He gladly accepts my offer. A week later, there is my check in the mail.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing though. I never specified how long until I would take the review down after I get the money. So I wait a week. Get some calls/texts from the CEO. Ignore them. Wait another week. Respond that I\u2019m having technical problems logging into Yelp but should have it resolved \u2018soon\u2019. After about 6 months of him reaching out and me being as unhelpful as possible I finally took it down. The next time I returned to that doctors office, it was a whole new billing system, not sure if my review made a difference but it was sweet malicious compliance regardless\n\nEDIT:  \nWow this has really blown up. Thank you for the awards.\n\nI went back to review my correspondences with the billing company. It made me realize the whole situation was even more screwed up than I had originally described here. The reason they owed me money was because at first, my insurance had told me they were not going to cover the appointments because the doctor was not in-network. However, I had found the doctor through my insurance website. When I went back to check, the doctors name was no longer listed on their website. Luckily for me, I had taken a screenshot at the time so I could have the phone number for the doctor on hand. After I sent the insurance company the screenshot, they agreed to cover the appointments. They paid the billing company, yet the billing company refused to refund me the money I had paid. So essentially, they were collecting from both myself and the insurance company and trying to get away with it. American healthcare in a nutshell lol.\n\nAlso, when I told my wife about this post she told me I need to make a correction. The CEO sent me a check within four days, it was not even an entire week. After months and months of reaching out.\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nI\u2019m not going to provide the name of the billing company, I don\u2019t need any more drama with them.\n\nThe insurance company was Aetna. Seriously screw them.",

I did not want to pay up front for their fee when I knew, after the claim processed, I would owe less and then have to fight for a refund. I ultimately left the office without seeing the doctor, and left them a negative Yelp review.\n\nThe *doctor himself* then started sending me private messages on Yelp, saying he couldn't find any patient records with my first name and last initial as they appeared on the site (no shit, Sherlock; I never went through with the appointment, and the review said as much), and as such, he deemed my review defamatory and posted to the wrong business. He went on a whole tirade about how he'd pursue litigation, and he recently just won $50,000 pursuing another Yelper in court. Even if I had posted to the wrong business (I hadn't), coming in this hot to what could have been an honest mistake was a bad play.\n\nI responded asking him how exactly he intended to serve me with a lawsuit if he had no record of me, and thus no address for me. I then also shared a screenshot of how I searched his name and practice name in the local district and circuit court databases and found no results of him ever being a plaintiff, but several where he was a civil defendant and even one where he had been charged with a misdemeanor, and told him that lying was not a good look.

Unfortunately after two years of working there, they retired.\n\nNew owner came in, put up multiple cameras (like 8 in a 3m x 10m coffee shop with all the cameras trained on the counter and staff areas) and used to proposition the girls (we were all university students so 17-21 years old) that they would get extra shifts if they went home with him.

He decides that the uniform will change, but only for the girls.\n\nNow the girls will wear a midriff top with the cafe logo and low rise pants. The boys still get to wear the old uniform. We argued that it was unsafe (hot coffee and plates of food next to bare skin) and got told too bad, so sad. Staff got together and hashed out a plan.\n\nThe first day of the new uniform, the girls showed up in the old uniform. The boys showed up in the midriff tops and the low rise pants.\n\nThe new uniform policy lasted an hour.

            "Reminds me of an incident at my last workplace, a casino. So once a year there was a big poker event/tournament, it lasted a week and was a lot of fun. Most of us that were interested in poker wanted to work those days. My boss at the time , a woman who is nice and all, but... well she\u2019s... not the sharpest tool in the shed. She had decided that it would be fun if the female poker brushes (the boss in the poker room) working that week wore evening gowns. \nWe all wore uniforms every day, it was the same for both men and women. Black shoes, pants, shirt, a vest and a jacket. Women had the choice to wear a skirt instead of pants. I would have had no problem if the dress were strict and stylish. But the one they picked was a lime/grass green monstrosity with a deep d\u00e9colletage and a slit up to the thigh. It was nasty to say the least. \nAs a woman working as a poker brush it takes a long time to gain any sort of respect, poker is in the deepest pits of testosterone land. So I knew, trying to make decisions that wouldn\u2019t be immediately questioned whilst wearing the green goblin thing would be impossible. \nSo when the said boss asked me if I wanted to work that week I accepted on the premise that I could wear my usual uniform, same as the men. I was turned town then. \nSo anyway, this pissed a lot of people off, especially when it became clear that she chose the women in dresses to work INSTEAD of the men who were supposed to ONLY be working as brushes, nothing else, and who were the ones that knew the most and actually made the rules in the poker room. So in a meeting before the event they confronted her about this. And it went something like this:\n\nGuys - it\u2019s not ok that you move us from our stations and let less knowledgeable people work when it\u2019s such an important event. \n\nBoss - Well, I have decided that MY GIRLS wearing dresses should work instead. \n\nG - So it\u2019s because they wear the dress?\n\nB - Yes\n\nG - So we\u2019ll wear the dress then. \n\nB - You can\u2019t do that. *giggle* you\u2019re men. Men can\u2019t wear dresses. \n\nG - Yes they can. You know there are laws against discrimination right?\n\nB - I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m the boss and I decide what goes. \n\nThe girls worked in their dresses. The guys were sent off to do other tasks that they hated and hadn\u2019t done in years. \n\nI know they talked to a lawyer about suing or actually report to the authorities for discrimination. But they needed ONE to take the lead. And no one was in the mood to completely wreck their career just then.\n\nEDIT: fixed a few grammatical errors.",

As long as we got our tasks done, if something came up and we needed to slip out a few minutes early, they never had much of an issue. I rarely took advantage of it, but if I had to, I always made sure to make up those few minutes elsewhere. \n\nThis new boss comes along and is such a micromanager and control freak. Now, we are not allowed to be even a minute late or leave a minute early. We need to actually put in for PTO, either for a half or full day, just to be able to slip out a few minutes early. I had an appointment one say and offered to work through my break time just to leave a few minutes early. Boss balked at the idea. I arranged ahead of time for a whole personal day off. I booked myself a massage and went out to lunch before my appointment. Boss wasn\u2019t happy with me for taking a personal day , especially since we\u2019re currently short-staffed, but I did follow their policy.",

            "I once put in an official PTO request to leave about an hour early for a doctor appointment  for a chronic condition that has to be managed. My manager responded that she'd have to see how busy we were that day,so basically a no. I hadn't wanted to go through the trouble of getting  FMLA certified, just because I wasn't going to do all that paperwork if I didn't have to. But after that refusal, I had to. It was no problem getting intermittent FMLA approved, and after that I could go to any doctor appointment  or call off and my boss couldn't do a damn thing about it. I would have been happy to schedule appointments on days, or times of the day when we were likely to be less busy, but after that I didn't care.",

He insisted that I should be there at 7:45 every day but would not pay me for that extra time. I continued to arrive at my regular time and one day he started yelling at me for arriving late.  I wasn't but he had changed the clock to be 15 minutes behind.  I continued to arrive at the actual time and just told him the real time when he mentioned it and show him on my phone. The malicious compliance came in because I left every day precisely when the clock in the office turned to 5.

He had a doctor's appointment coming up so he worked extra the days before so he wouldn't have to take the time off his weekly work. Nope.

            "I used to be a high school teacher and became pregnant with my first kid. For the third trimester of my pregnancy, I had a doctors appointment once a week. \nMy school was running out of money for substitute teachers (non union state, absolutely a thing). Classes ran on semesters, and teachers taught three out of four 97-minute blocks, with the final block serving as a planning period. I suggested that a simple way to save on substitute money would be to schedule me to have last block planning for the second half of the year, and it was possible with the classes scheduled for that semester. I agreed to schedule all of my appointments for the afternoon if they did this. I would still use 2 hours of sick leave, but there would be no money spent for a substitute.  Instead, they scheduled me with first block planning, which ended 7 minutes after my doctor's office opened.  I took a full sick day for every single appointment because I couldn't leave and get back in time to teach more than one class, and if I left early they would force one of my peers to cover the class during their planning instead of hiring a substitute. So, they paid for 12 additional days of substitutes unnecessarily.",

He was further pissed when he started talking Shyte about me to others on shift (I was a group lead) and was shut down. Not only did he start to become isolated and was only addressed in reference to work related issues (we worked a four day on four day off on premises type of schedule) but started to deny everyone\u2019s pto/vacation requests.

            "I worked at a call center many years ago. The job was absolutely terrible and I fought traffic for a 45-60 minute commute both ways every day. They had a system where you could call in and request a \u2018flex\u2019 to your schedule, where basically you could move small amounts of time, maybe start 15 min later in exchange for a shorter break or leaving 15 min later. The trouble was, this was entirely up to them to allow or deny based on their need, there was no consideration for the employees.\n\nSo, one morning I\u2019m 5 minutes from the house and I get onto the highway. . . And it\u2019s stopped dead, both directions. I turn on the radio and hear an ex president just landed and every highway exit in the city has been blocked at 8am so he can get to a neighboring city an hour away (that had its own airport). Basically, expect to be stuck in traffic until noon. So, I called and requested Flex Time thinking maybe I could get off the highway and snake my way through back roads. denied. So, I call back and ask what the penalties are for being half an hour, an hour, 4 hours late. The guy on the phone gets snippy with me (I\u2019m assuming they are flooded with people calling in to be late) and says \u2018it doesn\u2019t matter, if you aren\u2019t here on time you may as well not be here at all, because it\u2019s treated the same. We have schedules and expect you here on time.\u2019 Ok. I hang up. I call back. \u2018Hey, it\u2019s me again, I\u2019m feeling sick now so I\u2019m just not going to come into work.\u2019 I went home and enjoyed a beautiful day off.\n\nThe next day, they pulled me into HR and went over the interactions and tried to give me a double write up for being late and missing work. I told them that wasn\u2019t right, that I\u2019d been told on a recorded line that being late would be penalized the same as missing the entire day, so I chose to miss the day. If they really wanted or needed me there, maybe they should have shown more compassion for something I had zero control over.

            "If you looked at the balance sheet for most of these type bosses I suspect you would find a VERY low net worth. Why? Because they don\u2019t understand investing for the long term.

            "I have never understood the pettiness and power trips of bosses and supervisors. I made my career as an elementary school teacher for 35 years. In the mid-90s my brother had a serious heart attack. Was hospitalized for 10 days and was on bed rest for almost 2 months after. I managed his real estate and advertising business for 2 months because my brother had to take precautions due to the large amounts of cash that was in and out of the business every day. Was absolutely eye-opening. I made sure that money was not mishandled and people did not take advantage. Quickly searched out three or four employees out of 20 that really new their stuff. I quickly figured out that the employees had self-interest in the smooth running of the company ,lessening everybody stress. I was so happy to be little more than a rumor and let the people that knee what the hell they were doing run with the ball. There was always money in the business to subcontract something that the employees couldn't do properly or efficiently, and have an outside lawyer or accountant review paperwork that I did not understand. Of course I did not have the experience and skills to continue that high level of responsibility. However, I never forgot that summer where I learned that the best managers are the ones that manage the least and simply figure out who knows what the hell they're doing and step out of the way. The only problem long-term with that philosophy is that the competent employees could get burned out with extra work. I found out that for a short time most of my brothers employees were just happy I didn't get in their face or stare over their shoulder.",

            "Same thing happened to me once.  I worked at a school as a teaching assistant.  I would sometimes stay after to help out, come to after, come to parent teacher meetings, stuff like that.  I was technically hourly, but I never submitted time sheets for this stuff.  It amounted to maybe 6-10 hours a year.  Really nothing major.\n\nSo some of my colleagues were chronically late for their morning duties.  We had to be there at 7:45, and they would show up at 8, or sometimes even 5-10 minutes after 8.  The old principal just kinda let it slide, never scheduled them in spots that mattered for morning duties.  This one was not having that though.  Started writing people up for chronic issues.\n\nLong story short these idiots thought they had some special union protection, but were outside contract so there was nothing the union could do for them.  The central office didn't want to have a union battle on their hands though, so everyone decided on a new policy.  If you were late you would be penalized 1/2 a sick day.  All the sudden the tardiness stopped.\n\nThat was until a couple weeks later I got a flat on the way to work.  I called ahead to let them know what had happened and that I would be there as soon as possible.  I ended up getting there at 8:11.  I got called down around 8:25 for them to have me sign the paper work that I would be docked for my half day.\n\nI signed the papers, and began to walk out of the school.  They asked where I was going, and I said \"Doesn't matter.  I will see you at 11:30.\" \n\nThe principal came chasing after me, and threatened my job.  I smiled and told her that if they were docking me half a day, I was gonna take the the half day.  If they didn't like it, they could talk to our union rep about it.\n\nTurns out, since the contract laid out the specifics on being tardy the district was in violation of the contract.  They had no authority to dock us half days.\n\nI still lost my half day, but fuck that bullshit.  I gave extra time over and over again and it stopped after that.  I submitted time sheets for everything.  They stopped inviting me to meetings.  The teachers and administration had to scramble to figure out how to report about the students I worked with.  So they started asking me to write up reports.  I told them I didn't have time to do that inside my work day, as pretty much every minute was inside a classroom or my lunch / break time.  So I ended up getting planning time every day of 30 minutes to process data and write reports.  I was the only assistant in the district with this time.",

Things were moving upwards last year, bought a house, she was offered a position in her field and only a few dollars less an hour than I was making after 6 years in my own field.

They were very loud and screamed constantly during all hours of the day and night. Not just giggle playing screams but blood curdling horror screams.\n\nAll. The. Time.\n\nOne day I get a knock at my door and see two blue shirt police officers; white guy and Hispanic woman. They ask me if I've seen anything strange, creepers, uncomfortable situations, etc. Things have been pretty normal and say as much. They proceed to tell me that a little girl is missing and if I had heard a scream or struggle. I let them know that the children scream everyday and constantly, so I wouldn't have paid attention to any particular scream.\n\nThat's when the Hispanic officer lost it. She got IN my face about racist white males ignoring the plight of Hispanics, not caring about the neighborhood and community and for not calling the police when I heard a child scream.\n\nSo I agreed to dial 911 at every child scream from that point on.\n\nWithin three days I had to called 911 at least 15 times. Each time I explained it was relevant to case #XXXX with officer (Hispanic lady) that I should report a child screaming in the neighborhood.\n\nEventually I got a call from a superior officer about abusing 911. I agreed and was told to contact Hispanic officer directly with any other information regarding the investigation.\n\nMalicious compliance level II. \n\nNow I was authorized to call Hispanic officer directly, day or night, when I had information regarding the investigation.\n\nAnd I did.

I didn't read 800+ comments but I'll try to give some more information over all.\n\n-MC level I ended after the first weekend and MC level II ended by the second week.\n\n-More than once (witness car accidents, questions about domestic violence) I've been given direct contact information by officers. Though in this case I was given the business contact by the other officer.\n\n-The white male partner during the initial encounter did nothing. I could only tell he was alive because he blinked. He was a non issue.\n\n-I probably was too casual about dismissing children screaming, but it was the officer who decided I was ignoring 911 worthy phone call situations. Quit your bitching.\n\n-Duh, it's malicious compliance so someone will call fake. I'm not telling a boring everyday story but a once in a lifetime one off. That's the interesting part.\n\nEdit #2 and hopefully last addition.\n\nThis was as much a CYA(cover your ass) as it was Malicious Compliance.

            "I'm going to assume you didn't lead with a racial slur about the 'screaming spic kids' or even a slur-free comment that was racially loaded, like 'the Hispanic kids in this neighborhood are loud' or something.  If you had used such wording, then yeah, I can understand the cop taking offense.\n\nHowever, as I said, I'm going to assume you didn't do that, in which case, this woman's reaction is way over the top.  How does 'the kids in this neighborhood scream all the time' become 'I hate Hispanics'?  Some people look to take offense in any way they can.  They struggle to interpret words in the worst possible way, so they can claim offense.  I have zero patience with these people, and had it been me, I would have continued calling Officer Snowflake upon each child's scream until she a) resigned, b) was assigned/transferred to a different precinct/neighborhood, or c) simply *apologized for calling me racist*.\n\nI remember years ago a guy I knew accused me of being racist.  The reason?  I'm not a fan of rap music.  His reasoning?  To a large degree, rap/hip-hop has its roots in traditional African musical styles, therefore not liking rap means I'm racist against black people.  Of course, if I *did* enjoy rap music and the hip-hop subculture, in today's world, I'd be accused of 'cultural appropriation' or some such bullshit.\n\nUnwarranted accusations of racism are just as divisive as racism; they label and divide people, and imply that some people's opinions and feelings don't matter as much.

I had to take a job, any job, to provide health insurance (Murka!) while hubby looked for a new gig. I got a job as a teller at a bank. \n\nI tried, but was new to keeping a till, so a few times a week, my register wouldn't balance. Never very much money - under a few dollars. But the whole staff had to stay late until we straightened it out. I felt horrible for the rest of the staff. As if that shame wasn't bad enough, my supervisor, \"Mel,\" would remind me that I worked \"at will\" and they could fire me at any time. Our family's health insurance going up in smoke was terrifying to me. Sometimes it was hard to hold back tears.\n\nI got better as the summer went on, but every few weeks, if I would make a mistake, Mel would smile as she warned me that \"You can be fired for no cause and you'd have to leave immediately.\" It was so fantastically over-the-top. At one point, I pointed out that constant threats didn't create a healthy environment. Her smile only broadened. \"It goes both ways. You can quit at any time, you know.\"\n\nWhen the school year started in the fall, I needed to take my daughter to tour her new school for her first day. I asked to take my lunch in the afternoon, so I could help my daughter. Though they approved it, when it came time for my lunch, they insisted I work through my lunch because they were being slammed.. By then, hubs had found a job with insurance and, even. better, I'd been offered more hours teaching, tho still not full-time. It was enough.\n\nThe next day I practically floated into the bank. I waited until 10 am, then told Mel I needed to talk with her.  She replied that she was very busy and it would have to wait until after we closed. \"Oh, I won't be here then,\" I said.  She looked like I'd smacked her with a brick. \"Wut?\"  I smiled. \"Remember that I needed to bring my daughter to her new school yesterday? You wouldn't let me do that, so I'm doing it this afternoon.\"  She didn't get it at all. \"You can't just take an hour off when you-\"  I had to interrupt. \"I'm not taking an hour off. I'm leaving. For good. At noon. You kept reminding me that I work \"at will.\" Thanks for those reminders. I'm leaving for good in two hours.\"\n\nWhile Mel fumed, I waited on customers. I practically sang my greetings to them and was so fucking cheerful, customers kept asking me why I was so happy. :). I was delighted to tell them, \"Because I'm leaving forever at noon!\"  After a half hour of that, Mel thought I should just go right away. And I did. I fucking skipped right out the door , then gave Mel a very elaborate curtsey at the door. :)",

This company policy was to extend it everytime. That kind of  company always do this, it is usually called \"human meat traders\".

            "Had a similar experience, many moons ago, working a part-time job near the end of high school. I'd been there for a few years and was earning the top hourly wage for a part-timer. I was also fairly well-trained and responsible, so I was usually offered extra shifts and holidays when pay was time-and-a-half. The owner/manager and his wife were notoriously stingy, and doubly so when they had to pay extra to be open on civic holidays (even though they made a lot of money, since many other stores were closed). It was the Easter long weekend and I worked Good Friday and Easter Monday. The whole weekend, four days, long shifts (8 hours I think). My department head gave me a long list of tasks, which I was able to finish within three days. On the fourth day I focused on menial tasks like cleaning and back-orders. Not very difficult, but it was all I could do. Even offered to jump on the tills or help the grocery guys load/unload heavy stuff. \n\nI show up about a week later and the owner/manager tells me to come into the office. Sits me down on a super low office chair (he was five foot tall, I am nearly six, so I'm fairly sure it was a power move). I get reamed out for not working hard enough over the long weekend. Says other staff members noticed me doing nothing several times, and they even \"checked\" on cameras to see if I was working. First it was implied, then I was straight up accused of being lazy when unsupervised. For the first time I had had *enough*. \n\nAt the end of the rant, the owner/manager asked if I had anything to say. I tried to explain myself, but it was clear his mind was made up. I asked for him to provide the camera evidence of my laziness, but was told he'd seen it and that was enough. I was a bad employee, due to hearsay and speculation. My extensive service meant nothing. So at the end of my attempted defense, I said I quit. \n\nHis eyes nearly jumped out of his skull. Demanding I repeat myself, I simply said \"consider this my two weeks' notice. I'll work this shift, but will have my next shifts rescheduled.\" And that was it. He tried to withhold my last paycheque by demanding I come \"in person\", when he could easily just mail it for less than a dollar. My father ended that pretty quickly, if I recall.\n\nSo, yeah, at will definitely goes both ways. People can only be pushed so far, and everyone has their breaking point. Too many jobs are just not worth the bullshit.",

            "I was a typical overworked, oft-abused pizza delivery guy.  During the entire 9 months I was a driver, the assistant manager was constantly telling me, \"I could fire you at any time for any reason.  This is an at-will state.  Just do what I tell you.\"\n\nBecause of the abuse and fact that I couldn't save more than $200 a month, I started looking elsewhere for employment.  I got a job offer (rescinded because the company was downsizing) in another town and put in my two-weeks notice to the store owner.  Apparently, the assistant manager thought so little of me that he thought he could just order me to stay as long as he wanted me to.\n\nTypically, we drivers would pick up a couple of extra hours at the end of the shift because of how busy we were.  In fact, it was so routine that it as pretty much expected.  My last day there, the end of my shift was busier than normal because of a promotion we were running.  I mean, it was so busy that our normal delivery time was stretched from normally 20 minutes to over an hour.  A couple of drivers were a little upset at me still being there after the end of my shift because they wanted the money the extra deliveries were giving them.\n\nSo, two hours into the extra 5 hours I was supposed to pick up, I told the owner that it had been a pleasure working with him but that it was time for me to leave.  He and I went to the back office to count me out and give me my last paycheck.  We wished each other well and I walked toward the door while he stayed in the office to finish the paperwork.  Cue the assistant manager, \"Hey!  You can't leave until I give you permission!\"  I told him I had already quit and didn't have to do anything he told me.  \"You can't quit without my permission!\"\n\n\"Being in an at-will state means that I can quit whenever I want!

        "selftext": "I run a repair shop where I employ a bunch of local kids (ages 16+) to learn skills and make some money while we generally sit around and talk about the world while we fix things.\n\nWe had a client come in with a busted electronic; we fixed it up for her and gave her a decent discount on the work; her final bill for parts and four hours of labor was a hundred dollars even, discounted down from two-hundred and twenty.\n\nShe didn't like the bill. She didn't like the work. She claimed that we'd broken something else. She claimed that the kid who did the work didn't know what she was doing (she did, and I had supervised her) and that the kid who helped her in the front room was rude to her (he wasn't, but she didn't like the little pride flag pin he was wearing). She demanded to see the manager, so I popped out, listened to her tear into my kids, validated how she was feeling, but pointed out that the work she had asked for was done, done correctly, and her bill was due on pick-up of the piece.\n\nThe last straw for her came when she pulled out a credit card and I had to inform her that we don't accept that particular card. She literally asked me \"Do you know who I am?\" (which I didn't, still don't, don't care), and I told her we'd take a personal check. She wrote out a check, problem solved.\n\nI deposited the day's checks, and got a note from my bank that one had bounced. Her check, of course.\n\nI called her the next day to inform her that her check had been returned for insufficient funds, and that she'd need to come in and pay her bill, plus the extra fee for a returned check. All of these fees, just to point this out, were clearly outlined on the service agreement she'd signed - and we'd already discounted her a hundred and twenty dollars, just to be nice. Anyway.\n\nShe rolls up into the office carrying a bag, and I knew exactly what was going on. She drops - of course - a bag of pennies on the front desk. She's breathing heavily - we're on the second floor and she'd taken the stairs - and she announces triumphantly that she's here to pay her bill. She just needs to go get the rest of our \"hard-earned money\" (said with a sneer, of course). The kid at the front desk looks like he's about to cry, so I stop working on the thing I'm working on and take over.\n\n\"How many more bags do you have?\" I ask her, and she says that the nice people at the bank loaded them up in her car. She didn't count them. I told her that was fine, we'd wait for her to bring them all up and then settle up her bill. She was expecting a bigger reaction, I think - either that or she hadn't thought this through.\n\nTen thousand pennies, plus the extra twenty-five dollars, weighs a lot. And she'd just committed to carrying them through a parking lot and up a flight of stairs. One of my kids, bless his heart, offered to help her carry them. She refused.\n\nFinally, shaking and sweaty, she deposited the last of the bags on the countertop. The pennies were loose, not in coin-rolls. She'd done some work to prove her point.\n\nWhat she hadn't counted on was that we'd need to count the pennies.\n\nWhile the other kids took care of other clients and fixed things in the back, the front-desk guy and I counted up the pennies. She started to realize that this was going to take a while, and tried to leave; I told her that she couldn't leave until we'd signed off on her bill, since at this point she was in violation of her service agreement and had passed a bad check, we couldn't just take her word for it, and I would inform our local constabulary if she left without paying. I was kinda talking out of my ass, but she'd managed to tick me off a little. The other clients in the shop came and went, and we counted. Phone calls came in and were handled by my kids, and we counted. She sat down in a chair (folding steel, not super-comfortable), stood up again, walked around the office, and we counted. After a while, she said \"Just forget it,\" and took out a hundred and twenty-five dollars in bills. We signed off on her agreement and she started to leave.\n\nAnother one of my kids, bless his heart, asked her if she wanted help carrying the pennies back to her car. She looked at all of us with a face of sheer panic, mumbled \"no, thank you, just keep them,\" and bolted.\n\nThe whole shop was silent for a moment. Then one of the kids started giggling, and nobody could stop. People coming in thought we'd gone nuts, and I finally had to banish everybody to the back room until they could breathe again. We loaded the bags into my vehicle - we used the elevator she'd walked by a few times - took them to the bank and used the coin machine to deposit them, then wrote out a donation to our local shelter for the amount she'd dropped off.\n\nShe posted something nasty on facebook about it and got ratio'd; she had, of course, posted earlier about what she was going to do and she got called out with her own post. My favorite response was something like \"You said you were going to pay your bill in pennies, you paid your bill in pennies - what went wrong?\"\n\nPlease don't pay your bills in pennies, folks. Especially if you're just doing it to be a dick.",

I'm not a super-extroverted kind of guy, so all of this feedback was a little overwhelming; if I didn't respond to your comment, I apologize (but I did read it).\n\nAs many of you twigged, this story does not take place in the US; English is my first language and I grew up in the US, but my family and I left years and years ago. Thanks to everybody for their kind thoughts (and their expertise on different countries' respective coinage laws, those are great!), and thanks for your understanding about wanting to protect my privacy and the privacy of the kids I work with. Between my sweetheart's job (family social assistance) and the rough home situations of some of these kids, it's important to us to keep everybody safe, and thank you guys for respecting that, it's very kind of you.\n\nGiven that, the story *was* translated into American English: there's no coin called the \"penny\" where we are, but there is its equivalent; I also translated our currency into dollars for the ease of context and extra deliberate obfuscation. I would also like to shout-out the person who called me out for using \"ratio'd\"; that's definitely one of my \"hello, fellow kids\" moments. I work with teenagers, I need to keep hip to the groovy lingo. Thank you for checking me - don't worry, I've been getting absolutely mercilessly busted-on since this story caught on. They're good kids, and I'm very proud of them. And they need to stop making fun of me for being older than dirt (or those danged pokeyman games).\n\nAlso, thank you for not pig-piling on the woman who tried to pull this stunt. I genuinely harbor no ill will towards her; she did a foolish thing and got swacked for it - as far as I'm concerned, that's the end of the story. As came up in the comments, she is definitely not the worst person to come into the shop, and I hope she's having a better day and making better choices than she was on the day in question.\n\nSo, thank you for reading. This was bananas. If the story gave you a chuckle during a tough day, I'm glad. Be kind to yourselves and each other, try your best to assume positive intentions, and learn from your mistakes. We're all good people who can forget that about ourselves sometimes - each and every one of you brings something unique into this world, and you deserve dignity and respect. If you've got a moment and want to talk something out, I'm here to listen. Take good care out there, and work hard to be the person you want to be.",

            "Pro tip!\n\nAs your story makes obvious, you already know that coin-tender is still legal tender.  Thus, I take issue with the entire concept of having to *pay* some company, or some bank, a percentage of the coin-currency's value just for the privilege of uSiNg ThEiR sPeCiaL cOiN CoUnTiNg mAcHiNe to sort it all.\n\nWhenever I have large quantities of coins to transact, I make my way to any grocery store / big-box store that offers automated self checkout.  There, I simply *make a frickin purchase* and pay the automated self-checkout kiosk with my coins!  Bonues if the purchase is actually useful to me in some way, but even that is unnecessary.  I'm fond of simply grabbing a package of shaving razors (a package of 4 can run more than $28 US, that's insane and deserves its own separate discussion....)  It's a single item, one that can absorb a surprisingly large buffer of coin-inventory.  It's a cash purchase... one where I immediately get a receipt... *and can then immediately proceed to their customer-service desk for a full NON-COIN cash refund!!*\n\nPS -- to make your task extra convenient for yourself, pre-sort your coins by denomination.  Begin by paying / inserting ALL of the pennies, and only when exhausted of pennies, I then proceed to use nickels, then dimes and quarters.  I find that literally carrying them to the store with each denomination in a separate sock (not kidding) is un-obtrusive, un-obnoxious, perfectly un-suspicious, makes it VERY easy for others to ignore you during your task, and when you're done you can literally just stuff your now-filthy-from-dirty-coins socks into your pants pocket.  If you're sooper methodical, make sure to use your oldest and shittiest socks that need to be thrown into the trash anyway!\n\nMore coins than a single item's cost?  Repeat the process.  (What, is that a crime?)  I've literally bought a pack of razors, completed the purchase, turned around to refund said purchase, *and then repeated the exact same.process by re-buying the very item that I just got refunded!!*\n\nLegit, though, do your best to plan this for non,peak retail hours.  Spending literally 12-15 minutes plunking pennies and nickels into a kiosk is a slight dick-move to a customer waiting behind you, particularly if said customer has a young child in tow.",

The building was under construction (finishing units and such) so there was quite a bit of dust but other than that it was fairly easy work and at the time I was getting above minimum wage.\n\nI was the only cleaner in the building but I was good friends with the security guards and would hang out with them on most of my breaks.

Next break I had I sat down with the security guards and they joked that I should just have a cigarette in my hand but not actually smoke it. That's when I decided to be a little bit creative with my malicious compliance.\n\nThe next day I came into work with a small pack of sparklers. I kept them in my pocket and when I saw the security guards taking a smoke break I went out with them pulled out a sparkler lit it up and just kind of stood there with them as the sparkler went off. We all had a good chuckle about it. \n\nThe boss saw me and came outside probably to talk to me about not taking a smoke break if I wasn't a smoker, but he saw the sparkler in my hand.

He cut in line (of course) but he was literally surrounded by nukes the whole time he was there. As e-div and m-div finished their cigarettes, they would go relieve someone on watch to come back and smoke. Technically there was a time limit, but the COB was a \"rules for thee, but not for me\" kind of douche, so he would spend upwards of 45 minutes at times back there.\n\nIt was disgusting, half of us weren't really smokers and I actually got sick one of the times we pulled this...

I stated that, just because I wasn\u2019t interested in polluting my lungs with an addictive carcinogenic substance, I shouldn\u2019t be deprived of the extra break time, too. If those people were unable to handle their nicotine cravings then they should use some of the company services that assisted employees struggling with nicotine addiction.

Caught you once, you were written up, caught you twice you were done. Between cameras and my unexpected drop ins that started after, catching them was easy.\n\nThey thought they had me because I would be short staffed or something.

Naturally, I got hungry, and usually I can ignore it, but that time I felt close to fainting, so seeing as the kitchen was having no problems I went to the changing room to grab literally a bite or two of my sandwich, which took 30 second max. I was taking the second bite, when an angry manager ran up to me, and started yelling about me wasting time they are paying me for and threatening to fire me, and if I want to eat I need to clock out (which cuts my pay.
