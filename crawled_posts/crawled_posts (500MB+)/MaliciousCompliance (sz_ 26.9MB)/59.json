        "selftext": "*ETA: A genogram is like a family tree, but with extra symbols (e.g. a beer bottle for my alcoholic father!) and lines connecting each person. The type of line dictates the type of relationship- close, smothering, distant, estranged, abusive, etc.*\n\nI studied social work in school... I found myself doing 3 genograms over the course of my schooling, 1 for Intro to Social Work, one for Sociology of Mental Health and then ANOTHER in my last year. I have some not-fun family history and trauma, and so these assignments were never my favorite, but my teachers for the first two didn\u2019t pressure me to disclose only what I wanted and be vague. (One even said I could do a fictional family! Lol.) The last one did not.\n\nSee, one thing we learned was that bringing up a client\u2019s trauma outside of a therapeutic environment can be harmful. We were BSWs, which are not qualified therapists. During intakes and assessments, we learned to tell clients that they don\u2019t have to give more details than they wanted to. There\u2019s a whole host of reasons behind this, but I\u2019ll spare you all the lecture.\n\nI brought this up in class after this teacher assigned an extensive genogram with an accompanying 5 page essay on what we learned about ourselves. A third of the class expressed the same concerns. His reasoning was \u201cYou might be doing this with your clients and you shouldn\u2019t ask them to do anything you wouldn\u2019t yourself.\u201d (Not unless I get a graduate degree and become a therapist or psychologist!) The teacher also didn\u2019t give us an answer when asked if resources for therapy would be provided if this brought up any student\u2019s\u2019 past trauma that they needed to talk about.\n\nOh, and of course, he added \u201cThis will only be shared with me and is 100% confidential, unless you choose to share.\u201d Literally not any of our concerns, but I don\u2019t want to share any of my deeply personal business with this man. \n\nThe assignment did not bother me as much as the hypocrisy of it all!  I said \u201cBetween class assignments and therapy, this will be my fifth one. Could I turn one of those in and be given an alternate assignment?\u201d He wouldn\u2019t budge. He said I didn\u2019t need to disclose anything I didn\u2019t want to, but followed it up with \u201cbut I expect you to take this assignment seriously.\u201d And when I turned in a rough draft with about as much as I was willing to disclose, he said it wasn\u2019t detailed enough.\n\nAlright, fucker. It\u2019s show time.\n\nI have a lot of family trauma that is NOT mine to disclose, and I rarely ever disclose it. At least not with anyone who would ever meet the folks involved. My own is embarrassing enough. But definitely not as bad as some. But I put all that shit down on there and wrote about it. Then, the following week, the teacher asked if any students would like to share their genogram, if they\u2019re comfortable. My hand shot up.\n\nI will spare you the details, but I basically gave the class a content notice to allow anyone to leave who may be triggered (a common thing in social work school), and then I just shared ALL of it. All of the relationships and why they were fucked up and why I hate my dad and my sister resents my mom and all that. Cheery smile on my face the whole time. The teacher uncomfortably thanked me for my bravery. A few students shifted in their seats, feeling uneasy. Others smiled.\n\nThen my friend volunteered to share. She didn\u2019t like the assignment either, but she\u2019s not one to argue with teachers. Her presentation trumped mine (girl had a real messed up family), and by the end, she was red in the face and everyone was super uncomfortable.\n\nNext person to volunteer to share was this girl who was in foster care, I\u2019m not even sure if her sharing was malicious compliance? But hers was the most uncomfortable to hear. She started to cry at the end. Another student who also grew up in foster care, started to tear up.\n\nThe teacher cut us off after that.\n\nAnother teacher overheard and the following week, we had some serious discussions in class. I and the other students who shared were referred to the school\u2019s mental health center (Lol). Another teacher I had a good relationship with checked in with me, and I told her what happened. I can\u2019t tell for certain what went on, but it created a stink in their department. It\u2019s been several years since I graduated, but I heard there is now an alternative assignment for the genogram.\n\nSo... lesson is, don\u2019t tell social work students to do something that you tell them to never do to their clients, and you don\u2019t get into social work unless you are traumatized AF.",

Anything for multiple suicide attempts?\u201d Yeah, she got REAL real fast and immediately told us that sharing was 100% optional and that if anyone had been triggered to see her after class/go to the counseling center (which, ironically, a group project for social policy class found out that our counseling center had been turning away MSW\u2019s because our Dept has interns there; we brought it to the Dean and forced change, yay social workers!).

I am horrified at that assignment for you and anyone else forced to complete it.\n\nWe had a class on those things and had to do one for real, fictional and our own families. No one had to reveal if they disclosed their own family or how much (if any) of their own was real.  We were asked to do some work on our own, but not as an assignment we had to share.\n\nI'm glad you were able to take something that was abusive and make a difference in your program.

No one else agreed with me though so I made up a fictional family. I had done four other genograms by this project and included everything recommended in my two textbooks which explain genograms. I only got a 71 and the prof commented that it wasn't detailed enough. But I saw four other students' genogram projects (including the papers, not just the map) and mine was significantly better written and more detailed (don't mean to sound rude, but I went back to do this program after completing a diff degree and other students were also younger) , but three of the four of them got 90s or high 80s so.

I feel people knowing about what I went through can help them identify potentially children around them being abused and how to help them out. \n\nI do help the cps in my area with some advocacy and support with abused kids, in a here's a nice lady to be with you while everyone wants to talk about the bad stuff, can you talk to this lady cos she knows what your going through with this court decision she can help us answer your questions and help you think of good ones to ask type thing. I go into my past with those kids, especially when I'm the buddy so they have someone they know who get its. They get it. \n\nI baulk at more then those situations. It's not just that it's traumatic to some tho to forget it possibly could be is awful, I don't necessarily become overwhelmed because of it I just get saddened for a while and I choose to be happy, I choose to be healthy and I choose to try and be the best me that I can be, I've done the work with therapy. \n\nYou know why some people become teachers vs actually practice their knowledge in the field.

I remember in mid secondary (English class) we had a mandatory exercise in which we had to publicly talk about our fears and why we were afraid of them to write a critical essay to \"reflect on them\". I told my teacher I was uncomfortable sharing and he kept on insisting he was mandatory. I had a lot of bottled trauma (I still do tbf, but it was really bad back then) and I had the spider diagram with my biggest fears at the time: Rejection, loud noise (Especially yelling), violence, the dark and cramped spaces (Also trauma related) and so on and explained why I was scared of those things, but very vaguely. And me being vague and having very disorganised thinking/speech (I also have learning difficulties tho I didn't know at the time) the descriptions were very confusing to read.\n\nI presented it and afterwards my teacher put me to the side and told me off for \"Not taking this seriously\" and that I should write \"normal person\" fears like being afraid of spiders. I felt super upset and ended up just doing that, even worse, the essay was themed around the topic of \"We're exaggerating our fears and we should stop overreacting\", I just made up the whole thing.\n\nI really wish I did back then what you did with yours. It takes a lot of guts to do that\n\nBut honestly, these exercises asking invasive questions should stop. In one about \"step forward if this fact applies to you\" last year at uni they were asking questions about if our parents were divorced on you and also one about siblings and for \"Step forward if you have x amount\" I did a hesitating half step and everyone laughed in a having fun way about it because they assumed I couldn't count how many siblings I had, one of the tutors even cracked a joke about it.

I talked to the teacher privately to find a work around project but she refused. So I decided to plagiarize work of a person with the same last name (Actual relative) so I wouldn't have to disclose details of the other side of my family that I didn't want to open up about.  \n\n\nGot 0% on that one but I was so furious that a person in a position of power over a child would not listen to reason.

Apparently, the ambulance company (while owned by the in-network hospital) was out of network, so the bill was on me. Wanting to avoid this situation in the future, I called my health insurance company to ask what ambulance companies WERE in network. That's when I learned that absolutely no ambulances for a 150-mile radius are in network, except for three helicopter ambulance companies. So I live in a fairly rural area, where many folks are hours away from the nearest hospital, and farm accidents are common, so it makes sense that we have helicopter ambulances. But I live in town, and a ground ambulance is by far the cheapest and easiest thing for everyone. But it's not in network. The insurance representative said that the reason the ambulance wasn't covered was to encourage members to use in-network services. So I said, \"The in-network option is a helicopter, and I live 3 miles by road from the hospital. Are you sure you want me to use the in-network option?\" There was a long pause, and she said she had to check with her supervisor. A week later, I got letter from my insurance company saying that my bill was paid in full. Looks like they did not want that in-network option after all.",

So our separation was quite tumultuous (she still hasn\u2019t apologized for the act of cheating and still denies it even though I know beyond any reasonable doubt that she did). I was incredibly hurt at the time and I\u2019ll admit I wasn\u2019t acting my best. But I still tried to treat her fairly. \n\n\nWhen she left we agreed that she would take over the payment on our car because she needed it for work. Our other car was totally paid off and I couldn\u2019t afford the payment on the one that she drove. But I agreed to leave my name on the loan because her credit didn\u2019t qualify (tbh I didn\u2019t really have an alternative). I told her that she could keep it for as long as she made the payments. And that off she paid it off I would immediately sign her over the title. But if she started flaking on the payments I would have the car voluntarily repossessed. I also agreed to give her the washer and dryer on the condition that she take over the car payments. I had purchased the washer and dryer but had no use for them because I lived in an apartment at the time THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR LATER.\n\nWell, we inevitably got into a disagreement over the parenting of our children (I can\u2019t remember exactly what it was about tbh). And she randomly showed up with the car. Handed me the keys, and said \u201chave fun figuring out how to make the payments\u201d (she knew I couldn\u2019t afford them). And then ended with a \u201cand get all your s*** out of MY storage unit\u201d (we hadn\u2019t finished untangling the mess of items in our jointly owned storage unit, but she wanted it done immediately because she was mad). \n\nSo I did what she asked. I went over that day to get my s*** out of OUR storage unit. While I was in there I saw the washer and dryer sitting in the corner and immediately remembered that I had only given them to her on the condition that she pay off the car. So I took them. I had absolutely 0 need for them at the time. But she had very specifically wanted MY S*** out of her storage unit. So who was I to argue?\n\nShe called me a day later screaming about it telling me that she had filed a police report. I just laughed knowing they wouldn\u2019t do anything because it was my property. \n\nTHE STORY GETS BETTER: as it turns out she was just angry and actually wanted the car back. Well the day after she had dropped it off on me I got into a freak accident and totaled it (everyone was okay). So she ended up without a car and I never had to make a single payment on it. The universe wanted to maliciously comply with her demands.",

When I was in 6th grade my pump was wired, ie it had a tube that went from the pump, which looked a bit like a cell phone, to me. So, I have to take insulin after I eat and I had pretty explicitly told all of my teachers that I was diabetic, but this teacher was a bit thick and a stickler for the rules.  \n\nMy class had just gotten back to class after lunch and we were reading a book out loud. My pump beeped to remind me to take insulin after lunch, and I noticed Teacher give me a bit of a dirty look, but I ignored it and whipped out my pump to deliver insulin. \n\nTeacher: /u/ludwig19 stop texting in class! You know the rules. Please bring your \"phone\" to the front and report to detention (my middle school had a very strict no cell phones policy).\n\nI was about to protest, but realized this would be an excellent opportunity for some MC. \n\nSo, with a smug grin on my face, I walk up to the teacher with my pump in my hand, and it still LITERALLY attached to me, I hand her my pump. \n\nTeacher: what's this cord? Why do you have a chain for your cell phone. \n\nMe (deadpan stare): I'm a diabetic, and this is my insulin pump. \n\nAt this point, her face goes sheet white, and I unclip my pump from my body (a bit of a maneuver because it was on my arm and slightly difficult to reach) and walk out of the class before she can say anything and go directly to detention.  When I arrive I tell the detention officer I was sent for using electronics in class. Before I even finish, a student from my class walks in and says I can come back to class, and the teacher apologies profusely and never messes with me for beeping or using any device. ",

She suddenly started yelling about how the person sitting in front of her needed to stop listening to music, now I was sitting in front of her but wasn\u2019t listening to music so I sort of looked around for a second and went back to resting my head on my hand trying to remain conscious. Eventually she stopped complaining and went quiet again. According to my classmates she\u2019d been yelling at me (I\u2019m oblivious, genuinely couldn\u2019t tell that) and my best guess is she thought I had an MP3 player or something and was hiding the earbud in my hand. She could\u2019ve thought the tubing was the wire or something I guess, but I had literally just gotten the pump like a week prior so all my teachers had been sent alerts about it, meaning she didn\u2019t read mine and if I had passed out or something in her class she wouldn\u2019t have known what to do.

It was a pretty crazy process but sometime during the process I had to measure my blood sugar with a glucometer that could also be easily mistaken for a cellphone. Mind there was a strict no cellphone policy..\nWhen I was done measuring my blood sugar I held the glucometer in my hand. Some time passes and a presumably very high ranking officer (was dressed completely differently than all other personnel and looked kinda fancy) comes out of his room, sees me holding my glucometer, goes up to me and says in a dead voice \"how much do you value your cellphone?\" as if he was going to destroy it on the spot. Being the little shit I am I replied, in the smuggest way:\" That ain't a cellphone, I'm a diabetic and need this device to survive\". That's when his face turned red and he simply just said \"Oh!\", turned around 180 and went back into his office. The remaining 3 hours I was there I never saw him leaving his office again :D \n\nToday I use a sensor thats actually connected to my phone via bluetooth.

            "Really highlighting the malicious part of MC. They made a mistake, and you don't bother to attempt to explain. Instead you make a big display of it, immediately heading to detention without being told to as if to imply they had sent you there. Martyring yourself, you poor baby.\n\nThey made an honest mistake and instead of informing them you behaved dramatically. Which is understandable, a kid dealing with a condition, we can forgive some amount of shitty behavior. But that's what this is, shitty behavior. You manipulated them into feeling bad about a mistake.

        "selftext": " **UPDATE:** The original post is below. Only this \"update\" paragraph is new.  There have been no negative consequences from the below, and no consequences (other than a few people DM'ing me with incorrect guesses). In fact, the remaining family members have reached out a time or two about some consulting work.  They have no clue. \n\n**DISCLAIMER:**\n\nThe names and some of the situations have been changed to protect the identities, but the dollars and general nature of the situation is completely true.\n\n**BACKGROUND:**\n\nA year out of school in the early-1990's, I procured a job as a business analyst for a large, family-owned tech company. This business was located in the booming heart of technology at the time and was very profitable. As tech took off over the next decade, the company thrived and remained family-owned. What was a rich family and company became exceedingly wealthy with a valuation/net worth in the high 9/low 10-figures.\n\nThe family that owned it was quite neurotic, very moody and had a reputation as very ruthless (greedy) when it came to financing, deal-making, employees, etc. I truly believe this is what held them back from ultimately becoming a household name as a company.\n\nAs I progressed in the company, I gained more and more face time with the owners. I worked on some projects directly with ownership that really paid off and gained me even greater access to their inner circle. Now, like a lot of people at the time and particularly those who worked in tech, I was heavily invested in tech stocks. I discussed some of my investments and gains with ownership as casual conversation, though investing had nothing to do with my role in the company.\n\nThat is until one day in late-1999 when the owner came to me and asked me if I would invest some of his personal money. He wanted me to take big risks to see if they would pay off using 1 million dollars of his personal money. I was a bit hesitant, but still being in my late-20's and wanting to prove myself, I said I would. I asked for a written agreement where they acknowledged this wasn't my role in the company, was a personal matter between the owner and me, and to document my compensation for this side arrangement (20% of all profits).\n\nAround this same time and by working in the industry I started to notice the weakness associated with a lot of tech companies. They just weren't living up to their hype and stock price and some seemed like they were starting to run out of money. I had no inside information, just a strong sense of which companies were struggling based on my work in the business.\n\nBased on this sense I started using both my money and the owners money to short tech companies just after the New Year in 2000. For anyone unfamiliar with shorting, it means if the value of a stock decreases, the value of the investment increases. I had a few long positions, but my overall position was very short.\n\nSince the owner wanted big risk and big reward, I used his money and obtained leverage or margin from the financial institution where I maintained both his and my trading accounts. The accounts were separate, but both under my name (again, I documented this and gained consent).\n\nWell, both my account and his suffered some moderate losses in the first two months of 2000 before the bubble began to burst and both accounts, but his in particular, began to skyrocket.\n\n**OWNERSHIP'S PETTINESS**\n\nIn June, the company began to suffer a downturn. We were still profitable, but since we provided tech services and products we were not immune to weakness in the broader market. I had not informed the owner of my short strategy. He came to me one day and asked how his money was doing, saying he suspected it was way down like the general market. To his surprise, I informed him that while we still had some money tied up in options (puts) and shorts, but based on the positions I had closed, there was $1.35 million in cash sitting in the account that belonged to him. Again, I still had a bunch of open positions which, if memory serves, were worth about a million on that date, but the positions I had closed had yielded $1.35 million in cash just sitting in his account (which was in my name).\n\nThe owner, either through ignorance or lack of attention, said \"Great, $1.35 million. Fantastic work in this down market. Will you please wire it to me?\" I responded that I would, but would be taking my 20% of the $350,000 profit, or $70,000, before wiring him the $280,000. I also reminded him I still had open positions that had yet to pay off or close, but I didn't state the amount. He, once again, appeared not to understand or comprehend the open positions statement, but instead totally focused on and became incensed about my rightful claim for $70,000. He went on and on about how times were tough, I should be grateful for a job, particularly at my young age, and the entire $350,000 was necessary for him and the company. I knew this wasn't true based on my position within the company. Worse, this was my first time personally experiencing the greedy and corrupt nature that served as the basis for ownership's reputation.\n\n**THE REVENGE**\n\nNow comes the revenge. Since, after two separate conversations, the owner didn't seem to grasp that the open positions would yield at least some income, and thus additional profit, I decided not to mention it again. I sent him back the entire $1.35 million and continued to manage the open positions to the best of my ability. And here's the kicker, the owner never brought it up again. He seemed to think the $1.35 million payment was the entire value of the account and never understood or remembered that open positions still existed. He never asked for records, tax documents or any time of audit or financials. Given the fact that he was dishonest with me, I didn't feel the need to disabuse him of that notion.\n\nUltimately, after a bit more net gain, I covered all of the shorts and exercised all of the options (puts in this case) for an additional $1.8 million. I worked for the company for 3 more years and owner never asked about it during my tenure, after I gave notice, or since. I know it's a bit crass and even shady af, but given his dishonesty with me over the $70,000, I felt justified in keeping the additional $1.8 million. I paid taxes on the gain (long term cap gain), and went on my way with a fantastic nest egg. Nobody has asked about it since and I have only told the story to a few people (and even then only after the statute of limitations passed).\n\nThe final ironic cherry on top of this sundae is that during my remaining 3 years I gained greater influence with ownership in position within the company because they considered me loyal for giving the $1.35 million back and not making too much of a stink about the $70,000 profit. Little did they know I got the better of them. The company eventually folded due to family disputes, but my understanding is that ownership walked away in very good financial position. They likely could have been a much better and greater company had they not practiced the same dishonesty that they showed me with their vendors, clients and employees.\n\nThanks for reading and hope you enjoyed.",

            "Morally I don't see an issue with this one. Could view it as a mutually dissolving the agreement based on delivering all closed positions, and giving them back the agreed upon commission.\n\nThe party who the funds belonged to was notified of the open options and chose not to pursue them. Once the commission was returned despite being legally owed, it's no longer OP's job to notify the other party.\n\nNow assuming the other party never mentions the open options, never asks about the account, there's no moral obligation to remind them of this. If the other party asks and the OP lies? Then I'd agree it's morally wrong. However the OP wasn't asked, told no lies, paid all the proper taxes. Eventually the funds are theirs with no legal recourse. That's on the other party for not asking.\n\n---\n\nLegally?

            "I used to work at a glorified snack bar, which is a snack bar with a deep fryer and a grill. At the place I worked, Fridays were insanely slow; we usually served 250 an hour Monday-Thursday but on Fridays we served 50 *all day*. Just me and the manager on duty. Him in the back doing manager stuff, me out front helping the occasional customer.\n\nOn Fridays, a particular lady would come through, and she was always super picky about her food. What's in this, how long does it take, wheres it come from, how much is it, can I get it for less than that, etc. It usually didn't bother me because it was so slow on Fridays, I'd just humor her and give her food and she'd be on her way. She was never particularly rude, just 20 questions about the food. She rarely complained about the food once she got it.\n\nOne day she came in, and she asked for fresh fries. \"No problem, let me go drop some for you.\" She asked me if I was absolutely sure she was getting fresh fries. Usually she wasnt *this* picky. We'd been doing this circus act every Friday for a couple years at that point. *She knew she'd be getting fresh fries*. But, to humor her, I open a new big bag of fries, and put an order's worth into the fryer right in front of her. The fryer is easily visible from where customers wait at the counter - more visible than your local Five Guys, for instance.\n\nA few minutes goes by and I walk over to the fryer. I grab a tub for the fries and pull the fries up. She watches me do this from the counter where customers wait, and as the fries are still sizzling as they make contact with air, she asks\n\n\"Are those fries fresh?!\"\n\nI'm flabbergasted. I'm never even snippy with customers ever. But, I do this Seinfeld head jerky thing and I'm like \"are you freaking serious-you literally watched me pull them out of the grease!'\n\nShe throws her hands up and goes \"Okay, okay, I was just being sure.\" Gave her her fries, she paid, and that was the end of it.\n\nYour story made that memory pop up in my head. Not MC but, just a funny similar story.",

            "I worked as a line cook for many years.  Last place I worked at was a family owned place where everything was cooked and prepared to order.  It was the kind of place that would honor any food request as long as we had the ingredients to make it.  \n\nPeople would ask for the most ridiculous shit.  When someone requested something we knew was going to be horrible, we would have the server go confirm the order and if the customer confirmed it, the server would tell them, \"The kitchen staff says they can make it, but they advise against it, because it will not be good.\"  If the customer insists, they were then told, \"Ok, we'll make it for you, but if you don't like it, we will not be removing it from your bill.\"  \n\nIt was fun when they didn't like what they insisted we make them. ",
            "I have the same story with chicken fingers and I did not comply.  I get the order and they are immediately in the deep fryer.  Nothing to do but wait 6-7 min.\n\nThen I get notified that the customer wants them fast.  Good thing they are cooking already.   I pour some frozen fries into a fryer basket to wait.  Fries take 2-3 min, so I grab a drink. \n\nCustomer sees me grabbing a drink and \"asks\" \"WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE??? YOU SHOULD BE IN THE KITCHEN MAKING MY FOOD!!! **I'M IN A RUSH!!!**\"\n\nI inform them what I just told you.\n\nThey go and peek through the window at the fryer. \"THEY LOOK DONE! GO AND GET THEM!!!\"\n\nI inform them that there is no way they are done yet; they are probably still frozen in the center, let alone cooked.  They will float when they are cooked.  I go into the kitchen and drop the fries into the fryer. \n\nThey are frantically leaning on the counter and jumping like a gorilla. Yelling \"THEY ARE FLOATING!!! GIVE ME MY FOOD!!! I HAVE TO GO!!!\"\n\nI look into the fryer and see that they are not floating.   I shake the fryer baskets.  No floating. I mention it to the customer, but they can't hear me.  I don't want to shout, so I walk back out front.  This lying asshole is really pissing me off by now.  I get that he is in a rush, but shouting and his tone is just rude, but him lying that he can see his chicken fingers floating makes my teenage minimum wage smartass a little malicious.   He's still yelling from where he was looking into the kitchen. I'm 20 feet away.\n\nHe's ranting, shouting, and still jumping and flailing around comically. Not only do I not want to shout like him, but I decided to do the opposite.   I spoke slowly, deadpan, and very very quietly.   I maintained eye contact and he could see my lips moving,  but he just couldn't hear me saying I can't send out raw chicken over his shouting and 20 feet.  After several \"WHAT?\"s, he lowers his voice to try to hear me.\n\nNo good, I'm still too quiet and too far away.  I repeat myself as necessary, but he can't hear me.  He's getting really pissed off; his face is red and I swear I can see blood vessels popping out of his head and neck.  He is torn between watching his food cook while yelling or quietly come to hear what I'm saying.   Eventually he relents and comes closer to me, a little at a time.   I think he knows what I'm doing, but he also clearly thinks I'm incompetent.   I continue,  getting even quieter each time he gets closer until he is leaning over the counter and I'm almost whispering, still leaning against the wall so he can't get very close.  He's awkwardly leaning over the counter and I finally speak loud enough for him to hear me.  \"I can't send out raw chicken.\"  No emotion.\n\nI walk back into the kitchen and watch him pace and huff and puff through the window.  When his fingers are ready, I wait 15 extra seconds, smiling at him like that daft punk album cover as I deliberately waste his time.  I serve up the food into the window and wave at him cheerfully, encouraging him to get his food quickly because he doesn't want to be late.  He can't take his food yet because the front staff need to pass it to him.\n\nHe fucking loses it.  Shouting at me, shouting at the front staff to pass him his food (the front staff are helping another customer), flailing around, pacing and jumping more than before.  I started to wonder if I pushed him too far.  Would he resort to assault or vandalism? The front staff give him his food and I watch closely in case he snaps.  He grabs his food and shouts a little bit I couldn't hear.  He wants to berate us more than he wants to be on time.  I tell him to hurry so he won't be late as sweet and over-the-top cheerfully as I can.  He storms off.\n\nThe next few customers asked what his problem was. The customer after him explained to them.  They laughed loudly and he looked over his shoulder as he walked away.\n\nBeing in a rush is fine; I'll help as best as  I can.  I could send out a cold sandwich and salad/soup in less than a minute if asked nicely.  I can't change the laws of thermodynamics though.  Acting like an asshole can result in getting treated like an asshole. \n\n",

        "selftext": "A few years ago I took a customer service job and my boss, Shirley, was the laziest, snarkiest person I've ever worked around.  She spent her day on social media and personal calls while her in-box grew. Shirley's boss rarely came around and was happy as long as Shirley didn't bring any problems to her, so of course, Shirley didn't; she buried any problems.\n\nAfter I'd been there a couple weeks, Shirley was showing us some new procedure.  I don't even remember what it was, but it was something I'd done in a previous position and there was a much easier way of doing it.  I asked if I could make a suggestion.  Shirley instantly shot it down.  \"No. I don't want suggestions or help unless I specifically ask for them. Just do what I tell you to do.\"  It was embarrassing and demeaning to say the least.\n\nWhen Shirley went to lunch, the gal who had been training me asked me what I was going to suggest and I showed her.  She agreed it was much more efficient and she showed the others.  She told me they just worked around Shirley. They all disliked her and just waited until she was away to discuss problems and came up with solutions and left Shirley out of it.\n\nA year later, the lady who trained me retired.  Before she left, she showed me how to run phone statistic reports...they showed how many calls each rep took, how long the calls lasted, how many rings before each call was answered; typical call center stuff.  She asked me to take over putting together a report including email statistics each month to send to the ecommerce manager.  Shirley was to give me the email statistics.\n\nAfter the first month, I emailed Shirley asking for the email stats.  She ignored it.  After the second month, same thing.  I decided if it wasn't important to her, then I just wouldn't do it.  I figured if questioned, I would show the emails I sent Shirley reminding her so my butt would be covered.  Nothing ever came of it.\n\nSo things went for the next couple of years. Then came the announcement that Shirley's boss had been fired and while they searched for a replacement, Shirley would be reporting to the president of the company. She was terrified. He had her jumping through hoops. He had her submitting reports to him, attending meetings, answering questions.  She returned from one meeting frantic. She told the senior rep Angela that he wanted her to bring him phone statistics that afternoon and she had no idea where to get them.  Hmmm... I knew.  Angela knew I knew.  While Shirley sat at her desk trying to figure what to do, Angela came to me and said, \"You aren't going to tell her, right?\" I said, \"Well, she once told me she didn't want my help unless she specifically asked for it, right?  Well, she hasn't specifically asked me.\"  We grinned at each other.\n\nShirley went to her meeting empty handed.  She ended up getting fired a week or so later.  I don't think it was because she didn't have the phone statistics, but that was probably one of many things that made it apparent that she didn't know what she was doing.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your comments and awards.

Then she accidentally swiped to a photo of her BF\u2019s erect penis.\n\nManager was like \u201coops\u201d and \u201cRita\u201d ran to HR and told them what happened. She asked to have a representative of HR at all future meetings with this manager OR for her to be re-assigned back to the good manager.\n\nThe useless manager was given two strikes, had to attend a sensitivity class, and had my friend \u201cRita\u201d removed from being under her.\n\n\u201cRita\u201d went back to her good manager.\n\nUseless manager got downsized shortly thereafter.\n\nEdit: gave \u201cR\u201d a name",

        "selftext": "I used to work for a big, global company at one of their many big sites as an operations manager. Loved the job, hated the company.\n\nI hadn\u2019t gone by my legal name in about 12 years at this point. Everyone knew me by another name; I used it everywhere, all my clients used it, and my name badge even used this name as there was a section for \u201cpreferred name\u201d when I started right there on my application. I had zero problems up until the new HR manager arrived.\n\nShe was a nasty cow and especially disliked me. At around eight months working there, I still hadn\u2019t received any business cards and had put in many requests for them over the time. I think maybe the new HR thought she was going to pull one on over me as she did indeed get my business cards printed and delivered all 300 to me...all written with my legal name.\n\nI questioned this and was told it was \u201ccompany policy\u201d and that I would need to write my preferred name on each card if I wanted to keep using it. Even though there were several other managers who also didn\u2019t use their legal names and yet had their business cards printed as they wished, I was singled out. She was so d*mn smug about it. And at this point, \u201cmalicious compliance\u201d is really my MO.\n\nI had never worried about changing my name legally as it had honestly never really been an issue. People will generally call you whatever you introduce yourself as. But, well, opportunity came knocking at my door, didn\u2019t it?\n\nI spent $160 and a full day at the courts changing my name legally and hell, while I\u2019m there, I\u2019ll just change my last name, too! I was never attached to it and this one is much better. I also went and applied for a new driver\u2019s license and spent the rest of the afternoon faxing my new documents off to the many places that would need them. It WAS a lot of work and it did end up costing me about $200 all up, but walking into work the next day was the most satisfying day of my time there.\n\nI was able to hand over my official Change of Name certificate and I personally handed the HR manager back all 300 brand new, completely unused business cards with my now-previous name. And to top it off she had to update all my files and my contract, send everything to Head Office to be completed, and then had to come crawling back to my office for me to sign each one with my NEW name. It probably explained the vindictiveness she displayed later but I ended up quitting not long after.\n\nI doubt Head Office would have liked having to fork out for another set of business cards, either. And sure, I had to spend a bit of time and money doing it, but it was something I should have done a long time ago, anyway. I just got a little shove in the right direction and the payout was so satisfying.",

During this time the causalities coming in from Iraq/Afghanistan were pretty constant and shortly prior to this interaction I got briefed on what it meant if I saw the \"deceased\" card. I got the feeling we had several customers who died in Iraq and the policy was put in place as AAFES likely didn't want the bad PR on trying to collect debt from widows. Which, I mean is a good idea.\n\nIt meant the card was closed, all debt was written off, and all automatic payments were canceled.\n\nWell if you've ever worked or dealt with AAFES you understand they are incredibly incompetent. \n\nWell one day I'm working and a woman comes up to me and says \"I'm Mrs. Jackson I would like to make a payment on my star card\" I said \"That's fine, can I see your ID or star card?\" she gave me her star card and I asked \"And how much will you be paying today?\" to which she said \"$1,500\" \n\nI opened her account, and in big bright red letters her account status was \"DECEASED\" her balances were zerod out confused I ask her how much she owed on the account. She said approx $4,000. \n\nThinking maybe I opened the wrong account I asked if she had her star card so I could enter the exact account number. She gave me her starcard.\n\nSame status, she's dead, she's owes us no more money.\n\nAnd I said \"Miss Jackson I have good news and bad news\" to which she gave me a frustrated look and said \"Whats the bad news\" I said \"Apparently your dead\" she laughs and says \"I feel very much alive\" I nod my head and go \"I agree, you do appear to be alive\"\n\nSo she goes \"So whats the good news?'\n\nI smile and say \"You don't owe us anymore money\" she goes \"what?\" I go \"Per our policy if a customer dies we close their account, and write off their debt\" concerned she goes \"Well is this going get sent to collections?\" I ask \"Were you past due?\" she goes \"no I wasn't\" I go \"let me call my manager\" so I call my manager and I ask my manager \"If a customer is declared deceased, do we send their debt to a collection agency\" he goes \"No, its written off\" so I relay that information.\n\nShe starts to smile, and then she goes \"So can I use my star card?\" I go \"No, its been closed but if you want to open another account you can\"\n\nSo we opened another account (yes it worked and she was approved)\n\nI dealt with Mrs. Jackson several times over the next year as she liked to come in person to make the payment. I nicknamed her Zombie a nickname which she embraced. When she would approach me I would go \"Ah the Zombie is back\" and she would smile and joke \"Be nice or I'll eat you\" we kept it as an inside joke my co-workers were always confused.\n\n**Edit**\n\nThe Malicious Compliance is I allowed the system to say she was dead, and did not attempt to correct it.",

Had to tell them there is an issue with their account that is out of our scope and that they need to contact their manager. At one point entire departments were moved offshore so there were so many cases like this that people figured out what it meant when we said that and instead started packing up their desk waiting for HR to get to them.",

I also had a balance of about $200 on the credit side.\n\nGet back from school and found that I had lost my check cashing privileges and was facing UCMJ actions for not paying my bills.\n\nThey added the uniforms to the credit side, didn't give me credit for the payments I made, and quickly reported my non-payment to my chain-of-command.\n\nIt took me three months to fix everything.\n\nPart of the \"fix\" resulted in my having a balance of -$5.00 (basically five dollard credit on the card).\n\nBy this time I had swore off using AAFES for any type of credit, but kept the balance for the next 10 years.\n\nEvery time they would \"clear\" the balance (usually by sending me a check for $5.00). I would destroy the check, make a card purchase, then immediately pay off the balance =$5.\n\nThis led to events like:\n\nBeing called into the Commander's Office for non-payment of bills.  Cleared this by asking, \"How do I wrote a check for -$5?\n\nTwo Security Clearance updates where I had to provide a written explanation as to why -$5 could not be an unpaid bill [I had to get a letter from both my Commander and JAG on that one].\n\nHaving my account \"accidently\" closed, twice.

I am warned that since there is not enough funds to cover the amount I will be charged an overdrawn fee of $5. The date of the supposed transaction was after I closed the account so did not think anything of it. About 5 years later I am talking with my dad on th the phone and he randomly mentions that he has a stack of envelopes from the Navy Credit Union that have been sent arriving every 3 months since I got out of the navy. He wants to know what I want done with them. I get him to send them to me. There were close to 20 statements. It appears that the bank kept applying that same overdrawn fee to my account and accruing a progressively larger debt. By that point the $5 fee was now $25 each time. I don\u2019t remember the exact amount but it was somewhere between $500 and $600.\nI tried to contact the bank to sort it out but was told that I would need to talk to the bank where my account was held (Yokuska Japan). In the end I finally was able to contact someone to sort it out. I never found out how I was able to accrue such a large debt on an account that had been closed before the fee was applied."

In those days, in my country, we didn't have a withholding tax system, but you would pay in year, say 2007, the taxes on your income of year 2006.\n\nOf course the form would come by mail pre-filled, with name and details, and also some quite accurate amounts, because the state knows already pretty well how much you make. \n\nMy family name is a bit complex, being multipart and with unusual letter clusters in the middle. Mistakes are understandable, but you would expect the Revenue Service to be exact on that matter. Unfortunately, they weren't. They kept misspelling it every year on the form, and on all the subsequent forms (tax statement, tax returns etc) they would mail me, despite my correcting it manually every year on my income statement. In black. Then in red. Then the following year with neon red Sharpies. Then one year later adding a sticky note. Then adding a whole letter. Then adding a letter and copies of my ID as proof. Etc. But they weren't budging.\n\nIt was quite irritating, because the tax statement has to be shown on several occasions when you interact with the State administration or justice. Everybody would notice the discrepancy. Everyone was understanding that it was obviously a mistake from the Revenue Service, but it was still annoying on so many levels, the most basic of which being a matter of respect for my identity.\n\nAfter ten or twelve years of them not taking notice of my notes and corrections, upon receiving a payment notice still misspelled, I went in person to my local Revenue Service office and asked to speak with someone about that issue. I made it very clear to the clerk that they were wrong. He was adamant that they were correct (like I wouldn't know my own name...) and added, for good measure, that he couldn't change my name in their systems because he didn't have access to that blah blah. I was having none of it, so: cue malicious compliance.\n\nMe: So, you said you were positively, absolutely right, about my name's spelling?\n\nClerk: ....\n\nMe: I shall therefore stop paying my taxes. I am not the person on your forms. And there's no way you can come to me asking for that tax money, since the person on your forms doesn't live at that address, and in fact does not exist.\n\nClerk: *mouth is gaping, eyes are so wide open they're going to pop out*\n\nMe: But in case you need that tax money, you know how to write my actual name.\n\nAnd I left with a smirk.\n\nI actually did not pay that tax installment (in those days, you paid your taxes in three installments over the year). 2 weeks later, I got a reminder letter, without the 10% penalty normally owed for late payment, and with my name correctly spelled. Shouldn't have wasted so many Sharpies over the years.\n\n(Edit: added the mention about the payment notice for clarity.)",

            "It's super effective when you threaten to withhold payment how people decide to react. \n\nMany years ago my grandfather passed away.

Except, of course, for the power company.  Every month, along would come a new bill with my grandfather's name on it, and give another jolt/reminder.

My MIDDLE name. You know, the one that was on all THREE documents I had to send in. The one that was fairly easy to say and spell? That one. To get it fixed I have to send, you guessed it, ALL my documents back. Why? You didn't read them the first time\n\nSo what I'm trying to say OP is, welcome to beauracratic hell. You sound like you might make it.",

            "I have a double-barrelled surname which is hyphenated. The name themselves are both very common, but the concept of a double-barrelled surname seems to be lost on so many people. Dropping the hyphen, dropping one part of the surname, entirely different names replacing the entire name, you name it (seemingly what they do), it's probably happened. \n\nMost things I can just ignore, mistakes happen, whatever, move on. But with my name I find it infuriating that people seem to be lackadaisical with what I feel is one of the most basic things.

In many settings, where people get called by their last names for politeness sake, she is the only one who gets called by her first name.\n\nAlso, for years, different IDs had different spellings because it was translated from a language with a different alphabet.

Unless you don\u2019t use the company car for private travel. Now my job switched offices and I had to travel over 400Ks a day to get there and back, so the company gave me a car for this. And after some hassle I got a letter from the tax office, stating that I don\u2019t have to pay the company car taxes and I should contact them if I should get a disadvantage because of it. So, 2 years later when I moved and got a company car I did use privately, I saw no need to knform the tax office. So until I switched jobs, I had a company car more or less for free. Saved me a lot of money."
