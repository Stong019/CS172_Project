        "selftext": "This didn't happen to me, but to my dad, and it's one of my favourite stories he tells.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome years ago (by which I mean two or so decades, roughly) my dad was at a several-day course to earn some additional qualifications for his job. On the final day, there was going to be a multiple choice test to actually pass the seminar. On test day, everyone got settled into place, and the teacher announced that he would not go easy on cheaters: You had one strike to be caught trying to copy off of someone else or use a cheat sheet, but if you were caught a second time, you would be immediately thrown out and your score made invalid. Now, this teacher was very old-school strict, and treating grown working people like unruly schoolchildren, and my dad does not like that very much.\n\nSo my dad proceeds to take the test, and it goes pretty well! When he's through with the questions, there is just one left where he's not sure he's got it right.\n\nAnd he has a free strike, after all.\n\nSo my dad... yells out into the class. Just calls out, \"what's the answer to question 14?\". Some complete bro elsewhere in the room yells the answer back. My dad fills in the sheet, gets up, walks to the teacher's desk, presumably tries to not trip on the teacher's jaw as it lies on the floor, hands in his test, and leaves the room.\n\nTo the teacher's credit, he approached my dad afterwards with some... begrudging respect. I don't know if he changed his policy afterwards, or the tone in which he conveyed it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Holy crap this blew up!! I'm glad my dad's shenanigans brought a smile to so many people <3 And thank you for the silver, even though I had to google what that means!\n\n&#x200B;",

I get needing to have a basic understanding, but temporary memorization of every last detail isn't really helpful.   \n\n\nAlso, many of my math teachers were fond of the \"no one carries a calculator around in their pocket\" saying.

This particular evening there was some guy complaining and yelling that he was required to pay for his drinks and that I wasnt \"hooking him up\" with a heavy pour and freebies (he hasn't tipped me all night btw). I looked at him and said \"if you cant afford to pay for your drinks, you shouldn't be in a bar\". He did not like that one bit. He got indignant and said I was being a bitch. Now anyone who knows me, knows I will put up with none of that kind of nonsense. I laughed in his face and told him \"Im the bitch who wont be making another drink for you, get the fuck out.\"\n\"I want to see your manager!\"\nI place my index finger on the tippy top of my head, do a quick pirouette, and finish with some serious jazz hannds \"TADAAAAAA!

The amount of times I've seen Sandwich Artists cussed at, chewed out and generally disrespected is alarming and unusual relative to other chains. Typically, it's because the customer is impatient, and/or angry that the SA didn't put an entire fucking turkey on their 6-inch sandwich (for no additional cost, naturally).\n\nHonestly man, we need to thank the Sandwich Artists like we thanked the bus drivers a while ago.

            "I loved being a manager when dealing with shitty customers. I was a manager at Borders when they were going out of business. This particular store was at a pretty high-end mall where the security was an actual police force instead of rent-a-cops, but they were usually bored out of their minds there and loved to be called to deal with assholes because it gave them something to do. Also, once we went into liquidation we were by no means allowed to give refunds for our membership cards. We didn't even have the ability to do so. This pissed off some customers, but there was literally nothing I could do about it. One day my cashier called me up front and it sounded like she was crying. I got up there to find a guy yelling at her and calling her names because she couldn't give him a refund. I jumped in, told him to calm down or I'd have to call security. He said he was glad we were going out of business. I replied with, \"oh, you're glad 11,000 people are losing their jobs? you must be a great person. Now you can stay here and I'll get security involved who will forcefully remove you, or you can leave right now on your own and never come back.\" I'll never forget the look of pure shock as he realized he was being an asshole and that someone in retail would speak to him that way.",

        "selftext": "This might be a rarity for this sub, as I am the one who had the malicious compliance done to by someone else, but I had to respect it and thought it was worthy for this subreddit.\n\nContext:\nI own an escape room company in a town which borders a pretty touristy area and is very close to an airport. As such we tend to get a lot of bookings from people all over the UK who are visiting the area for the weekend or international people coming to do an escape room on the way to the airport.\nWe only take online bookings and don't take walk ins, therefore the site is only really manned whenever we have bookings.\nAs such, our cancellation policy is that we only allow refunds if the cancellation is more than 24 hours before the scheduled start time. If it is 2-24 hours before the start time, we can only reschedule the booking. Now, it's worth mentioning that for the majority of cases (weekdays) we are pretty relaxed with our policy as long as it doesn't cause any big issues and try our best to accommodate a group as usually I am the one hosting them so there's not any additional expenses on our part (i.e. staff wages/loss of income from other potential customers). However the only day where this policy is really relevant is on Saturday where we are almost always entirely booked from morning to night and have staff members working for us. So any cancelled slots would most likely have been filled by other customers, and we are of course still paying our staff for that time. Although I must say, we have only ever had to enforce this policy a couple of times as we are usually accommodate a group in some shape or form.\n\n\nNow onto the MC:\nSo I get a call earlier today from a gentleman with a thick Scottish accent that was scheduled to come in with his group in around 2 and a half hours from the time of the call.\n\nThe group said that they would be unable to make their booking as they were running late with some other activities or something like that, and asked to reschedule the booking for a later slot. I checked our schedule but didn't have any slots left for today in any of our rooms. He then asked for a refund as they would be returning back to Glasgow tonight and didn't know when they would be next down here.\n\nI told him our policy and that our system only allows reschedules instead of refunds due to the time frame and explained that given it's a Saturday we can't refund so close to the time as staff has been arranged, slot would have been booked etc etc. Rescheduling wouldn't have worked for them as they wouldn't be in the area anytime soon.\n\nAfter a short pause, he asked if we had any free slots to schedule for next month. I checked the system and offered to move the booking to the same time on 16th November, to which he said \"yeah I think that works\"\n\nI changed the time on the system and informed him he would get an email confirming the new time slot.\n\nHe replied \"Great, so the booking is more than 24 hours away now right?\"\nMe \"Yes it's booked in for 4 weeks time from today.\"\nHim \"Right so, the booking is more than 24 hours away, I won't be able to make it, can I have a refund?\"\n\nI paused for a second trying to process what had just happened in my head and realised that he had found a loophole in the system!\n\nTECHNICALLY, his booking was more than 24 hours away so he is TECHNICALLY entitled to a refund. I started laughing and congratulated him on beating the system as I processed his refund.\n\nEdit:lol I didn't think this would get this much attention but might aswell clarify a few things which came up in the comments. \n\n1) as I said these situations are so rare that it's never really come up often enough to become a big issue as most groups are fine just to reschedule to another day and we like to accommodate for groups as best we can. Perhaps if it does become more common we will look into it but in the past ~2 years we've been open, I can probably count on one hand how many times it's happened.\n\n2) this is a common malicious compliance usually done with hotels, doctors etc. Which is why I recognised it as malicious compliance straight away and thought it would fit here.\n\n3) obviously what I've posted is just the bare bones of the conversation. There was a bit of bantering back and forth which is why I didn't mind as much issuing the refund as he seemed like a nice guy. Guess it goes to show, if you're a nice person, you might be more likely to get the rules bent for you than if you're a complete Karen. Plus chances are, next time he's this way, he'll make another booking down the line because of this interaction. This is why I didn't think he was being cheeky by cancelling straight after rescheduling. \n\n4) yeah people do come to do an escape room on their way to the airport. Suppose it's a way of squeezing in a bit more entertainment into your holiday lool",

I tell the kids I ought to charge them for the labor (I said I'd help bake) and ingredients so they learn the concept of net gains, but instead I'll donate to their cause, and just to bring me back the money I lent them to make change. I love seeing the kids be entrepreneurial, work so hard, and get so excited at their success.\n\nAfter a couple of hours, the neighbor's son decides he's bored and wants to go home, so he tells my kid, \"when you're done, come by and deliver half the money.\" Mine says, \"hey, that's not fair, if you're leaving we should split the money now.\" Mind you, the bulk of their sales was my baking.\n\nNeighbor kid gets super pissed, but mine sticks to their guns, they split the money and the kid leaves in a huff. Mine comes in a few hours later, having lugged home all the gear and cleaned up, annoyed that the neighbor kid got annoyed at them. Then I get a knock on the door. It's the neighbor's mom, with the kid, who is still pouting. Mom's holding a receipt.\n\nMom explains that they purchased a bunch of stuff for the bake sale, it cost a lot of money, and it's not fair that my kid is making money off their stuff, and that they should be compensated for what they purchased.\n\nThe receipt lists a bunch of items I immediately see they didn't use (like 2 boxes of cereal, when they used 1, napkins that I'd ended up providing), but whatever. And nevermind that her son went home early and left mine to clean up. And nevermind that I'd been churning out batches of cookies all morning. I'm irked they've taken what was a fun, cheerful day of kids making money hand over fist, and shown up at my door making me engage in a super awkward conversation because they assume their kid can't be wrong. So I say, \"of course!\" and fetch my receipts.\n\nI sit down and (in front of them, and out loud) calculate the cost of lemonade, and cups used. I calculate the cost of flour, sugar, chocolate chips, vanilla and butter per batch of cookies, multiplied by the number of batches made. I toss in the baking soda for free (so generous). I even subtract the value of leftover cookies.\n\nDid I mention I made a lot of cookies? The neighbor kid has to fork over $23. They got pretty quiet all of a sudden.

Periodically I would have one of my neighbors or friends watch it while I rode my bike up to the store to get more lemons and sugar. On my second day when I was at the store I saw that watermelons were on sale so I bought a watermelon. I started selling watermelon slices. They became my biggest seller. at one point on my return trip from the store there were five UPS trucks parked waiting to buy watermelon slices.

I'm getting flashbacks to my childhood and when I was a teacher(those parents are the same and worse with their kids teachers; I observed this as a school student somewhat because my mom was an educator before retiring 20 years later.) There are other reasons I quit, but parents were a part and quite a large part. Honestly, adults period. I apologize in advance for the epic novel in the next paragraphs.\n\n I have a baby face and always have....I didn't start teaching until my early 30's, partly because of the area I grew up in and its politics(and I wanted to believe it wasn't for the reasons I now know it was for,) and I eventually had to leave the state to get a teaching position, and I had my masters before my early 20's because I needed to go straight through or I wouldn't have gone back for my masters; school has always been a problem because the classes I wasn't good at were all I ever thought about. I look the same now(I'll be 37 in less than a month) as I did when I was.....12. And I'm dead serious. Many parents thought I was the sub or a student.....and I had a name tag that all teachers across the county got. Some of those parents treated me horribly because of it, and it made discipline hard because the parents would bad mouth me at home and I knew this because their kids were just as awful. I always want to see the good in every person and up until I was forced to leave the classroom BECAUSE of non-parenting or just an awful kid despite good parents, I kept this personality trait. I still have it honestly, but.....I just can't believe every person I come across is an awful specimen of humanity, though other teachers tried warning me. I was only afforded 5 years as a teacher before I was physically unable to (two students injured me because they weren't disciplined, though the school was just as bad as the parents and I got blamed for everything, when I was only part of the problem and I even admitted that I was part of the issue, but not for the reasons the school tried telling me. I was just too nice and got taken advantage of all the time. Never had that as even just a sub in the state and area I grew up in.

She basically said tough shit and that I need to show up for class. \n\nSo the class starts and I log on to the meeting and you can very clearly see the central line in my chest, the iv pole with the unit of blood, the monitors that go on my chest (I forgot what they\u2019re called). My teacher looked visibly uncomfortable the entire time and emailed me after class saying I made her uncomfortable and what I did was completely unprofessional. I reminded her that she said I had to have my camera on the whole time.\n\n\nHoly shit this blew up. I wanted to clarify a few things for y\u2019all. The reason I still went to class because I\u2019d already missed a lot of school this year and was starting to fall behind so I didn\u2019t want to miss more school unless it was absolutely necessary. \n\nAlso, I know there weren\u2019t too many comments on it but I wasn\u2019t wearing anything too exposing or anything. It was a low cut shirt that I\u2019d worn to school plenty of times so I assumed it would be fine for zoom.\n\nAnd my parents aren\u2019t on my side for this. They think all children need to respect their elders and the adult in the situation is always right so if I do go forward with reporting her, I\u2019m on my own.",

The uncomfortableness the adult sufferers is the adults fault-they made a decision not on evidence or best practices, but a decision solely to ensure obedience. That discomfort if your compliance is supposed to be used by the adult to rethink how and why they are using their authority to ensure they are using it respectfully and solely to ensure the safety of the child and that child is gaining further experience in how to be a successful adult.\n\nI'm a parent and if you were my kid, I'd tell you you did EXACTLY what you should have done.

            " I'm sorry you had one of your teachers put her discomfort on you- that was inappropriate on her part as you had informed her more than enough about why you didn't want to be on camera. However, unlike some other commenters I don't think this is necessarily a situation that needs to be escalated to the school board, especially if your parents aren't supporting your complaints, which I am also very sorry you don't have the support you need from them. \n\nYour school probably will want to address this situation, and the following advice is all assuming that you attend a public school in the United States, as private schools don't have to follow the same ADA guidelines and other legal requirements to the same level. I'd recommend you start by talking to or emailing the school councilor- they aren't like the HR department in a business, they actually work on behalf of students. If you don't have a school councilor or have had bad experiences with them, email a different teacher or staff member that you trust (especially if they've worked at the school a long time- they'll know who it is they need to talk to to get you the help you need or to censure that history teacher's response).  Include a vice principal or the principal perhaps, and raise your concerns about your privacy and about the history teacher's email, as her actions were the unprofessional ones. You acted responsibly by informing your teachers about a procedure and still trying to attend classes without causing a distraction. Her response was unjustified and a decent member of the administrative staff of your campus will probably want to know about it and have a meeting with her to address her response and its tone.\n\n A school is there for the students, but a lot of school staff are struggling as the policies and infrastructure implementation of online teaching are barely codified and pretty untested, so it's not inconceivable she was trying to follow what she understood to be the required procedures even if your other teachers did otherwise, however her response was very inappropriate. If you are a US student, you're still towards the start of a school year and will have to interact with your history teacher for the rest of the semester; If you really feel like she won't treat you fairly though, you MIGHT be able to transfer to another teacher's section of the same class. But if she's the only one teaching the specific class it'd very hard to get the legally required classroom contact time to earn the history credit if you transfer to another course, so your school probably won't let you do so barring special circumstances or very good proof that you shouldn't be in that particular teacher's class. As such I'd advise you not to burn your bridges with this teacher- that doesn't mean you have to let her actions slide and that you have to accept her actions as the right ones- but don't make her your enemy unnecessarily. \n\nTo be fair, sometimes allowing a student to abstain from a procedure required by every other student (such as webcams being on) can become legally dicey if the student doesn't have the necessary documentation for educational accommodations. \"Special Ed\" doesn't just mean learning disabilities, and it doesn't mean that every kid with learning accommodations is put into special classes. It deals with all sort situations to aid students with different needs- sign language interpreters for deaf students, the elevator key for kids in wheelchairs or on crutches, a private testing room for ADD or dyslexic students, or extra time to turn in assignments because a student just got chemo. Sure some schools will just do this on an unofficial level, especially tiny rural school districts, but technically and legally there's a process for students to receive and be provided those sorts of specific aids. If you don't have accommodations for your health condition already, even if you don't feel they are really needed now, it's a good idea to have some established while in high school to provide documentation for colleges. It's so much easier to just bring paperwork from public high school to any college or university's student accommodations office than to try to get required testing or documentation done independently outside of the K-12 school system (apart from a short term physical disability like \"broken wrist- provide student with copy of notes for the semester\"). A school teacher or councilor can get you started towards getting evaluated on you eligibility for accommodations. Special education departments are also supposed to pay lots of attention to the legal side of stuff, so that'd provide you with more protections from anything like the situation with the history teacher happening in the future.",

        "selftext": "My brother has struggled with a drug addiction for most of his life. About five years ago, it tore his family apart. His wife filed for divorce, and was awarded full custody of their son. This is all right and proper, as brother was in no condition to be a father at this time.\n\nThe road to recovery has been long, but my brother has been working the program and has now been clean for several years. He has no formal custody of his son, though he gets visitation at his ex-wife's discretion. He's been a good and stable father to his son in the last years. However, his ex has not wanted to allow for the possibility that brother has become well. In fact, she has begun jerking him around with visitation, even planning on removing son from his father for a period of several months so she can take a long vacation with her new family.\n\nBrother, not willing to let this slide, immediately filed for joint custody. The court case was just a day ago, and as expected, his ex has badmouthed his former drug abuse and attempted to paint him as still an addict and a threat to their son (again, he totally is not - him being clean for years, employed, and owning his own home now). The ex was so self-deluded and confident that he had backslid, that she loudly demanded, in front of the judge, that my brother provide a letter from the local president of \\[drug counseling program\\] stating that he has attended every meeting for the last several years.\n\nMy brother smiled at the judge, and said, \"Not only is that not a problem, your honor, but I can provide that document today.\" The judge asked how this is possible, did brother already think to bring it with him? \"No, your honor, but, you see, *I am* the president of our local chapter.\"\n\nI wish I could see the look on that hateful bitch's face. It's not official yet, but yeah, he's totally getting joint custody.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I hate adding edits, but it's apparently necessary. Yes, I said \"hateful bitch.\" I understand that this may not seem justified to many of you given the context of this story. A story. A story that is limited in scope, and in no way attempts to capture the whole of reality. I have my own personal reasons for my feelings toward the ex, which are completely outside of the scope of this story, and which I have no intention of sharing here. But I understand why you may be confused reading that.\n\nSince I've now had to repeat myself explaining this dozens of times, even after adding this edit, and since this statement was an OP comment that has absolutely nothing to do with the story itself, I will no longer be acknowledging comments whinging about my choice of words here.\n\nUPDATE: Joint custody has been awarded. Primary placement is with the mother, but his visitation hasn't changed much and, more importantly, is no longer subject to her whims. More importantly, she can't simply disappear with his son for months on end whenever she feels like it. If you are an addict or on the road to recovery you CAN come back from it!",

Depending on what it is, I know plenty of kids who would be thrilled about that idea. If so, the kid is just going to view this as his dad now taking away his vacation because of issues between him/his ex. Which, even if he now has joint custody, telling him he can't go is just going to hurt their relationship in the short-term (and possibly long-term), more than going on the vacation could, even with a spiteful ex whispering who-knows-what into the kids ear.\n\nLike I said, I've no idea if this is the case here, not enough information to tell.

            "as great as it is that your brother has gotten sober and stable, his ex-wife is 100% in the right to be cautious here. just 5 years ago he was such a severe addict that it destroyed his marriage and no custody at all. this story also shows that he has not attempted to show ex-wife how he has gotten better by telling her how involved he is in the program. less than 5 years is an awful short amount of time to rebuild trust.\n\n> In fact, she has begun jerking him around with visitation, even planning on removing son from his father for a period of several months so she can take a long vacation with her new family. \n\nhow is this jerking him around? he doesn't have any official custody at this point. visitation is entirely at her discretion, and obviously her saying not right now is within that. she has been the single parent of this child for at least 5 years. why are you acting like her taking *her child* *that she currently has sole custody of* on vacation is such a horrible thing? families with much better relationships, without a history of drug addiction, can still go on vacation. why wouldn't your brother be happy for his kid to go on this vacation? \n\n> I wish I could see the look on that hateful bitch's face. It's not official yet, but yeah, he's totally getting joint custody. \n\nwhy is she a hateful bitch? why are you so bitter here? your brother destroyed his own relationships with his drug addiction, and broke a lot of trust in doing so. honestly it doesn't appear as if your brother is accepting responsibility for the damage he caused, and you're jumping right into enabling that. that \"hateful bitch\" is the one who was parenting his kid when he was too busy being an addict. \n\nwith that said, i hope your brother gets visitation. i also hope he learns to recognize the damage he did, and would continue to do if he just rushes in. it sounds like he is trying to get custody to prevent the vacation. if he stops the vacation, he will likely hurt his relationship with the kid. the kid is at least 5, and would realize that dad is the reason they can't go on vacation, and may even be old enough to remember how dad was before getting clean. your brother needs to rebuild trust before he can start making demands about what's best for kiddo",

Anyway I have instead became an excellent step dad to two wonderful boys and have never been happier.  Trying to rebuild trust with my ex but it\u2019s been over a year of me constantly asking to see him or get updates and still nothing.  There should be more rights for fathers who have lost their kids due to addiction issues",
            "I\u2019ve been separated from my wife for 6 years and finally decided to file for divorce because ai feel like our youngest son is not getting proper medical attention and my wife refuses to give me health insurance information, dr names or allow me to take my son to the dr.  The last thing I wanted was a huge divorce and I would have been happy with a no contest divorce.   Well,  I warned her that I had no choice but to file and she filed the next day.\n\nI have been awarded temporary joint custody but one condition is to pass a hair follicle drug test before I can see the kids on this temporary order.   It sucks because that can go back three months and has nothing to indicate if it was time alone or with my kids when I was using.  It\u2019s just a barrier to be a barrier.  So now I\u2019ll miss Christmas and thanksgiving with them no matter what.  I could understand a urine test within 24 hours of my weekends with the them if the concern was using drugs while with them.  \n\nToday I found out that the audio files I submitted for discovery (the audio is my son talks about his mother forgetting his medication for two weeks until his older brother reminds her about it.    And how sad he is in school because of his condition and how he wants to get better) and my lawyer didn\u2019t submit this stuff.   Life is a travesty sometimes.   I should have known my lawyer was a bad one when he was late for the first two consultations.  Damn he sucks.  No one trains us on how to pick a lawyer.   You barely have time to vet more than before your first hearing.   After paying 25% of my net income for support over the past 4 years I am now somehow ordered to pay 42% of my net income for support and it blows my mind I got so cockslapped when I sincerely thought I was doing the right and decent things.",

She tried emigrating with the kids, but that was thankfully quashed.... \n\nWhen I say he had 'roid rage, he was never violent to her, or their children, he did break a few things, and once put his fist through a dry wall.\n\nHe now has every second weekend, and Christmas and Summer school holidays.",

Its was alright for most classes, but it was absolutely atrocious when it came to math.\u00a0 Nothing worked with math.\u00a0 We were supposed to use the lessons they had, but it just didn't work.\u00a0 Math symbols didnt show up right and some questions even had the wrong answer marked.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMy math teacher wasn't allowed to just move to paper, and the company insisted that the problem was that our math teacher was older and just didn't understand technology.\u00a0 They said that if she had a genuine issue to email them.\u00a0\n\nOne day, I get to class, and there are 7 email addresses written on the board. She told us that we were going to go through our math lesson today, and take screenshots of every mistake we found and email them to the companies executives. One screenshots = one email.\u00a0 10 emails = a packet of gummy bears. We had a blast trying to send as many emails as we could. \u00a0 One kid got ten packets of gummy bears by end of the hour class.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBy lunch the principal called my teacher aside and asked for her to stop.\u00a0 She said \"Hell no! My afternoon classes haven't had fun yet!\"\n\nLong story short, our school district got all of its money back from using the software, and the company no longer exists (or they changed their brand out of shame.\u00a0 Idk, I just cant find them anymore)\n\nTl;dr: the software company said to email if she found a actual issue, so she had an army of either graders, inspired by gummy bears, send thousands of emails to the CEO and other executives.",

One question used the word \"combinations\" when they meant \"permutations\".  The word problems were marked by a district team of administrators who clearly didn't understand what they were marking because questions on different tests (same question though)  were given different answers.

        "selftext": "Edit: First and foremost, thank you for the upvotes and awards. Greatly appreciated, I love all the discussions below. There is some food for thought here.\n\nTo clarify a few things: this took place in Europe. I was a salaried employee (40hr/week). I left that job about 10 months after the \"event\" took place. I didn't get into trouble and nobody tried to fire me (my probation period was over and we have employment laws regarding constructive dismissal, so I knew their hands were tied).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout four years back, I started a new banking job. All was well, just that the management was pretty strict with timekeeping, which was weird as we were back office (my experience was in a similar field at another bank, and we had flexible schedules and received time in lieu). But rules are rules, so I followed them. I learnt my tasks and got to know the wider team.\n\nAnyway, about four months in, I started to realise my senior manager didn\u2019t like me. I\u2019m pretty assertive as a person, and I do know how to stand up for myself. He hated it. I would speak up during the meetings, ask questions, give suggestions, and so on, while the team would stay quiet.\n\nThe week everything went south, I was working overtime, which was (obviously) unpaid. On Thursday, I did nearly two hours of overtime. On Friday, I thought I\u2019ll leave a few minutes early as I was done for the week. My manager was off. I left 10 minutes early.\n\nOn Monday, I come to work, and I got called into a meeting straight away. There were three of us in the room: myself, my manager, and my senior manager. Our conversation went as follows:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy manager (MM): I heard you left work early on Friday\n\nMe: I did. I left 10 minutes early.\n\nMM: did you ask for permission to leave early?\n\nMe: it was 10 minutes. You know I did about 4 hours of overtime last week. Why are we having this conversation?\n\nSenior Manager (SM): because you left early without asking for permission. As a senior, you should be setting an example for the rest of the team.\n\nMe: Is this a joke?\n\nSM: Your working hours are 9 am to 6 pm, not 9 am to 5:50 pm. You shouldn't leave early without asking for your manager or my permission first. Is that clear?\n\nMe: Got it. It\u2019s perfectly clear.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI listened and started coming into the office at 9 am and leaving at 6 pm on the dot. At first, they didn't realise what was happening, but the week after the meeting was the last week of the month. And let\u2019s say the last week of the month was\u2026 intense. Especially the final day. The reports had to be completed, signed off, and submitted before the month's end. We covered multiple jurisdictions and would deal with Southeast Asia in the morning and the Americas in the evening. Our team was \u201cexpected\u201d to work overtime due to this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere comes Friday, the last day of the month. Showtime!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m at my desk at 9 am sharp. Most of the team have already been at the office for at least an hour. I, of course, have a cup of coffee from the cafeteria because I was a bit early. My manager looks at me and raises his eyebrow, but he doesn\u2019t say anything.\n\nWork work work. Break time (we had two 20 minute paid breaks and 1-hour unpaid lunch). I\u2019m the only person to go on my break.\n\nLunchtime. Everyone was eating at their desks, while I go to meet my friends for lunch. On the second break, I once again leave my workplace and go for a short stroll around.\n\nBack to work. About a quarter to 6 pm, I get a call from one of the senior managers in the US. She needs the report amended. There were 4 of us on that call. I\u2019m doing the amendments as we speak and closely monitoring the time. I see it\u2019s two minutes to 6 pm\u2026 One minute\u2026 6 pm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSM2: \\*rambling about the report\n\nMe: apologies, but I have to stop you right here\n\nSM2: yes?\n\nMe: It\u2019s 6 pm here. My day is over.\n\nSM2: Huh?\n\nMe: As per my management, my working hours are 9 am to 6 pm, so I must leave now. Have a great weekend, and we\u2019ll catch up on Monday!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI logged off, got my coat, wished everyone a great weekend, and left. It was 6:04 pm. Both my manager and my senior manager were dumbfounded by what has happened. Looking pale, and stare at me in disbelief. It was a glorious sight.\n\nI wanted to apologise to my senior manager that I wasn\u2019t able to leave at 6 pm on the dot, but I thought that would have been way too passive-aggressive, so I just left.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI relaxed the rule a bit after a few months. Yet, I never did more than 30 minutes of overtime. Ironically, once my stakeholders understood that I will not be available for 10+ hours, they started collaborating earlier in the month. I would have most of my reports done and submitted by the last day of the month.",

This was not specifically delineated in my employment expectations.\n\nAnd with my current jobs, the others are surprised when they wonder why I didn't get an email sent after 5pm. No I don't have my work email on my phone, and I won't make the effort to check it after that time. I have Microsoft Teams on my phone but notifications are turned off. I only turn them on when I'm in the field and may absolutely be needed.\n\nKindness got me into trouble before. So now I'm doing exactly what's told, to the letter.

            "I have had an almost identical thing...\n\nWhere I used to work I would almost always start 10-15 minutes early and stay 10-20 minutes late and would often be in the office an hour early to get everything done if I needed to leave bang on 5pm. I was salaried, so no overtime. One day I was half an hour late. No drama or excuses, I literally overslept and was running late - my fault entirely.\n\nI'd been at my desk for a few minutes when my boss walked past me and said loudly so everyone could hear 'Ah, RicoDredd, you're here? So nice of you to join us' which you could call 'banter' or 'just having a laugh' - I suppose - although it didn't feel like it to me. I was annoyed but let it go. A little while later I got a shitty, passive-aggressive email from him saying that I needed to make sure that I made the time up - which I was going to do anyway - and to remind me that my hours were 8.30am-5pm and 'they didn't do flexitime' so not to be late in future.\n\nRight. OK, if that's the way you want it, now it's fucking on. From that day forward I didn't worked a minute early or late and took my full lunchbreak to the second. I would start my computer up at 8.30 exactly and shutdown my computer at 5pm exactly and be in my car by 5.01\n\nA few times over the next few months someone would try to talk to me about work before I had started or while I was at lunch and I'd say 'sorry, I've not started work yet...and we don't do flexitime here' and go back to my phone. Pretty soon my boss noticed and he asked me what I was playing at and I said that I was doing exactly what he said I had to do - working 8.30am-5pm as there was no flexitime. He said that I was being pedantic and I was 'obliged to be flexible' and that due to the nature if the job my working hours were 'changeable' depending on what the work load was at the time. I asked him to show me where it actually said that in my contract of employment....surprisingly, he couldn't.",
            "I had a boss like that at the start of my career straight out of college. She was a major micromanager and control freak, also responsible for many people leaving their jobs cuz of her attitude and approach. No one dared say anything most of the time. If you dared try to speak against her you would get some long condescending diatribe. \n\nCoworker once needed to get somewhere early before something closed so she left literally ten min early. Boss comes slowly strolling down the aisle (I can smell her coming from her copious amounts of perfume as well as hear the sound of her particular walk). She sees my coworker gone and asks me. I said she left early cuz of an appt and didn\u2019t do a lunch or whatever to make sure she made her normal time coverage. Instead I get to hear some drama whine about our hours. We are salaried so it isn\u2019t a very specific shift schedule or whatever except by her rules she wants us there the core hours while many others who sit right next to us get to be flexible cuz their bosses aren\u2019t jerks and control freaks. I was so glad when she got laid off, she was the classic boss bully.",

There was a very informal timesheet system since the entire company was salaried and had \"unlimited\" PTO. \n\nI had been routinely working 50-60 hour weeks and getting off early an hour or two on a Friday here or there, always cleared with my supervisor, but not coded on my timesheet total as PTO since my working hours were still over the normal 40 with the time removed. This had also been discussed with the payroll admin. \n\nWe got a new controller on a warpath and she couldn't find me one Friday and came unglued. When I returned Monday, she accused me of falsifying my timesheet and stealing from the company, even when I produced email approval for all of the \"absences\". She told me I was expected to work 8 hours every day. \n\nOkay, bet. \n\nI suddenly only worked 40 hours. It took them a few months to realize how intense the backlog was with my unpaid overtime missing, at which point they started badgering me to work more.

            "I had a similar situation, although my role was less time-sensitive as I was in advertising design. \n\nI was hired as a designer at a design studio within a print shop (when print was fading but still somewhat relevant). This was the opposite dynamic than I was used to as generally, designers are the print shop's clients. This may or mayn't bear influence on this interaction. \n\nPrint shops are a very blue-collar environment, whereas design studios are, well, full of artists, but we were kept in a pretty secure bubble by the partner who oversaw the studio and sales. There were 3 other partners, one who ran the printing, one who ran a photo studio, and another, we'll call him Biff, who ran the front office and business administration. Biff always gave me and the other designers (but it seemed especially me) the side-eye. \n\nWhen I first started, my direct manager, the art director, showed me around the office, including the kitchen where there was a coffee pot. She joked that I could help myself to the coffee, but that I might decide not to once I tasted it. Fair enough. \n\nI had been in design for a few years at this point, and understood that there were often projects that required overtime when there was a deadline. I wasn't fussy about it so long as I was given around the amount of time I needed to finish a job.\n\nI commuted by car from about 40 miles away in a major metropolitan area with traffic and it would typically take between 1:00 or 1:15 to get there in the morning.

(I rarely had appointments to keep, and when I was late, I would make up the time on the other end of the day.)\n\nA few weeks in, Biff caught me pouring myself a cup of horrible coffee from the office pot and said, in a kind of villainous voice, \"That's not for you.\" I replied, \"I'm sorry?\" \"That's not for you, that's for the office and guests,\" he said.

That was 10 years ago, and you know what? The sky didn't fall, the universe didn't end, but I did get home on time for dinner and everyone around me at work adjusted to my new hours. It's been that way at every place I've gone to since.\n\nI suppose I should thank that jerk for teaching me an important lesson.",

I'd ask the questions that they didn't want asked and I'd bring up the \"what if X happens?\" situations that they didn't want to think about.  At that previous job we ran a virtual Windows environment on all the computers - Windows and Mac.  One meeting the manager of that was saying how the virtual desktop could be loaded onto a USB drive and ran on any machine as long as the launcher software was loaded.  So I asked: \n\nWhat happens if they lose the USB stick?  Is it backed up anywhere?\n\nThe response was \"it's encrypted!\"\n\nThere was a bit of back and forth with me saying \"that's great - but what happens if they ***lose the physical part that holds their data?\"*** with the \"it's encrypted!!!\" response.  They really didn't like that question and finally admitted that there was no backup of the local files.  Guess what they never implemented there...",

I had just started treatment because I lost upwards of 20 pounds in two months and needed to get back on the wagon to stay in school. Since my advisor had walked in on the conversation, I was hoping to segue into bringing her aside to talk about extensions.  Nope. She came into the conversation with,\u201dWow, I wish I could lose weight like that.\" She rattled on about her unsuccessful dieting and her lack of willpower not like mine. How could I do it?I lost it internally.  Mind you she was fully aware of my issues because I had taken medical absences and have had to maneuver classes around treatment. Never stopped her from telling me whenever I ate french fries that I don't eat real food.\n\nHere's where the malicious compliance comes in. I in jest I said, \"Do you want tips?\" She obviously jumped on that. Of course she'd love tips. The next day I sent an email with every single detail of behavior usage. How to restrict, how to vomit, lying to your friends and therapists, how to run a 5k after not eating for days, etc. It got graphic too with how to deal with vomiting blood, passing out in public, acid erosion on your teeth, and having your hair fall out.\nShe didn't respond to that email, but she stopped talking about dieting in front of me for the rest of my time in college.\n\n\n\n___\n\nEDIT: I am so unbelievably thankful for all the upvotes & words of affirmations.

Four drums and four flats.\n\nOne night a table comes in and everyone orders a pound of wings. A little while after the wings go out, the server comes back a little flustered and explains there has been a complaint.\n\nApparently, one of the guys at the table complained that it was 'obvious' that he didn't get a pound, because it would be a *huge* coincidence if everyone's pounds led to the same number of wings on each plate. He insisted that the server go and weigh these (already discounted) wings to make sure he was \"getting what he paid for\".\n\nSo we weighted it. Sure enough it was not a pound. It was a pound and a half. We tell the server to bring it out and tell him he's getting more than a pound. She says \"fuck no. He paid for a pound, he's going to \"get what he paid for\"\" and threw two of his wings in the garbage and re-weighted the food. Still over. Throws another one out. Bang on 1 pound of wings.\n\nSo she brings back out his 5 wings and calmly tells the gentleman \"here are your wings sir. You were right, there was more than a pound there. So we threw the other ones out. Good catch\".\n\nWhen they ordered a second round, he didn't complain that everyone got 8 wings to a \"pound\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdits: Obligatory thank yous to everyone. I've never had a post generate this much discussion or get this much attention. Nor have I ever gotten anything like this number of awards. Thank you kind strangers.\n\nOn the size of the wings: You can buy 6-8 count wings if you shop around a little bit. Like shrimp, for example, wings are sold by their \"count\" of pieces per pound. This place made wings (and burgers) their signature items. Yes, they were very large wings, which were then double breaded.\n\nOn the fact that they ordered a second round: This is not unusual. If you've ever worked at a wing joint, you would know that people will order round after round of wings. Minus the bones, there is not a lot of food there compared to, say, a steak or a chicken breast. \n\nOn throwing the food out: we got staff meals and no one was terribly interested in eating food that was already pawed over by someone else. Plus, cooks rarely go hungry. There was plenty of fresh food on the line. We certainly were not going to put them on some other customer's plate.\n\nThanks everyone. Glad you all enjoyed this so much.",

            "Similar story coming from almost ten years ago.\n\nI was working at a steak and seafood restaurant at the time and we offered a pound of king crab legs for whatever the price was, I honestly can't recall. I worked there for about a year before we got a complaint about them. Some guy was insisting that he didn't get his full pound. We took the order back, re-weighed them and they came out to 17oz (within our tolerances). We sent the server back out to explain that it was actually an ounce more than advertised.\n\nDude sent it back saying \"Yeah, I'm sure it is. But I'm sure a lot of that came from the shell. I don't want to pay for what I can't eat and I know it's going to be less weight after you cook it.\"\n\nIn comes the r/MaliciousCompliance. I was working seafood and pasta end that night, asked the kitchen lead that night (owner) if it was fine to honor his demand -- for the cost of shelled meat. He paused, grinned, and said \"Let's give him what he wants.\"\n\nI went to work meticulously shelling three pounds of leg clusters after it was steamed. Weighed it and got 20oz of meat. The manger approved the extra four ounces, walked it out himself, apologized for the hassle, took the original order off the bill, told him it was 20oz and let him know there was a small fee for shelling the meat in-house. The customer said that was fine and he appreciated getting what he 'ordered'.\n\nAfter the customer finished his meal and got the check, he was foaming at the mouth. The manager ended up charging him $250 (with the extra work fee included). From what I heard he went from super smug to absolutely aghast. \"I didn't know it would be that much! This is highway robbery!\", he said. The manager explained how they weren't cheap to buy initially and how part of the cost was deferred by having customers shell it themselves. \n\nHe ended up paying the bill in full and I got a free order of crab legs and three extra shift drinks that night.",
