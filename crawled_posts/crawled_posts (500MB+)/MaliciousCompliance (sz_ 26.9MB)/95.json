        "selftext": "The leaf collection company for my neighborhood has absurdly strict rules about where leaves must be for pickup. I live at the end of a cul-de-sac, so my curb is curved and pretty short (about 30' / 9m) long. My property is wedge-shaped, so my back yard is quite long (200' / 60m) and has 40-50 oak trees. I also have two sugar maples in my front yard. So, leaves. Lots of leaves.\n\nPickup rules state leaves must be within 5' of the curb, but on the road. They must also be at least 15' from a mailbox. Because subscriptions for leaf pickup are by individual homeowner, neighbors are not allowed to combine leaves and cannot buy a group subscription. Subscribers must only put \"their\" leaves from \"the current year\" out for pickup. Pickup trucks use GPS to identify homes who have signed up and ignore leaves in front of homes that did not sign up.\n\nBecause I have so many leaves and so little curb (only 15' of available curb due to the required distance from a mailbox), I called the leaf collection company and asked to put the leaves along a longer curb I share with my neighbor. \"No problem,\" they said. Great.\n\nThe truck came through and picked up a fraction of the pile and left the rest of the pile the driver decided was in front of my neighbor's property. I called the company back and a different person said those are the rules. I'll just have to figure it out.\n\nFine. Now it's on.\n\nI have 15' of width and 5' of depth. There is, however, no limit on height. I moved the remaining leaves to my available curb space. I collected the rest of my leaves and added them to the pile. I spoke with my neighbors and acquired the rights to their leaves by paying them $1 each. Now they are all \"my\" leaves. I shoveled / swept the leaves off the streets. They went on the pile. I collected the purchased leaves from the neighbors. They went on the pile. Leaves continued to fall, so I kept adding them. It was a lot of work, but the pile was over 12' tall. I spent a ton of time using a snow shovel to fling the leaves to the top of the pile that was more than 5' above my head. Neighborhood residents stopped to gape at the epic leaf mound.\n\nI am happy to battle willful ignorance with malicious compliance. I reminded myself of this every time I spent another hour tending to the obscenity on my curb.\n\nThe truck came today. The pile dwarfed the truck. They had to drive away and dump leaves, then come back and reload. Twice.\n\ntl;dr Leaf collection company won't let me put leaves on a longer curb so I collect everyone's leaves and create a 12-foot pile.\n\nEDIT: Not surprisingly, many want to see the pile. Since I did this alone, I didn't have a way to take a picture of myself in front of the pile (attempts failed). I also don't want to show too much house for fear the company could single me out for denial of future services. Apparently, however, my son took a picture when he got off the bus on the first day when the pile was about 10'. He's 6'1\". https://imgur.com/gallery/xOuhbgN\n\nNot really the proof that satisfies, but it's all I have.",

My great-aunt was trying to get the leaves off 9f her lawn for the same reason.\n\nAfter getting most of the leaves onto the garden, it was clear that a storm was coming that would blow a lot of the leaves from my grandmother's garden into her sister-in-law's yard. My dad then asked if I could finish moving leaves if he tried getting them tilled enough that they wouldn't blow away (hoping a quick, shallow tilling with the cover of leaves would keep him from being bogged too much).\n\nI assured him I could, but also pointed out that if the leaves blew over, they would no longer be our problem since his aunt believed possession was 9/10 of the law.\n\nThe whole time we finished working that day, my dad couldn't stop giggling at the thought of using one of his aunt's favorite phrases against her.",

        "selftext": "\n\nDecember 24 and 31 has always been a non-working day in our country but just this year our president announced that it will be a \u201cspecial working holiday\u201d so it is still up to the company if they will have work on that day or not.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen our company announced that we will have a full day of work on the 24th\u00a0\u00a0the employees weren\u2019t happy. We didn\u2019t have work on that day even before the oldest employee in the company have started working (working for the company for 40+ years already) and most employees already had plans set up for that day.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfter back and forth meetings with the union, the company finally gave in and agreed to have only a half day of work on the 24th. Employees are still not happy but we took that as a win.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow to the malicious compliance. Each department in our company can choose any day in December to celebrate their Christmas party. The party can last half a work day and the employees will still be compensated as long as the party is held in the office. So today is December 24 and we will all have our Christmas party. As agreed, department Christmas parties are company time so it will still be credited as us going to \u201cwork\u201d. Merry Christmas!\n\n\nEdit: someone suggested I add this. Some of you have said that this is still a win for the company. I don't think it is because in the prior years most departments will not use the allowed half day Christmas party and would just do it after work or on weekends because parties here tend to be super loud (karaoke!!) but since we are forced to work this morning we all just decided to have a party now. Someone brought a portable karaoke and it is loud!\n\n\nAnother edit: the president I was talking about in the first paragraph is the president of the country. November 2, December 24 and 31 used to be a \"special non-working holiday\" meaning companies don't have work that day. For those who need to work that day they are entitled to an additional 30% of their basic rate. He suddenly changed it this year to a \"special working holiday\" so it's still a holiday but we need to go to work and we don't get the additional 30% pay just the basic rate. Pretty stupid if you ask me. Meanwhile the president I was talking about in the comments who joined our party is the president of our company, sorry for the confusion.",

Fortunately our local management knew what was coming.  2 folks early shift, 4 folks normal day shift, 2 folks closing.  (8am East Coast to 5pm West Coast coverage).   We took a total of 5 calls that day.   Every single one was someone who expected to leave a message or wanted information available in our automated system.   \"For product line X, touch 1....for model xyz, touch 2...recording of one us reading a data sheet\"  (Pre web)  \n\n\nSo what did we do all day long.   We played team FPS (first person shooter) games.   The one manager would keep an eye on the queue, when a call came in he'd call out \"Pause the game!   Call for {name}\"  He made sure if we had taken a call, we didn't have to take the next another.   Why?   Because it was multiplayer and we were shouting at each other for moves, yelling profanity when we got killed, etc.",

        "selftext": "  When I started at my new company, we had used all assigned parking spots in the adjacent parking garage, and I was given a spot in a building a couple of blocks away. \n\nWhen I got in early one morning and had to be let in by security as the building was not yet unlocked, I talked with the security guard briefly, and this started a bit of a friendship. After a week or so he asked why I always came through the front door, instead of through the parking garage and I explained my situation. \n\nHe ended up giving me one of the extra spots that was assigned to the security staff. I was only allowed to park there Monday-Thursday as they needed the spot for cleaning crews on Friday. This spot is only about 20 feet from the pedestrian bridge to the building, so it is a pretty nice set-up. \n\nWe also have 2 company visitor spots in the same adjacent lot, however they are on the top floor (along with the rest of the spots assigned to our company), exposed to the sun, and require walking down three flights to get to the pedestrian bridge. \n\nWe have had a Senior Engineer visiting from a different office for the last two weeks, parking in the visitor\u2019s spot. \n\nOn Tuesday we went to our cars together, and he saw where I was parked. \n\nWell when I got to work yesterday, he was already in my parking spot. I headed up to one of the visitor spots, and let him know that he needed to move his vehicle out of my spot, or his car might be towed (we are right downtown and have many people who park in this garage without permission). \n\nHe told me that it was fine, don\u2019t worry about it, it was a company parking spot, and that could just stay in the visitor\u2019s spot. \n\nI told him that I really did not think that was a good idea, and tried to explain, but he brushed me off. I followed up with an email letting him know that the spot was not leased by our company, but that I just had permission to park there until a spot opened in the garage.\n\nI parked in my assigned spot in the other parking garage (boss man does not like non-visitors parking in the visitor\u2019s spot so I was not about to stay there) and didn\u2019t worry about it, just like I was told.\n\nWell come lunch time, Senior Engineer comes storming back into the office. Apparently, Security Guard saw that the vehicle parked in my spot was not my shitty Civic, but rather a Tesla, and decided to have the vehicle towed. \n\nNot exactly sure what came of this, and I bet I will find out later today, but I am happy that I sent the CYA email as Senior Engineer outranks me by a considerable margin, and I do not need someone thinking that I left him high and dry out of spite. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI should note that while we have spots assigned to our company, each vehicle gets assigned its own spot. Occasionally we will have people park in our assigned spots, and Security will call our office to confirm if this is someone we are allowing to park there, or if this is someone parking improperly. So if it had been a company spot, Senior Engineer's assumption would have been correct. \n\nWe got no such call, and Security Guard does not have my personal number.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nNot the satisfying update I was hoping for at all. \n\nApparently Senior Engineer called and complained to building management. He explained the situation, and it turns out that security did not have the authority to allow me to park in this spot. \n\nSounds like Security Guard got chewed out, and I am really hoping this did not impact his job...\n\nI lost my parking in the close garage. Boss man is not upset with me which is the only good thing about this.\n\nSenior Engineer was bitching to anyone who would listen. He is such a victim. \n\nNo idea who had to pay tow fees, but I am prerty confident that Senior Engineer did not.\n\nUPDATE 2:\n\nI was able to speak with Security Guard on my way to lunch today. \n\nApparently his boss did not chew him out, and I guess that was passed onto Senior Douchebag to appease him. \n\nYes Security Guard was told that he could not give out the spot, but that was it. He was quite surprised when I told him what I had heard.",

Short story no one works for him anymore but he is still his own boss/ceo of that company company and can reach over and grab resources (ie me) from parent company.\n\nI work all night fixing an issue with a huge digiboard setup..yeah a long time back. I pulled an all nighter and never left that night and had parked up front by the door when no one was around. I was literally the only one at work all night into the next morning. In your minds eye see 300+ 56k modems hooked up to 8port digiboards as an incoming ISP setup and you kind of get a taste of what I was dealing with.\n\nAnyway, call goes out over the intercom that whoever is parked up front with the jeep has exactly 2 minutes to move it or the CFO is having it towed. \n\nYep that would be me. These spots are not locked to people, in fact the ones that are for the CEO and owner have their names painted on them. The CFO just parked in this spot every morning because they got their early before everyone else.\n\nI walk down, walk into the CFO office and say it is mine and I have been here all night and have not left. \n\nMove it or it gets towed. She says\n\nTouch my jeep and you will have my resignation letter in your hand before you can hook up to it. Maybe you should have them paint your name on the spot if you think it is yours. I will park in whatever spot is open!\n\nI was tired. I was hungry. I was bent. I did not move my jeep. \n\nShe lost her mind. There were meetings. She wanted my head. My old boss was In these meetings. He said he would take care of it and I would never park in the spot ever again he would make sure of it.\n\nShe had the temerity to come to my office and let me know personally. I was about to get sideways when my old boss walked in after her and said let\u2019s goto lunch and she smiled.\n\nAt lunch he informed me never to park in her spot again. That because he was a tenant and owner of his business at the complex he got two spots and he indeed had one with his name on it. The next morning I had his second with my name on it. Two spaces closer to the door than hers made up ownership spot.\n\nTada! That guy knew how to work it. I learned a lot from him and I indeed never parked in her spot again and she had to walk past my name painted on a primo spot every morning.\n\nThis makes me smile just thinking about it and that was over 20 years ago.",

            "I worked for this company for a few weeks as a temp, and the day before my first day I broke two bones in my right foot and ended up in a boot with crutches. \n\nI desperately needed the job so the next morning I arrived bright and early, only to find that employees had to park about 150 feet from the entrance. I had a purse and a notebook in a tote to carry and struggled to get to the door. About halfway there a nice man came out and took my tote and walked back with me to the building. He was the manager of the department I would be working in for the next few weeks. I explained what happened and he was fine, and said they would make accomodations for me. He recommended I get a handicapped placard but until I had the chance he told me to go ahead and park in one of the two handicapped spots right by the front door. \n\nUnfortunately I didn't work directly under him, but under Satan's Mistress. SM thought the department was her own little fiefdom and we her serfs. When the Manager took me in and introduced me to her, her exact words were \"if she can't go get me coffee she's useless to me.\"\n\nSM tried every way in the world to get me to quit that first day, but it was a good paying job that could go perm and I was hoping to stay, so I took it. When my day was over, SM stopped me as I was leaving and made me stand on crutches for another 15 minutes while she explained to me that she didn't give special favors or privileges to anyone. I assured her I was not asking for any when she finally stopped talking, then she decided to walk me out. \n\nAt lunch I had moved my car to one of the handicapped spaces so I only had a short walk there. When she saw where I was going she went on a tirade about me making assumptions and I needed to park in the employee lot like everyone else. \n\nI didn't realize I had walked into an intramural tug of war game that had been going on for months, and they went back and forth all the first week on where I could park. Finally home office said let me park in the handicapped spots until I was back on my feet. I thought that settled it. \n\nThe next Monday morning, I arrive and see that there is already a car in one of the two handicapped spaces. It was displaying the proper placard, as was mine at this point. I didn't think anything of it and went on in. At the end of the day SM asked me to walk out with her, asking me dumb questions as we walked. I wondered what her motive was, and I found out when she got into the other car with a placard. I didn't say anything but she laughed, grabbed the placard and said \"I have a handicapped...I work here. It's good to have friends who are doctors.\" Then she laughed and stuffed it under her seat before driving off. \n\nI decided at that moment I didn't want to work there anymore, went back inside, wrote a letter to the nice manager relating what had just happened, and why I had decided to end the contract, and left it on his desk. \n\nOne of the women I worked with was a friend of a friend, and she reached out to me a couple of days later to tell me SM got fired later that day for using a handicapped placard she didn't need to get a closer parking space she also didn't need.",

If for some reason I did find myself needing to use a lot or something, I figured out I could use that debit card I had been issued. You could even use it to pay for tickets, I discovered lol. So I'd just use it to pay on the rare occasion I needed to, didn't think anything about it. I'd usually still have money left over, but I had been told it didn't roll over. Apparently that was not true. The cost for the space in the garage was like, idk, say $147, but we were given something like $155 a month, but again, told it didn't roll over. Someone found it it actually did, and after being there for a long time, had built up a bit on that card. They then used it to pay for parking in the city on their personal time. Someone important I guess found out and got all pissed, so from then on the policy was changed to just the company paying that garage directly somehow, no one got cards anymore, and I once ended up calling out because I couldn't find street parking and was not about to pay for my own fucking parking lol.\n\nEdit, for overnight parking in my pretty large city, on a weekend, which was usually the only time I'd have an issue with street parking, the absolute cheapest I could find was a really sketchy place that was NOT close to my office really, and was still like $40. I wasn't doing that lol. Had it been idk, less than $10 or something, I'd have just done it. But nope. All the lots in the city will do \"special event\" parking on weekends if a concert or sporting event was happening, solely so they could charge higher prices. It's a total racket. Everyone hates parking downtown lol. Funny though, we also actually got credits for a ride sharing app as a perk. I didn't use those often and easily could have done so. Could have driven home and then ordered the ride from there, even. That was actually gonna be the plan, I'd just let my boss know I'd be a little late. But once I got home, I was like nah, I'm not getting back out. Fuck it.",

            "I worked in a position back in the mid-90's where we had government cars (GSA) assigned. We all had Plymouth Acclaims, and they were left parked in a gravel lot in downtown New Haven, CT. Apparently the cool thing to do at the time, was for kids to steal the cars, and wreck them to make the airbag deploy. My Acclaim had been wrecked 4 times, while the other one had been wrecked 3....I guess Acclaims were easy to hot wire. Anyway, we had been working with GSA to get parking for all of our vehicles, GS and personal, in the gated garage right across the street, and GSA finally approved paid parking, but only for the GS cars. As none of us wanted to leave our personal vehicles in the open lot, we figured out that we could scan our plastic parking pass at the automated gate to exit with our GS car, pull forward under the gate, then quickly back into the garage again, thereby logging our vehicle out of the garage. We then used the same pass to park our personal vehicles in the garage for free. I would imagine 2 decades later, this might not work anymore, but it worked pretty well back then.",

        "selftext": "I used to work for a small, fee-for-service non-profit. The average number of clients served was/is around 250. The average caseload is 12 but can range from 10-20 per person (and may exceed 20 depending on circumstance). Non-management staff hover around 18-20 people. New staff aren\u2019t really able to effectively use client authorized hours until several months in, so the org is reliant on senior staff to keep projected income up. This is relevant later. \n\nKeeping it as understandable as possible, one of the \u201cperks\u201d of being a senior staff member was receiving a personalized, facilitated plan for your goals. Once the plans were done individually, everyone who received one from all regions of the org came together as a group to discuss. This was meant to be an opportunity to share, support each other, and figure out next steps. Since our plans were mostly done around our goals at the company, we had an honest conversation about what we need to be successful. It wasn\u2019t inappropriate in any way and many of the needs we brought up were already being met; it was honestly just a facilitated discussion around how to keep focused on advancing our career there. \n\nWell, one person from another region with more \u201cweight\u201d didn\u2019t like how the day went so they complained to their manager (who is also a personal friend). That manager worked herself up about it, created a new story, and went straight to the assistant director. The assistant director is a VERY reactionary person and isn\u2019t very well liked; most just avoid or placate her. \n\nEveryone in my region at the group meeting gets an email from AD saying we need to cancel all appointments and be in her office at a specified time the next day. Remember, we\u2019re senior staff. That means five of us cancelled our client-based appointments to go into this mystery meeting, losing the company money. \n\nMeeting comes. We are sat down in front of all of the managers in our region and the AD. She launches into us with the following highlights: \u201chow dare you use group time to provide feedback about the organization\u201d, she\u2019s so ashamed and doesn\u2019t trust us to represent the company, informs us that we wasted $7,000 of the companies\u2019 money, and that her toddlers behave better than us. She ends this five minute rant by saying that every one of us is replaceable, and they\u2019d be happy if we left. We five sit in stunned silence before the meeting is \u201cconcluded\u201d and we all walk out. \n\nTurns out the AD never spoke to the facilitator, didn\u2019t consult any other attendees from other regions, in fact, didn\u2019t bother getting any additional information at all. To add insult to injury, my boss (one of the managers in the room) told me the point of that meeting was to \u201cmake us feel shitty\u201d when I asked what follow-up was needed from me. \n\nI found a job within two weeks and left. Two other people in that meeting quit within a month. A fourth is halfway out the door. Others found out about the meeting and so far four additional staff have left. All seven of us who quit (so far) had been there three years or more and our departures were no more than two months apart. Our total caseloads numbered roughly 120 clients, meaning that almost half of the organizations\u2019 clients are without staff to support them and there are now five new hires without mentors. One of the new hires quit because of this, making 8 people gone in two months. This turnover has never happened before. \n\nI left behind three years of stellar client relationships and high performance/outcomes and took with me the knowledge on everything from mandatory trainings to the billing protocol. Yup, that\u2019s right. I developed the billing protocol for the new database and no one had stepped up to learn it prior. Sucks to be you I guess.\n\nMoral of the story: if you tell staff they are replaceable, their answer will be so are you.",

            "I joined a 7 person company. On the basis of my work they gained about 150 employees. They thought of themselves as a telemarketing company, and that they made their money on the call center. In truth they had contracts of over 10 million dollars each with Fortune 500 companies, the only deliverable of which was some data, which only I knew how to produce out of the databases generated by the telemarketers. I warned them repeatedly that this made me overly vital to the company and they should let me train someone. They didn't listen. I warned them repeatedly that if I wasn't available to produce the data, they couldn't fulfill their contracts. They didn't listen. The owner hired a new boss who didn't like me because I didn't tap dance and sing \"everything's coming up roses\" quickly enough for her, so she got rid of me. (Literally one morning she came in and I was in the lobby working with the secretary's computer and I said \"good morning\" to her as she entered, and this launched her into a 45 minute screaming fit about how dare I say \"good morning\". No, I still don't understand.) They couldn't produce the data without me, so they couldn't fulfill any  of their contracts, so all their clients stopped paying, and they had to lay off most of the staff. Two months later they consisted only of the owner and one employee, the idiot who fired me. The boss deserved her.",
            "My employer is going through a big learning experience. They've decided to start cutting staffing costs. As minimum wage in my country has begun to increase, their raises have started to decrease with the intent to bring them in line with the new minimum wage in 2021.

Each of the jobs we do takes time to learn, and workloads have steadily increased to the point where those with more developed skillsets cannot train newer employees.\n\nWhen you have concentrated skillsets, long training times, and a staff only mostly fluent in English, it's usually a bad idea to get rid of incentives and competitive wages.

The bathroom thing above, fire marshal closing them on some busy weekend nights for being way over capacity, the liquor board had pulled their license once already for overserving/serving minors with pretty obvious fake IDs. \n\nI was one of the new security hired to help resolve all this. It was so bad, we had to be trained by a government ATF person and get a card to prove we knew how to spot and stop overserves, and spot fake IDs. I think the real reason they hired us, was to have scapegoats on the ready for next time they did this.\n\nSo, I worked there a while, doing my best. The owners wife was the worst. She was always drunk, always had her friends in the bar and bent the rules for them. She thought she was Lady Jesus and we should all be kissing her feet, because she was the owners wife. I mostly stayed out of her way and had no issues, but many coworkers complained about her.\n\nOne night, some dude gets sick on the way to the bathroom, I cut him off, he ends up getting escorted out by his less drunk friends. I notice a man sitting at the bar watching this. He had creased slacks, a jacket indoors on a summer night, and no drink in his hand- at a busy meat-market dance club. I started watching him, and notice the badge under his jacket. Ah-ha! He was here to watch for overserving.\n\nA little later, a woman came to the bathroom, drunk enough to need to hold on the walls for dear life. I cut her off. She screams at me, then goes into the bathroom and tries to wash off the giant black Sharpee X's from the back of both hands. I warn her that she will be kicked out of the club if she continues. She screams again and staggers out of the bathroom.\n\nAbout 5 minutes later, owners wife is in my face, screaming. The woman I had cut off was one of her friends, attending a bachelorette party in the VIP section, and I was supposed to somehow magically know she was VIP. I was also apparently supposed to break the law for her because she was VIP. So, she and I start a screaming match, where I inform her that HER HUSBAND had hired me to make sure the law was followed. I also started to inform her about the police officer at the bar, but she screamed in my face to 'shut your mouth and get out of my bar'. She fired me on the spot. I didn't bother waiting to see if her husband agreed, it was known she wore the pants.\n\nI complied. I shut my mouth and got out of her bar. I walked past the cop, still sitting at the end of the bar near the bathrooms, where the screaming match had taken place. I made eye contact with him, gave a slight nod, to which he responded by looking at the boss's wife, rolling his eyes, and smiling at me as I left.\n\nThey got shut down that night for overserving the bachelorette party. This time, they went out of business because of too many strikes against them.",

        "selftext": "So for a little bit of pre context, I used to go to the Mormon church every Sunday. My mom is super religious, while I am not. This happened a few months ago. For whatever reason, Mormon church makes teenagers attend \"seminary\" and \"young men's\". Seminary is an hour lesson every morning before school (which is stupid) and young men's is an event every Wednesday night (or other day depending on the activity).\n\nBasically, I had to go to most seminary and young men events because of my mom. There's a bunch of things I disagree with what the church does, and I am mentally not in the church anymore. Quick example is that they take 10% of income as \"tithing\" which is, again stupid. Point is they also take up a lot of your free time, demanding you contribute and invading your personal space if you refuse.\n\nI was tasked with a project in seminary and organizing 3 events for young men's. Honestly, I planning a hiking trip and cross country skiing and whatnot. When I got really busy with school, I stopped going to seminary (as I wanted an extra hour of sleep). Guess what? The church pestered me and harassed me for not going to seminary.\n\"Oh it's sooo important!\"\nMy ass it's important.\n\nBlah blah blah, I didn't go to seminary and they continued to harass me. Come time, they start encouraging us to use our \"agency\". They made a whole 3 hour long service talking about Agency, and the importance of it. Agency, to my understanding, is the ability for an individual to make ones own decision to find out the truth. They started saying this as a motivator to be MORE active in church, and find stories that prove the church to be true, but I did the opposite.\n\nCue, malicious compliance.\n\nSo instead of researching about why the church is true, I found out about why it's a whole god damn corporate lie for money (basically). I used my \"agency\" to find the real truth about the church.\n\nFor my seminary project, I made a whole presentation about the negative aspects of the church, and why we need to be more careful with what's happening (r/exmormon I thank you) I talked about Joseph Smith and his 30 something wives (10 of which were underage), the hypocrisy in the church, and the the amount of suicides and whatnot that came of the church.\n\nThen, I left.\n\nThey didn't have anything else planned for Young Men's.\n\nThey invaded my house to try and get me to go back. They gave me calls to bring me back. It was pretty simple what I would say.\n\n\"I'm utilizing my agency. Please respect that.\"\n\nThey didn't have young men's for a month, because I wasn't there to organize anything else. Not only that, my presentation also encouraged other people (some of my acquaintances) to stop going to church too.\n\nIt may not seem like a big deal, but this is a big church and bringing it down as much as I can brings me joy, especially after all the pain it's caused me.\n\nI'm glad to say that I've gotten my hour of sleep back, and now my Sunday is free for watching Endgame.\n\nEd: thank you for the gold and silver!\n\nEd2: For clarification, Joseph Smith did NOT have 30 teenage wives. He only had 10 teenage wives, and a number of other wives, many already married to other men. (Thank you u/ajaxfetish for pointing this out\n\nLink to \"plural marriage\" from the LDS site itself:\n\nhttps://www.lds.org/study/history/topics/joseph-smith-and-plural-marriage?lang=eng\n\nLink to list of Joseph Smith's wives (may not be reliable):\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Joseph_Smith%27s_wives",

It was always sports and talking about girls. I went to a different high school and so I was different. My whole family was. We weren\u2019t \u201cstandard\u201d Mormons. The YM only cared once I stopped going. Too late by then, cause we moved out of the ward and into another wards boundaries. Didn\u2019t go to church. Much happier now.",

I've heard a lot of awful things about the church, and it seems an extremely stressful organisation to be around.

        "selftext": "I\u2019ll keep the details as vague as possible because I\u2019m still with this organisation. I work for a government department. We have offices and locations all over the state. I\u2019m based out of a city that\u2019s about a two and a bit hour train ride to our head office. \n\nAt the time I was working in a team that had members working remotely all across the state, looking after policy, process, and quality assurance. Our old manager had gone and gotten himself promoted for being genuinely brilliant at his role. So our new manager, Steve, was hired in from the glorious world of banking, and he was here to whip us \u201clazy public servants into shape\u201d.\n\nA few days after he began his role, he called us all to a teleconference to inform us he wanted all of us to be at the head office 8am, tomorrow morning for an all day in-person team meeting. He wanted to see us in \u201cmeat space\u201d, to \u201csize\u201d us up, understand what we were doing, and see where we \u201cweren\u2019t keeping up with the private sector\u201d. \n\nAs I mentioned, due to the nature of the work we were doing, we were all across the state. So in-person, whole team meetings were rare and if they occurred at all, they were booked weeks in advance. We were all adept at videoconferencing looonnnnngggg before COVID. \n\nSome of us tried to tell our new high-flyer manager that almost none of us were in the same city as him, and to be there on such short notice would mean travel expenses, meal allowances, overtime etc. He didn\u2019t seem to care, and told us in no uncertain terms to \u201cjust be at head office tomorrow at 8am\u201d before abruptly hanging up. \n\nNow, I should explain something. I\u2019m one of a handful of union delegates in our department. I know our award back to front, specifically the sections dealing with travel, allowances, and overtime. So I engaged malicious compliance mode, if Steve wanted us there fine, but it\u2019ll cost him.\n\nSo I quickly went about emailing my team what Steve had done by requiring us to be in the Head office at 8am and what to do. \n\nBecause we\u2019d have to travel outside our normal work hours, our work day clock started ticking the moment we left our homes and only stopped once we got home.\n\nSome of our team travelled overnight, they were entitled to overtime to travel, a dinner allowance, and accommodation for the night, and the same returning. As someone travelling in the morning before 7am, I was entitled to a breakfast allowance, lunch allowance, and if I got home after 9pm, a dinner allowance also.  \n\nSo, I left my house at 5am to catch the only train that would get me there in time. The train was running slightly behind, but I made it in time. So my first 3 hours of my work day down and I\u2019d done no work. \n\nAfter a brief period of us introducing ourselves to Steve, he proceeded to spend the next 4 hours telling us about all of the things he did at the bank, how he made so much money for them, where they\u2019d sent him as a holiday bonus, how we\u2019re all stuck in the past in the public service, the work he\u2019d seen wasn\u2019t up-to \u201cprivate sector standards\u201d etc. He had all the cocksureness of a finance bro who had always failed upwards because others had picked up his slack. \n\nBy 3pm my entire team were into overtime pay territory, and Steve was just warming up with his non-charm offensive. Another 3 hours go by with Steve verbally patting himself on his back, deeply in love hearing his own voice, but all I hear is \u2018cha-ching cha-ching\u2019.\n\nSteve decided that 5pm was a good time to finish up. He stopped mid sentence, looked at his watch, and unceremoniously said \u201cthat\u2019s all for today. Go home now\u201d and walked out. \n\nAfter I and a few other gave a few awkward shrugs to each other, we all packed up and started to make our seperate ways home after doing no work all day. \n\nI, myself got to the train station pretty quickly, and saw a train was leaving soon that would get me home around 8pm\u2026 or I could catch the all stations train and get home closer to 9:30pm. You know what? No matter how fast I could run, I just couldn\u2019t catch that earlier train, damn I\u2019d just have to catch that all stations train and be on the clock for another hour and a half, plus have my dinner paid for. Such rotten luck! ;)\n\nI submitted my claims the next day, 4 and half hours at double rate, my train tickets, my taxi fares to and from the train station, my breakfast, lunch, and dinner allowances. For me alone it was close to a $500 expense claim. The rest of my team followed suit, and ensured they claimed everything too. \n\nSteve tried to fight us on approval for the claims, but quickly learned that unlike in the world of banking, most public servants are union, and we\u2019d raise living hell if he denied our award guaranteed allowances. \n\nHis all day Steve-fest symposium, blew a good $6000 hole in his budget. Needless to say, while Steve was our manager, he never required us to attend an in-person meeting again \u2014 videoconferencing was just fine. \n\nHe only lasted 6 months before \u201cleaving for new opportunities\u201d\u2026 he just went back to his old job at the bank. Guess he was the one who couldn\u2019t keep up.",

            "Was Steve from out of state by any chance? If he wasn't, that's even worse because he should have known.\n\nI had one of these once, a new manager who I met for the first time during an in-person sexual harassment meeting that was being conducted by HR. When the meeting was over, she was telling everyone to clock out and saying we got paid for an hour and fifteen minutes for that meeting. I said to her, \"I know you're from \\[other state\\] where the labor laws are different, so I just wanted to make sure that you knew. In this state, if someone is scheduled, you have to pay them for a minimum of 2 hours.\" She said, \"Oh, I'm not sure, let me ask.\" Then she called over the HR guy who had been conducting the meeting and told him I had a question. I said, \"no, I don't have a question. I'm not asking you, I'm telling you, this is the law in this state.\" HR guy came over and told her that he didn't know if I was right or not, because he also was from out of state. I told her that she could look it up if she didn't believe me, but please look it up. I was just trying to help her, because we don't need a class action suit from employees who would rightfully be claiming wage theft, all because she wasn't taking time to learn the ropes before she jumped in.",

Between the US office, handling North America and us in the UK, handling everything else, we were losing $2 million a month.  Every second Monday, our VP would fly to NY on Concorde for a meeting and fly back via Concorde on the same day.  Each flight was $4000. The meeting was to explain to the big bank parent why we were losing so much of their money.  I once suggested to VP Finance that the VP could instead use the newly installed videoconferencing suite and he looked at me as if I had shit on his shoes.",

            "Steve's biggest mistake was not understanding the climate of your department, and prejudging everyone as knowing nothing.  Arrogance is the reason some leaders aren't adaptable.

            "Heh, I remember when the company I was working for hired a new project manager and he was given a project they had just landed. He called like 15 people together and explained that in his entire career, he had never over-spent a project budget. He knows that's a common problem here, so he just wants everyone to know they will NOT overrun their budget. The people working on this project are going to show everyone it can be done. \n\nWell, his project happened to be with our most difficult customer.  And to my knowledge they had never made any money with that customer's projects, but they would make it up later on spare parts and extra work so it wasn't a big deal  - but at the project level every one was a loser with that customer. \n\nShort version, 18 months later and the project has spent all the money and still has 3 months to go - the most difficult months because that's when the customer has to install all the equipment. And the customer is all union. And the customer's subcontractors are all union.  And they are extremely talented in making you pay extra for every little glitch. \n\nLet's say one site is to be installed on the weekend. Should take 38 hours - leaving a few hours buffer for any problems because whether you're done or not, you must have all your crap cleaned up and everything running by 5 AM Monday. All three shifts will be fully staffed to grind through the work.  The customer and their contractors work at a snail's pace. So we have to ask them to work overtime and overlap with another shift. Time and a half for overtime and double time if it's on Sunday like it often is. Oh, and they broke a couple of things that we can't replace until next weekend. So everyone has to come back again to finish up. That $75,000 part of the work is now costing $120,000. They have to pay for the $500 in parts they broke, but made another $8,000 in overtime.\n\nSo Mr. Project Manager had to eat crow about never losing money on a project as the customer schooled him big-time.  He was warned but his ego made him double down on his insistence we would not lose money.",

New supervisor first day said we were starting things too early, so everything we cleaned and put away he pulled back out so we could continue to use it. We didn't go home that night until 1:30 am. Next day he came in and apologized, told us to close up as we normally did and he'd be quiet and just learn how we did it instead of trying to butt in and tell us what to do. Told me when I asked what happened that he had learned a good lesson. \"I told our store manager I was sorry because I messed up so bad.\" Yep, but good manager, just needed the lesson that all stores are not the same.",

For weeks they had been prepping for a meeting of powerful executives to discuss the safety of Google\u2019s products. The deck was done. But that afternoon Mr. Walker told his team the agenda had changed, and they would have to spend the next few days preparing new slides and graphs. At the Googleplex, famed for its free food, massages, fitness classes and laundry services, Mr. Pichai was also playing with ChatGPT. Its wonders did not wow him. Google had been developing its own A.I. technology that did many of the same things. Mr. Pichai was focused on ChatGPT\u2019s flaws \u2014 that it got stuff wrong, that sometimes it turned into a biased pig. What amazed him was that OpenAI had gone ahead and released it anyway, and that consumers loved it. If OpenAI could do that, why couldn\u2019t Google?\n\nElon Musk, the billionaire who co-founded OpenAI but had left the lab in a huff, vowed to create his own A.I. company. He called it X.AI and added it to his already full plate. \u201cSpeed is even more important than ever,\u201d Sam Schillace, a top executive, wrote Microsoft employees. It would be, he added, an \u201cabsolutely fatal error in this moment to worry about things that can be fixed later.\u201d \n\nSeparately, the San Francisco-based company announced plans for its initial public offering Wednesday. In documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Reddit said it reported net income of $18.5 million \u2014 its first profit in two years \u2014 in the October-December quarter on revenue of $249.8 million. The company said it aims to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol RDDT. \n\nApparently many shoppers are not happy with their local Safeway, if questions and comments posted Sunday on a Reddit forum are any indication.\n\nThe questions in the AMA (Ask Me Anything) were fielded by self-described mid-level retail manager at one of the supermarket chain's Bay Area stores. The employee only identified himself by his Reddit handle, \"MaliciousHippie\".\n\nThe manager went on to cover a potpourri of topics, ranging from why express lane checkers won't challenge shoppers who exceed item limits to a little-known store policy allowing customers to sample items without buying them.",

We recieved some documents about the processes and stuff for our job as we needed to understand what we would test. It was some goverment stuff but it was pretty straigh forward so mostly no problem to understand. We also did all this from our homes and were not forced to go to the office at that time (after that period it was 3 days per work week in office). After first week our manager called us to the office on monday morning from 8:00 (am). So we went as it is not much problem in my country (for me it was around 1 hour via bus) but one colleague is from another country so for him it was more time consuming. We get to the office and the manager commes to the room. Sits down and as us if we understand everything from the documents and if we have some questions. We all understand everything and no one has a question. Then he says ok and that we can continue to learn the processes from the documents (so basically what we did until now from home). That was all what we did at that day and after work we went home.   \n\n\nThe weirdest thing is that then he was the managers for the testing team but we found out he was the manager of the whole project but was fired (for incompetence i guess) and then was hired by a company that worked on that project as partner (or something like that).",

The small company I work for uses a call-logging software that plans my trips to customers. A typical logged call would look like this: Called X customer > time spent in call> call notes. \n\nAbout a year ago the owner of the company asked me to create a customer called \u201coffice work\u201d to ping on the software to let him know I was in my office and not out seeing customers. In the call notes I would write a short general description on what I did in my time in office. \n\nA month ago the owner decided his fresh out of college 22 year old son was fit to be the manager of all salespersons. His son has commenced to micromanage my daily call reports to the fullest extent. He has to write a report to his father what each salesperson does every day. I get texts or emails almost daily asking what \u201cexact times\u201d I did what in my office or on the road. This culminated to the owners son demanding I log each individual task such as driving to a customer, working on a spreadsheet, or even warming up my vehicle. \n\nThe example he gave me: 7:30AM-7:49AM checked and responded to email, 7:52AM-8:00AM warmed up truck. Etc. Each entry takes about a minute to create and log. \n\nHe wanted to know what I was doing every minute of the entire workday. \n\nFine. I can play ball. \n\nFor the past week and a half I have been scrutinizing every single second of the day to ludicrous extent. I timed five minutes and counted the number of breaths I took to get an average amount of breathing per minute. About 18 breaths per minute. Better log that. \n\nI began timing my bathroom breaks and logging it. My fastest bladder draining is 48 seconds including washing hands!\n\nI timed how long it took to fill up my water and logged it, 29 seconds from start to back at my desk. \n\nI timed how long to tie my boots and logged that, 4 seconds each boot. \n\nSitting at a stoplight? Logged. \n\nHe now knows I can knock on a customers door 10 times in 3 seconds. \n\nFor about a week I logged everything I did every waking moment of the workday including the bites of my salad for lunch. Hell I even got the other salespersons to join in the malicious compliance. He was inundated in hundreds of reports each day he had to comb through. \n\nToday he sent an email to the sales force that we are no longer required to give specific times for tasks but rather a general description would suffice. Just like it was before he took over. \n\nTL;DR- Bossman\u2019s son micromanaged so I nano-managed to get back to being macro-managed.",

That was considered fully utilized. I was over 120% for six months. That\u2019s because I was the only person on our largest project.  My boss called and wanted me to start logging my non-billable time to a high degree of notation and to come into the office. They would no longer be paying for my home internet. \n\nSo in addition to billing 60 hours a week, he wanted me to drive into the \u201coffice\u201d which was one rented office (single desk) shared by four sales people already.\n\nSo I said, \u201cNo problem. But I work 8 am to 5 pm. I\u2019ll come into the office, where I will have my work computer setup, log my time. I will then head to the customer site where I will work until 3. Then I will head back to the office where I will log my work and leave at five.\u201d  Doing quick math I would drop from 120% to about 50-60% billable.  He babbled for a few minutes and I simply hung up. \n\nI was pissed. The next closest person on my team was 40% billable and several were sub 20%. I had asked multiple times for some help and not received more than a day or two. So I had given up asking for help and asked to just be left alone. Now that didnt work. I also hate useless and arbitrary rules, and thus would have changed my day to useless and arbitrary that hurt both me and my customer. \n\nSo there I was, steaming about the crappy company I worked for, and my terrible boss and his shortsightedness, when my phone rang. He was calling me back. \n\nI answered the phone, and he started right in. \n\n\u201cHang on Boss,\u201d I said, \u201cI agreed to everything you asked.
