        "selftext": "My Father worked for a Forbes 500 company since the 70s.  Moved up the ranks as a software engineer and management, has patents for the company that saved it millions of dollars.  He's almost to pension age and suddenly HR starts making his life miserable.  He noticed this trend was happening to some of his coworkers when they were getting close to age 60 as well.\n\nHR Lady calls him into the office and says that he was not punching in and out at the correct time.    My Father, an engineer, is very very detail oriented.  He knew that these were false accusations and asked HR to prove it.  They came back a week later and couldn't prove it.  And he said,  \"Of course you can't.  I have been driving the corporate carpool bus from \\[A major city 40 miles away from the company\\] for the last 15 years.  I always have 16 witnesses on my clock in time and I haven't been late in 15 years.\"\n\nHR Lady came back a week later and they said that they were going to fire him for letting people into the building without badging.  He asked to see when and where he was letting someone into the building without badging.  They showed that he held the door for his best friend who had also been working there since the 70s who had his foot cut off after having type 2 diabetes. He was in a wheelchair.\n\nPrior to this my dad took the chief of security out for lunch and told him about how this company wanted him to leave before he got his pension so he got some footage of his own.  My dad said, \"That is very interesting.  You are going to fire me for holding the door for my best friend of 35 years after his foot was amputated and he was in a wheelchair?  Fine then I hope you fire the CEO and yourself as well!!!\"  He then proceeded to show footage of the HR lady holding the door for his friend and the CEO holding the door for his friend.\n\nMy Father ended up staying there until he got his pension.\n\nEdit:  I don't know his finances and he probably wouldn't have lost the whole pension but there was a definite financial difference from being fired prior to reaching age 60 and making it to age 60.\n\nEdit 2:  So this blew up so much that my brother who didn't know I was on Reddit texted me and said \"You are reddit famous.  That's a story about Dad!  I knew this was you.\"  Also some of you are wondering why a Software Engineer would have to clock in and out, well he didn't.    I meant to use the word badge in and out of the building, they went that far to talk with security to see his badge timestamps.  There are more things that led to this getting bad and I didn't want to write pages and pages but it definitely escalated to this point.  Lastly for those of you that have been saying that my dad must have worked there as a child, this whole thing happened roughly 9 years ago.  My father is 68 right now.  If you want to know what company it was: this sentence is the most general hint I can give you but it may drive people from that company to be mad at me.  \n\n\nFinal Update:  Dad quit that job a while ago and made his own company in his retirement.  He has used his own money to patent a new invention that desalinates seawater and provides clean solar energy.  He has patents for this in America, India, and China and is looking for some capital to provide clean water and power to 3rd world countries.  If interested in helping him build his first power plant please send me a message.  \n",

To be fair, when you get caught trying to fire a dude for refusing to let you get away with manslaughter (at least how we see it), then it gets complicated. The boss didn't literally murder someone but he forced employees into an unsafe situation and more than one employee died as a direct result of it... And my dad told investigators that the boss threatened to fire them if they didn't go through with the unsafe situation. Then dad got hurt on the job (doing everything safe/right , but the bucket he was in got pushed hard by the wind and he ended up with a hook stuck in his elbow). Boss failed to fire him there because it was again an issue of boss saying he'd fire people if nobody got in the bucket and finished the job. Boss then tried to fire my dad for workers comp fraud... But dad's doctor, the employer's doctor, and an independent doctor all agreed that yea my dad was actually wounded and needed to heal. At this point, the boss is basically not allowed to say anything to the employees under him. Can't threaten to fire/demerit/writeup, can't actually punish people, and basically just sits on his fat ass yelling at people all day and taking up money. \n\nRight now my dad is recovering from a hand surgery (repetitive stress injury due to his job) and the boss is, you guessed it, accusing him of insurance fraud AGAIN. \n\nIf he was forced to quit now he'd be getting like $500 less per month in pension vs if he finishes out when he's 60.",

The policy was you had to make a purchase to get the bathroom code, but by the way he was doing the potty dance, it was pretty apparent this guy needed to go. Obviously, either he or his wife will pay for the four sandwiches I've already started.\n\nThe next day, my boss sits me down and lectures me about how the code is on the receipt for a reason. She watched the tape and see me give the man the code and tells me, \"I don't care who it's for. Whether it's your friend, family, whatever, you name it, you do NOT give it the code under any circumstances.\"\n\nLater on that night, I was working by myself when some guy in a trench coat and greasy long hair came in the side door and said, \"Hey man, somebody got seriously f**** up outside.\" A long line of customers waited for me while I subtly grabbed the bread knife (sharp af) and went around to check. It wasn't the best part of town, so you never know with people.\n\nAnyways, as trenchcoat man stated, someone was seriously f**** up outside. His face was all bloody and he was just a mess. I called 911 and went back to making sandwiches. \n\nSometime later, a few cop cars and an ambulance showed up. They were doing their business outside and then one of the officers comes in and asks for the bathroom code. Like six hours earlier, my boss told me not to give it \"under any circumstances\" without a purchase. \n\nI laughed a little and told him what I told all the other customers, \"I'm sorry, you have to make a purchase first. You can get a cookie which is $0.?? and then it'll be on the receipt.\" He didn't realize the laugh was really at myself and how awkward of a situation he unknowingly put me in, nor did I have a chance to explain it before the laugh and the rejection of the bathroom code caused the cop to become straight up furious. \n\nHe gives me three warnings to give him the code. Each time I tell him I'm not going to give it to him and the customers are on my side telling him I'm just doing my job. After his third warning, he shook his head and muttered \"I can't believe you're interfering with an ongoing investigation,\" and he uses the walkie on his shoulder to get some information. \n\nAbout five minutes later, one of the cops handed me a phone. I answered and my manager said, \"Are you f****ing serious???\" Long story short, the cop got the bathroom code and a free bag of chips.",

Because the cut off is for the health of the dogs I need you to stand at the back of the line and not let any more people in\u201d\n\nSo not the best job but makes sense.

        "selftext": "This happened about 4 years ago, when I got a summer job at my university. The job was working for professors that I had worked with before, and they asked me last-minute to teach a summer workshop to 9th and 10th graders.\n\nSo with less than 2 weeks before the camp starts I have a bunch of paperwork to do first, including \"clearances\" that say I can work with kids. One of these is an official FBI check for which they need my fingerprints. Well, I needed to do the physical fingerprinting right away in order to get the result in time - luckily I was able to book a fingerprinting appointment for that Friday (booked 24 hours in advance, as required) which would be just barely enough time to get the result.\n\nThat Friday I catch the subway to campus and it's atrociously slow (I'll admit I should have planned for this - the subway here is always behind). Anyway, I end up slightly late getting to campus so I literally run to the police station, and enter the front room at EXACLTY 5 minutes after my appointment time. I know this because, as I stepped through the door, I felt my phone buzz with what turned out to be a \"Your appointment has been cancelled\" email.\n\nI speak to the security/cop behind bulletproof glass inside and I learn the appt was cancelled after he checks my confirmation number. Apparently the they are automatically cancelled if you're not checked in within 5 minutes. Obviously this is outrageous, but I'm usually a patient guy: I ask if I can book a new appointment. That's no good since it would have to be Monday or later.\n\nSo I grab a coffee from across the street and return to sit inside the police station, to try and solve this with some Googling while I slip into a more and more frantic state of frustration. I can't find anywhere in the city that can fingerprint me before Monday.\n\nBut here's what really pushed me over the edge. While I'm sitting there, at this point 30 minutes past my appointment time, someone else comes in for fingerprints. She shows up 5 minutes early. They take her in immediately, and she's out BEFORE her appointment was even scheduled to begin. The entire thing took her about 2 minutes. I point out to the cop behind the glass (as politely as I can) that CLEARLY someone could see me RIGHT NOW because her appointment is already over. Why can't I have the current slot? But, the cop insists that since my appointment was cancelled, my registration info was \"no longer in the system\" and I can't be seen today.\n\nThat's when the idea comes to me and I confirm with him that showing up early is not a problem, because they would have my appt and registration info in the system. You see where I'm going with this.\n\nSo I quietly sit back down and take out my phone. About 10 minutes later, I calmly approach him again and say \"Hello, I have a new appointment to be fingerprinted. I'm about 72 hours early.\"\n\nI have never seen such an exasperated sigh in my life. But he checked my new confirmation number and everything was in order. Within 10 minutes, I was walking back out after getting fingerprinted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL:DR Appointment was automatically cancelled because I was 5 minutes late. I can't go in now because my registration info is not \"in the system\". But I can make an appointment for Monday, and show up 72 hours early.",

It is not so.\n\nThe 5 minute automatic cancellation might, on the surface, seem too harsh, after all, shit happens.\n\nBut \"shit happens\" to everyone, every day.  If each appointment takes approximately 5 total minutes, there are 480 appointments available in a day 60*8/5 and if you show up late to one, accommodating you potentially pushes back everyone else by 5 minutes or at least some volume of time.  \n\nIs that fair to them, to make them ALL wait for one person's issues?

Patients are endlessly complaining that they have to wait a few minutes after their appointments are scheduled to see the doctor. You go in at on time at 1PM for your appointment and are annoyed, both visibly and vocally about not seeing the doctor until 1:25.\n\nBut once they get into the room, they are perfectly fine with talking the doctors ear off about issues and problems they did not originally come to see the doctor about, further delaying all other appointments for the day.  They do not see, nor care that the allotted time they have is cutting into someone else's and making them wait after their scheduled appointment.\n\nThey are also sometimes appalled and offended that they are asked to come early. But inevitably forms that need to be filled out take time and for some, a lot of time, a lot of extra time.  All that time has to come from somewhere and affect someone, so schedules and requests are made to help make it better for everyone, not just you.\n\nBut your time is always more important than someone else's, obviously.\n\nWe are a very self centered and oblivious to others species.",

There is one project in particular that includes a really demanding team from a federal government department.   \n\n\nI recently returned back to work from maternity leave. I work in my office three days a week; on those days, I have to pump breastmilk at regular intervals for my baby. Luckily, I have my own private office and can usually just keep on working (emails, reports, etc) while I pump. I have a hands-free, wearable pump which is convenient....but still definitely obvious if I am wearing it (it pokes out about my shirt and is not exactly silent).   \n\n\nRecently we have a Zoom call scheduled during one of the times I needed to pump. Instead of missing the meeting, I figured I would just keep my camera off so I could wear my pump and still participate and listen. Heck, I was even IN my office and not working from home; I felt like I was being a pretty committed employee!   \n\n\nMeeting starts, a few people have their cameras off. The Lead makes the announcement: \"I just want to remind everyone that our expectation is that you will have your cameras on because this is not a virtual meeting, it is a simulated in person meeting\" (....whatever that means)   \n\n\nI sent a quick private message to explain I was paying attention, but pumping; no response to me, just instead, a, \"Again, the expectation is that all cameras will be on.\"   \n\n\nSo fine. I turn my camera on for this meeting of about 20 people, The camera isn't aimed at my chest but certainly the top of my pump is CLEARLY visible. I unmuted myself, so you could also clearly HEAR the pump, and just said, \"Thank you for your patience, I was adjusting my breast pump.\"   \n\n\nThe meeting continued awkwardly, with several other team managers letting me know privately it was fine to turn my camera off, but at that point, there really was no point in turning it off. \n\nAt the most recent meeting, the announcement was, \"Please turn on your cameras if you are comfortable doing so.\"",

The fact you were working during your pump break could also have gotten someone somewhere in trouble. \n\nAdded to that, you are required to be given a private space to pump. By forcing you to turn on your camera they are violating that privacy.\n\nAnd this was all done by a federal government department\u2026.

Tried to explain that he was changing, and for what reason. \n\nHis manager, who is apparently known for a short temper, basically said camera on NOW or its a write up\". \n\nSo, my buddy walked over and turned the camera on, still in boxer briefs, with a vague wet spot near the crotch from said spit up. Suddenly the manager went from \"camera on\" to \"don't show yourself in such undress!\" \n\nManager threatened to write him up for sexual harassment. So my buddy sent an email to HR. Manager was written up for demanding an employee turn camera on, despite clear statement that said employee wasn't in a proper state of dress.",

I've actually been in a meeting while trekking in the mountains and except for a quick showing of the views on request my camera was off all of the meeting. \n\nWhere I work we usually leave the cameras off, especially in large meetings.",

(Prior to the conference i had pumped and frozen enough milk to last through my attendance at the conference). So while we were away, I was pumping and dumping, to keep my supply up. \n\nAll went well until the return flight home. I had explained the situation to the airline clerk at check in, asking if I could use the crew shower to pump (it's a nearly 12 hour flight from US to NZ). Not only did she not enable access to the crew shower, she changed my seat allocation. Instead of sitting with my fellow lab mates, I got stuck in the middle of a group of (male) American football players. Several rows before and behind me were huge sports guys and I was sitting between two huge sports guys. I'm pretty sure the clerk was laughing her arse off.\n\nSo I just said \"excuse me\" to my fellow travelers, covered myself with the supplied blanket, and deployed the automatic breast pump. Talk about an awkward 12hr flight.\n\nJust fyi on breast pumps, some are manual which require some hand action to extract the milk (usually into bottles), while others are battery operated; you basically stick the device on your boob and it automatically pumps out the milk into plastic bags. A downside is that they are really noisy, do you can't really be subtle about it.

If someone genuinely requires micromanagement to be productive, then it's either a skill or will issue.  So you either need to train them properly or find a way to motivate them.

        "selftext": "Old story, but in 2007 I was involved in a traffic accident on the I-95-I-695 ramp in Baltimore.  Traffic went from the speed limit (55mph) to a dead stop around the curve of the exit in a space of 500 feet, AND it had just started raining.  I and my Honda Accord managed to stop literal inches from the person in front of me's bumper.  I had enough time to have half a sigh of relief before I was rear ended so hard that the can of tea in my waist-level console cupholder wound up splattered all over the the windshield.\n\nI get out of the car and the person who hit me is literally crying blood.  She's driving a Saturn that is at least a decade old and the ancient airbag broke her nose and blacked both of her eyes.  She's also crying for real, because this is her only transportation.  I go \"Fuck,\" grab an umbrella out of my now weirdly shaped backseat, and hold it over her while she sobs, explains her brakes had been locking up lately and she was literally on her way to the mechanic's, and tries to text her boyfriend to pick her up.  She's crying so hard that she drops her phone twice.\n\nAnd then a cop shows up.\n\nBaltimore cops are bastards, so he writes this girl a ticket about \"failure to control speed to avoid an accident\" and \"reckless endangerment\" and half a dozen other bullshit things to where the ticket would literally cost more than a new car and she might get her license revoked and/or jail time.  She's hysterical.  I talk to her, reassure her it's not her fault, and manage to swap insurance info.\n\nFast forward two months.  I had mild whiplash, but I'm healed up and mostly good regarding the accident.  Have a new car and everything.  I get a notice in the mail that I am requested to be a witness for this poor girl's trial for her ticket - don't have to show, but it'd be nice.  \n\nFuck if I'm gonna let that cop roast her - I was asked, to I'm taking a day off work to show up.\n\nI turn up in court dressed in my civil servant best (was working for the state government at the time, so however staid you imagine, multiply it by three), and even toss on some makeup to impress the judge.  I wait three hours for her hearing, because hell if I'm gonna accidentally be late.  The cop goes first, making up a bunch of bullshit about how recklessly she was driving to have hit me in an accident he was probably ten miles away from witnessing from his response time.\n\nThen the judge calls me, and I stand up.  Cop looks this weird combo of surprisedpikachu.jpg and pissed - like he didn't expect me to show.  Poor girl was already crying and starts crying more.\n\nSo I get to the stand, get sworn in, and tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.\n\nSo I day that we were going exactly the speed limit - I know, because I checked my speedometer in surprise that there wasn't more traffic.  That she was following a proper distance behind me, because I'd checked my rear view mirror and she was a ways off.  That it had just started raining after a dry week, so the road was greasy as fuck and I knew that because I'd almost slid into the car in front of me, only saved by my car's ABS.  That her wheels had locked because I'd heard the screech and seen the skidmarks, and that she definitely wasn't at fault because she was on her way to get her car's old-ass ABS fixed.  And I mention that the cop didn't show up until twenty minutes later.\n\nI know this sounds like an \"and everyone clapped!\" moment, but the judge did thank me for doing my civic duty and turning up.  And I got a quick hug from the poor girl after the judge dismissed her charges.\n\nAnyway, Baltimore cops are bastards and if you can turn up in court to fight a traffic ticket (even someone else's), you should do so.",

            "A couple of things to point out, everything you said has no bearing on her guilt. The speed limit is a maximum limit, however, the police can give a speeding ticket for driving at or even below the posted speed limit if there are bad conditions. You telling the court it had just started to rain and the roads were slick as well as her brakes were not working correctly could be used to justify that she was driving recklessly.\n\nBut the worst part is, your testimony could have kept the case from being thrown out completely. Years ago I was in an accident in Maryland (PG county specifically). I was heading to school on a day I had an exam. My mind must have been wandering and somehow I was at an intersection with a red light and I wasn't prepared to stop. Cars began entering the intersection, and to avoid broadsiding those cars, I swerved to miss them.\n\nWhen the cop showed up, I got two tickets, one for running a red light, and one for failure to keep right of center. I wanted to contest the second one as I was avoiding broadsiding a car (I did end up hitting a car that was on the other side of the intersection though). I just wanted to explain to the court and hopefully get that second ticket thrown out.\n\nIn court, the cop presented his case and started with something like \"When I arrived...\" The judge asked if he had seen the accident, and the cop said \"no\". So the judge turned to me and told me not to say anything. He then moved to dismiss the charges on my behalf. Basically, since the cop didn't witness the accident and there were no other witnesses present, the charges could not stick.",

            ">started raining. \n\n>failure to control speed to avoid an accident\n\n>we were going exactly the speed limit\n\nSo the cop was *right* on that count, then. The speed limit is intended as the *maximum* speed of a roadway, in ideal conditions. You're supposed to compensate for road conditions and lower your speed accordingly. Going as fast as you legally can in rainy weather into a hard curve? Well, it's no wonder there was an accident. \n\nIt's also no wonder you came within inches of rear ending the car in front of *you*, too, you were both going too fast.

Being under the speed limit is irrelevant if you were driving too fast for the conditions. \n\nBarring exceptional circumstances such as someone jumping in your lane and hitting the brakes, or someone brake-checking you to deliberately cause a collision, if you hit the back of another car you are at fault...end of story.   \nSometimes circumstances may mean you are not guilty of an offence...such as sudden unexpected brake failure...but you are still at fault and liable for damages.\n\nFrom the sound of this, she was knowingly driving a dangerous vehicle, and not taking the proper care due to that fact. She definitely should have had a couple of tickets, although it sounds like the cop went overboard.",

However, I'm surprised you're so willing to stand up for another driver who clearly did not maintain their car to a high enough mechanical standard which, if in proper condition, would have avoided the collision and resulting damage to both cars and all the personal injuries. You are both lucky noone died to due negligence in vehicle maintenance. I also feel that you are too willing to accept a sob story... Like honestly it's hard to believe the other drive was literally on their way to a mechanical appointment to fix the exact issue.\n\nI'd also like to point out having ABS wouldn't have necessarily reduced the stopping distance. ABS helps with stability and directional control of the car under breaking.  All drivers in your accident suffered from driving too fast for the conditions, following too closely and having delayed reaction times.\n\nI get you are trying to be a good human here and feeling compassionate about another person's situation, but that is besides the point. \n\nYour calling out the Baltimore Police seems to be a bit agressive and unwarranted. The cop isn't out to ruin Ives as you are suggesting \n\nYou have your own personal bias against the police, much like your own assesment of the accident. You got lucky you didn't rear end the car infront of you to begin with otherwise you'd be at fault, regardless if you say it was raining or your own claim of going the speed limit. \n\nBased on the accident situation and scene you described, what happened to the car infront of you? You said you stopped inches behind it, yet you talk about your car being destroyed in the rear. How did you not end up being in at least a 3 car pile up?

I sped up a bit to make sure there wasn't enough room between me and the car in front of me for him to get in front of me (but plenty of space behind me).

Despite steady efforts, both the police and the woman's insurance company refused to budge, and I ended up being saddled with the debt, which included a hefty surcharge on account of the first response workers deciding to strap me down when they learned I'd apparently flipped in the air.\n\nI'm lucky enough for that to have been my only real experience with cops, 'cuz I know a lot of stuff way worse can happen, but my credit score is still horrible because this was before I even had a credit card.",

        "selftext": "Many years ago, I worked at a car dealership. The attached service garage was small and I was the only licensed mechanic. \n\nI would occasionally have issues with male customers\u2014 they would second guess my diagnoses, watch me while I worked on their cars from the bay door, double check my work in the parking lot, etc. \n\nI didn\u2019t deal with customers directly and would often get my apprentice to pull cars in and out of the shop for me. \n\nThis morning in particular, we were busy. The lot jockey and apprentice were occupied helping wash cars for delivery and driving to a customer\u2019s house. \n\nThe service advisor left a work order and keys at the parts counter, and I went out the front through service to get the car. It was in for a service campaign, which was an update done with a scan tool. It takes about 10 minutes. \n\nThe customer was planning on waiting and was sitting in service. When he saw me with his keys in my hand, he immediately stood up, alarmed. I was hustling so I walked right by him and out the door. I missed the following conversation, according to the service advisor (also female):\n\nCustomer: \u201cWho is that chick? Is she going to be working on my car? I don\u2019t want her working on my car.\u201d\n\nAdvisor: \u201cThe other tech is out at the moment, so it\u2019s going to be quite a wait until someone else can look at your car.\u201d\n\nC: \u201cThat\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll wait for a guy. I don\u2019t want that chick touching my car.\u201d\n\nA, politely: \u201cUnderstood.\u201d\n\nThe advisor comes to let me know, and I pull the car out and put the work order and keys back on the counter, nonplussed. \n\nHalf an hour passes. The apprentice is still away, and I am happily working on something else, bringing other cars in and out. \n\nThe customer is now watching each and every person who comes through the door. \n\nThe high school co-op student comes in to get something signed. The customer\u2019s keys are still sitting on the desk. It\u2019s been about an hour now. \n\nC: \u201cHey\u2014 why hasn\u2019t my car gone in yet? Can\u2019t you get this guy to do it?\u201d\n\nA: \u201cNo, sorry. He\u2019s just a co-op student so he is not allowed to drive the cars due to liability and insurance concerns.\u201d\n\nC: \u201cJust get someone else to bring the car in and he can do the work. This was supposed to take 10 minutes.\u201d\n\nA: \u201cSorry, sir. He\u2019s just a high school student doing his co-op; he\u2019s not approved to perform warranty work. Only licensed techs and apprentices can do the recall.\u201d\n\nThe car jockey returns. The advisor hands the car jockey a different set of keys, and he brings yet another car into the shop for me. The customer is becoming incensed. \n\nC: \u201cI\u2019ve been sitting here for over an hour and I\u2019ve watched 5 cars go in before mine. My appointment was for 8am, this is getting ridiculous,\u201d blah blah blah.\n\nAt this point he says that he literally doesn\u2019t care who does the recall, but that it has to be a guy. \n\nThe service advisor starts listing off the names of the men who work in the dealership, then saying why they can\u2019t perform the recall. \n\n\u201cWell there\u2019s Herman, but he\u2019s just the car jockey. He doesn\u2019t know how to work on cars. Then there\u2019s Jeet, but he\u2019s about 17. I wouldn\u2019t want him doing the recall, personally. I guess we could ask Mike\u2014 but Mike is the parts guy\u2014 he doesn\u2019t know how to use the scan tool. The detailers are men, but they know NOTHING about cars\u2026 \u201d\n\nThe customer is fuming at this point, and demands to talk to the service manager. \n\nThe manager comes out of his office, and guides the customer into the garage. He\u2019s pretty old school\u2026 lights up a cigarette standing at the end of my bay, and points at me. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my best technician. Those guys take orders from her. You can either wait for her to finish what she\u2019s working on, and then you can ask if she\u2019s still willing to do your work, or you can take your car somewhere else.\u201d\n\nThe guy was pretty shook up at this point and he took his car and left, two hours after he\u2019d first arrived. I don\u2019t think we ever saw him again, which was not much of a loss, all things considered. \n\nThat manager in particular ALWAYS stuck up for me and took my side. The service advisor has this very dead-pan sense of humour. She knew full well it would easily be an hour before the apprentice would return from his errand, and that no one else could do the recall. This was not the first sexist we had encountered. \n\nThanks for reading!\n\n\nEdit: Thank you for the comments of support, and shared experiences, and for the updoots and awards. \n\n",

So after driving for a meeting 400 km away and back I brought it to the garage. The mechanic listened to me describing the problem. First question out of his mouth:\n\n\"Do you know how to drive that car?\"\n\nAs I didn't want to die in a car accident and needed the problem resolved I didn't bite him. It was a close thing. I told him yes, I could see on his face that he thought I was just a *female* driver fumbling with a brand new car. \n\nI did get my revenge. From the hint I got he tried my car on the narrow street of the garage with a cement separator in the middle, and had the fright of his life when the car weaved and bounced when he braked hard and nearly put him in hospital. So they spent a lot of time trying to find the problem and finally put it on a hoist, put the exact same car on the next hoist, and compared the two. \n\nThe factory had made a mistake when they filled the tires, instead of 2 bars my tires were at 4 bars. I was driving on balloons. The mechanic admitted that I was 'lucky' to have survived such a long drive filled with crazy trucks with those tires.

When the story was on the local TV news, and people found out that he was one of only two that were honest, he was flooded with so much work that he had to hire another mechanic.  The news even went back to see how he was doing after the sting and he got even more customers.\n\nThe other mechanic who wasn't fined was an eighteen year old girl working for a big shop.  And after the story was on, she got tons of offers to work at other shops so she quit and went to a different shop.

When I told them I wanted to stay, they started staging incidents/messes around the house so they could yell at me for them and it all came to a head when they called a meeting with me two days ago. One of them had to hold the other back as she screamed at me that she hated me and I was not welcome in the building. They proceeded to tell me that I contributed nothing to the house and wasted their space and that they had gotten in with the landlady and convinced her to not renew my lease in June. \n\nI told them I\u2019d talk to the landlady and when they said they were the heads of the house I laughed and went on with my day. I spoke to the landlady and she acknowledged that they were out of hand and while she had given them the power to not renew my lease, she also said I could move out whenever and not pay for a single day I wasn\u2019t there. So, yesterday when my roommates both left to visit family (they are sisters), I immediately called everyone I knew and vacated the house of everything I owned. I took the curtains, the rugs, all the cat toys and even the cat tower that I had made with my mom. I took all of their things off my shelves and other furniture and stacked them in the middle of the now nearly empty living room. I snapped pictures of everything, handed the keys to the landlady and immediately fucked off.\n\nThey won\u2019t be back to the house until tomorrow. I\u2019ve blocked them on everything so I won\u2019t get any angry messages, but I\u2019m sure their faces will be priceless when they come home to a half-empty house with hundreds of dollars in storage and furniture gone. So much for me not contributing anything to the house, now I actually don\u2019t. They also have to find someone else to take up the lease till boyfriend can move in when June comes around or they have to pick up my rent.\n\nFeels pretty good.\n\nNOTE- I have updated this post, it is my [newest comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/zy9t6z/i_moved_out_and_took_everything/j2alkks/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)",

My lease specifically states: \u201cIf one tenant is not able to fulfill their portion of the rent, it will be up to the other tenants to make up the difference.\u201d I don\u2019t know if she will make an exception or not for them. She did tell me though that it will be THEIR responsibility to get someone to lease my room until boyfriend can move in in June. \n\n-The girls came back from visiting family today so it is certain that they have seen the empty house now. I haven\u2019t gotten any calls from any officers about stolen goods, so I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m in the clear. Considering that I haven\u2019t actually stolen anything, they would be filing a false report which is very illegal, according to my attorney. \n\nAnd the big one-\nMy boyfriend was pretty pissed by the whole situation (he heard the whole screaming meeting when they told me to leave as he was up in my room when it happened, and he has also observed the abusive texts and language they have sent and said to me) and confronted both of my roommates online about how they\u2019ve been acting. They immediately went to their dad and he had the cops called. I don\u2019t know all of the details and frankly I don\u2019t want to because I have them blocked, I want nothing to do with them, and I just want my life to go on, but yeah, my boyfriend pretty much had to go to the station and sign some papers saying he\u2019d leave them alone. I\u2019m pretty pissed at him for confronting them, but like, the cops? Come on. \n\nAnyways, I\u2019m couch-surfing until I can get a place.

            "I did the same thing back in college. One of the roommates told me I was her \"best friend\" and then went behind my back with the other roommate and called me horrible things. One night I heard them IM chatting and laughing...I just knew it was about me...a gut feeling. When they left together I checked her computer. They said they hated me and one said \" I wish I could piss on her\" the supposed BFF laughed in response. I had been going through a horrible depression and was really struggling and this hit me like a ton of bricks. I made plans to leave asap. A day later they were both in class and my parents came and got me. Took everything! Couch, tables, plates ...everything!! Left a nice note, \" piss on this\". Found out they ranted online about how I \" even took the shower curtains\"!!! Karma baby",

            "A \"friend\" of my mom's pleaded with her to let her rent an apartment and that she would have the first/last/cleaning deposit ready at the end of the month but she needed to move in before then. Since she was a \"friend\" my parents allowed her to move.  She never paid them a dime.  She actually flaunted the fact that it would take them at least 3 months for an eviction (it did) and on the day the police and a moving van showed up to unlock the door, she was not there.  I took pictures of each and every thing we moved and placed into storage.  All of the moving expenses and storage were paid by my parents.  She had the nerve to file a law suit for illegal eviction (nope - sheriff had personally delivered the notice and had her sign for it) and for damaging her furniture, etc. (nope - I had pictures of her sad shit). She told people she would be getting over $100,000 out of my parents by the time she was done with them (nope - it went to an arbitrator) because my parents were NOT willing to spend another penny on her/her bullshit.  She lost, but weirdly, the arbitrator actually asked my parents if there was any way that they could settle for some amount of money??  Like NO.  The other thing she did was to arrange for a moving company to come get her stuff out of the storage unit WE PAID for.  I arrived to let them in and mentioned that if she had not paid them for their service, she will not and they are never going to see a penny.  I could see the wheels turning in their heads and they called her and told her that she had to meet them at the storage unit or they would not move anything.  I left at that point.  No idea what else happened with her furniture.  Taking pictures with time stamps is the way to go.  No room for anyone to claim \"priceless oil painting\" when it is just a poster....",

            "I had a similar instance at one point in my life as well. One of my best friends convinced my wife(then girlfriend) to move in with him and his girlfriend. We\u2019d all be friends, hang out, have cheap rent, and everything will be great. We were all paying equal rent.\n\nThen we move in. These 2 are always taking the close parking spots when they get off early and every spot is available, while me and my wife get off late and have to park blocks away. They have the master bedroom/bathroom as well as another room for storage, while we have 1 tiny bedroom that all of our stuff doesn\u2019t fit in, and share a bathroom with all guests. That bathroom door also didn\u2019t lock properly and had multiple walk ins from random people. All of our food was getting eaten. Dishes constantly left dirty in the sink so we had no utensils to cook/eat with. Our liquor in the freezer was getting more and more ice in it, as they were drinking our booze and filling it with water so it looked like none was missing.\nEventually we got fed up and moved all of our stuff out while they were both at work. They both worked at the same place and had the same shift. Never talked to or heard from them again, but I can only imagine the feeling they had when they arrived home that day. Made me feel great.\n\nI\u2019m generally not the kind of person to do something like this, but the amount of disrespect we received from these people who convinced us to move in with them, when we already had a great place to live, was just too much",

            "I feel this. I had a toxic roommate situation back in '09. A friend and I got a place together, his gf started staying over, but he still wanted a 50/50 split of the bills. I only half-heartedly fought back on that, until he took it next-level by planning to give away my cat because \"she wouldn't stay out of his bedroom\" to which he or his gf couldn't bother to keep the door shut. I made all the arrangements with my parents to move in with them, gave notice at work by using unused vacation days, and loaded my stuff while he was at work. He went nuclear when he found out what I was doing. Tried to physically restrain me and force me to sign some \"roommate contract\" he'd cooked up in the event things went bad. I refused, told him that he'd lose some teeth if he didn't get out of my way, grabbed my cat, and left. I said I would be back to get my things from the storage unit we shared, after which I'd toss the key. Blocked him, but stayed cordial with his gf. Surprise, surprise, they're no longer together.",
            "This is glorious! I too have done a drop of the hat move out.

After a couple months of increasingly mean behavior, I told them that I would be moving out.  Since I originally found the house had all the utilities in my name, I told them they would need to get this taken care of by X date.\n\nThey laughed it off and said whatever.\n\nI had all the utilities transferred over to my new house, and wouldn\u2019t you know it, those clowns didn\u2019t follow up with any of them.

            "This happened to me in college. There were 4 of us in an apartment and I became the bad guy after a different roommate moved out because the other 2 decided she was the bad guy. \n\nAnyway, as things got worse during spring of our senior year, I mostly hung out with my bf at his place and only went to mine to shower, change, and occasionally sleep. The other 3 planned to keep the apartment the summer after we graduated and expected me to pay my portion even though I wasn\u2019t welcome to stay (not that I was planning to!). I confirmed with the landlord that my name was on the lease only until May and that I owed him nothing for the summer as the other 3 extended the lease separately. \n\nBecause I was never at the apartment, I decided to move all of my stuff out the day before graduation so that I could just leave with my parents immediately after the ceremony. I took everything that was mine: bed, dresser, all of my clothes, plus the tv, vcr and house phone (I\u2019m old), tv stand, sofa, coffee table, dishes, utensils, glassware, pots and pans, floor and table lamps, etc. Everything aside from my bed, dresser, and clothes either went to charity or to one of the fraternity houses down the street. \n\nMy roommates neglected to tell me that they were having a graduation party with their families and they were PISSED there was almost no furniture or dish/glassware left in the apartment for their party (let alone for the summer). I can still picture the looks on their faces. Makes me happy to this day.",

I guess he didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d be taking all of my belongings with me to my next place. He tried to fight with me over the dish soap- perhaps he thought fairies refilled it? Almost everything in that apartment belonged to me and a previous roommate, we actually went shopping in preparation for moving into a new place- this guy showed up with a bed and a tv and then made a liquor run and considered himself moved in. Went absolutely ballistic if anybody touched something he considered his, but saw no problem using all of our shit. He brought like one bowl and a fork and knife to the kitchen set-up, but still cooked elaborate meals using my stuff. I think I still have the picture I took of the list somewhere- it was sweet vindication to find, because he frequently called me useless and said that I didn\u2019t contribute anything to the household. While sitting on furniture that I sourced, eating off of my dishes, cleaning (or failing to) with my products, putting miles on my microwave, wearing out my shower curtain, scraping his dinner from my pot into my trash can. \n\nSo yeah, fuck you you fucking fuck, I totally did \u2018steal\u2019 enough milk from your FULL CARTON to make Kraft dinner.

Spouse and I had the only real furniture in the shared living room and had all the necessities in the kitchen. We packed up EVERYTHING into boxes while they were visiting the psycho girlfriend's family. Psycho girlfriend had decided she was moving in anyways after the visit and spouse and I said hard no. We paid majority of rent since we lived in the bigger bedroom and 5 people is too many in the lease (in her words she was jobless by choice, talked all the time about wanting to get a dog (not allowed per lease) and get engaged and have kids ASAP in their 2-3 month long relationship (major red flags, family members/roommates were all less than 22 at the time and first serious relationship, psycho gf that moved herself in was 27 and does have a masters degree in science)). \n\nSo spouse and I signed a lease at a new apartment for less than the rent we were paying (all around massive win find apartment really), waited until they left, packed up, and actually got to watch their reaction as they came home to everything boxed up except their tv and books on the floor, and only silverware in the kitchen. \n\nAbsolutely shocked and speechless, they literally didn't say a word for the whole first day. Next day the one tried to start a fight about furniture that one or two items should be left as they're new to living on their own and we don't need all the furniture. I explained I paid for the furniture, I keep the furniture, if they wanted to offer to buy something to talk to me like a normal person and not full volume screaming that I OWE them as an older sibling (no I do not owe my only $400 tv stand/shelf or $1500 couch).

            "My family sold our house and moved to a rental house in 1993. The plan was to rent until we decided where we wanted to live so we rented a storage space rather than moving everything we owned into the rental. \n \nOur marriage wasn\u2019t in good shape when we moved and ultimately my husband moved out in 1995 and we divorced in 1997. Everything in storage stayed in storage. \n\nHe remarried in 1997 and moved to a small apartment with his new wife and kept the storage space. Somehow along the way, everything in the storage space became \u201chis\u201d property. I was glad enough he was gone not to make a fuss about it. \n\nToday he is still renting the same storage space. According to my kids, it\u2019s packed from front to back, floor to ceiling. I know that when he moved from the place he rented while we were separated, he moved everything into a larger space. \n\nSo he\u2019s now been renting this storage space since 1993 to today. Yes that is 29 years. His wife won\u2019t allow him to bring anything from that space to their apartment. He periodically goes to the space and sorts through stuff, but he\u2019s made no real effort to get rid of anything. He has this misguided idea that he can make money from what\u2019s in there. I know he has about 40 boxes of paperbacks, none more recent than 1993 (most at least three to five years older than than). He has about 20 boxes of records, none in particularly good condition. He has about 15 boxes of comics - he thinks they will be big money. He has about 10 boxes of old boys books - think Hardy boys and the like. None in top condition. \n\nHe has artwork that we used to have in our house, including pieces that absolutely belonged to me. He has furniture that he got when he moved out along with household items like dishes and utensils. It\u2019s probably at least 75% junk at this point. \n\nBut he\u2019s been paying the monthly rent for 29 years!",

If they liked it well enough, then a real software engineering team would build the real product.  Occasionally, I would run the prototype for a few months while the customer evaluated if they wanted to buy the real project.\n\nNow these prototypes are not a lot of code, but they do run with a lot of data.  Even compressed, it can be a terabyte or more.  Having done this work for years, I've accumulated a small disk farm of past projects, which can be very useful when a customer asks for something just like we did last year, but with a small change or two.  The company resisted buying hard drives for this, but it saves me so much time, I ended up buying one or two a year myself until I accumulated about 10 of them.  Figure over $1000 worth of external drives.\n\nThen unexpectedly management changes, new management thinks they can replace old software guy with a cheaper new software grad and I am laid off, with two weeks to \"train\" my replacement.  (Yes, it's blatant age discrimination, but impossible to fight, so I just went for a graceful transition to my next job.)\n\nExcept, I have $1000 of personal disk drives with old customer data on them.  Company insists that no ex-employees may take any company data off premises and all files must be deleted.  I don't want to just leave the drives at the company, but they insist I must delete all data before taking them home.  So I offer:\n\n1.  They can buy them from me\n2.  I will eventually use them for something else, but I can leave the data on them in case someone needs it\n\nNot good enough.  New manager insists I must delete all data and all backups before I remove the drives.  Okay.  That's what I do.\n\nSix months later, I get a series of desperate phone calls.  New software grad has been unable to build any new prototypes.  Old customers are calling to get old prototypes updated, and new software grad has no idea how to do that.  Executive VP is calling to ask what would it take to bring me back to do my old job.\n\nSorry, I've got a new job now.  And even if I didn't, I cannot just modify the old prototype because *you insisted I delete all old copies of it.*   If I did want to modify it, I'd first have to re-create it from scratch. The code still exists in their source control, but the data is the heart of the prototypes.  And that old series of six month's apart data we collected is gone for good, no matter what.\n\nSorry, you screwed yourselves exactly like I told you would happen.  Hope whatever you saved by hiring a new grad to replace an actual experienced programmer was worth it.",

            "I had a similar experience while working as a contractor. I was brought on to work on an open source platform, a linux based custom CMS for call center agents at a large firm.\n\n6 months into the contract, they decide we have to integrate with a microsoft LDAP service. I've never touched the thing before, but I give it a try. They give me some scuffed 14GB VMware hard drive files to boot as the LDAP server instead of an actual integration, and I can't get these things to work. Of course we have no actual source control or documentation either. I try to talk to the guy who made them and he responds to a total of 2 emails over 2 weeks.\n\nAfter those two weeks I get a call that I'm being let go from the contract because \"it's not a good sign that I can't get the development environment running\" - never mind that I've singlehandedly built 70% of their entire platform and demoed it to them 3 times along the way.\n\nSo after the call is over, they send me an email giving me parting instructions, and one of the steps on the list is to delete all files related to my work immediately and that I have 24 hours to comply. Remember how I said we have no source control? Well, I follow the instructions to the letter. Format the encrypted drive I was keeping the project on.\n\nA week later the project manager calls me up, telling me they have a git server now and I need to upload my code. I say \"What are you talking about? You instructed me under threat of legal repercussions to delete those files last Tuesday.\"\n\nHe just kinda sounds flabberghasted at that point. He tries to walk through not paying me out for my last month of work, and I say \"No no, I have that time billed and labeled out for each thing I did. It's not my responsibility to make sure you have the deliverables you EXPLICITLY instructed me to delete.\"\n\nI got my check on time and never heard from them again.",

At the end of the final year, they told me that I was charging too much for any changes to the site (even though I had given them tons of freebies) and they were going to get a younger \"more hip\" designer that could do things faster and cheaper. They wanted me to give them all the files and delete what I had on my end. So, I sent a CD to them with all of their files (basically what was online on their server anyway, easily retrievable) and erased everything, meaning, I erased all of the code and the \"build\" files (layers and layers) for all of their online images as well. I told them to put the CD in a safe place and make sure to back it up with another one. Closed out that account, moved on.\n\nAbout a year later, they called me in a panic saying that the new person screwed up their site, it was not running correctly and that they couldn't find the CD I sent them. No back-up! And somehow this person also erased all of the old files on their server as well, so had nothing to start over with. Apparently she was doing a re-design on the fly and just writing over the old files without backing anything up. But they didn't like the re-design and wanted to put the old site back up until they could make a decision. But it was gone. Oops. Not my problem. Get your younger, faster \"hip\" designer to figure it out, folks. I'm out.  \n\nLast time I checked, (and this is years later) the old site is still up, broken.",

The desire to immediately wipe drives and erase emails when someone leaves cost us (at GE) millions and millions of dollars.\n\nNow the smarter managers insist we use box to backup our systems..., except some of us get told \"oh no, you can't keep commercially sensitive docs on box\".   I did learn in my time  there to IMMEDIATELY (like within in a minute) grab IT sand say \"don't fucking wipe his/her box or drive, we need it\" but then it would take at least a month for someone above to \"approve\" me or others getting access to their data because of \"privacy\".

            "My mum did something similar on a non-digital basis. She was responsible for following up tunnels and bridges the company built and making sure they won't collapse. Then, the company changed owners and the new owner thought it was too expensive to have those checked every 5 years. He told my mum to get lost and bin all her documents. She did exactly that, after printing out that email and photocopying all documents. She took the copies home and disposed of the originals (including contracts with the state) which was watched by her superior. \n\nA few years later one of the tunnels collapsed. The company tried to frame it on her. She showed the email. The state was very interested in the documents she shredded. She never told anyone she had copies. The company had to pay a very hefty fine, all contracts were altered to which the company couldn't object because they didn't have their copy of the contracts and it cost them a few millions up to now. \n\nMy mum knows exactly where every single tunnel and bridge under her former supervision is and what the state of it is, since she had all technicians report to her when they last checked. In about 2-3 years some major roads will crack. She will then go to the mayors of the cities and tell them to better watch out at those locations and maybe look for tunnels. If they want more info, she's happy to give it, free of charge. She doesn't want anyone to get harmed because her former employer is a shithole.",

About 5 years in, the 2008 recession hits, and money gets tight, so I'm let go.\n\nI should mention that they \"replaced\" me with the lady they hired to do marketing for the weekly magazine.  She knew WordPress and could handle basic HTML and some javascript if she had to, but didn't actually do much hardcore web programming.  Fun fact: None of our sites, except a small staff blog, ran in WordPress.  Two of them were Drupal (which, after that experience, I swore never to use again), one was an in-house CakePHP-driven montrosity of a CMS, and another was a sort of dumbed down version of the CakePHP monstrosity, plus there were a smattering of other things I don't specifically remember.  At least one was pure PHP.  No underlying CMS or framework.  So... not really beginner level when it comes to things like security updates and major functionality changes.\n\nNow prior to me getting laid off, the IT department consisted of exactly two people.  Me, and the IT director (the 3rd they'd had since I was hired 5 years previously, so... make of that what you will), and I *did* use source control for all of the web projects.  The only problem was that I was literally the only person in the company who had any idea how it worked.  IT Director knew git... but I used subversion (mostly because that's what the *first* IT Director set me up with.  I've grown attached to it).  So when I left, there was no one who could update the website from source control.  IT Director probably could have muddled through with enough googling, but I think he saw the writing on the wall when I got dumped, because he left not long after me.  And then Marketing Lady left for a better job upstate so they didn't even have someone full time who knew the basics.\n\nLong story short, no one knew how to do anything with the websites.  Then the main website went down for almost a month.  I didn't get a call. \u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\nLast I checked, they're paying for all of the sites to be hosted on a managed, templated service (through the nose, I'm sure, because the whole reason for hiring me in the first place was so they could get away from that option due to pricing).

Boss got tired of people walking in at 6:05 or 6:03 when we start at 6:00 (even though he was a few minutes late more consistently than any one of us were), so he said \"If you aren't standing in front of me at 6 o'clock when we start then I'm docking 15 minutes from your time for the day.\"\n\nThe next day I accidentally forgot my tape measure in my car and had to walk back across the jobsite to grab it, made it inside at 6:0. Boss chewed me out and told me he was serious yesterday and docked me 15 minutes. So I took all my tools off right there and sat down on a bucket. He asked why I wasn't getting to work and I said \"I'm not getting paid until 6:15 so I'm not doing any work until 6:15. I enjoy what I do but I don't do it for free.\"\n\nHe tried to argue with me about it until I said \"If you're telling me to work without paying me then that's against the law. You really wanna open the company and yourself up to that kind of risk? Maybe I'm the kind to sue, maybe I'm not, but if you keep on telling me to work after you docked my time then we're gonna find out one way or the other.\"\n\nHe shut up pretty quickly after that and everyone else saw me do it and him cave, so now they weren't gonna take his crap either. Over the next few days guys that would have been 1 or 2 minutes late just texted the boss \"Hey, sorry boss. Would have been there at 6:02 and gotten docked, so I'll see you at 6:15 and I'll get to work then.\" and then sat in their cars until 6:15 and came in when their time started.\n\nSo between people doing what I did or just staying in their cars instead, he lost a TON of productivity and morale because he decided that losing 15 minutes of productivity per person and feeling like a Big Man was better than losing literally 1 or 2 minutes of productivity. Even though everyone stands around BS-ing and getting material together for the day until about 6:10 anyway.\n\nAfter a few weeks of that he got chewed out by his boss over the loss of productivity and how bad the docked time sheets were looking and reflecting poorly on him as a leader because we were missing deadlines over it and it \"Showed that he doesnt know how to manage his people.\", and then suddenly his little self implemented policy was gone and we all worked like we were supposed to and caught back up fairly quickly.\n\nWorker solidarity for the win. Not one person took his crap and worked that time for free after he tried to swing his weight around on them.\n\nBut obviously I was a target after that and only made it two more months before he had stacked up enough BS reasons to get away with firing me when I called in a few days in a row after my mom fell and I took off work to take care of her and monitor her for a while during the day.\n\nTL;DR- Boss told me because I was 1 minute late he was taking 15 minutes off of my time, so I didn't work for 15 minutes. People saw me and I accidentally triggered a wave of malicious compliance in my coworkers and the boss got chewed out over it.",

Less than 3 minutes from the time they punched in to the time they were in position and working.\n\nHad a manager trainee on one of their first \"Ill throw you the keys, this is your shift to run\" days pull all of my employees aside and explain to them that policy specifically states that they needed to punch in after they are ready to work, not when they walk in the door.\n\nI found out later that shift after hearing some rumblings from the staff, so I pulled everyone aside and told them while that is technically policy, no one is abusing it so ignore trainee managers directions from earlier today.\n\nWhen he found out I rescinded his order he decided to break out the calculator and show me how much labor it cost over the course of a month.  My location was high volume, so I then proceeded take his \"hours lost\" number and plug it into our monthly P&L report as a dummy number.

We never knew from one day to the next.  Why did I put up with that?  Because she often brought the most delicious cookies in the whole world.  And she would do the jobs no one wanted.  And she often worked more than her 8 hours, staying late with me when I worked late.  Which, as a woman, was a comfort because it's very eerie to work alone.  Once a guy walked past the front office where I was inputting data on the computer.  Huge glass windows and doors.  And he proceeds to pull down his pants and expose himself.  Now this was 40+ years ago and not common.  I was alarmed cause he could be more than just a flasher and shrieked.  She came running out front and the guy disappeared.  We had a good laugh later.",

            "I was once docked 15 minutes pay for being 2 minutes late to my retail job because my usual train had been cancelled. When I questioned it with the manager and the pay office, they were like \"You get paid in 15 minute blocks, if you don't want to lose money, be on time\".\n\nA few months later I was again a few minutes late, this time because of a crash on the freeway. When I got to work and went to sign in and saw 5.02pm on the clock-in machine, instead of signing in I sat on a nearby bench and started playing Pokemon on my Nintendo DS. The manager saw me and threw a shitfit, demanding to know why I wasn't out on the floor, and I just said \"You're not going to start paying me until 5.15 so I'm not going to start working til 5.15.\"\n\nHe said something like \"Do you think you can just get away with sitting here doing nothing\" and I responded, \"Do you think you can get away with trying to make me work for free? I wonder what the union will say\", and that shut him up.\n\nI think the saddest part of it all was that up until that point, I had often stayed back 10-15 minutes to make sure my department was perfect (unpaid and unacknowledged of course) because I took pride in my work and thought that hard work might be rewarded (in fairness I was only a dumb teenager). But from that point on, as soon as my shift ended, I was out the door. My department manager noticed after a few weeks that some things weren't getting done as thoroughly as before and I just said that if I'm not going to get paid more for going above and beyond but am going to lose money for something that isn't my fault, then why on earth would I keep putting in more effort than I had to?\n\nShe wasn't happy with that but there wasn't anything she could do about it, especially as she knew that my half-arsed effort was still better than a lot of other staff's best effort.",
