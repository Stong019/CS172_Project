        "selftext": "A few years ago my best friend and I rented a tiny 2 bedroom flat together. This place was kind of terrible; my friend's room had a hole cut into the wall so the last foot of the bed would fit (this became a 'mantlepiece' in the next room), the kitchen was the size of a child's playhouse kitchen and the upstairs neighbours spent all ours of the day and night screaming at each other or having loud sex. BUT, we were mostly happy because we were over living with 6+ other people. We paid \u00a375 a week each + bills for this place, which was pretty standard for a 2 bed flat in our area.\n\nThen 6 months into our 1yr contract the landlord sold the terraced house our flat (and 5 others) was a part of to a middle aged married couple who were first time landlords. They were the kind of people who thought they were smarter than everybody else and I got the impression they thought property management was going to be the easiest thing ever.\n\nWe had no problem throughout the sale process, we were assured nothing would change, we didn't interact much with the landlord before anyway. Then 2 weeks after the sale we got an email from the couple saying that we owed them \u00a320 each more a week. Basically, in our contract it stated our rent was \u00a375 each a week about 10 times, but there was one typo where it said our rent was \u00a395 each, so they said they could legally charge us \u00a395. We laughed at this, but when it became clear they were serious we reached out to the letting agent and got them to put in writing that it was a typo, our rent was always \u00a375, and they even gave us the original advert for the flat with the correct rent on it. We thought this would be the end of it. We were wrong.\n\nThe couple insisted on coming to our flat for an in person meeting. When they got there they said that they asked the old landlord about it and he was shocked that we'd not been paying enough for 6 months now and the rent was always \u00a395. I didn't buy this because they had nothing in writing, but I made the argument that OF COURSE he would say that because he wouldn't want it to seem like he sold under false pretences, and if we'd been underpaying by a total of like \u00a3160 a month why had he never spoken to us about it?? They said that he was a busy guy with too many properties, then the husband spent ages condescendingly explaining mortgages to us. Then they declared that if we did not start paying them the higher rent, they would evict us and we had 24hrs to pay or 30days to get out and they left.\n\nHonestly I think they saw two 22yr old girls and thought they could scare us into paying more money. What they didn't know is that my friend and I are very pleasant until you piss us off and we become vindictive motherfuckers. We decided that night that if they wanted to evict us from this shit hole we were gonna make them do it properly and if they were so pedantic about contracts and rules we were going to stop letting ANYTHING slide.\n\nThe couple woke up the next morning with an email from our lawyer (my flatmates brother, a bored lawyer with time on his hands) requesting a formal eviction notice in writing and laying out a record of last night's conversation. Thing was they didn't actually have legal grounds to evict us because even if we went to court and a judge favoured their interpretation of the contract (we were advised this was unlikely) we still didn't owe them more than a month's rent, which would have been their only legal way of evicting us because we were otherwise great tenants. By 9:15am they were ringing us, but we ignored them and emailed that our lawyer had advised us to only communicate in writing.\n\nWe then sent an email informing them that the fancy new front door they just installed could not be unlocked from the inside without a key, which violated fire safety laws and unfortunately if this wasn't rectified ASAP we would have to report it. We then sent texts that showed them repeatedly entering our flat with less than 24hrs notice, and did they know that this was illegal? Maybe we should talk to the other tenants because if they're doing this to everyone then this could be quite a problem...\n\nAfter about 3 days of this we received a very nice email saying that they don't agree our rent was supposed to be \u00a375 each a week, but they would graciously allow us to finish out our contract at that rate. By this point we'd found a flat triple the size for \u00a380 each a week and wanted out of that hamster cage, so we offered to move if they signed mutual surrender forms. They eagarly agreed. \n\nThe best part was that they stubbornly tried to rent that flat at the higher rate, despite us telling them it was a terrible idea, and the flat was empty for over a year. And because they had agreed to end our contract early they got stuck paying the council tax, not me!",

            "As I was moving out of my duplex, my landlord looked in the window - saw a mess of boxes, bags, papers and shipping supplies and told us we were \u201cmessy\u201d and she was raising our rent $200-300 more a month. She said we could pay that or leave.\n\nI told her we would be out by the end of the month.\n\nCome the end of the month, we are out and even shampoo\u2019d the carpets (didn\u2019t have to).\n\nThe landlord dragged her feet and said she was keeping our deposit because of a laundry list of damage to the duplex.\n\nI emailed her back with a slew of photos of said damage on the day we moved in and told her that if I didn\u2019t see my security deposit, in full, I was taking her to court.\n\nGot it 2 days later.\n\nI made a point to print out a dozen copies of the \u201cLandlord Tenant Act\u201d of my city, highlight all the areas she had tried to screw us over (the last few years) - then I took those booklets, looked up her properties online - and gave a copy to each of her tenants.",
            "In college our landlord tried to renew a lease and increase rent by $100 and they did so without proper notice; less than 30 days. A week after sending us the new lease they called to tell us they had mistakenly sent us that lease agreement and were not going to continue the lease and we had to leave on the last day of our lease. We immediately checked with a lawyer and were told to just send a check for the original amount and a letter saying we were staying. They retaliated by sending a pay or quit stating we had underpaid. Our lawyers very quickly pointed out they hadn\u2019t given enough notice to legally raise rent. So they send a new notice of rent increase. Our lawyers then pointed out that they couldn\u2019t legally raise rent if problems reported by the tenants had not been fixed.  Unfortunately for them we had six major issues that had been reported but not fixed. At the same time We sued our landlord for not fixing the issues in a timely matter.  So they fixed the issues and attempted to raise rent by a huge amount. The issues were pretty substantial to the point of us needing to stay in hotel rooms for days to be fixed. Our lawyers then informed our landlord they couldn\u2019t raise rent in retaliation for legal issues. Their lawyer agreed but stated we needed to start paying the previous increase in rent now that the problems were fixed. \n\nMeanwhile our lawsuit was in remediation and the landlord wanted us out. We wanted basically a half a year of rent back for having to live in a house that should have been condemned prior to the fixes. They wanted to give us half a month of rent then a full month and then finally agreed to a third of a year. The best / worst part is that the landlord sold the house for a fraction of what it was worth in attempt to make it someone else\u2019s problem. She only agreed to pay us close to what she wanted because the clause in the sale agreement stated it needed to be a empty house. In the end the house ended up selling for almost double just a year later. \n\nIt was fucked up because had they just talked to us face to face we could have settled the matter and both come out on top but instead the landlord took pennies on the dollar just to protect their pride.",

            "A while back my wife and I were looking to move into the Chicopee village (unincorporated area of North Georgia). I was set to buy but my wife wanted to rent for a year first, smart move. We found this house for rent, two bedroom, one bath, 1k sqft, on .16 acres. The home was built in 1909, single story with a root cellar and had a two bay detached garage out back. Through the house was valued at $87k, the guy rented it for $1100.\n\nWith the intention of buying it, we fixed up the old building, at nominal labor rates, and submitted receipts to deduct from rent.  At the end of the lease I was ready to buy (and cut our rent down to a $600 mortgage). However the home inspection did not go well. The house failed for wiring, plumbing, broken sewer line, sagging foundation, and rotting supports. It didn't even have good bones. We let the land lord know, and offered $67k as is, or $87k once fixed. Mind you, this house was technically no longer legal to occupy. \n\nThe land lord refused our offer, so we resolved to rent it for another year while we looked elsewhere. However, due to code violations it would have to be fixed before being rented. The land lord tried to raise rent by $200. At that point, we bailed. Went to live with g-ma for three months while we closed on our new home. A year later my stimulus check was sent to the wrong address, so I elected to drive by the old place and ask for it. Fortunately I didn't have to ask because the house was still vacant, and now condemned.",

Basically these people let me renovate the places while they live there meaning if they do leave the places are top notch and can be instantly put to market with a few hundred more each week. \n\nThe idiots who try and nickel and dime people wringing every last cent they can usually screw themselves over.

I was homeschooled at the time, so I had a good couple hours before I was supposed to start. \n\nFor some reason my mom had a problem with this. She had a lot of problems with a lot of things but that\u2019s another rant for my therapist. So naturally she decides to tell me that I can\u2019t wake up at 6 anymore. So I thought as you probably do that she was being stupid, but of course not being brave enough to tell her so, went into my bedroom, and set my alarm for 6:*01* instead. \n\nWhen she woke up the next day and found me on the computer she of course started screaming at me. I waited patiently for her to stop, and then proudly announced that I had not disobeyed her, I had woken up at 6:01 instead. My victory was shortlived, as I then got my ass beat and was grounded. I never was allowed to wake up early again, and of course am now a lazy adult who would rather sleep as much as possible.\n\nEdit: thanks to u/caufield88uk for pointing out I didn\u2019t clarify: \nI woke up without an alarm when I was really little, but then started sleeping more and set an alarm because I genuinely enjoyed waking up early. I made it sound weird. \n\nAlso: it wasn\u2019t because I played video games. It was solely the waking up part. Never had issues with school because of it, was never tired. Wasn\u2019t loud in the morning, didn\u2019t wake her up. She was just a narcissistic pos.",

I vowed if I ever in my life ended up custodian to a child they would NEVER be homeschooled.  Socialization is an important factor in growing up as well as the book/math/etc parts of education as a child.   Few of the other kids were future narcissists/insert-other-awful-trait-description but most of the general group was just very excited but unsure of how to even ask questions at the different exhibits/tables.   Very few of them had even been in any sort of building devoted to academics before.  I left that night after clean up feeling pretty down that there are so many awful parents that are bizarrely self-righteous and suffering from the Dunning-Krueger effect.

        "selftext": "I hated my old apartment, needed to desperately get out and right when I was looking for rentals last year, coronavirus hit and everyone shut down. With less than a week on my lease, I had to jump at the first available home. Didn't even get to inspect it.I ended up with equally horrible property managers.\n\nI didn't have a key on day one, had to break in to move in, they didn't tell me about the German roach infestation (it's okay, I used to do pest control so I managed) and so forth.Right when I lost power during Christmas (also okay, I live in the south, I didn't get too cold) I tracked down the original property owner and asked her if I could get out of the contract and just pay her directly. We investigated many options and the best way to get out of the contract was to just pay for the last remaining months and write a 30 day notice.\n\nThey call me and tell me that I have to write them a notice, signed and sent and received on the exact date 30 days from the leases end to be accepted or I will lose my $1,000 security deposit. They really stressed it had to be mailed and definitely on time or they won't be able to accept it.\n\nCue my pettiness.\n\nI wrote a template letter, with a generic \"this is a \\[number of days till lease end\\]- day notice .... I'm writing to terminate my contract and to receive my security deposit as stated...\".I sent one out on my 103 day notice. Then another one on 89 day notice. Then another one on 73 day notice and so forth, basically whenever I remembered about it, I would change the date around, print it, sign it and then mail it.\n\nThey call me saying this is very unnecessary and that they got my message loud and clear. But they sounded pretty rude about it so I sent some more. \n\nI then received some passive aggressive emails that they will honor the contract and leave me the $1,000 deposit as I have sent them a 30 day notice. But they can be tricky and as I haven't technically sent them an exact \"30 days\" notice, I have some more letters to send. Plus again, they sounded pretty rude over e-mail.\n\nCue the final 15 day countdown till my 30 day notice letter. I upped the ante. I now have one letter per day to send and I have changed the fonts on each letter ranging from Papyrus to Jokerman to Comic Sans. My favorite one is the one where it's all bright yellow and barely legible. It jsut hurts looking at. Oh and better yet, I got the last batch sent as certified mail so I get an email that they received it AND that they had to sign it.\n\nOn my 34th day notice letter (now probably the 20th letter I've mailed), I received my cashiers check back. No message or anything.Fortunately I have four more letters to send. The best $43 on stamps I've ever paid. \n\nTL:DR I spam the lease office with 30 day notices till they gave up on holding to my security deposit\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Even though some are breaking rule 3 and wondering if this is some made up everyone cheered tale, heres a link to some screenshots and emails. |  \n[https://imgur.com/a/d6Xbc4P](https://imgur.com/a/d6Xbc4P)",

She eventually just let him kick her out and as far as I know has been living in a tent behind her mother's house.  She's a super alcoholic that I just can't be around anymore despite being very much in love with her but no one deserves to live like that.  I've been homeless but was both unfortunate and fortunate enough to qualify for a domestic violence shelter that I stayed in for six months. It's not even close to as bad.\n\nIt stresses me out not knowing how she's doing but despite not being able to help attempting a relationship when we are around each other, I realized how toxic we were together.  That said, I hope she's ok and hope that landlord goes to hell.\n\nEdit: typo",

            "This is very good. I didn't have but a $95 security deposit. But I had learned from several people that moved out over the years they would charge them for new carpet, new paint, new bathroom fixtures (upgrades to match the new model) but usually several thousand. You could try and fight it but they had  a paralegal at an attorney's office that did paperwork just for them. And they would file a lien that showed on your credit. Most people paid. Many had lived there for years so all these things were normal expenses in turning over an apartment. They also charge high rates for labour cost more than what they paid. They owned several thousand apartments and had roving maintenance staff.\n\nSo when I got ready to leave after 9 years I went and took pictures of the new Model Apartment. It had a different style and color than mine and the paint was different. The bathroom and kitchen fixtures we different. There was no varience of colors in the newly leased apartments.\n\n2 weeks later they were showing my old apartment. A friend went over and took pics of carpet, paint and fixtures. 2 weeks after that I get the letter saying they are keeping my $95 and I owe them $2,364 for painting, new carpets, scratches on the walls and new fixtures. I forget to mention 3 scratches that were deep enough to see, I spackled and sanded.\n\nMy good buddy sent back a letter on his law firm stationary asking that after 9 years wouldn't they be doing these things anyway. Please respond to his office not me. There began an odyssey of 2 years before my friend said he would be looking to find plantiffs for malicious prosecution suits including mine if they were stupid enough to take us to court for vacating the lien. That's when we sent them the pictures. By then I had 11 other people who had moved and my buddy was looking at really going after these guys. Working with me had been for fun, meals, and drinks. I did pay for his assistant's time doing the letters.",

        "selftext": "\n\n\n\nNot sure if this is Malicious Compliance or Petty Revenge...\n\nI graduated uni a few years back and immediately started looking for a job in my chosen field - marketing.\n\nMarketing entry level roles were thin on the ground, so when I found a role which was hybrid of marketing with sales support, I took it. \n\nThe company was a medium sized business which specialised in recruitment, contractor hiring and head hunting. They also subcontracted work for a recruitment technology provider, which matched up perfectly with one of my other passions - technology.  \n\nI absolutely loved the role. I got to do all parts of the marketing and sales lifecycle, I got to work with suppliers, event organisers, clients, staff all across the company, meet new people and do really exciting things. \n\nI had two managers - the one who managed the sales team and the one who managed marketing. \n\nThe marketing manager was a kindred spirit; the sales manager was oldschool sales. An arrogant and headstrong late-forties man who lived for making deals and boasting about them. Shiny shoed, silver-tongued. I\u2019ll call him Dapper Dan. We were not friends. \n\nFor about 18 months, things went swimmingly. I\u2019d do marketing half the time then divide the rest of the time between sales support and billable work. Billable was building custom careers / job sites to host the recruitment system front end. A steep learning curve but with the help of some web dev friends I got pretty familiar with simple site builds. \n\nBeing tech-aligned meant I was always looking digital first, bringing the company into the age of social media, SEO / SEM, website optimisation and multi channel marketing. \n\nDapper Dan sneered at such things. He saw digital as a waste of money. However, we were always able to justify the spend on digital by offsetting the billable website work. \n\nThe marketing manager eventually moved on to bigger and better things. Rather than promote me or hire in a replacement, the company moved the marketing responsibilities to Dapper Dan. \n\nDapper Dan\u2019s changes were immediate and far-reaching. He removed the digital budget. He required that 50% of my time would be sales support, to \u2018better enable the sales team\u2019. He incorporated the billable work with his own team\u2019s revenue. He rewrote my annual objectives to align purely with sales targets, rather than marketing. When I voiced my objections, he took me aside for a \u2018friendly chat\u2019 and told me if I didn\u2019t like it, I could always leave. \n\nNaturally I went and complained extensively to the departed marketing manager over drinks. After listening sympathetically for 45 minutes, she held up a hand, said \u2018Stop\u2019, and shared some life advice. \u2018Each job pays you twice. You get your money now, that\u2019s your wage. You also get experience now, that\u2019s how you get paid in the future. So. Are you still getting paid? Yes? Are you still learning? No? Figure out how to keep learning, or leave.\u2019 \n\nTaking the advice to heart, I busted my ass for the next year. I worked on digital outside of office hours. I made friends with the tech provider\u2019s support and dev teams. I went to developer group meetups, attended conferences, studied for and acquired industry qualifications. I joined the national marketers and digital marketers group. I dug through blogs, articles, emailed people, took every opportunity to cross skill, upskill, to learn. \n\nAnd I sat with a smile on my face in the sales meetings as Dapper Dan delegated dumb do-work to me so his team of sycophants could make the company\u2019s growth figures look spectacular. Spectacular they were, to the point that the company was acquired, and Dapper Dan betrayed me. \n\nYou see, managers have the discretion to assign a pool of shares to high performing staff. The shares have no real value and can\u2019t be traded, but in the event of a management buy out, they would suddenly have value - and quite a lot of value. \n\nDapper Dan felt it appropriate to reward every SALESperson in his team with a generous parcel of shares. As a SUPPORTperson, I would not be the beneficiary of such kindness. I\u2019d had a verbal agreement with the previous marketing manager that the pool would be shared across the entire team so was pretty shocked to discover I\u2019d been excluded from the pool. \n\nI queried him on it, per the previous agreement, and he said (verbatim) \u2018Well, an verbal agreement is only worth the paper it\u2019s written on. You don\u2019t make any sales, you haven\u2019t built the business, you don\u2019t get a cut\u2019. \n\n'If you didn\u2019t like it,' he reiterated, 'you're welcome to leave.'\n\nThat is EXACTLY what I decided to do. Except I didn\u2019t tell him. \n\nThe way the contract handover works in this instance is that all staff cease employment with company X on one day. The following day, they commence employment with company Y. Annual leave is paid out and begins to re-accrue at the new employer. Other arrangements - salaries, long service leave and length of service - may be transferred to the new employer. \n\nAbout six weeks before the handover, Dapper Dan passed me my new contract. I waited a week, came back with some enthusiastic queries on the new benefits, which took him two weeks to follow up. I quietly registered a domain name and parked it, then spun up a Wordpress instance and started building a personal blog. \n\nThree weeks away from drop date, everyone\u2019s frantically running around getting all the deals as close as possible to closing and employment contracts are the last thing on his mind. I go back to him, I tell him I have a couple more things I need to check out and I\u2019ll email them through to him before I sign it. I spend a few more nights throwing together a bunch of blog articles relating to Recruitment Technology. How to articles, that kinda stuff, many of my own installation notes. \n\nA week passes, I fire off a couple of really complex questions around the transfer of benefits. He obviously forgets about them, then in the week of the handover, catches heat from the HR team about the outstanding contract and pulls me into a meeting room to berate me about not having signed the new contract.\n\nI explain I\u2019m waiting on his feedback on those specific points before I\u2019ll commit, that I don\u2019t want to be disadvantaged moving into the new role, call out the lack of a share option as an example. Clearly frustrated, he drops the words I\u2019ve been waiting for. \u2018If the signed contract is not on my desk on Friday, don\u2019t bother coming into the office Monday.\u2019 He paused for dramatic effect, and reiterated \u2018I mean it. You won\u2019t have a job.\u2019 I replied that I completely understand and that I\u2019ll have everything he needs on his desk by close of business Friday.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, Dapper Dan leaves the office early to attend his normal \u2018client networking\u2019 visits which typically involve long lunches and alcohol. \n\nAt 4.45pm I save the final set of forecasting and reporting to the share drive, send an email to the IT team passing over access to the Marketing lastpass account which contains the global database of usernames and passwords for all digital assets (including client sites), an Excel workbook containing my reporting macros and the location of all my documentation. I redirect my phone to Dapper Dan\u2019s desk number, lock my laptop and leave it on his desk along with my ID card.\n\nOver the weekend I push my personal website live and add my contact details to my LinkedIn profile, switching it to 'Actively Searching' mode. I figure my holiday pay will cover me for a couple of weeks of downtime before I have to go diving back into the workforce. \n\nOn Monday, I\u2019m enjoying a long walk in the spring sunshine with my dog, who\u2019s incredibly happy that his human has not disappeared down the driveway at 0720 per normal. We stop for coffee at a local cafe and my phone begins to ring. It\u2019s one of the sales drones at old company; I ignore it and thoroughly enjoy the freedom of being able to amble through a park without anywhere to be. The phone buzzes another eight or ten times by the time I get home. The poop has well and truly hit the windmill.\n\nI check my voicemails, ignoring those I know from my previous employer and returning the phone calls of two ex-clients to let them know that my contract has ended and to check in with Dapper Dan for work in progress - or contact the technology provider for support requests. \n\nShortly afterwards I got a call from a bemused contact who works at the technology provider who\u2019s been fielding support calls that I\u2019d normally handle. He listens with increasing interest as I explained the situation, then tells me he\u2019d call back shortly. \n\nTen minutes later he\u2019s back with the Head of Product on the line, asking about my lunch preferences. She arranges to meet me at a nearby Thai place. Over a delicious red duck curry, she cheerfully describes the wonders of a career as a contractor. She also mentions the day rates for highly qualified, industry-certified staff, mentioned that Tech Provider were really struggling to find such staff and gives me the number of a recruiter who may or may not have been on Tech Supplier\u2019s preferred supplier list. I call the recruiter on the way home. \n\nMeanwhile, my collection of voicemails from Dapper Dan was growing by the hour as he came to grips with the breadth of the problem that he\u2019d generated. At some point in the late afternoon, HR must\u2019ve clicked to what had happened and I received a polite SMS from the personal number of the regional HR Directory asking if I was available for a quick chat. \n\nI call through and discussed the options presented to me by Dapper Dan on Friday, and that I felt I had no option but to follow his instructions. They probed for more information and it became apparent they were unaware that Dapper Dan had pulled an ultimatum without first engaging HR. They then informed me that to benefit from the sale of my shares, I would need to transfer to the new company and remain in their employment for a full year. \n\nWhen I explained that I had no such share options, there was a full four second silence. It transpires that this, too, was not adequately communicated to HR. I mentioned that I\u2019d appreciate it if Dapper Dan could discontinue his voicemails to me as I found them unprofessional and had no intent of recommencing employment under his management. We ended the call politely, I wished them all the best and regretted the conversation had to happen under such circumstances. \n\nMy contract for Tech Provider came through via the PSL agency at 11pm that evening and was signed and returned the following day. \n\nI was deployed to client site that Wednesday. \n\n*Post Departure*\nI met up with one of the old IT team at a conference three months after it all went down. He was ecstatic to fill me in on what had happened. \n\nThe first notice anyone got of it was the service desk asking who they should route my LastPass account to and why I\u2019d be passing it around. One of the techs came up to my floor to find me, then found an empty desk. Asked around for where I\u2019d moved to and noone knew. That was the first call, from one of the Sales drones trying to locate me. \n\nThe tech went to Dapper Dan\u2019s desk and found my laptop with my ID and post-it note taped to it. He put two and two together, went back downstairs and checked the access logs and realised the last time I\u2019d logged in was Friday. He then locked my account for security purposes and went to HR to check if there was a leaver form. \n\nHR checks, no leaver form AND a great big red cross next to 'employment contract received'. HR calls Dapper Dan, who\u2019s not in the office. Dapper Dan says \u2018No, contract should be on my desk, it was on there on Friday, I\u2019m out on the road at the moment, give me till lunch time and I\u2019ll sort it out\u2019. Obviously thinking that I\u2019m grandstanding. Starts to call me and leave messages then gets progressively agitated as he realises I\u2019m not coming back. \n\nWhen he gets into the office, he can\u2019t find the contract either so he goes to HR and \u2018explains\u2019 what has happened, says I have been stonewalling them and it\u2019s cool, he\u2019ll get it sorted, it\u2019s between me and him. HR says erm, no, this is our thing now, and the HRD sends me the SMS. \n\nShortly after my phone conversation the HRD walks into a sales meeting and very abruptly pulls Dapper Dan out. They disappear into a meeting room where it may only be assumed that Dapper Dan was required to spell out exactly what had occurred and address the comments that I had made. I suspect he came completely clean at that stage.\n\nDapper Dan was subsequently reamed as only HR and senior management can ream a manager who\u2019s f*cked up. He was demoted, decoupled from Marketing, his budget reduced by half and a new, separate Marketing function created. \n\nHis team were collectively put under review and forced to carry out their own reporting, tracking and metrics, which lacked the coherence and consistency that I\u2019d been able to deliver. This reduced the capacity of the team. A couple of them left and they missed out on some key deals. \n\nIn the fallout they completely dropped the ball on the client website builds. They went to market to try and find a resource who could fulfil these builds, and Dapper Dan was reportedly astounded to discover that experienced technical marketing staff are both hard to find and expensive to recruit. \n\nThey were unable to fill the role and the builds were taken back inhouse by the tech provider, who now had an experienced resource to deploy (me). I ended up working on three of these at full utilisation rate, which was paid by the new company. I\u2019m pretty sure Dapper Dan would\u2019ve seen the funding arrangements for these and would know my day rate - which is substantially higher than his. \n\n*Much later*\nAs the sales lead, Dapper Dan had to bear the displeasure of his superiors for the full twelve months before he could claim his share payout. It would\u2019ve been a really, really shitty twelve months for him. He resigned within two weeks of the anniversary of the purchase, and the company enforced a six month notice period and another 12 month no-compete clause. Any benefit he would have received from the share payout would have been consumed over that 12 months unless he switched industries or moved cities. Last time I saw he was on the job market. \n\nAs for me? Happily living the life of the contractor. I get paid for the hours I work and I work the hours I want. \n\nMy old marketing manager is now VP of something at a large multinational. I\u2019ve used her speech several times when giving young, frustrated staff career advice. \n\nTL;DR\n\nOld school sales manager attempts to call my bluff. Hilarity ensues. ",

        "selftext": "This happened years ago when I used to work at an office as a front desk one summer during college. A video I saw today just reminded me of the incident. One day this lady came in to pay a fine. She was very rude and angry about her fine. I don\u2019t know the particulars because all I did was work the front desk. She decided to try a little malicious compliance. Her fine was about $250 and she said she was going to be paying in quarters. I knew I had to comply since we\u2019re supposed to accept any legal tender \n\n I took the bags from her but realized that she had unrolled every single roll of quarters. She said that since we want to waste her time with a stupid fine, she will also waste our time. I tried to explain/beg her not to do this to me, since I had nothing to do with her fine. She didn\u2019t care and said that we\u2019re all evil. She smirked and said \u201cone band one sound\u201d. I realized then that there was no reasoning with her.\n\nI was furious but I began counting one by one. We were interrupted by multiple phone calls and customers so I had to restart a few times. She started to realize how long this would really take. She tried to stack  the quarters to help me count faster but I told her that it was my job. That I couldn\u2019t just take word that the stacks were correct so I had to do it one by one like she asked for.\n\n2 other came, paid and left while she was still standing there. She started getting mad saying that I was wasting her time on purpose. I told her that we don\u2019t have a coin counter so this is how long it would take. She threatened to call the police, I told her to go ahead that I\u2019ll have to restart when the police gets here so I can be sure to get an accurate count. After someone else came and left she finally snapped. She whipped out her credit card and paid.\n\nAs she was leaving she snatched one of the bags of the counter but the handle gave way spilling all the coins all over the floor. She scooped up what she could but left a good chunk. I told her she was littering and  she flipped me off. \n\nI got a broom and swept up the coins. There was about 192 quarters on the floor. When I was leaving work I found some more in the parking lot. It wasn\u2019t a whole lot of money but for a broke college student it was great.",

            "Random piece of somewhat related trivia. Here in Australia is Currency Act 1965 have conditions for coins to be considered legal tender  \n\n\n* not exceeding 20\u00a2 if 1\u00a2 and/or 2\u00a2 coins are offered,\n* not exceeding $5 if any of 5\u00a2, 10\u00a2, 20\u00a2 and 50\u00a2 coins are offered,\n* not exceeding 10 times the face value if the coins offered are greater than 50\u00a2 up to and including $10,\n* to any value for coins of other denominations above $10.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat this means is that there is no obligation to accept it as payment (although there is nothing stopping you from accepting it anyway) if the total value of the coins exceeds $0.20, $5, and $10 respectively.

Sure but I also remember working frontline support and people walking up to me at all times even while on a break to try and directly report an issue to me vs using the proper notification channels. If the proper notification channels were used then the ticket queue would have a ton of tickets reporting the same thing making it easy to prioritize the work. Just my 2 cents.",

My personal favorite was one where a dude sent a ticket complaining that his desk is crooked. I shit you not, the man wrote a literal essay about how his crooked desk is preventing him from doing his work. \n\nThing is that people complain stuff isn\u2019t working properly all the damn time even if the real issue is them not knowing how to use the software. When you have one person coming in to say \u201cthis isn\u2019t working\u201d you aren\u2019t going to immediately drop the other 124747 tickets in your queue just to spend the next 5 hour investigating something that might or might not exist.

Or just catching up on tech news while waiting for a status bar to reach 100%. If he\u2019s really playing on his phone all the time, his manager should hear multiple complaints.\n\nAnd knowing if the issue is affecting one user or multiple is critically important both to troubleshooting and prioritizing an issue. By getting _everyone_ to upgrade and not just one or a few, you magnified the severity of what would otherwise have been an issue with limited scope that he could\u2019ve \u201ccaught early thanks to your help\u201d.\n\nJudging from your tone though, I suspect he was either impudent to some degree, or at least seemed lazy and/or irritated that he had to work on this, which is unprofessional.

He has the smug look and just stares at me, thinking that I just got in trouble. \n\nQuickly he turns around and everyone can hear her barking at him for wasting her time enacting useless policies and how dare he waste valuable class time as one teacher,to another. He's quietly mumbling \"yes ma'am, yes ma'am.\" He hangs up the phone and resumes class.\n\nI was never asked to call my parents again in his class.\n\nEdit: I speak to my mother every day or so and read her some of the things y'all said.

            "My father was a Captain in the US Navy (Colonel in the other branches, it's one below Admiral), he fought in Vietnam and has had thousands of men and women under his command... yet I've never seen his \"war face.\"\n\nExcept once.\n\nI was on a Boy Scout trip to the Blue Ridge mountains, 4 hours away.  As we were breaking camp, my buddy Jon and I decided to go up to the scenic view one last time (3 minutes up a hill).  When we came back, everyone was gone.  Thinking at first \"Oh shit, we are lost in the woods...\" and then remembering there is a Ranger station about 2 miles down, we hike there and ask to borrow the phone to make a collect long distance call (this was the 80's so it was a big deal to call long distance collect)  I get my dad on the line, explain the situation, he tells me to give the phone to the ranger... and the ranger gives him directions to where we are.\n\nIt was a long 4 hour wait, and an even longer ride home, almost completely silent.  About 10 minutes from home, my dad pulls over and makes a call on a pay phone to my scoutmaster and tells him to meet us at the church parking lot where the scouts meet.  We get there and our scoutmaster, Mr. Frost, was waiting.  My dad says \"Stay in the van.\"  Jon and I just nod.\n\nMr. Frost starts out with his hands up in an \"Ok, let me explain\" pose and my dad cuts him off.  I have never seen one grown man so thoroughly dress down another grown man in my life.  The most terrifying part was he never raised his voice.  Something in my dad just \"shifted\" and suddenly he was a goddamn Commanding Officer of a United States Naval Base telling some poor squabbie that his level of fuck up from the true course of rectitude has been noted, and it has angered the powers on high... their very avatar stood now, in the body of my father, addressing that scoutmaster with cool, calculated, righteous anger that had not the barest hint... but really just the implication... of focused, controlled, murderous rage underneath.  Mr. Frost wasn't a military man, but you could watch his very attitude melt into pure submission.\n\nMy dad got back in the van and took Jon home.  Then he and I are alone in the car for the 10 minutes it took to get from Jon's house to ours.  I asked him \"Dad, are you mad at me?\"  He said \"No, you did something stupid, but Bob's job is to protect you from that.  I will say this though, learn from this and don't do it again.\"  Message.  Received.\n\nWhen I became a scoutmaster years later... you better fucking believe I counted my kids twice before a single car rolled out.  Never lost one.",

            "Back in the late 90s in high school, one of the teachers made me call my mother to bring me a different shirt. Reason being, because the one I had on had a cigarette ad or something in the background. My mom worked an hour away at least. I was literally giggling when my teacher called her which just made the teach even more pissed. I had already offered to turn the shirt inside out so you couldn't see it.\n\n30 seconds later, I can literally feel the explosion of anger through the phone from my mom.

            "In primary school, my teacher sent me to the Head teacher because she felt I was being disrespectful, because I asked her to explain the answer to a maths question as she marked me wrong. Her response was just \"that's what the answer book says\". The Head wanted me to apologise to the teacher, and when I wouldn't without an explanation of the maths question, she rang my mum.\n\nMomma Roonling asked the teacher what the question was, then answered it herself, and asked what I had given as an answer, and what the teacher had said. Turns out, I was right, and my mum tore the Head a new one, and threatened to go to the school board / papers, as if 2 senior teachers couldn't explain a primary school level maths problem, they shouldn't be in that job.\n\nI got apologised to and sent back to class, and asked not to tell my classmates.

            "I was attending a Catholic private high school in the 80's, despite being from a non-religious family.  I decided that because my Religious Co-ordinator set us an assessed task to \u201cCompare and contrast two differing religions.\u201d, that I would choose Christianity and Satanic worship.  Yes, I know: I was asking for it.  But\u2026 I did a good job academically.\n\n\nI was failed for presenting the doctrine of an \u201canti-religious cult\u201d, and given a two week suspension.  My parents were asked to attend a meeting with the Religious Co-ordinator (along with a fairly large group of parents in the same situation), to \u201c\u2026discuss their child\u2019s grading\u201d.\n\n\nMy Dad was busy.  My Mum attended.\n\n\nWhen my Mother stood up to ask on what grounds I was failed, The Religion Co-ordinator asked whose child was hers.  When she replied with my name, the Religious Co-ordinator replied \u201cWell, we hear more than enough from your son on this topic in class, so you can sit down.\u201d\n\n\nI was only privy by eavesdropping when my Mother presented this information to my Father that night.\n\nMy Mum was a shy, retiring type.  My Father, the Scotland-born, retired Squadron Leader, R.A.A.F., was not.\n\n\nI remember distinctly the short quiet period after this revelation.  In the end, my Dad simply said: \u201cI\u2019ll handle this.\u201d\n\n\nI\u2019m not really sure what happened, as I only have other people\u2019s reports of the interaction (I was suspended), but by all accounts, my Father made an appointment, attended the Religious Co-ordinators office, and destroyed him.  Apparently, the tirade was heard far and wide.\n\n\nMy parents received an official letter the next day from the school apologising and requesting my immediate \u201creturn to studies.\u201d \n\n\nI called my Father \u201cSir\u201d.

            "My 7th grade language arts teacher made us do this as well, needless to say, half the kids just dialed wrong numbers on purpose and the other half had parents asking why the teacher was wasting everybody's time. Fortunately, that was her last year teaching before retirement. ",
            "That\u2019s amazing! \n\nThis reminded me of a horrible day when I was in second grade. I was a very well-behaved and quiet student. One day in computer class I asked to go to the bathroom and the teacher told me no. I asked again about 15 minutes later when my tiny bladder was about to pop and she told me no again and scolded me for asking. About 5 minutes after that I peed myself. We had those plastic closed back chairs so it held all of my pee and I was sooo embarrassed. \nI don\u2019t remember much between that and getting to the office while sobbing, but I do know this was an excellent time for someone to mistreat me, as my dad was home. He worked out of state from the time I was in first grade until I was in high school, but he just so happened to be off that week and my mom was at work. \nThe principal called my dad and explained what happened and he told them he\u2019d come get me. My dad isn\u2019t a huge man, but there is something about him that makes him very intimidating when he needs to be. He came into the office and gave me my clothes and told me to change and wait on him. He ripped the principal and the computer teacher a new one, took me home to shower, then took me to lunch and told me they would never treat me like that again. That computer teacher learned to let kids go to the bathroom after that too. \n\nMy other favorite story is when my PE coach wanted to give me a C in middle school and my sister, who was an English teacher at my school, chewed him out in a faculty meeting and got written up. I ended up with an A in PE after that though. ",

            "Oh man, teacher-on-teacher drama.  I love it.\n\nMy stepmother was a high school English teacher.  Universally hated.  But the year I graduated, my AP teacher and head of the English department was retiring.  She got to take over the department and redo AP to her liking, thankfully after I was done.  This meant throwing out everything postapocalyptic, sci-fi, or remotely enjoyable, and replacing it with Bridget Jones' Diary, and literally everything that Jane Austen and the Bront\u00eb sisters ever wrote, and she was so incredibly proud that after 30 years she finally got her wish to dismantle a truly fantastic AP class.\n\nAs a hated stepmother, I had no qualms in calling her out on her bullshit one day whilst visiting my dad.  This started a war that unfortunately carried over into school.  However... her lair/classroom was right in the middle of the second floor hallway.  This becomes important soon.\n\nAfter some minor spats, it became apparent that she was going to go out of her way every day to make the rest of my senior year hell.  Except she failed to take into account that 1) she was universally hated and somehow didn't know it, and 2) I was a straight-A student, athlete, musician, recognized multiple times for various academic awards, and my teachers were more like my peers than my actual peers.  My teachers both past and present were my best friends.\n\nOne day I came back from lunch a few minutes late because I stopped for a latte and the place was busy.  Meh.  Whatever.  I could get away with the occasional late-to-class because my teachers liked me.  However, getting to my after-lunch class, which happened to be AP English, I have to walk past my stepmother's classroom twice - once to get to my locker, once to go to class.\n\nUpon seeing me walk toward my locker 5 minutes after class started, my stepmother - a roughly 4'10\" woman of Medusa-like hideousness - came and blocked my path to class by standing in the middle of the hall with her hands on her hips.  Oh, this should be good.  I crossed my arms, yawned at her, and leaned against my locker, inviting her to do her talking/yelling/screeching thing that she does.\n\n3 words into her tirade, half the doors on the second floor flew open to see who or what was making that awful noise.  Every teacher whose class I had ever taken barrelled down the hall and surrounded my stepmother and yelled at her for disrupting their classes with her personal vendetta bullshit which the entire school had known long about - she and I have hated each other since the day we met, and since we share an uncommon last name in a small town, yeah, everyone knows.\n\nFinally, my AP teacher, a tiny, ancient, gentle man overcame his emphysema to bellow at her like a creature 4 times his size.  All I could make out was, \"Goddammit Medusa, go back to your miserable fucking cave and die just like your students' souls!\"\n\nI'm 34 years old and my stepmother has never spoken to me or made eye contact with me since that day 17 years ago.",

Three of us were on our way to lunch \\(we weren't allowed to leave, but did it everyday and it was known among one of our parents anyway.\\)\n\nSo we're headed to my friend's place to make lunch as her mother specifically purchased food for us to do so knowing this was the norm. To paint a picture, I'm driving and our female friend had positioned herself in the lap of our other friend in the front seat as I got tired of waiting on them to stop fighting about who was riding shotgun.\n\nWe're pulled over by the police and he pulls us out of the car. She's up first and is asked to call her mother \\(who is a teacher in another district\\) Her mother answers, hears police and assumes something had happened. The cop replies, \"Ma'am, do you know what I just caught your daughter doing?\" Not only was she annoyed to have receive such a call, she was able to tell the cop EXACTLY the situation, what we told him, and where we were going up to and including that her daughter was in the lap of our friend. \\(This was a normal fight they had fairly regularly and could have just as easily been him in her lap.\\)\n\nThe cop, taken aback kind of stammers as she's screaming at him over the call for wasting her time and to just let us go. He replies, \"Ma'am, are you aware they're not allowed to leave school?\" To which she abruptly responds, \"Have YOU had the school food?\" She then tells him to stop wasting her time and to just let us go and proceeds to hang up on him. In the end, he made her call her brother \\(who is roughly twice her age at this time and gave her a stern talking to\\) because her father just laughed and hung up on the cop as he'd already gotten the situation from the mother.\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR\\*\\*  Female friend gets me pulled over on our way to get lunch because she's sitting in my other friends lap in the front seat.

I worked as lead production in multiple Kinkos, and subsequently I can make the copiers pretty much dance to any tune I set, due to learning their ins and outs. \n\nAnyway, for a variety of reasons, mostly I'd moved, I got a job with a competitor(Ikon) that stationed me closer to home[contract positions at client locations], in an incredibly busy, paper oriented, banking company. My boss was a rather ... stubborn, close-minded woman, who liked to insult her underlings, of which I was one.  When I started, I began streanlining her processes. Most of her time was taken up by physical labor which the copiers could do automatically. I pointed this out early on, to which she said, \"That's the way we've always done it, and I like it this way.\"  There was an implied threat at the end of that. Thankfully, we worked opposite schedules.  So while she was there, business as usual, but I was blessedly alone for 6 hours after she and the others left. \n\nAnd shit got *done* while I was alone at work. Turn around times would drop from 24 hours minimum, sometimes days, to less than 5 hours. The clients learned that if they brought their projects in after my boss left, they'd get them much sooner. All of this leads to the blowup.  \n\nBoss Lady = BL\n\nProject client = VC\n\nMe = Trance354\n\nThere are other co-workers, but they didn't speak up. \n\nI come in to the basement shop early in the afternoon, and there are stacks of paper *everywhere*. Massive collation job. Which the copiers can do automatically, of course. I open my mouth to say as much, but,  \n\nBL: \"No! Dont touch anything. No touchy!\"[She's a 20-something Italian **girl**woman with maturity issues]  \"Start working on the next job. I don't want you touching this one.  VC is going to get this in the time I specified, not one second earlier.\"  I don't think BL liked VC, BL's husband had gotten whiplash looking at VC one time, so there was a bit of jealousy.\n\nSo I look at the email, and start pumping out jobs. All collation, ironically. Really small, really complicated jobs. All done and picked up by the time BL was packing up to go home. \n\nBL: \"I'm going home.  Don't touch anything. This job is off limits.\" \n\nTrance354: \"This job is off limits, don't touch it.\"\n\nFive minutes after she leaves, VC calls.  \n\nVC: \"Is BL still there?\" No. \"I have massive edits to that job, it's like a whole new project.\"\n\nTrance354: \"She point blank told me not to touch *that project*.\"  \n\nVC: \"If the project isn't done by morning, I'll lose my job.\"  \n\nI know this is hyperbole, but I have a way around BL, so, \"Send it to me as a new project, cancel the old project by email, sent only to BL, not to me, and I'll see what I can do.\"  \n\nVC is appropriately appreciative, and sends the files over.  I set the machines up, and everything starts printing. All I have to do is refill paper and put the automatically collated products into massive binders. \n\nEverything is done just before quitting time, and VC is already there with her superior, looking at the process BL was using, versus just having the machine do it. \n\nVC: \"Why was she doing it this way?\"  \n\nTrance354: \"I really don't know, but if I had to guess, I'd say her bonus was tied to her profit. This company is paper reliant, so saving on your monthly copy allotment is out. If she does all the collating by hand, each time we touch a sheet of paper, it costs you money. And it is likely not a discounted, or included, cost in your contract. It probably isn't much, each time, but it can add up, especially at this company.\" \n\nVC and her boss thank me for getting everything done so quick, and I head home.  \n\nNext day, I get to the copy center,  and right off....\n\nBL: \"Go home.\"  This woman is livid, \"Go home. Don't come in tomorrow. I don't care who calls, you're suspended.\"  \n\nI go home and proceed to go on a massive bender.  Because there's no work the next day, I turn off my phone. Prevents angry drunk dialing.  While checking my phone, I send a message to VC, to I tell her I will be out for a couple days, and to expect a production slowdown, and to pass it along.\n\nWhile I'm out of the world, my boss calls. And calls. And calls a lot more. She leaves messages about coming back in, getting work done, etc.  \n\nTurns out VC's boss called her boss, the CEO, and told him about the job I'd done.  CEO liked the job and wanted to thank me ... And VC may have had them check the contract.  And an order came from \"high up\". All the bells and whistles I usually have the machines do. Turn time was faster than BL could manage. \n\nI was on the verge of being fired, so I reached out to a friend at a kinkos I used to work at, about noon on my 2nd day of suspension. They agreed to the same pay rate, and I was hired. \n\nI informed BL and said my goodbyes to VC and the rest of the ladies. \n\nBL was fired a week later. I heard through the grapevine it was poor human resource management. VC unhappy, her boss was pissed, and *her* boss was .... not happy.  \n\nSorry so long.",

And because I had also allowed group work, the whole class got it.  \n\n\n(Luckily, most of the test was measured more on rubrics (e.g. short answer responses as opposed to multiple choice), so they still had to come up with a way to phrase it in their own words).",
