He brags that, when people give a two-week notice, he immediately takes their office key, has them clean out their desk, and hands them a final paycheck. \n\nAfter 8 months of working for him, I call in \"needing extra rest\" one morning (I was at a job interview), then go in at 1 p.m. and tell him \"I quit.\" He asks me to finish out the day's work, which I do. \n\nAt the end of the day, he comes to my desk and asks me to at least finish out the week, stating I put them in a hard spot for not giving a two-week notice. \n\nI remind him that on my first day of employment he told me he did not accept two-week notices and that is why I did not give a two-week notice. \n\nI received my final paycheck and walked out with a smile on my face!",

            "I was once working for a IT firm that focused on Healthcare Providers. It was a good gig for the most part...... until they started making cuts, making bad judgement calls on policies, and demanding way more work out of us rather than hiring more people. They wanted me to do 8 hours a day(plus a one hour lunch) during normal business hours, and then do server updates after hours. The main reason they wanted me on that role is because \u201cUpdates are absolutely critical\u201d. I was salary, so I asked if I work over 40 hours, can I get those excess hours comp\u2019d to me as out of office time? They said sure. But what they didn\u2019t tell me at first, is that they\u2019d calculate the time after the end of the month. First month, I clocked in at average 65 hours a week because they wanted me to work the 8+maintenance hours. They didn\u2019t give me any hours as comp time. \n\nI began to hate working there from the long hours and then ignoring my pleas for more support since I was the only guy doing updates at night for all of the client\u2019s servers. It got to the point where I felt ostracized from the team as I was always tired and getting scrutinized for \u201cunder performing\u201d and not closing out as many tickets as the rest of the team. Which in it own way sucked since my tickets were a product of automation and were never closed out by me, but by the system once the servers were verified as updated. The system was then against me and I couldn\u2019t prove them wrong. I was put on a PIP. I tried to fight it by proving that the number of tickets that I close are actually greater than what the other team members are closing by counting the tickets that are automatically closed by the automation system, but they didn\u2019t want to hear it and things got heated. I was verbally bashed by the manager for \u201chalf-ass\u2019ing\u201d and that was it. Breaking point reached. I found another job that was going to pay me more, put me in a role that I wanted to be in, and be on a team that I would personally manage and help make better. \n\nI put my two weeks notice in and they really showed their true colors. I sent a nice email to my team for being awesome and enjoying the time I had with them. After I sent the email I was pulled aside and said they didn\u2019t need my position any longer since \u201cit\u2019s only updates\u201d.

        "selftext": "So this didn't happen to me, but an attorney that I work with regularly as part of my job.  He moved from a very high COL area to our rural community.  Sold his $2,000,000 house, paid off and inherited from his grandparents, and bought 50+ acres with a huge house in a bedroom community that has a lot of dairy farms.  He always used to say how it was much better living up here, both in terms of the lifestyle and monetarily, as his urban $2,000,000 house had property taxes in excess of $40,000 / year.\n\nNow, in addition to the huge house, the property was mostly fields, 40ish acres, and had a 10-acre or so large woodlot.  After he moved into his new house, the attorney was approached by his neighbor, one of the area dairy farmers.  The farmer told the attorney how he had a handshake agreement with the former owner of the attorney's home/property.  The farmer would mow the fields for hay 2-3 times per year and would harvest a sustainable amount of trees out of the woodlot.  In exchange, the former property owner got 10% of the chopped wood, which was more than enough to heat the house all year long without having to run the oil boiler for anything more than hot water.\n\nThe farmer wanted to keep this arrangement going, as it had worked out well for both parties for over a decade.  The attorney thought the former owner was being taken advantage of and refused to do a handshake agreement, but told the farmer to give him a week to draw up a proper contract.  The farmer was not overjoyed with making this out to be more than a gentlemen's agreement, but agreed to come back the following week.  The attorney decided that what would be \"fair\" was that the farmer should pay him $1,000 each time he mowed the fields for hay, since the farmer would feed the hay to his cows for \"free\" otherwise (completely ignoring that the farmer was using his own equipment and time to do the haying) and that the lawyer deserved 50% of the chopped wood, not 10%, or at least the 50% of the revenue the farmer got from selling the excess chopped wood (again ignoring the equipment and time investment of the farmer).  As you can guess, the farmer refused.\n\nThis all happened in late 2019, when the fields were rather bare and the supply of chopped wood for the house was full.  Well here comes 2020 and now the fields start looking like garbage, because none of the other farmers will pay to hay the fields.  In fact, after speaking with the first farmer, all of the other area farmers are unwilling to mow the fields unless the attorney pays **them** $1,000 per mowing.  And, of course, come wintertime the attorney's woodpile is depleted and he has to use the oil boiler to heat his entire home, costing well over $300 / month in winter heating costs.\n\nNow we come to early 2021, tax prep season.  The farmer, being a good a dutiful community minded citizen, informs the town that he did not cultivate any of the attorney's land for the entirety of 2020, nor did he know of any other farmers who did.  Well, as it turns out this is a big deal, because in our state farmland is assessed at a much lower value than residential property and additionally has a seperate and lower tax rate.  The attorney's land had previously been entirely zoned as farmland, except for the house and a few acres of lawn around it.  Now, the town sent out an assessor and rezoned the entire 50+ acres as residential, which more than tripled the taxable property value and imposed the residential tax rate rather than the much lower farm tax rate.  The attorney was quite surprised and furiously told me, and everyone else we work with, all this past  week how he's going to sue the town because they now expect him to pay $50,000 / year in property taxes.\n\n\n\ntl;dr - City attorney buys huge farm estate in rural community.  Refuses to work with farmer neighbor who used to maintain the property.  Property now looks like shit, attorney has extra bills, and the entire estate got rezoned costing the attorney $50,000 / year in property taxes.",

But since it was a start up firm, we didn't have a lot of man power and the ones we had weren't as qualified either. I was one of the very few qualified enough to handle a team of my own. The boss trusted me with almost everything. I was like the second in command after the boss only because I was managing a lot of things on the side as a volunteery basis. Things like paycheck balancing, client meetings, quality assurance, documentation, and other stuff which he should had hired someone else to do. I was good at it and he took full advantage of it by giving me things to do that never was under my job description.\n\nOne day he had this bright idea that we should revamp our website to attract more clients. And he gave this project to his nephew who just graduated from college as a developer of sorts. After a week or so the nephew came up with the first draft of the website and the boss was fairly disappointed as it didn't look anywhere near to what he expected. He then called me in and asked me if I knew anything about website design.\n\nAt that time I was very much interested on UI/UX and was doing an online course to learn about it more. So I told him that I'll see what I can do.\n\nI spent the next week full making a proper information architure, wireframes and colour guidelines that the nephew could pick up and build the website from scratch. In the end the website looked futuristic and the boss was pretty happy.\n\nBut during the week my other 'responsibilities' were put in a backlog and it just kept piling on. I knew I would be able to cover it once am done with the website and didn't pay too much attention to it.\n\nThe next week my boss caught up with backlog and called me in to his cabin. He started yelling at me for all the 'responsibilities' that I didn't attend to. I calmly told him that I was working on the website and its not a big deal. Told him that I would clear it out as soon as possible. But he wasn't happy. He asked me why I spent so much time doing something that isn't even my responsibility. I told him that I was learning about UI/UX and was pretty much interested to learn more. ( I obviously never thought about perusing it as a career because frankly I was a mechanical engineer by qualification and didn't think jumping to IT would be easy)\n\nThe boss snapped and told me that I should quit and peraue my 'hobby' as a living. He said that only then I will understand how lucky I am to have a job that pays.\n\nI kind of got offended because 1. He doesn't even pay me the worth of things i do for the company and 2. He knew I could cover and yet took this as a opportunity to 'discipline' me.\n\nI stepped out of this cabin, went to my desk and put in my resignation and went home.\nHe called me a couple of times asked me to revoke my resignation and then made other people from the organization call me to convince me to come back. I wasnt having it at all.\n\nIt's been 2 years now, I decided to persue UI/UX as a career now and am working as a product designer in one of the biggest organisations in the country with a pay that's almost 300% more than what I was getting as a mechanical engineer.\n\nUpdate 1: To all the people who wanted to know the company status today, the company was shut down because they had to pay a huge penalty for not being able to deliver the last project I was handling. Then covid hit and they had to reduce pay for all the other staff which lead to people leaving. Eventually the company went bankrupt for not being able to keep up financially after covid. \n\nUpdate 2: for all the people who want to know the steps I persued to have a career in UI/UX, I did the online certification course from googIe and spent a lot of time solving whiteboard challenges preparing myself to be a problem solver. Then I got the opportunity to intern for a service based agency for a few months where I dedicated my time to learn as much as possible and then when I though I was ready, I applied to all the openings I found on LinkedIn and other job portals until I finally landed a job with this tech unicorn startup. While I was working as an intern I also invested in a Bootcamp certificate course from an organization called designboat in India and also some certificate course from Interaction design Foundation. \n\nHope I was helpful, but if you still need to talk, hit me up on chat I will surely help you.",

We'll then see how important your 3 minutes are when they are costing the company money.\n\nLittle did I realise at the time but the guys job was bonus related and linked to our productivity, which tanked after that because all the other gangs followed my lead, except the brown nose gangs obviously.\nThree weeks go by with an absolute shit show in customer service complaints about their work not being carried out in a timely manner \nMy productivity dropped from 7 jobs per day down to 4.\n\nAnd Mr Numbnuts gets called in by his bosses to try and explain wtf is going on, \nHe tried to spin some bs story that I'd turned all the guys against him for no reason and that this was the result.\n\nLittle did he know that I'd actually trained his boss when he first started with the company 15 years before and wanted to come out and find out what we do and experience how hard the job is, he surprised me by working a full month on the repair crews before going back to the office.\n Anyhow the boss calls me in to find out what is really going on, so I explained how he'd used the tracker to monitor what time I'd left the yard and that I'd guesstimated my finish time and over estimated by 3 minutes because I was absolutely knackered after working a shift from hell on-call .\nConclusion, manager was let go for misuse of the tracking system, as it's only supposed to be used for emergencies and not monitoring and we had our on-call system reviewed to cut the hours we were having to work.\n\nEdit apologies for it being so long arsed\n\nEdit 2 NO apologies for format or spelling and grammar, that's just me.\n\n This isn't an English exam it's the freaking internet, get a grip.\n\nHoly shit, this blew up quickly.",

            "An old place I worked for came at us all hard for clocking in 2-3 minutes late. They even switched to (and spent a lot of money on, I'm sure) a new time keeping company where everyone had to call in on a landline phone to clock in/out. We only had 2 phones for an entire crew of 48 employees,  so there'd be these long lines to clock in, causing people's time to post later than their actual arrival. They became so strict about these few late minutes that they began handing out write ups left and right (mind you, all over less than 5 minute differences.  They let it be known: \"Just because you stay late doesn't mean you can come in a little late..,etc.\" So we all started sticking to our clock in/out times to the letter. Clocking in and out exactly on time, and if you were last in line and missed the exact 60-second window to clock in, you went home for the day! You received more of a punishment for clocking in late than going home and calling out sick or whatever ( you only got written up after 3 absences in a row). So we basically took turns \"taking off,\" and most of us were only working 2 - 3 days a week! The icing on the cake was that we were all repeatedly staying late - off the clock - to get stuff we really needed done before our next shift. So they also ended up missing out on free work, and duties started piling up! Several people were let go after \"excessive absences\" after using up all their sick/personal days, but prior to that, hardly anyone ever took a day off. We had a really demanding job and knew if we didn't show up, someone else would have to pull our weight. However, once we all collectively decided to stick ot to them, we didn't mind the staff shortage thing. We were having so much fun watching the whole system crumble. After about 6 months of no one working and massive amounts of work not getting done, they caved and went back to the old honor system.  It's funny, I think most workers go above and beyond for their employers,  but they're so shady themselves that they always think others are trying to screw them, and instead, they end up screwing themselves.",

        "selftext": "This happened a couple of years ago. I was working on a part time basis in a small firm owned by friends. Pay was not very good, but the atmosphere was and I was allowed to set my own timings. So life was good overall.\n\nThen a friend whom I knew only through social media approached me for a job in her company. Even though they were offering good money I turned down the offer as I knew I could not get the benefits I was getting in my current job. Plus the commute to the new office was very long. I would have to travel 2 hrs one way and change 3 trains just to reach office.\n\nA month later the HR of the new firm approached me again. They offered me almost four times the money I was making and I could set my own work hours. There was also extra pay for working overtime and on weekends. This was important. I joined the new company.\n\nMy friend did not know the terms of the new agreement I had with HR. She used to act like I owed her big time for the opportunity I got. So one day I corrected her. I told her that I had turned down the offer she had been part of and one month later I had had my own negotiations and I got much more favorable terms. So I was here because her company really needed me and not because of her.\n\nI didn't share the details of my agreement with her, but we both realized that she was making significantly lesser than me. This totally changed her attitude towards me.\n\nNow she wanted me out and I was determined to stick through for at least a year. So she decided that she would make it very difficult for me to work so that I quit on my own.\n\nThere are a lot of stories I have about how she tried every trick in the book to make me quit. I'm sharing some of them here.\n\nShe was my manager and was in charge of allocating work.\n\n**Malicious Compliance - 1**\n\nShe started piling on more work on me than any other member of the team. I was happy to comply - she did not know that as part of my contract I would be paid 1.5 times the hourly rate for every hour I worked OT and 2 times the hourly rate if any work was allocated to me over weekends or holidays.\n\nEvery time she tried to ruin my weekend by calling me to office unnecessarily, I happily complied. This continued till the time I left the organization and told her how much extra money she had helped me make.\n\n**Malicious Compliance - 2**\n\nAfter the long commute to work, I used to be hungry so I developed the habit of stopping at the food court to pick up a glass of fresh fruit  juice and carry it with me to work.\n\nMy manager thought that this way she could harass me without actually seeming to do so. So she sent a notice that bringing liquids to office was a hazard.\n\nIronically she used to have coffee delivered to get desk 3 times a day. Well, I pointed out that the rule applied to her as well and if I couldn't have my juice, she couldn't have her coffee. She had to literally spend an extra unpaid hour at work every time she wanted her special coffee.\n\nMeanwhile I was happy to leisurely sit in the food court - have my glass of fresh fruit juice with some snacks and then begin my work day half hour later than usual.\n\n**Edit -1**\n\nWhoa!! This blew up and how. I didn't expect that this post would receive so much response. These two were the least of the incidents of my work life with this woman.There are a lot of comments and messages about this post and while I would love to answer all of them individually, since they more or less relate to the same subject I'll add the clarifications here below.\n\n1. A common question people have posted is why my manager did not know my **pay structure**. I work in India and here salary structure is kept strictly confidential. It can be grounds for firing to reveal or ask for someone's salary. Basically the way the system works is that every new hire negotiates their salary on the basis of last drawn pay, experience and qualifications. It is very common for two people working on same level to have vastly different pay structures.\n2. **Overtime:** Usually people in Management level do not get overtime. I had a 7 year gap in my career and when I started working again I chose to work in a different field, so even though I was drawing a high salary I didn't belong to the Management level. My manager was not aware of it. When she assigned e work she assumed I would be working without pay.\n3. **I owed her.** NO. No organization hires anyone on the basis of recommendation. They hire people on the basis of what they bring to the table, how they seem to fit into the organization's growth plans and culture. I was able to prove that I was worthwhile investment for the company.This goes out to all. If someone tells you that they did you a favor by recommending you - don't feel overly obligated. Yes they did you a good turn. But you got the job on your own merit. Be professional at work and do not go out of your way to return perceived favors.\n4. **Was she a \"friend\"** \\- No, not towards the end. Initially I knew her only through social media. As we worked together I developed a friendly working relationship with her. When she began harassing me, the dynamics changed. Though I made sure that nothing in my attitude, behavior or demeanor would give any indication of hostility from my end.\n5. **Negotiations** \\- How was I able to get such a beneficial pay structure? I was working part time before. The first offer I had was double my salary - but it actually worked out to the same salary structure since I would have to work full time. I took a calculator to my meeting with the HR and showed them how with my increased travel cost and time spent on commute I would be more out of pocket taking their job. This is how I was offered OT, flexible timings and a high base salary.\n\n**Edit - 2**\n\nLink to my other story about this manager. I have a lot of stories about her. As I keep posting them, I'll update the links here for those who are interested in following the saga.   \n\n\nThe Uber ride that didnt turn out to be a freebie like she expected:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/ndos8b/manager\\_tries\\_to\\_scam\\_me\\_into\\_paying\\_for\\_her/gyekio6/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/ndos8b/manager_tries_to_scam_me_into_paying_for_her/gyekio6/?context=3)",

Simple. \n\nI used to supervise the bar while my landlord dealt with the office stuff to help balance the workload. It was a great job overall - decent wage, was right on my doorstep and the regulars were class. Except one. We shall call her Karen.\n\nKaren was getting married to one of the regulars and was a complete bitch. She was this horrible morbidly obese woman who would complain about the size of the stools and how it doesn\u2019t fit her. What\u2019s worse is she doesn\u2019t acknowledge you. She would just huff and puff until she gets a new drink - I HATED that and so did every member of staff.\n\nOne day I got fed up and ignored her because she snapped at me for saying hello. The situation went as follows:\n\nKaren: \u201cwell aren\u2019t you going to serve me?!\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\nK: \u201cErr, Grandma\u2019s rules?! My grandma would be offended if I sat here with an empty glass for too long!\u201d\n\nI immediately had a lightbulb moment and waited my moment to strike. I served her as normal and spoke to my landlord about her in the office. I explained what I wanted to do and he gave me the go ahead.\n\nI went back to the bar where she was spitting fire at the new bar girl I was training. I just calmly told the bar girl to ignore her, serve the customers. I then took her drinks, poured them down the sink and asked her to leave.\n\nKaren: \u201cWHAT ARE YOU DOING?!\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cSorry, Grandma\u2019s Rules.

        "selftext": "18 years ago (Not about, trust me, I know this one to the date) I was over Dad's house and I needed a wrench, and coming from a long line of mechanics, I knew he's have one available as I didn't have my kit in my car, so I asked to borrow one.\n\nDad of course said yes, handed me the mechanic's tool box, and just out of habit, I opened it and immediately noticed that a Craftman's 7/16, ratchet-end wrench was missing.\n\nAgain, I come from a LONG line of mechanics; every tool has its place, be it in a drawer, box or outlined on a peg board, and I thought it was weird that Dad lost a wrench out of the spare / house tool kit.\n\n\"You're missing a 7/16.\" I pointed out, showing him the missing slot.\n\nNow Dad, being Dad, just had to bust on me a bit, so looking me dead in the eyes and beaming a huge smile he responded: \"It was there when I gave it to you.\"\n\nMind you, I hadn't left the kitchen. I hadn't so much as shifted my FEET. I knew he was lying, he knew he was lying, but it had been ingrained in me since childhood that losing a tool is a death sentence.\n\nNow, I knew he was busting my balls and I let it go; but from that day forward, anytime we needed something, he'd make a comment like \"Sure wish I had that 7/16th wrench that Coyote lost.\" or \"You know what would fix it? That missing 7/16th wrench.\" \n\nThis went on for MONTHS. So one day, he made the usual \"tease me for losing a tool\" comment and I warned him. I looked him in the eyes and said:\n\n\"Say it ONE more time old man, and you're going to get that wrench every Birthday, Father's Day and Christmas for the rest of your natural life.\"\n\nFew hours passed, I asked him to hand me a tool and he said: \"I can't you lost it, remember?\" \n\nI laughed, and played it off -but it was on...and that was 18 years ago.\n\nToday, being Father's day, he just received his 52nd craftsman's ratchet-end, 7/16th wrench.\n\nSince that day, he's tried telling me that he knows that I didn't lose it, (I knew that already) that I don't need to buy it (Oh, I fucking DO.), and he's occasionally tried to say it was a different size or item to get a different present, but we both know that's not happening.\n\nThey're everywhere. Every coffee can, junk drawer, cabinet, tool box, peg board or spare nail in the house and garage contains a Craftsman's 7/16 ratchet end wrench. You know how they say you're never more than 8 feet from a spider? Well in Dad's world, you're never more the 7 feet from a Craftsman's 7/16 ratchet end wrench, because there are at least two in his truck at this point as well.\n\nWhen will it end? When the old bastard dies. The last wrench will go in his cold, dead hand so he can tighten bolts in hell, because I warned him.\n\nGoddamnit. I warned him.\n\nHappy Father's Day to all of you with weird traditions, jokes and relationships with the man who made you who you are today. And if you need a wrench, hit me up - I know a guy.\n\nTL:DR - Dad teased me about losing a tool that he lost, and I've replaced it as of today, 52 times.\n\n** Update #53: https://imgur.com/a/4qOGTbv  **",

            "Reminds me of when my brother and sister both realized they were getting my dad spatulas for Christmas. Both of them were getting these nice looking ones that were on the expensive side for spatulas. So my sister was like \u201cmake sure you get him something else.\u201d Well fuck that, I understand my dad. AND the Walmart I worked at at the time was selling these metal spatulas for 25 CENTS each on clearance, left over from the summer grilling stuff that they ordered WAY too much of. Spent like $50 on these fucking spatulas, and then I started having fun. I know my dad enjoys the act of unwrapping something, so I found different boxes and containers to put them in. Also threw in some books to make it more interesting, he doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s a book or a spatula. Christmas came around and he got to my gifts to him and went \u201cI like seeing all these gifts, but I swear if there\u2019s one more spatula in this I\u2019m gonna lose it.\u201d Had to hide my shit eating grin as I handed him the big box of all the spatulas I couldn\u2019t get into other containers.

I told him I remember giving it to him in the garage when I was finishing up on the door, but I wasn't sure after 7-8 months. He gave me a ration of crap about it, saying he looked all over and he claimed I never gave it to him. I didn't argue, but he told me to buy a new remote and get it connected and he would pay me, so I did. He still gave me a bit of crap about it from time to time.\n\nThis late spring I was at his house looking for something and open the junk drawer in the kitchen. I was digging around and what the heck, there was the remote. Obviously I did give it to him and he just dropped it in the junk drawer and forgot about it. (He is in his 90's so I guess it is forgivable. Any way I knew he was outside so I walked outside. He was in the yard in view of the garage door. I walked up and said, \"Look what I found!\" and opened the garage door with the remote. He looked at me and asked what I had and I pointed to the door and closed it while he was looking that way and then I handed him the remote. I told him where I found it and he didn't say much. I gave him a bit of crap that I had not been certain I gave it to him, but was about 75% sure I had. He mentioned that my memory was obviously better than his!",

            "Back when I was a teenager one of my friends had a father who hated shopping.  He would traditionally only go Christmas shopping on Dec 24, starting at 6 PM.  As such he was always in a mad rush, and would just sweep up whatever random stuff he could find.\n\nOne year in January she complained to us, in a quite indignant tone, that on Christmas morning she rushed down the stairs and the first thing that she saw was a spatula sticking out of her stocking.  She went on and on about how terrible it was that her father thought that a spatula would make a great Christmas gift for a 16 year old girl.\n\nAnd that's when a plan was hatched.\n\nYou see her birthday was in February, and we all made a vow together.  On her birthday every one of us presented her with a spatula.  She had all kinds of spatulas, wrapped in every conceivable manner.  Every present that she opened was another spatula.\n\nOf course she vowed revenge.  Every birthday from then on she would gift each one of us with a spatula.\n\nAnd that's how a tradition was born.\n\nSoon the spatulas were flying back and forth between our entire group.  Birthday?  You get a spatula.  Christmas?  Spatula time.  And who can forget the traditional graduation spatula.\n\nIt was glorious.\n\nAnd guys, I have so many spatulas now.  I have them in every colour.  I have them in every size.  Comically oversized spatulas?  I have 3.  Comically undersized spatulas, probably  intended for doll houses?  They're more of a foot hazard than legos are.  Ever hear of the [Malaysian Battle Spatula](https://www.questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=540)?  I have one.  How about a [Hydro-Dynamic Spatula](https://spongebob.fandom.com/wiki/Hydro-dynamic_spatula) with port and starboard attachments and turbo drive?  Well, I haven't actually received on of those yet, but I just know that it's a matter of time.\n\nThe tradition has spread to my kids.  Every Christmas they get a spatula in their stockings.  every Christmas I get three.\n\nYou've probably heard of rick-rolling?

I trusted most of the tools were there so made an offer on it all without sorting and loaded up. As I found time back at home I went through those buckets and started to piece the sets back together.

            "This reminds me of the on going in joke my mom and I have. (I'm 32F this happened when I was like 15)  \n\n\nWhen I was a teenager she came up to me and asked me if I had seen her purple foot massager. I said no. She said it was in the junk drawer the last time she saw it. My mom had a drawer in her room that was a \"junk drawer\" but that actually useful stuff in it, like nail clippers, that we all got into now and again. This is important later.  \n\n\nI told \"Still nope mom. Haven't seen it.\" So she launches into a description of what her purple foot massager looks like. She explains it's a remote with a wire leading from it and a little ball on the end that vibrates and that you use the ball on your feet. I'm sure some of you already recognize this for what it actually is but my brain back then did not. I tell her again I haven't seen it.  \n\n\nWeeks go by of my mom occasionally asking me if I have seen her purple foot massager with me constantly telling her no. She finally stops one day and tells me she found it. I think nothing of it. Then I go to the junk drawer in her room for a pair of nail clippers. What do I see? The \"purple foot massager\" and upon actually seeing it I realize what it was.  \n\n\nI storm out of my moms room to the kitchen and just yell at her, \"You thought I stole your fucking vibrator mom??? Seriously??? Why would I EVER use YOUR vibrator???\" If I remember right it was because she had recently found my small porn stash in my room and just assumed I took it lol. But like.... ew mom no.  \n\n\nEver since it has been an on going joke for over 15 years now where, whenever possible, I buy her a purple massager of some kind. Christmas time? I buy her one of those vibrating back massagers in the color purple. That kind of thing. There was even one year when I got her one and she had it on her coffee table. My teenage sister came home with a friend and that friend....THOUGHT IT WAS A VIBRATOR! I bout died laughing when my mom told me that in a twist of irony she had to explain that a literal massager was in fact not a sex toy. That she did not just casually leave her vibrator on her coffee table for guests to see.  \n\n\nHowever... I had never been able to find an actual foot massager that was purple. This year for mothers day I FINALLY found a foot roller that was purple. The look of disappointment/exasperation when I gave it to her was hilarious XD. I found out the other day that she seems to begrudgingly actually like it though lol.",

I know it started with my aunt (moms sister) and if I remember correctly she first got a shadow box containing the remote that started it all. Since then the collection has grown exponentially. This started when they were teenagers and they're both over 50 now. Every single remote no longer in use has been collected. They have networked to collect remotes. And they hide them around each others houses when they visit one another. I don't know what the last count was, but my mom got the last strike. My grandparents were still finding remotes a year after her visit a few years back. To this day I don't know if they've found them all. There's also a couple of decorative plates that somehow ended up involved. Its crazy how competitive they get with it though. Hence why I try to stay as far out of it as humanly possible.",

While doing invoicing, I come across a work order that has a higher expense amount than invoice amount. Realizing we will be losing $100 on the job instead of at least breaking even, I decide to question the project manager (Chad) about it.\n\nMe- hey, I noticed this job has an anomaly. Can you explain it to me?\n\nChad- What are you talking about?\n\nMe- See the expenses? They reach a higher total than the amount you want me to bill for. I want to see if that was a mistake or\n\nChad- No! It\u2019s right.\n\nMe- if that\u2019s right, we\u2019re going to lose money on this job. You won\u2019t get commission and \n\nChad- I\u2019m telling you it\u2019s right. (Chad then rips the papers from my hand.) See, we charge a 20% markup right here. (He points to the wrong spot and has the audacity to look smug.) See, it\u2019s fine.\n\nMe- (I calmly take the papers back and show him to two amounts side by side) I see that, but you didn\u2019t account for that over here for the billing amount. The total billing amount is less than that. \n\nChad- Look, it\u2019s right and I don\u2019t have time to explain it to you. Just do it and stop bothering me.\n\nMe- no problem, can you just initial here so when our boss asks me why this job is invoiced so low, I can\n\nChad- sure fine, whatever. (Signs his name next the billing amount) now get out of my space\n\nI go back to my office and invoice the too low amount. I sent it off, fully knowing this was going to backfire, and kept all backups and copies handy for when it did.\n\nNext Monday, I have the boss in my office. The invoice in question is in his hand.\n\nBoss- hey, you did this invoice wrong. (Shows me the invoice)\n\nMe- actually, if you\u2019ll look at the backup, Chad told me that was the invoice amount. (I show him where Chad signed off)\n\nBoss- I\u2019ll be right back\n\nHe left my office. Roughly an hour later, I get called in to the boss\u2019 office. Chad is there, looking uncomfortable, and my boss is on the phone. He waved me inside and I sat down.\n\nBoss- alright. We\u2019re all here. Now, TandyAngie, please explain this to me.\n\nMe- I noticed that the expenses on this invoice were higher than the billing amount. Chad told me that the numbers were fine, and to just do the invoice.\n\nBoss- hear that Tex? (Tex is the sub contractor we used on this job)\n\nTex- yup. So what are we gonna do?\n\nBoss- only thing to do is fire them. They\u2019re either incompetent or cheating us. Either way, it\u2019s bad for business \n\nI am now very concerned for my job, but I sit silently. I know I don\u2019t have the whole story yet. \n\nTex- I recon you\u2019re right. Good luck. And don\u2019t worry about the park job. I got an opening up tomorrow I can squeeze in.\n\nBoss- thanks Tex. \n\nHe hangs up the phone and turns to Chad. Chad has gone from nervous to mad.\n\nChad- it\u2019s not my fault she can\u2019t do her job!\n\nBoss- you signed your name right next to the wrong amount. Now you\u2019re either working with someone in accounting over in Tex\u2019s company to steal from me, or you\u2019re too stupid to work here. Which is it?\n\nChad stands, as does my boss. I stood as well,  not liking being the only person sitting. Chad says nothing.\n\nBoss- you\u2019re fired. Get your computer and leave. (Boss turns to me) Go ahead and fill out the paperwork for his leave. Make sure to add that he attempted to embezzle money.\n\nI nod and leave. Chad stays there. As soon as I leave, the office explodes in screaming. I stayed in my office, doing the paperwork my boss asked me to fill out. I saw Chad leave later with his stuff thrown haphazardly into his bag. That was the last time I saw Chad. A friend saw him working at a cash register at a buffet place about a month later.\n\nTurns out, both my boss and Tex had agreed to lower their markups for the job so the invoice number was STILL too high (not too low), but I didn\u2019t know that until after the fact when my boss had me redo the paperwork for the entire job. Someone from accounting in Tex\u2019s company had altered the invoice sent to Chad, and they were planning on splitting the difference after we paid the altered bill.\n\nTLDR: Chad attempts to embezzle money for the first time and doesn\u2019t pay close enough attention to his numbers. Got caught and fired.",
