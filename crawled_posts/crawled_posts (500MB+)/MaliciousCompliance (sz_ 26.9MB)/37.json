        "selftext": "Some years ago I was driving pick up's and deliveries (P and D) for a trucking company in Denmark.  \nP and D is the part of the transport chain where you usually deliver small quantities to multiple customers on a route - kind of like UPS or FedEx but in semi's or rigid/box trucks. It was nearing the end of the day and I had to deliver a trampoline to a residential area - mind you this in EU, so things may be a bit different than in the US regarding rules and regulations.\n\nIt was a fairly new area with plenty of space - but I had to reverse in cause there was no way of turning around. But no problem - the road was wide and so were the corners I had to go around.  \nI put my semi in reverse and started going backwards - and of course I was delivering to the last house on the street. Now the road climbed a bit and was about 6 or 700 metres long - but it all went fine.   \nWhen I finally got to the end of the road and got out of my truck to unload this trampoline, some guy was already standing behind my truck and started yelling and swearing at me:  \nI was the biggest idiot on this earth!  \nHow the hell could I even think of going in there with a semi?  \nI could have run over all the kids in the neighbourhood. (no-one was out)  \nI had absolutely no valid reason for being there and could get the hell out of there right away!\n\nInstead of starting an argument with person, I calmly asked him where he lived - he pointed at the house and said \"Number 74\" - and low and behold, where was I delivering???  \nYou guessed it - number 74...\n\nSo I - again very calmly - told this man:  \n\"Well, in that case I have a trampoline for you...\"  \n\"Oh\" the man said \"Well, I would like if you could...\"  \n\"BUT!!!\" I interrupted \"Since I have no business being in here with a semi, I will be waiting for you at the end of the road\" and pointed to the direction I just came from...  \n\"Mind you - this is the big model weighing about 130 pounds, so you might want to bring a wheel barrow\".\n\nThe joy it was seeing him coming all the way down the road with his wheel barrow. And then trying to get this 130 pound trampoline up in the wheel barrow and starting his long heavy walk 700 metres up to his house again... Priceless!!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Spelling errors",

He finished rest of his deliveries and went back to base (note this was before mobile phones were common or cheap)  \n\n His boss was doing his nut because the knob in the beemer had been on the phone to them every 20 mins asking where their delivery was, hubby simply handed over the signed paperwork, explained what happened and clocked out.

Less than one kilometer, and driving the main road was a 6km detour. The shortcut was a private road and the locals got tired of big trucks driving on _their_ road.\n\nThey put up weight limits on the private road, 3.5 tons. I had an 18 ton box truck. No way I'd drive there.\n\nThe few times someone ordered goods to those addresses, I'd call and they'll go on babbling instructions. I'd listen patiently and then mention the weight limit. They'd get upset, but I cannot break the law. \n\nI'd meet them at the weight limit sign and unload the goods on the side of the road. \n\nOnce I delivered many long aluminum ladders and the customer had no other option than to carry them one by one.

We live in a Midwest US state, in a residential housing addition at the end of a cul-de-sac. We are mostly retirees, the houses here being built in the 1990s, many of the original residents still live here, and we moved here after retiring a few years ago. \n\nBut in the past few years more and more of us older folk have been moving out and young families with little ones have been moving in. Some days I'll see three or four little ones probably ages 3 to 6 on tricycles and scooters on our cul-de-sac or the road leading up to it. Once or twice I've had one pop out in front of the car and I was headed in or out. I now try to drive around 10 mph (\\~16 kph) down the last bit of our road. It feels 'stupid' slow after 60 some years as a driver, but I can't imagine how I'd feel if I ran over one of those little ones. \n\nWhile I can understand where the guy is coming from, as I said at the start it doesn't excuse him for acting like a jerk and it made me smile when he reaped the rewards for doing that.",

I just copied and pasted right from my other post. \nObligatory I'm on mobile so forgive me for formatting.\n\n\n\nSo my last relationship was beyond bad, he was all sorts of abusive and controlling.  At one point I had the strength to break up with him but then we got back together after we discussed some things.  Stupid I know, but yeah love and all that.  Well anyways one of the things we agreed on was that he and I would stop drinking alcohol because he was beyond crazy aggressive when he drank, and I wanted to support his sobriety.  This is REALLY important.\n\nFast forward about eight months or so and we got into a huge fight and I not only broke up with him, I kicked him out of the house and told him he wasn't ever allowed back inside. We'd been living together over a year at this point so his mom got in touch with me about getting his stuff.  While on the phone with her I could hear him in the background saying, \"make sure they get everything I own or bought.  I want it all back.\". Apparently even stuff he gifted me he wanted back, but honestly I didn't care, I was happy to get rid of anything related to him.  While cleaning our room up and gathering EVERYTHING I started to come across numerous bottles and cans of alcohol.  It seems he had been drinking again for a while and was hiding the evidence in the room. I mean he was hiding them under the bed, in his guitar case, rolled up in his clothes, in some old backpacks of mine and so on and so forth.\n\nHe had said he wanted everything of his, so any bottle and the few unopened cans I found went straight into one of the garbage bags of his stuff.  By the time I had gathered everything up, I had 3 bags of stuff and one was basically all just the alcohol.\n\nDropping them off was just so satisfying.  He actually called moments after I left his parents place ranting about how petty and immature I was being.  My response? \"Well you wanted all of your stuff back, and those definitely weren't mine.  Plus I figured you'd probably need a drink to deal with the breakup.\". I promptly ended the call and blocked him on everything.  Most satisfying thing I've ever done.\n\nEdit:  Firstly thank you everyone for the words of encouragement and everything.  This happened years ago, but knowing people are still proud of me for leaving means the world to me. \n\nAlso there's definitely a lot about this story that didn't get posted, such as cops having to be involved and other things.  I didn't put open cans or unscrew and bottle lids just for the fact I didn't want to risk ruining his stuff as that'd be a huge headache and everything.",

One day I get my expense request denied for the Uber that took me to the airport because \u201cit was close enough to walk and as per company policy taxi/Uber is only for Pearson\u201d. This was all over $12 which I was doing for months. Ok, fine. \n\nNext flight I booked in Pearson. The ticket was $900 instead of $400, I paid $70 in an Uber to get there instead of $12, and I had to leave work a full 3.5 hours before my flight to make it through check in, security, etc to get to my gate in time. Usually I\u2019d be on some sort of call leading up to my flight but here I couldn\u2019t do any work at all. Sorry team, I\u2019m unavailable for the rest of the day because of company policy. \n\nCome back and I\u2019m asked why my expense report was double the usual amount I\u2019d put in. It\u2019s because I can\u2019t expense a $12 uber to Billy Bishop airport and I\u2019m not going to walk for 40 minutes in my suit and dress shoes in the middle of January in the snow. 2 months later it\u2019s now cost them $2000+ over what I\u2019d normally have spent.  Some of the flights in that time were over $1000 vs the $400 at the Island Airport. \n\nFinally I get an email one day saying I can take whichever flights I deem best based on my judgement and that any amount under $700 is auto approved at the Island Airport. Now I get to eat a nice meal and sometimes upgrade myself to premium seats and still fall within budget!",

            "I had a similar situation back in 2000.  I lived in Texas and was doing I/T consulting for a Federal Agency in Washington DC.  The company I worked for had just switched the travel agency that arranged all of our flights, hotels and rental cars.  Their orders were to save money whenever possible.  I regularly flew into Reagan National because it had convenient flight times and was just a metro ride away from our corporate apartment and that goverment agency I was consulting for.  \n\n\nThe travel agency decided that it was 74 dollars cheaper to have me fly into BWI (Baltimore).  I raised the issue with my boss (Company Owner) and he dismissed me saying do what the travel agency says.  So they had me fly into BWI.  This necessitated a 97 minute 125 dollar cab ride to the corporate apartment.  The malicious compliance occurs on Friday when I am returning home.  I depart the goverment agency at 11:30 AM to catch another 97 minute cab ride to BWI to catch my 3:30 flight back to Texas (next flight was 7:30).   So to save 74 dollars in air fare we had $250 in cab fares as well as 5 hours of missed billable time ($1,250).

Only a half-hour flight time which was much better than a 3-4 hour drive with heavy traffic, full parking lots, shuttle to the terminal, etc.\n\nHowever, one of the execs decided that we were all to get a car service to the hubs as the commuter flights were too expensive.

Before I joined job there were 2 people doing my job, both left before I joined. I was alone doing the job of 2 people. Weekly reports being sent to client \"head\" and client would visit job site once a year. \n\nSo here goes. As a means of control and reporting there a general mailbox to where client should send all requests that needed to be addressed. Had to deal with 30 to 40 different people from the client side plus client\"head\". They didn't give a shit about said mailbox, would always email my inbox ignoring said general one almost always. \nSince I was alone doing the work of 2 people, I was almost always behind on the workload and would get the idiots on the other side constantly complaining to the client \"head\". Who in turn would complain to my managers, how is it possible that OP can't deal with 7 or 8 daily emails and be behind on his work. Weekly report stated I was only getting 7/8 emails from the client a day, completely ignoring the fuckin phone, personal inbox, Skype chat which were the ways people were contacting me every day. \n\nSo client \"head\" complains to managers and escalates me for being a lazy idiot that can't even handle a handful of emails a day. \n\nManagers setup meeting to grill me. OP  you always look so busy and you're only getting a handful of emails a day and constantly behind on your work. How is this possible? Client isn't happy and you either improve dramatically or client wants us to replace you. I explained that general mailbox wasn't the only thing I did, mentioning all other means through which client idiots were requesting things. \nSo solution to show client \"head\" what was being done, I was told I needed to register on an excel sheet everything, EVERY THING I did during the day. I asked for clarification, you mean emails and calls right? No, no EVERYTHING. And email the excel at the end of workday.\n\nSo here goes my malicious compliance. \nI did exactly what I was told, wrote down everything I did during the workday, even including bathroom, smoke and coffee breaks. \nClient writes on Skype, I write down timestamp when client asks for something and timestamp of each and every reply, \nAll adding to an excel at around 500 lines every day with my personal favorite of adding a line at the end \"time wasted to fill in sheet, 1 hour\"\n\n1 manager laughs when he sees my full compliance, other one not so much but knows can't do shit cause I did what I was told. A few months later when client \"head\" visits tells me he fuckin loved it.\n\nWas told to stop doing it on the 3rd day. They were now aware of what I did during the day :)",

            "This makes me chuckle, because one of my prior help desk departments (which operated on Cost Recovery) *operated like this*.\n\nWe all tracked our time to at least the 5 minute interval, if not more fine-grain than that. We spent a half hour a day inputting all our tracked time into a billing system. Things like official legal break time were \"billed\" internally to our own department as a cost of operating/having employes, and the rest was either \"lost money\" e.g. when we had a departmental meeting, or needed to clean up our cubicles after a project ended, etc. or else it got billed to a client with explanation of what that 'work entry' was for.\n\nSo - yes. I documented that I spent 3 minutes making coffee, 1 minute opening Access and logging that time, 5 minutes peeing, 4 minutes ~~asking~~ answering a user's question because they found me in the hall leaving the restroom, 2 minutes pouring a coffee and saying good morning to my office-mate, 2 more minutes entering time, and 1 minute logging into email/etc to begin the day.\n\nOur billing system's minimum time increment was 0.1 Hr (6 Minutes) so sometimes if you were studious about logging and entering time honestly & accurately, you could actually recuperate some of your \"lost hours\" during the day by adding up one \"bonus\" minute here, one there, in doing so saving your biling percentage rate for the week!! (We had to hit about a 65% billable ratio for break-even on our own positions/benefits, to keep the department from turning into a net loss.)\n\nP.S. This client?\n\n>  5 minutes peeing, 4 minutes ~~asking~~ answering a user's question because they found me in the hall leaving the restroom\n\nYup, they got billed for 6 minutes - They shouldn't have asked a help desk question, otherwise it would've been \"my time\" costing me money!",
            "Lol, I did a similar thing once.\n\nI was transportation manager, but they had fired my Director and dispatcher without replacing them, so I was also doing those jobs. These aren't jobs you can normally schedule. You just deal with problems as they arise, and those problems ALWAYS interrupt the things that you can schedule. For instance, a dispatcher could do nothing but schedule loads for  2 hours and be done for the day, but with interruptions from drivers, customers, broken down trucks, pickup scheduling issues, etc., it might take all day.\n\nGeneral manager wanted my schedule. So first, I just gave a general breakdown like \"2hrs dealing with drivers, 1hr talking to customers, .5 hours dealing with truck breakdowns...\" That list alone was 2 pages long. It included a note that I was interrupted for 40 minutes by the drivers I managed while simply logging my time.\n\nGM didn't like it. He wanted a schedule. So I gave him one. I just blocked out approximate chunks of time that I spent on various issues. It was like 23 hours a day, 7 days a week. (It was an exaggeration, but I was working 80-100 hours a week at this point and included my 40 minute one-way commute in the schedule, so it wasn't that far off.)\n\nGM didn't believe that that was correct, so he sent me back to the drawing board.\n\nSo I gave him a 50 hour (give or take) per week schedule, basically just by cutting my previous schedule in half. \n\nGM accepted that until the next day when I ignored customers and employees who called me outside of the hours on my schedule.",

Generally speaking I think a better approach is to talk to your managers about how your performance is being measured based on the requests in the mailbox but are getting many more requests through other channels. Proposing to more heavily enforce only doing work that comes through the official channel (the mailbox) with rare exceptions of the **HIGHEST** of priority emergencies. After approval from managers, announce it to everyone on the client side that any other requests will be told to go through the mailbox, and be a hardass about it. Slack message, email, phone call, tell them explicitly and clearly it will not be done unless they send it to the mailbox. \n\nIt may not be work for everyone in every situation but most managers I've dealt with would gladly support the idea of enforcing pre-existing standards that are reasonable especially if it makes their lives easier, your life easier, and leads to overall better accountability.",

They finally investigated her after the person who replaced me quit and found she spent almost all day spying on employees, timing bathroom breaks, and asking employees to watch each other to make sure they're working and report to her if anyone makes a personal phone call or goes to the bathroom too often.

        "selftext": "I used to work at a regional airline. The jet we used for our flight to the \u201cbig city\u201d had 6 business class seats. The business class service was really good for a 2 hour flight. It included a full bar service, a hot meal, warmed bread basket, followed by a trolley with dessert and signature coffee. The good old days...\n\nOne of our regular travelers was a local business owner who was just\u2026 a slimy businessman (SB). He had a reputation for making a lot of money from some pretty shady deals over the years. We would roll our eyes when we saw him coming to the check-in counter because he would always name drop and ask for special treatment. He always used the business class check-in line even though he was usually in economy. He didn\u2019t have frequent flyer status, but he was buddies with one of the airline executives and always let us know this fact when he checked in by making sure to tell us that he was good friends with Vice President Karen. He would always ask for free upgrades, extra baggage, not charging a change fee, last-minute discounts, etc. If he didn\u2019t get what he wanted he immediately called VP Karen, who would usually then call us and approve whatever it was he wanted.\n\nSo one day SB checks in for his flight to the \u201cbig city\u201d and of course name drops and asks for a free upgrade to business class because \"I'm friends with VP Karen and said it would be ok.\" He was traveling on a discounted ticket that was not eligible for upgrade even if he did have an upgrade coupon, which he didn\u2019t.\n\nI informed him that he was not eligible for any upgrade on this ticket and gave him his boarding pass and sent him on his way. Of course he flips open his cell phone and immediately calls VP Karen. Within 2 minutes the phone at the check-in desk rings and it\u2019s VP Karen authorizing me to override the policy to upgrade SB to business class with no upgrade coupon required \u201cif there is room.\u201d\n\nThe flight that day wasn\u2019t that busy and only 1 person booked in business class leaving 5 open seats. I was really irritated but I begrudgingly put SB on the upgrade list anyways. He returned to the check-in counter and picked up his standby boarding card and gave me that smug \u201ctold you so\u201d look. But then what VP Karen said clicked with me - \u201cif there is room.\u201d\n\nThe next passenger I checked in was a SUPER nice lady, big smile, friendly, please and thank-you, oh thank-you so much for checking my bags to my connecting flight, that\u2019s so nice of you. I was taking my time and we were chatting a bit since it wasn\u2019t that busy. She was a teacher going on a trip to see her family and it was her first visit with them in over a year and was going to meet her new little nephew for the first time. She was overjoyed just to have the time off to travel.  I typed in a few things into the computer to make it look like I was checking something about her connecting flights and then said \u201cOh, you have been selected today to receive a free upgrade to business class.\u201d She was shocked. \u201cI\u2019ve never flown business class in my life! This is so amazing!\u201d\n\nAt that time we were rarely questioned if we upgraded someone without a certificate. Over the next 20 minutes I found excuses to upgrade four other passengers - one who worked for one of our top corporate accounts, one who was legitimately a frequent flyer, can\u2019t remember the other reasons, but by the time I went to board the flight I had to tell SB that I was sorry but business class was full and couldn\u2019t offer him an upgrade today.\n\nThe teacher I upgraded profusely thanked me again when she boarded with the rest of the business class passengers. Little did she know that it really made my day also!\n\n\\--\n\nThank you all for the votes and awards! I'm a long-time lurker but first time poster.  This will encourage me to share more tales from the airport. I could probably write a whole book about the crazy Karens, the very good and the very bad staff, the non-rev trips... anyone who has worked in the airline world knows it is unlike any other job. \n\nThere were no repercussions to my actions. We rarely upgraded passengers randomly so it wasn't something that caught management's attention, and they mostly trusted our judgment on these things. But, like many customer service jobs I'm sure, if you were nice to us we would go out of our way to help you. If you were not nice to us, we would apply the rules very strictly. Our boss did watch baggage like a hawk though - if you printed more bag tags than the passenger allowance without collecting the excess fee it showed on your daily report and you would be asked about it at the start of your next shift.

I didn't ask for or expect an upgrade, but she said \"you know what - I'm going to put you in first class\".  And I gotta say it was a pretty sweet flight. \n\nThat lesson always stuck with me, and since then I've applied it many times in other contexts.

For weeks they had been prepping for a meeting of powerful executives to discuss the safety of Google\u2019s products. The deck was done. But that afternoon Mr. Walker told his team the agenda had changed, and they would have to spend the next few days preparing new slides and graphs. At the Googleplex, famed for its free food, massages, fitness classes and laundry services, Mr. Pichai was also playing with ChatGPT. Its wonders did not wow him. Google had been developing its own A.I. technology that did many of the same things. Mr. Pichai was focused on ChatGPT\u2019s flaws \u2014 that it got stuff wrong, that sometimes it turned into a biased pig. What amazed him was that OpenAI had gone ahead and released it anyway, and that consumers loved it. If OpenAI could do that, why couldn\u2019t Google?\n\nElon Musk, the billionaire who co-founded OpenAI but had left the lab in a huff, vowed to create his own A.I. company. He called it X.AI and added it to his already full plate. \u201cSpeed is even more important than ever,\u201d Sam Schillace, a top executive, wrote Microsoft employees. It would be, he added, an \u201cabsolutely fatal error in this moment to worry about things that can be fixed later.\u201d \n\nSeparately, the San Francisco-based company announced plans for its initial public offering Wednesday.

The company said it aims to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol RDDT. \n\nApparently many shoppers are not happy with their local Safeway, if questions and comments posted Sunday on a Reddit forum are any indication.\n\nThe questions in the AMA (Ask Me Anything) were fielded by self-described mid-level retail manager at one of the supermarket chain's Bay Area stores. The employee only identified himself by his Reddit handle, \"MaliciousHippie\".\n\nThe manager went on to cover a potpourri of topics, ranging from why express lane checkers won't challenge shoppers who exceed item limits to a little-known store policy allowing customers to sample items without buying them.",

My son having a 2.5 hr nap on the way home meant he was in a good mood even though he didn't feel too good, and he was chatting with us all the way home in the car (40 min drive or so).  \n\nHonestly, I think the fact that I had a kid, and didn't start screaming about not getting on the flight helped me get that bump.

I had NO IDEA what was included or not. And it was a 4 hour long flight, across the US from NY to CA. So I got a meal, warm towel, warm cookie, the staff knew my NAME! \n\nI didn't even know alcohol was included, but I made up for that on future flights. \n\nBut the funniest part was the old man next to me.

He's reading a newspaper (like, actual paper newspaper. Huge, spread out open, not even folded up properly the way you're supposed to do on public transport). So he keeps rustling his paper and sighing. I started to feel self conscious, but I squashed that. Fuck that guy, I'm enjoying this. \n\nHe says!! \"UGH, it's like the Beverly Hillbillies goes to the airport!\" \n\nI was shocked and stared at him for a beat, then just laughed and continued pushing buttons. By that point I had figured out the buttons but now it was just a game to see if I could make him stroke out. \n\nSo for the entire four hour flight, I would occasionally readjust my seat minutely. Just a lil bit....enough to make him twitch. \n\nFuck that guy. Most folks aren't buying first class for a flight that short, so it's likely he was up there for the same reason as me; someone ELSE paid a bunch of money for him to fly and he earned status over time. \n\nIf he's not dead yet, I hope he still hears a phantom button press when he least expects it.",

A part of the job is testing customers pool/hot tub water to see what chemicals they needed.\n\nIf you don't take care of your pool or check it often, you need a lot of chemicals to fix the mess you've made. Particularly if you use chlorine pucks. They generally have such a low pH level that it burns away at your heater coil and causes you to have copper in your water.\n\nWell a couple years ago a customer came up to me to test their pool water. It was a complete mess and it had a bunch of copper it in. This isnt the exact conversation because it was a while ago, but this was the main points.\n\nMe: Yeah the main issue is your pH is so low its making your chlorine less effective, and you have copper in your water.\n\nCustomer: Yeah just get me the stuff I need to fix it.\n\nI go and grab all the chemicals he needs and put it on the counter.\n\nCustomer: How much is all of this going to cost?\n\nMe: Around $250\n\nCustomer: I'm not paying that much. Is all of this really necessary.\n\nMe: Yes. You won't be able to hold chlorine. And you need to get the copper out. If you oxidize copper with a shock, it's going to stain parts of your pool and can even tint you hair green. (If you have recently dyed blonde hair)\n\nCustomer: my daughter is having a pool party next weekend and I just want the pool to have chlorine for then.\n\nMe: Yes, and you need all of this to make sure you're good to go.\n\nCustomer: Can you just put everything away and only give me the chlorine?\n\nMe: Fine. (I'm not going to argue. I don't work on commission.)\n\nFast forward a couple days and the customers wife came in. It was subtle, but you could tell her hair had a funny tint to it. She asked for all the chemicals that I recommended to her husband and she paid with zero hesitation. The husband never came in ever again and his wife took care of the pool from that moment forward. The next time the wife came in, it looked like her hair had been dyed the original blonde colour she used to have.\n\nTl;Dr: A customer ignored my advice and his wife came back with her hair tinted green",

I tried to explain how to install her vacuum but she doesn't how her pipes and skimmer are configured. Ends going to the parts department but doesn't understand anything.\n\nFast forward to May. She shows up, complaining that her pool's water is murky. I ask her if she has debris still at the bottom of the bottom of the pool. Still does and I ask her for how long has it been there. She tells me that she never removed any of it. I tried explaining to her how to use a net or a vacuum to clean it out. Still doesn't want to understand and do it.\n\nFinally in June, she comes back, complaining about her liner being stained. Turns out all that junk decomposed and stained the liner. I tell her to put degreaser in (after being advised by my boss) and not to put any chlorine in for 24h. She comes back the next day and tell me the pool is foaming like crazy. I ask her if she put in any chlorine and...\n\nShe doesn't know. She tells me that her family might have thrown in chlorine without telling her.

You have that battery?\" I check the size, and confirm that we do sell 2032s. \"Well, are you gonna go and get it?\" I walk over to the battery rack, pull one out, and return to the register.\n\nAs soon as I step back there, and no earlier: \"I need four of those!\"\n\nI go back out, and instead of putting it back and grabbing the four-pack, I pull down three more single packs and once again return. All together they cost about twice as much as the multi-pack, but you can't put a price on shaving ten steps off your shopping trip.",
