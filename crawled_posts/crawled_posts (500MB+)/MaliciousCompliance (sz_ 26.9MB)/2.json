        "selftext": "(My compliance was malicious for the ex husband) I'm working in the billing queue in a call centre for one of big three telcos, and a client calls in regarding a billing concern.\n\nThis lady calls in, is puzzled by why she got charged a one time fee $49 for a wireless access point(it's gen 1 equipment for wireless set top box's for Optik TV).\n\nShe's even more puzzled, why would she have that charge when she doesn't have TV services from us. And I inform she does, it stared more or less a month ago. She's disputing that because Optik TV isn't available in her area. Now I'm confused. She lives in a small town and there's no Optik TV there. I do a little digging and find out that someone (no ex hushand) was still her on account and got 3 year contract to get a free TV for Optik TV and Internet.\n\nShe begins to cry on the phone and tells me her now ex-husband had an affair with a younger woman, divorced her, milked her for as much as he could and apparently still is milking her for more. He totally ghosted her. Moved to Alberta, changed his email, phone number, blocked her on all social media, etc. \n\nIn my mind I'm like, what a dickhead. And I'm like, well I'm sorry if you cancel the services you're on hook to pay for cancellation fees and so on. I can tell her though, I can remove his access to your account and you can also add on a password, downgrade the internet and tv to the bare essentials and I can attempt to to redirect the TV gift from his address to hers but there's no guarantee as it's been processed already. \n\nI can hear the light going off in her head. \"Wait, what? You have where he's living at now?\" \"Why, yes. He's got TV and Internet services so there's a service address.\" \n\nShe goes really quiet, says her lawyer & herself have been trying to track him down but his family and friends are being tight lipped about it. \n\nShe asks if I'm allowed to give that info to her. I smile and reply, this is your account. You have unrestricted access for service address, phone numbers, emails that your now ex-husband provided to us to get hooked up. She asks, that I can give her his new address, his new cell number(and the 2nd number left on the account, presumably the new woman) and contact info over the phone right now. I asked if she had a pen and paper handy. She was so ecstatic. And after giving her all the details from her account regarding the 2nd service address, downgrade everything, and he was a hockey fan and there was a game playing right now with his team, so I wish i could of been a fly on the wall when the game cuts out and he calls in to ask wtf and discovers hes been removed, and there's an account PIN and he's been discovered by his ex wife and lawyer.",

            "I grew up Christian in predominantly Christian communities. I never really understood why the separation of church and state was a big deal, because let's be honest, it didn't affect me. So any mention of God in schools didn't bother me, and I didn't understand why others were so against it.\n\nFlash forward to my 30s and I'm living in Utah, which is predominantly Mormon. I'm a parent chaperone for my 1st grader's public school class field trip to a place that is celebrated for the Mormon pioneers coming to Utah. I don't have an issue with this. It's important to know our history and how we got to where we currently are.\n\nHere's where I had my epiphany on why the separation of church and state is important. At this field trip, for a public school, they made all the first graders watch a video celebrating Mormons and basically giving the message that all Mormons are superior to non- Mormons.\n\nI was in shock.\n\nHalf of my child's class is Mormon. The other half is a combination of a variety of faiths and no religion at all. I watched the Mormon children publicly proclaim that they were basically better than others. I watched the non-Mormon kids basically have an existential crisis after having been told that they are a lesser citizen because they weren't Mormon. I spent the rest of that field trip trying to comfort 6 and 7 year olds, telling them that they have value as a human being and that they still matter.\n\nI now fully support the separation of church and state and have a much better idea of why it's so important.\n\nEdit: Because this has come up a few times, yes, this only became a problem to me when it affected me, because I had never been told WHY the separation of church and state is important. I had to experience it for myself because no one was teaching me this. From my perspective at the time, it was innocent and harmless because I grew up in one of the least diverse places possible: almost everyone is the same race, the same religion, the same political party. I don't ever recall incidences of discrimination happening (doesn't mean that it didn't), so this was a topic that never came up. We were taught that racism is bad and what happened to African Americans is awful, but we also came away from this thinking that only white people are racist. There were A LOT of holes in my education. This happened several years ago. This is not just a school issue; it has far reaching consequences in all areas of life. I use this story all the time in real life to illustrate to other people who were raised like me why this is important.",

        "selftext": "I'm a paramedic. A few months ago, we're coming back from a routine patient transfer when at an intersection about four blocks from the base I notice a woman sitting on the side of the road with her arms wrapped around herself and her head down.\n\nI nudge my partner who's driving, and we flip on the lights and I see her head come up real fast, and she looks terrified. I get out and she relaxes when she sees the ambulance. After I approach, I notice bruising on her wrists and other similar signs of domestic abuse. \n\nShe seems hesitant to get up off the curb.and into the ambulance, so I decided that I would at least pull the cot out of the back and give her something a little more comfortable than concrete to sit on. \n\nNow a few important details. All the cots in my service are Stryker powered cots. You've almost certainly seen these before. They're bright yellow with black handles and side panels. These cots have a motor and battery built in to allow us to raise and lower the cot at the touch of a button instead of throwing out our backs having to physically lift the cot up after loading someone. They're usually paired with an automatic loading system built into the ambulance that lifts the cot up to the right height to be pushed inside and also secures the cot when loaded. There's a little red tab at the end of the track, just inside the doors, that you press down to free the cot and allow it to slide out. When you press this tab, it simply releases the cot and the loading carriage it's connected to and it's up to you to keep it under control until it reaches the unload position and locks into place again. This can be problematic because these cots weigh about 125 pounds, about 55kg. \n\nAs soon as I hit the release tab for the cot, I hear lights and sirens behind me. It's a city police car. Which is weird because we had not yet requested police, and we were outside the city, in the sheriff's department jurisdiction. We merely informed dispatch that we were stopping to check on a woman at such and such intersection. The woman says something along the lines of \"oh god he's here\" and moves faster than me seeing free food being distributed at base. She dashes past me and pretty much hurls herself into the ambulance, sitting on the bench seat. The cop is approaching and he's pissed. I put two and two together and slam the ambulance doors shut. Let's call this officer Police Officer Steve, or POS for short.\n\nPOS: Is that bi-Is she in there?!\nMe: Who?\nPOS: You know damn well who I am talking about.\nMe: You mean my patient? I'm afraid I haven't gotten a name yet. \nPOS: Open those doors, I need to talk to her.\nMe: You're not using my rig as an interview room. You can talk to her at the hospital.\n\nWe go back and forth like this for a few minutes, my partner at some point came back to see what the hold up was, but overhead my stonewalling and went back to the cab to call our chief. I continue my routine of deny and delay until a pair of deputies (likely specifically requested for this by the chief) arrive. Oh good, now I have witnesses. \n\nSee, we had stopped on an upwards incline. I had hit the release tab on the cot and it wanted to slide back. I had to close the doors so swiftly, I didn't bother pushing the cot back against the stops and locking it in place.\n\nEmboldened by the presence of two deputies, he gets in my face. \"Get out of my way or I'm gonna have to charged with obstruction!\". Okay. I step out of his way, and he opens the double doors. Between the cot, the monitor, and the jump bag, I'd say there was probably close to 160 pounds contained by those doors. All of which comes barreling out and hits POS square in the chest. He goes backwards and falls on his ass. One of the deputies laughs aloud. The other walks up and kneels down beside the guy. He says \"Your shift captain is going be here in five, I wouldn't be here then if I were you.\" POS gathers himself up and scowls at me, then stomps off.\n\nThere is a limited amount that I can say about the aftermath as the trial is not settled yet, but we all know how well charges stick to cops. The woman is now living elsewhere, the cop is still a cop, and I have been getting pulled over at least twice a week ever since then. But the video footage of him getting bodychecked by that cot remains one of the best things I have seen.\n\nEDIT: For clarification, yes the woman was/is married to POS. And yes, he is allegedly responsible for the abuse.",

            "Good for you. I have dozens of stories about police being dicks with our L&D patients that were victims of domestic violence, and a few of them were definitely the partners of LEOs. It\u2019s beyond fucked up. Even outside our patient care setting, many nurses I worked with were married to police officers, and we knew were definitely abused at home themselves. Often call outs were to extend healing time for visible bruises. One of my best friends was married to one of the good ones that eventually washed out because of the corruption, and his stories about the filth working and floating around the various local jurisdictions was beyond nauseating. Even my mother working at a bank had one of her coworkers in an abusive relationship with a local officer and she ended up in jail herself when she finally called 911 after too many beatings. His buddies showed up and the report was allowed to be manipulated, and thus raising her hands to shield herself from his violence was claimed to be assault on a law enforcement officer. In the day she spent in jail, she said numerous officers came by her cell and harassed her and intimidated her. For all that\u2019s been said about law enforcement reform in the US, if they merely did it with the focus on the prevalence of perpetrators of domestic violence, it would be enough for an overhaul.",

As usual, when you move out of an apartment, you get a final bill, which includes your last month's pro-rated rent, deductions for damages, security deposit refunds, and the like.  We paid it.\n\nThe next month I get a call from my wife who says we've got a follow-up bill in the mail from the apartment management company, for $0.02.  We're both in the tech field, so we laughed that this company's IT deparment didn't catch the edge case of spending $0.50 in postage to collect $0.02 in revenue. But it happens.\n\nMy wife prints out a copy of the bill.  I grab two cents from the change jar.  The apartment complex is on my daily drive, so I swing by the office.  I walk in and tell the manager that I want to pay my last bill.  \n\nI say \"It's two cents. Here's the bill, and I have the two cents if you want it.\"\n\nThe manager says \"We don't take cash.\"  Nothing else.  There was an awkward pause.\n\nI say \"I don't expect you to take cash. I expect us both to have a laugh about how silly computer systems are, and for you to write off the two cents, because it'd cost you more to process the payment.\"\n\nShe says \"I'm not going to do that.\"  Again, awkward pause.  \n\nI say \"So you want me to write you a check ... for two cents.  And mail it?  And you're going to process that check?\"\n\nThe manager says \"Yes, send us a check and we'll process it.\" and then WALKS BACK INTO HER OFFICE to end the conversation.\n\nSo I go home and set up an automatic, monthly bank payment to my apartment complex.  For **three** cents.\n\nAnd then, because I'm a programmer, I write some code to send a letter once per month, saying \"I'm so sorry - I've overpaid my bill.  Please send me a check for the overpayment.\"  And I use an online service that sends post cards in ridiculous sizes - up to around 18\"x24\", figuring that'll be my escalation strategy.\n\nThe first of the next month, I get a call from the apartment company's regional manager.  After introducing himself, the next two minutes were the most sincere, \"Oh god, we made a mistake - please don't do this, we'll never contact you again\" apology anyone could've hoped for. \n\nI stopped the mail and never heard from them again.

My index funds have done better since then too so no loss. Only problem was they deposited like 25 cents extra after the sale for some reasons, it wasn\u2019t a dividend and I still to this day could not tell you what it was for. This was through a large firm, like a fidelity or Morgan Stanley size place. But they kept sending this huge packet at the end of every quarter with a dollar stamp on it with my account performance. It was $.25 in cash with no performance. I figured they would realize it and send it as a check but they never did, so after about a year of getting these giant packets I called them up and said they could right it off which they said they couldn\u2019t so I said can you just send me the $.25 and stop sending me the packets and make sure the account is closed.

        "selftext": "TLDR at the end.\n\nThis happened several years ago when my ex and I were going through a heated divorce/custody battle. While we were married, we had a couple of conversations about how rich people hide their assets to avoid paying taxes. I've never had enough assets to do this, but she somehow got the idea that I was and told her attorney that I was laundering money and hiding income. It was more likely the heat of the moment as divorce/custody battles often come down to. I couldn't even afford my own attorney so I represented myself.\n\nHer lawyer wasn't a total ass, but he clearly was out to get me, and he talked down to me like I didn't deserve to breathe the same air. One day, I get a letter in the mail from him requesting an updated income declarations form and 3 years of financials. It had a long ass list of things to include.\n\nI own a communications tech company that was in super startup phase back then. Money was already tight. I was trying to get this business off the ground with no financing, I was finishing my MBA with scholarships and loans, so paying for copies and postage or driving this 30 miles to his office meant eating peanut butter and saltines for a week. So I called him to explain my situation. He all but called me a liar and didn't believe I couldn't afford it.\n\nI was put off by that, and I said this was taking time away from business I needed to handle. To which he replied (and I'll never forget this), \"Well, according to your income declarations, you're not that busy. What do you do all day?\" He then said if he didn't get these documents, he would consider my previous filings as fraudulent tell the judge, contact the DA, and also alert the state tax agency and IRS. Probably an empty threat, but I'm no lawyer.\n\nEfax is one of the services my company provides, and at this time it was relatively unknown. So I asked him if he has a fax machine. He said he had a fax/scanner/copier device, then said what law office doesn't have a fax machine? And I suddenly got an idea. Okay, I said to him, I'll put together and fax whatever I can.\n\nOkay, motherfucker. You want 3 years of financials? You got it.\n\nI scanned-to-PDF every receipt I could find. McDonald's receipt from 5 years ago? Fuck it, won't hurt to include it. CVS receipt? It's 3 miles long, perfect. They get the $1 off toothpaste coupons too. \n\nI downloaded every bank statement, credit card statement, purchase orders from vendors, and every invoice I sent to clients. I printed to PDF the entire 3 year accounting journal, monthly/quarterly/annual balance sheets, cash flow statements, P & L's. Not only did I PDF 3 years of tax filings, but every single letter I received from the IRS and state tax agency, including the inserts advising me of my rights. It took awhile, but I was a few days ahead of the deadline!\n\nI made a cover page black background with white lettering. Wherever I could, I included separator pages in all caps in the biggest, boldest font that would fit on the page in landscape: 20XX RECEIPTS, 20XX TAXES, etc. I merged everything into a single 150+ page compressed PDF and sent the document using my Efax system. Every hour or so, I received a status email saying the fax failed. Huh, that's weird. Well, they're getting this document. So I changed the system configuration to unlimited retries after failures to keep redialing until it went through. Weird, I was still getting status email failures. I'll delete the failure emails and keep the success one after it eventually goes through, I thought. Problem solved.\n\nTwo days later, a lady from his office called and asked me to stop sending the fax. Their fax/scanner/printer/copier had been printing non-stop. It kept getting paper jams, kept running out of ink and they had to keep shutting it off and back on to print.\n\nI explained that her boss told me to send this by the deadline or else he would call the DA and IRS. Since I didn't want a call from the DA or the IRS, I would keep sending until I get a success confirmation. I suggested they just not print until my fax completes, but she didn't like that.\n\nShe asked me to email the documents, and I told a little white lie that my email wouldn't allow an attachment that big. Unless her boss in writing agreed to cancel the request or agree to reimburse me for my costs to print and ship, I said I would continue to fax until they confirm they have received every page. \n\nShe put me on hold, and the attorney gets on the line. He said forget sending the financials. I said that I would need this in writing, so I will keep sending the fax until he sent that to me. He asked me to stop faxing and he would send it in writing, and I said send it in writing first and then I'll stop.\n\nLong moment of silence... *click*.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, I received an email from his assistant with an attached, signed letter in PDF that I no longer needed to provide financials. The letter then threatened to pursue sanctions in court or sue me for interfering with their business. Every time I saw him after that, the lawyer never brought up sanctions, lawsuits, criminal referrals, or financials again.\n\nTLDR; ex accuses me of hiding income and money laundering, her divorce lawyer demands 3 years of financials, I spam fax them with my company's Efax service.\n\nEdit: All these awards and the Reddit front page?

The requesting attorney should have narrowed his request a bit (e.g., 'all pay stubs, 1099s, W2s, K1s, and tax returns'), but lawyers also have a bad habit of drafting discovery requests that are way over broad and just counting on the other side to push back and narrow it down.

        "selftext": "I worked for Company for 14 years. I loved working there for 12 of those years. There were 2 main parts to the job. The first part was the \"sales\" side of things. This was away from the office, in the customer's location. This involved quite a bit of driving (and on a couple of occasions flying abroad) to work face to face with the customers to deliver a high quality product. We weren't the cheapest, but we were the superior product. And I was the best employee when it came to delivering the product. I consistently got rave reviews from customers for my personal style when it came to delivering the product and executing the customer's vision. I got a huge amount of repeat business and I got a lot of new business through word of mouth with customers recommending the company based on their experiences with me.\n\nThe second part was the office side. This was my weaker side. I hated cold calling \"potential customers\" with numbers I found in the phone book. When it came to answering the phone and speaking to potential customers who initiated contact with us I was fine! But I wasn't great at making the calls. This was my only real not-great part of my job. \n\nSo, in the office I wasn't asked to make any calls. Instead I prepared product. Designed new product. Trained new staff members (ended up being one of the biggest parts of my job). I was also the problem solver, helping out whenever and wherever. Filling in for sick employees whenever I could. \n\nI liked the owner and I liked the manager. I liked all the staff who were around me. All in all it was a great job that I was really good at and took pride in.\n\nThe company had been doing so well that the owner had slowly expanded over the 12 years since I started working for Company. I had joined about 3 months after he started, so I'd been a part of this expansion. I worked out of my nearest office, but often travelled to other areas to train their staff. I was \"loaned out\" as it were to other companies to help train their staff. At one point I was a guest lecturer at a University teaching medical students how to deliver complicated explanations to people who don't have the base knowledge that you yourself do. \n\nAfter 12 years I was on a decent salary. Not massive, but I was happy. Then the owner decided to sell off part of the company. He was selling the area where my local office was. He told me he would love for me to remain as his employee, but I would need to work from a different office. This was either require me to move, or to quadruple (at a minimum) my daily commute. The other option was to remain working from my current office but with a new boss. I chose the second option.\n\nBefore the new owner bought the company she worked alongside the staff for a couple of weeks to see how we operated. This was before any of us knew she was about to buy the company. As far as we knew she was just another employee, and she was shadowing us to learn. She came with me on assignments in the field and saw my abilities. \n\nWhen the sale was announced and we were informed that she was the new owner, everyone was very surprised. She made some sweeping staffing changes. The manager left to start her own business, since the new owner was also going to be the manager. A lot of staff were let go. The secretary, myself and a couple of newer hires were kept on. The new hires were on the lowest wages (not salaries). Anyone who had got to a decent level was let go. Since almost everyone was on a zero hours contract, she was able to do this. \n\nWhilst technically it was a \"new company\" for the customers it was the same old business. The company still had the same trading name. The only real difference was that there was a new owner and the registered business name was now different. As far as the customers were concerned nothing had changed.\n\nMy job for the first few months after the sale was to train up the remaining staff to replace the more experienced staff members who had been let go. I recommended a couple of new hires who I had experience working with in the past. I was open and honest with the owner, and let her know that one of them was a close friend and one of them was my girlfriend. Both were more than qualified for the work and both were happy to join. My friend had recently come back to the country after a year of travelling, whilst my girlfriend could only work during school holidays (worked in a school). The owner gave them both interviews then hired them, since we needed the staff.\n\nOver the next 2 years business started to fall. The reason was simple: The new owner decided to try and maximise profits by increasing prices whilst decreasing the quality of the product. For new customers this wasn't noticeable. They just thought we were expensive and the product wasn't the best. But for old customers who had been with us for 10+ years, they immediately noticed. They were being charged more and were receiving less/worse quality. So the owner doubled down and increased prices again. 95% of our old customers left us. New customers almost never became repeat customers. Complaints sky rocketed. \n\nWhilst all this was going on our staff turnover rate was ridiculous. People left after a few months when they realised that the minimum wage they were being paid wasn't worth it. Under the old owner the average hourly wage for new employees was around 2.5x the minimum wage. This made people care about their jobs and want to keep them. My girlfriend quit. My friend remained, but was looking for something new.\n\nThen I got a phone call. The owner needed me to come to the office. This was unexpected. I had just finished working on location with a customer. My next customer was in 2 and a half hours. It was a half hour drive away. The office was about an hour and 10 minutes away from both locations. If I drove back to the office I would have about 5 minutes in the office before leaving. My mileage was paid above my regular salary, so I was saving the company money by doing this. Also, parking was a nightmare around the second location, so I intended to get there as early as possible to find parking, then read a book. The manager didn't care. She *needed* me to return to the office. So I did. I arrived back to be handed a letter by the owner. It was informing me of a disciplinary meeting to take place in a couple of days time. I could bring a \"witness\" along if I so desired.\n\nThis knocked me for 6. I was the best employee. I read through her list of complaints about my performance and started working on my defence.\n\nAt the meeting I declined to have a witness. Instead I decided to record the audio of the entire meeting on my phone without informing her. Where I live this is legal and I didn't need consent. The boss' witness was her friend who she had met at Yoga and hired for an office role, firing the secretary who had been there long before the takeover.\n\nEvery point she raised I could counter. They ranged from the weak: \n\n\"You were unavailable to work for a week in August\" \n\n\"I booked a week's holiday so I could attend my cousin's wedding on the other side of the country and turn it into a holiday.\"\n\nTo the pathetic: \n\n\"You were late for work on the 12th of May.\"\n\n\"Is that the day my car broke down and I called the office to let you know?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"I do. Here's the receipt from the garage dated May 12th.\"\n\nTo the downright lies. This one I can't write as a quote. Basically, she accused me of gross misconduct for breaking health and safety laws in the way I was delivering a product for a customer. I hadn't broken health and safety laws. I knew exactly what I was doing since, as I've mentioned already, I had been doing this for 14 years at this point. She had witnessed me do this on multiple occasions and had never mentioned it before. Because it wasn't an issue. She even had me train staff in this specific delivery method. Because it wasn't an issue.\n\nShe finished her list by telling me that she doesn't want to lose me, but she can't justify keeping such a poor employee at my current salary. I had 2 choices: I could either sign a zero hours contract and work for minimum wage, or she could fire me with 2 weeks notice.\n\nI countered that she would have to give me 12 weeks notice, since my contract guaranteed me 1 week's notice for every year of employment, up to a maximum of 12. She argued that I had only been her employee for 2 years, since before then I worked for the previous owner. I informed her that with how the business takeover had run, it counts as continuous employment. I quoted the exact law and code that backed me up. She asked for a 30 minute break in the meeting to \"let me think about her offer\". She went to call her lawyer.\n\nWhen she came back she informed me that since she was firing me for gross misconduct, she didn't have to give me any notice at all. If I wanted to remain and move to the zero hours contract, I could do that today. But if I didn't then she would have to fire me. But because she was nice she would give me the 2 weeks notice. I asked for a couple of hours to go home and think about this. She allowed this.\n\nI knew the reason she wanted me to remain for at least the 2 weeks was because one of our few remaining bigger customers were set to have a product delivery from me in that time. They would only work with me. The owner had tried sending other staff in my place an several occasions, and each time there had been problems. It wasn't the staff's fault. It was just a very difficult delivery for a very specific customer which needed to be perfect. As a result this customer would only deal with me.\n\nI called the office and spoke to the owner. I declined the offer of a zero hours contract and said I would be leaving. She then said she was giving me my 2 weeks notice. I declined her offer of 2 weeks notice. I informed her that if I was being fired for gross misconduct then surely I cannot be relied upon to safely deliver the product. Therefore it would be best for everyone involved if I didn't return to work. She panicked and said that she needed me for those 2 weeks. I feigned ignorance and let her know that I was just thinking about what's best for the company. After all, you can't have unsafe staff delivering your product to your customers. However, if she wanted to rethink the \"gross misconduct\" accusation then I would work my 12 weeks notice. They were her options. 0 weeks or 12. She chose 12.\n\nFor those 12 weeks I worked the same way I had for 14 years. I didn't coast. I didn't slack. I didn't badmouth the company on my way out. I continued to train new staff. I continued to deliver the product in my own, personal, exceptional way. I also got in touch with an lawyer who was a specialist in employment law.\n\nFor those 12 weeks the Owner barely spoke to me. She resented the fact that I knew my legal rights and didn't just believe her lies. She hated the fact that I could defend myself. She was petty. She accidentally dropped my mug in the kitchen, breaking it. Most petty of all, she paid for every member of staff in the office to have a spa day... except me. I was asked to work my day off to answer the phones whilst everyone else was being pampered. Nobody knew I hadn't been invited until they arrived at the spa and I wasn't there. Here's the thing; I'm a big fat bearded guy. I have no interest in a spa day. If she had offered it to me I would have thanked her and declined the kind offer. But by pointedly excluding me she was making herself look terrible. For the last 2 weeks I was training up my friend to basically take over from me. \n\nAt the end of the 12 weeks my final day came around. The owner had nothing planned. Not so much as a card after 14 years (2 for her). The office assistant manager who had become a friend had got me some presents, but had to give them to me once the boss was gone, for fear of reprisals. \n\nThe day after my final day 2 things happened. The first was my friend who I had been training up to replace me quit. He was on a zero hours contract so required no notice. He was unhappy with her treatment of me, and was unhappy that she expected him to do my (previously salaried) job for minimum wage. He hadn't informed me of his plans to leave, and I only learned of it when he knocked on my door in the middle of the day when he should have been at work to let me know.\n\nThe second was the owner received a letter informing her that I was bringing legal proceedings against her for ~~constructive dismissal~~ unfair dismissal. I had arranged this with my lawyer to be delivered the day after my final day. According to the office assistant, she went pale and started crying, before leaving the office to call her lawyer.\n\nShe refuted my claims for ~~constructive~~ unfair dismissal. Said it was gross misconduct. Tried to come up with some more reasons for firing me. But the truth was that the company was making less money because of her business practices, and I was the highest (and only) salary. I had evidence that I was a great employee. I had evidence that she asked me to move to a zero hours contract. She initially tried to deny this, since the \"gross misconduct\" fabrication makes no sense if she wanted me to stay. But once my lawyer provided hers with a transcript of the entire meeting along with a copy of the recording, she knew she was fucked. Still, she let the case drag on for over a year. I think she hoped that the legal fees would lead to me dropping the case. Little did she know my lawyer was working on a no-win no-fee basis, whilst hers wasn't. She ended up settling out of court.\n\nThe aftermath: \n\nThe office assistant who had become a friend quit a couple of months after I left. She hated how I was treated and didn't feel feel safe working for such an untrustworthy boss. \n\nSeveral former customers contacted me personally to enquire why I was no longer with the company. Apparently the owner was telling them that I just quit. I informed them that I had been fired for cost cutting reasons. They moved their business elsewhere. Several offered me jobs. One went so far as to offer me a part time job and to pay for me to attend college to earn a degree required for them to hire me full time. This was a lovely offer, but they were one of the customers who were a bit too far away to commute, and I wasn't ready to move. In the end I found a new job in a different industry where a lot of my skills transferred over. Currently earning more than I was, working less hours and for better owners.\n\nThe business is floundering. COVID left the new owner desperate for cash. She cancelled orders but refused to refund customers money, citing an \"act of god\" clause in the contracts. The business' Facebook and Google reviews have tanked. Most staff left. The business is still afloat, but barely.\n\nTLDR - Owner fired me as a cost cutting measure. I sued and they ended up settling out of court, whilst the person they planned to replace me with quit.",

Like the amount of claims of unpaid wages is ridiculous, and people like in your shoes that have the other side of just getting screwed when it comes to employment itself: e.g. lying about their rights as employees when firing them. She only lied because 9/10 times she'd get away with it and win saving money on firing you.  You were gucci enough to be the 1/10, but her only repercussions, had she not ran the business into the ground, would be whatever (hopefully substantial) settlement there is. She's lieing in a legal setting at the end of the day, ESPECIALLY when she specifically said things contradictory to the recording.

            "In 1997 an American company bought the Danish telecommunications that had preciously been state owned. They thought they could save a lot of money by \n\nA.

            "I have no idea why certain owners get greedy when they have a good thing going.  I started as a laborer doing electrical work for a very large corporation.  We were paid per fixture we installed and did a store per week, usually working 5.5-6 days.  Occasuonally we'd finish in 4 days and the agreement was that we got to go home after the store was finished, with a bonus.  My boss got moved up and I took over the crew.  I made some changes and my crew was finishing stores in 3-4 days.  Everyone was having a great time, the quality of work was excellent, we were always getting our bonus, everyone was happy with the long weekends since we traveled a lot, the customer was very happy to have us in and out so quickly, things were going well.  The owner saw how efficient the crew had gotten and started adding stores to our week, having us do two stores in one week.  My guys went from working 45 hours in three days to over 100 through the week.  He then cut the guy's pay per fixture, siting that since they were doing so much, they were making more money.  Then he took away the bonus, because it was \"too much for two stores in one week\".  I fought for them and told him it was unjust and not what they signed up for.  They were being punished for being good at their jobs.  They were tired and needed rest and it was dangerous for them to do so many hours in one week while working with electrical and heavy equipment.  I was told that their pay was not my place to ask about.  So I gave my two weeks.  A month after I left there was a death on the crew.  It's sad when owners get greedy.",

In the US, it is exceedingly rare for an individual worker to get the upper hand versus a corporation to fight to keep your job, you are better served ducking out early if you can.\n\nSecondly, if you *ever* start seeing people quitting en masse or the old owner/CEO drops out, prepare for succession chaos in which you will *probably* lose your job. New owners like a clean slate that they can control and build themselves. Legacy people/processes/organization are very very likely to get wrecked in pursuit of this, regardless of how well they perform. This is called business reorganization or reorg, but whatever they call it it means trouble. Anytime you hear about the possibility of ownership change dust off your resume and start looking immediately for other opportunities.\n\nBasically, understand that from an organizational standpoint, \"merit\" is a myth. Sure, individual bosses care about that, but the organization really doesn't ultimately.",

Because of the employment laws in the UK they couldn't just fire one of us because we had all been there a long time, so they decided to \"restructure\" , changing our job descriptions slightly and serving us all with redundancy notices and invitations to apply for the \"new\" ( exactly the same as the old) jobs of which there were only four vacancies. What they weren't expecting was that all five of us accepted the redundancy offer leaving them with nobody to look after the systems.

It's important to say that all the six kids are boys and MIL is in some sick baby girl rabies.\n\nEver since we made the announcement MIL convinced herself that I was pregnant with a girl. I told her that once we knew the gender she would be the first one to know. We told her it was a boy, she still was convinced it was a girl. She told they whole side of the family it was a girl. I corrected but she told them I was just annoyed bc I wanted a boy first (I wanted a healthy baby, I didn't have a damn about the sex). She also told them we are naming the girl after her mom, which we will never do bc hubby hates his Grandma. \n\nWhen the baby shower gifts started to come I noticed a lot of things that wasn't in the register. Embroidered things with grandma's name. And it didn't matter we told them the gender and the name, and make clear we are not lying about the gender. Everyone believed her \n\nWell, the baby was born. And imagine the surprise... It was a boy, just LIKE WE HAVE BEEN TELLING EVERYONE. The problem (for them) was that now the baby have plenty of \"girly\" clothes, pink onesies etc, and we are dressing our baby with them. Specially for his family video calls and for pictures for them. \n\nAfter Saturday call, MIL called us to scream to us bc we are making the elders uncomfortable for not sticking to a masculine color scheme for the baby clothes. And we have to stop being this childish, she just through my belly shape was more like girl them for a boy. \n\nWe told her we will not change the baby's clothes, and to just await until the dresses fit.

He immediately gave it to the first girl he dated. \n\nMeanwhile, I\u2019m minding my own business, got myself a new number and thought I updated everyone. By this time I was dating a new, awesome guy, who I ended up marrying. His mom, for some reason, had my old number. Well, she got a new one and mass texted her entire phone book about it. \n\nMy (now) husband and I were out to dinner when he got a message from his sister asking why I was being disgusting. Confused, a few more questions between them, we quickly figured it out. When my ex got the mass text, instead of, I don\u2019t know, saying \u201cplease take me off this list\u201d or something normal. He decided to take a picture of his flaccid penis, followed by him spreading his butt cheeks and having someone else snap a photo directly of his anus. \n\nTMI\u2014 The thing was, his hairy mess of the areas left the front side...wanting, and the back side looked super greasy, with matted hair stuck all over the place, and he definitely didn\u2019t do the best job of wiping after his last bowel movement. \n\nSo 30+ people, once the confusion was done and they knew who it was, laid into him about his messed up junk. Even Sharing his Facebook photos so everyone knew exactly who they were talking to. He left the chat quickly with that lol. \n\nThe night it happened, before the reaming (lol) I asked why he didn\u2019t just tell them it was the wrong number. He told me it was \u201cmy punishment\u201d for not letting everyone know I changed my number. \n\nThe next day, he called to apologize. But only to ask them to stop posting and sharing his fb photo with the pics online, as it apparently embarrassed him. \ud83d\ude44 I didn\u2019t, and people several states away had fun mocking him.

First time poster, on mobile, etc. TLDR at the bottom.\n\n My father died on Father\u2019s Day 2012. He was divorced and living alone, and I am an only child. So that means that I had to wrap up all of his affairs. This story centers around us trying to get his utilities canceled.\n\nI called in to see what we had to do to get them to cancel. The lady I spoke with on the phone said to send in his certified death certificate. I sent in the certified copy of his death certificate the next day. The next month got another bill. I called again and a new woman answered. She said that because I wasn\u2019t on the account that she had to speak with the account holder. I informed her that the account holder was dead but she wouldn\u2019t budge. I had to make an appointment with a supervisor so she could speak to him herself in person. \n\nI showed up at the board of public utilities with another death certificate and HIS ASHES IN THE CLEAR BAG that they returned his remains in. I plopped them down on the center of her desk and said when she talked to him to tell him that I loved him for me. The woman went pale, flew out her chair, and called the cops. \n\nWhen they showed up she claimed that I had assaulted her. And yes my dads remains were still sitting in the middle of her desk with the death certificate. The cops questioned me as to why I would do that. I told them the story. The supervisor\u2019s boss was called in and they all stepped away from the desk for a private talk. While they were talking the cops came over to talk to me. They said that I shouldn\u2019t take human remains out in public, but there was no laws that were broken. I said that I agreed with them that it was extreme, but she insisted to speak with him in person. By then they were done talking between themselves. The supervisor\u2019s boss kissed up to me and got it taken care of.\n\nBut the story isn\u2019t over yet! I had to call back a few days later to get utilities back to the house in my name. When the person on the phone saw the address and my name, I was immediately put on hold. The supervisors boss that finally helped me got on the phone. She sucked up to me and waived all of the fees that come with setting up utilities. Just as the call was ending, she informed me that she was again so sorry for the employees lack of compassion. She said that the employee was terminated and again she is so very sorry. \n\nTLDR: Ignorant employee asked to speak to dead dad. Had a meeting in person, brought his ashes, got her fired.\n\nEdit: I can\u2019t believe this blew up! I\u2019m so grateful for all of the love and support in this post. And for those who doubt the validity of the story, I hope when you are in my shoes and doing the same that you have an easier time than I did.",

The rep reiterated that I wasn't an authorized user or the account holder, so I was not able to make a payment. He said he would be happy to assist me if I were to put the account holder on the line. I explained my mother was in surgery and was unable to come to the phone. He said he wasn't able to help me.\n\nSo I asked to speak with his supervisor. The guy put me on hold for 5 minutes, then came back on and said his supervisor told him I wasn't allowed access to the account. I insisted to speak to someone other than him and he said no one would give me account access, to have my mother call. I explained again that she was in surgery and would not be able to talk to him. He told me he couldn't give me account access.\n\nSo I pulled a trick out of my mother-in-law's \"book of legalese\" and gave the guy some spiel about due diligence and compliance. I honestly don't remember what I said to him, but it got him concerned enough that he put me on hold and within 30 seconds I was speaking to his supervisor.\n\nI explained the situation to her and she apologized multiple times for the rep's confusion and asked me how I would like to pay. I said I wanted to use my debit card and she tells me they aren't able to take payment from a source that my mother isn't authorized to use. I asked why and she said it was because they didn't want people using stolen cards and banking information to pay their bills.\n\nI asked if there was an account or card on file that could be used to make a payment and she said there was, but because I wasn't the account holder or authorized user, it couldn't be used to make payment on the account.\n\nSo I hung up, got my mom's social security card out of her wallet and called back saying I was her and giving them her last 4 to verify.

We commonly combatted this tactic by asking for a death certificate, this usually put an end to the request since it was only a lame excuse for trying to back out of their contract.\n\nSo I pretty callously told him to produce a death certificate and we\u2019d cancel the contract and refund his deposit. About an hour later the salesman involved came into my office with the newspaper. There was a story detailing how this family\u2019s infant son had been life flighted to a hospital the night before but didn\u2019t survive.\n\nNeedless to say I felt like a total dick!

            "I have had this type of thing happen with the death of my dad, mom, and grandmother. \n\nWith grandmother: Was called about a bill for a blood test that was supposed to be covered by insurance and that had been completed about 10 years earlier. Call was from a collection agency. Called Qwest Diagnostics who said something like, \"Not sure what we can do to help you sorry.\" Collection agency kept calling and demanding to speak with my grandmother despite submitting proof of death. Eventually I filed a complaint with the attorney general (after warning them I would do it if they continued and they did), who investigated and shut down the collection agency. \n\nWith dad: Hospice agency hired a collection agency who tried to collect a $3000 bill from us. Insurance company provided proof that they had paid the hospice agency and even provided a copy of the deposited check. The collection agency continued to harass us. Really pleasant thing to be reminded constantly about how your dad was in hospice.

        "selftext": "**TL;DR At Bottom**\n\nSo this story is about a property I own, but rent out.  This may sound strange, but I don't think I could afford to live there these days - it's become somewhat exclusive.\n\nI guess this could also go in pro revenge.\n\nI've used dollars here, because it's what most people reading this will relate to.  This doesn't take place in the US, and I've given an approximate dollar value for local currency.  To answer the most commonly asked question, this is in South Africa.\n\nThis is going to be VERY LONG.\n\n**BACKGROUND**\n\nA million years ago my property was part of a large farm.  I bought it about 30 years ago, long after the farm was broken up, but before there was any development near it.  The piece of land I got was near the back entrance that joined into a dirt road that ran past. The more expensive plots were near the tarred road in the front.\n\nI originally bought a large chunk of the land intending to do some farming, but that never happened. About 20 years ago some of the owners got organised (We'll call them the Organised Owners - OO) and had the area designated as a municipal suburb. The municipality agreed to put in tarred roads, water and electricity if a certain percentage of the properties were developed.  A construction company (linked to the OO) went around contacting the owners who had land but no buildings offering to build houses for us at a very (very) reasonable price - contingent on them getting a certain minimum amount of people signing up. While this was happening, one of the OO approached me and offered to buy half of my property.  I agreed, and the money I got for the sale (which was about 4 x what I'd paid for the entire chunk of land 10 years prior) combined with a small loan from the bank gave me what I needed to pay for a house to be built, and it was a fairly large and nice house too.\n\nI stayed in the house for a few years, and my mom moved in with me.  I had decided to subdivide the property again and build her a house next to mine, but unfortunately an un-diagnosed tumor took her before the house could even be started (well, it was diagnosed, but too late to do anything).\n\nSoon after she died, we moved out of the house and started renting it out.  About a few weeks before we moved out the OO I'd sold the land to started talking about starting an HOA.  I wasn't interested, and left soon after.  About two years later, the neighbour OO contacted me. There were two roads entering the area these days - the original tarred road that was near where the farmhouse had been and was entered from a fairly busy main road, and my \"dirt road back entrance\" which was now a tarred entrance from a wide but not very busy municipal road.  The HOA was trying to get the old farm road blocked off to inprove security and decrease through-traffic, and wanted the road next to my property to be the main (and only) entrance to the HOA community.  And they were pressuring me to join.\n\nI said no, and I was adamant, and eventually they accepted that, but told me they wanted to have a sign near the road welcoming people to the neighbourhood, and the only practical place to put it was on the edge of my property.  They also wanted to build a little guard hut and have a security guard permanently monitoring who went in and came out, and they wanted to build his shed on my property. We came to an agreement whereby they would mow the lawn and pay the equivalent of about $35 per month in exchange for the land they needed.  I was very happy with this arrangement, since the property was fairly large, and it didn't really cost them anything since they already had a full time gardening service servicing the HOA.\n\nThis all happened a over a decade ago. They eventually got the other main road blocked off, and the HOA is paying for rent-a-cop to be permanently stationed close to my property, as well as mowing my lawn and paying me enough money for takeaways for the family each month.  I'm occasionally contacted by members of the HOA to get me to sign up, but I'm really not interested.  My property has been rented to the same tenant for all these years and everything there is going well for me.\n\nUntil about 3 years ago, when someone scared the crap out of my tenants young daughter by making strange noises and shooting a gun close to her bedroom window three or four times over about a month.  This scared my tenant and I guessed it scared the HOA because they AND my tenant contacted me with a proposal - I join the HOA and they give me exclusions from the HOA rules, including exclusions from paying the monthly fees, and in addition they will build a wall around the ENTIRE HOA neighbourhood, including electric fencing and security cameras.  They told me they had wanted to do this for a while but were unwilling to build the wall on property that was not in the HOA.\n\nI couldn't see the downside, and so agreed.\n\n**THE DISHONEST DEALINGS**\n\nIt took a little over a year to build the wall and get everything completed, which is quite fast. And then a month to the day after everything was done, my tenant got an HOA warning about his dogs barking.  He told the HOA that while the property was in the HOA, it was exempt from the rules.  The HOA told him that they had cancelled the exemptions, and that he had 30 days to comply.  He contacted me, and I opened some mail I'd gotten from the HOA (I'd ignored it since I was supposed to be exempt from the rules and fees).\n\nMan, did I get a surprise.  They had retroactively cancelled the exemptions, and were claiming:\n\n1. That I pay late fees going back over a year\n2. That the easement agreement had been cancelled, and that they were retroactively canceling it a year back because the HOA contract allowed them to use \"small unused portions\" of HOA members land for the common good for free\n3. That I refund them the money they had paid for the easement over that period,\n4. That I owed them money for the garden service mowing the large lawn, and\n5. That I would be fined for each infraction my tenant failed to remedy.\n\nThis started an expensive process involving lawyers and the court system, that ended with a judge  telling me that what the HOA had done was mostly legal - they had the right to revoke the exemptions, but that they had to give me 30 days notice.\n\nAs I was walking to my car the neighbour OO (the one who bought half my land so many years ago) told me that I was stupid to have refused to join when the HOA started, as I could have been a founder member (whatever that means), and that next time I should be sure to understand the documents I sign before signing them.\n\n**THE MALICIOUS COMPLIANCE**\n\nNeighbour OO was right, I should have read the contract (better).  Also, I was interested in what it meant to be a \"Founding Member\" (spoiler: Nothing), and so when I got home I grabbed the HOA contract I'd signed, as well as all the other documentation they had provided me with, and started reading.  I was determined to break every rule I could find a loophole to break.\n\nI didn't get past the first page.\n\nWhile the street address of the property is used to identify it for all *practical* purposes, in the city records it has a unique property number that has to be used on *legal* records.  When my mom moved in, I'd subdivided the remaining property but hadn't yet started building on it.  And when I gave the HOA the easement all those years ago it had been on the property I'd sliced off for my mom.  And when the HOA set up the contract, they had simply used the property number from the easement.\n\nThe next afternoon the neighbour OO delivered (and had me sign for) two documents - one telling me that my exemptions would expire in a 30 days, and one letting me know that the easement would no longer be required after 30 days.  I think he was being a bit malicious here, because I lived about an hour away from the property, and he drove out himself.\n\n**THE REVENGE**\n\nEXACTLY 30 days TO THE HOUR after the HOA had given me the 30 days notice, I knocked on the neighbour OO's door (did I mention he was the president of the HOA?) and had him sign for two documents.  The first was that I planned to build a house on my HOA property (which confused him) and the second was notice that they had 30 days to remove from the property the guard shed, the parts of the electric boom that were on my property, as well as the sign.  He tried to engage me but I ignored him, climbed into my car and drove off.\n\nEarly the next morning I got a call from the HOA lawyer who explained to me that their junk would be staying on my property since it was in an \"unused\" part of my land.  I explained that I was building a house there, and that the land would not be unused anymore.  I could hear the smirk as he told me that building a second house to be spiteful would not be accepted by the courts. I sure hope he could hear the smirk in my voice when I told him that the property in question did not have a house, and was, in fact, barely large enough for a house to be built and would not be large enough for any extraneous buildings.  I then told him to go look up the property in question and call me back. (I had sliced off just enough to be legal, which was just enough to build a small house).\n\nIt took them just under 5 days to get back to me. Their lawyer told me that the terms of the easement meant that I could not cancel without their permission, so I emailed him a photo of the document they sent to me cancelling the easement. That afternoon Neighbour OO invited me to lunch (his treat) to discuss the problem.  I said \"No thanks\".  He extended the offer again two days later, and again I said \"No thanks\".  Others of the original OO contacted me to try to talk.  Some sounded aggressive, some sounded sympathetic.  I said \"No thanks\" to each of them.\n\nEventually the lawyer phoned and asked if we could come to some sort of arrangement.  I asked what he had in mind, and he told me that he was prepared to discuss exclusions in exchange for access to my property.  So I said \"No thanks, and please don't call me again\".\n\nAbout 9 days before their 30 days was up I got a call from a different lawyer.  He said he wanted to \"negotiate a surrender\" (his words, not mine).  I agreed to meet him at his office the next day.  I'd already had documents drawn up, and the meeting was as simple as me giving him the documents and him reading them over.  My new easement offer:\n\n1. Included everything offered by the old easement offer,\n2. I changed the line \"mow the lawn\" to \"get the property to HOA standards and keep it there\" since it was now in the HOA.\n3. Would cost them about $500 per month instead of \\~$35,\n   1. This amount would increased with inflation (the previous contract didn't include that bit).\n4. When cancelled, for whatever reason, the HOA would have to pay me a cancellation fee of around $7500.\n5. The contract automatically terminated 30 days after\n   1. any disciplinary action was taken against the me, my tenant, or the property (\"the property\"),\n   2. any complaints were levied by the HOA against the property,\n   3. any legal action was taken against the property by anyone in the HOA,\n6. That \\[lawyer who had offerred to negotiate surrender\\] would be allowed to mediate any disputes between us, at HOAs expense, and that\n7. The HOA would pay all my legal fees if any legal action was taken against me.\n\nI'd deliberately left some insane things in there so that I could appear to \"concede\" some points or be negotiated down when the HOA got indignant about the points I actually cared about.\n\nThe lawyer didn't look happy. He said that my proposal sounded unfair, but that he'd have the HOA president look at them.  I reminded him that in 8 days I'd be setting a group of men armed with sledgehammers and anger management issues lose on whatever of theirs was still on my property.\n\nThat evening I got an irate call from the HOA president.  He told me he was never going to sign the new contract.  I said \"OK\".  He then told me I was charging too much per month, and that it should be at the same rate as the previous contract. I pointed out that when I signed the previous contract the area was under development, and there was at least one other road leading in and out, but that now there was only mine.  And besides, mine was now developed with everything they needed.  He told me that I was forcing them to sign a document they didn't want to sign.  I told him that he was free to not sign it. He whined about everything he could think of.  And then eventually told me I'd be hearing from his lawyer.\n\nThe next morning Surrender Lawyer called to ask if I'd be willing to come to their offices to sign the contract.  I agreed. When I got there that afternoon I learned that Surrender Lawyer was not a lawyer, but a Paralegal.  He handed me the contract and asked me to sign it.  He laughed when I told him I'd have to read through it first to make sure nothing was changed, and mumbled something that sounded like \"I'm sure you would\".\n\nI read the contract.  Nothing had been changed. NOT A SINGLE THING. And the HOA president had signed it, with the Surrender Paralegal signing as witness.  I looked at him and said \"Why did he sign this?  It was stupid to sign it!\" and the paralegal looked at me and said \"I started telling him that signing it would be a bad decision, but he told me I wasn't being paid to think or give legal advice, and to shut up.  So I shut up.\"  I said \"Do you understand what he's signed here?\" He looks at me and nods.  He said \"I asked him if I should have one of the lawyers look at it before giving it to you, and he told me that we had already billed enough for this, and that he'd sign it and sue me after their easement was safe.\n\nThis happened about a year and a half ago.  It took 6 months for the HOA to find out how screwed they were.  They wanted to sue me, but their lawyers explained to them that there was no way to win. Even if the court sided with them, all they would get is the easement contract voided, and they did not think that the court would side with them.  The lawyers were adamant about one thing - the HOA could not live with the \"HOA pays my legal fees if legal action was taken against me\" since it didn't limit the people taking legal action against me to the HOA - as worded, the HOA would be fordced to pay for my legal fees if ANYONE took legal action against me.  They argued that the courts would probably not enforce that, since the context of the agreement was to do with the HOA, and I told them I was prepared to find out since the HOA would definitely be the ones taking action against me if they challenged it.  I eventually signed an addendum to the contract that said that the neighbour OO (HOA President) would personally pay all my legal fees *unless he held no position at all in the HOA*, and that the HOA would pay all legal fees if the HOA took legal action against me.  He resigned from the HOA at the end of that meeting. I politely told him in front of everyone that he should not sign documents unless he understands what he's signing.  He didn't look pleased.\n\nIt came out during the mediation (you cannot imagine how happy the lawyers were that their paralegal was mediating) that without the ability to control access to the HOA neighborhood through the security boom (partially) on my property (the HOA had become a \"gated community\" a number of years back) the HOA would be in breach of their own articles and would be dissolved. I also learned (should have been obvious to me) that all the security cameras were wired, and all terminate in the guardhouse / guard shed.  So basically, it was my way or the end of the HOA.\n\nThat first mediation was really quite funny. My paralegal looked more than a little glum as we assembled and he called everyone to order.  I suspected that he had been told to work against me, so I took the initiative.  I reminded everyone there that I had agreed to let Paralegal mediate, but that I had agreed to no arbitration at all.  If I didn't feel like the proceedings were fair I'd leave and they could go ahead and sue. Paralegal brightened up and things actually went quite well.\n\nI'm writing this after getting home from the latest mediation.  I built a \"paddling pool\" for the neighborhood dogs.  As in I made it myself.  I dug a hole, packed it with stone, and added a concrete finish.  It was my first attempt, and if I say so myself, it looked ... well, terrible. The HOA called for a mediation meeting (what they do now instead of taking official action.  I've declined their mediation requests in the past) in which they told me, as nicely as they could, that the paddling pool was an eyesore right at he entrance of the HOA.  I asked them to create a list of what needed to be fixed and how it needed to be fixed to give to me at the next meeting.  The list was extensive.  It basically required the pool to be rebuilt from scratch,  I asked them if there was any way to reduce costs on the work they needed to get it up to HOA standards, and they assured me there was not.  I thanked them, pulled out a copy of the agreement where they had agreed to \"get the property to HOA standards\" (which I'd highlighted) and handed it to them with the list.  I told them the HOA usually preferred if these things were dealt with within 30 days.  They started arguing until the mediator reminded them that they could not force me to comply without causing the easement to end.  I should mention that their lawyers usually no longer attend these things. They said they would get it done.\n\nI also learned a lot about neighbour OO today:\n\n1. I found out that Neighbour OO sold his property about 3 months back, and is apparently leaving the country for Australia.\n2. I found out that the HOA had successfully sued him for a crapload of money they had lost to his mismanagement as part of his vendetta against me.\n3. I also learned that he had a vendetta against me. I have no idea what I did to upset him.\n\nI'm not sure if I will screw with the HOA any more.  I already think I'm so close to breaking them the only thing stopping them from canceling the contract is the massive financial loss if they do.  I guess a lot depends on how they treat me and my tenants going forward.\n\nAlso, I do like the monthly payments, though, so I'm motivated to play nice.\n\nNeighbour OO was right, though, in the end.  You really shouldn't sign documents unless you understand what you are signing.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nHOA President gets me to join the HOA under false pretenses that get upheld in court, then finds out that that he signed up (literally) the wrong property and has to resign after getting the HOA into an incredibly expensive situation that it cannot get out of.\n\n**Thank You Every One**\n\nWhen I posted this here it was because I felt like I could fly and wanted to share. Now the adrenaline is gone and I feel like I've been kicked by a donkey. I thought some people would like the story, but also thought it was too long for most.  It seems I may have been very wrong.  There are so many people commenting and sending messages that I cannot keep up. Thank you all so very much!\n\n**Picture**\n\nStupid picture drawn using a potato.

I asked them to create a list of what needed to be fixed and how it needed to be fixed to give to me at the next meeting. The list was extensive. It basically required the pool to be rebuilt from scratch, I asked them if there was any way to reduce costs on the work they needed to get it up to HOA standards, and they assured me there was not.

            "Years ago I owned a rental property that backed up to a very wealthy gated neighborhood. My home was built in the late 60s the wealthy homes around 2000. On the left side of the home was a wall that ran the length of my property. Behind my home I had a large shed and a pvc fence. When I first bought the home the HOA president of the neighborhood behind me asked if they could pressure wash the back fence and shed they could see from their retention pond. Also said he would trim my trees next to the wall. Ok, no problem. A few years later I get a call from the new HOA president insisting I clean the fence and shed and overgrown brush behind the shed and fence. I never knew there was a problem since I couldn\u2019t see that side. He also asked me to trim the trees hanging over their wall. I told him my past agreement and he said that was over. Told him to F off since I didn\u2019t live in their HOA anyway. He complained to the county on me. I decided to look at my survey to see if my back fence was on the property line and the overgrowth was their issue. Well surprise surprise. Who ever built the block wall that ran the length of my side property screwed up. The wall was on my land by about a foot and a half. \nThe next week I was in town I went over to the presidents house with a certified copy of my survey. Asked him what color he thought I should paint the wall. Told him I liked purple. He threatened to call the police if I did such a thing. I then handed him the survey. Did a complete 180 turned nice as could be and asked what I wanted. Got my entire fence, shed and house pressure cleaned. Trees trimmed and not one peep out of that HOA again. So satisfying.",
