        "selftext": "Every once in awhile I think about this story while I\u2019m idly playing sudoku on my phone and it makes me smile. I realized it\u2019s perfect malicious compliance/petty revenge material. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don\u2019t want to go into too much detail here but some background is needed. A few years ago when I was in grad school, I dated a man who was several years older than me who had just finished his masters at the same school (completely different program but both in the realm of STEM) and started a company based on that work. He seemed to have a chip on his shoulder about the fact that he went back to school in his late 20s, and the fact that I was in a PhD program. I need to emphasize I did not think I was better or smarter than him in any way, and I thought and still think he is incredibly smart and his company does fascinating work. But, he still projected this inferiority complex on me and it was one of many things that soured our relationship. He was obsessed with feeling smarter than me and bringing me down a peg. The relationship ran its course within a year and the breakup was messy, but he insisted on remaining friends despite a lot of obvious tension between us. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne day he asked me to help him pick up a moving truck he needed for work and I agreed, but when I got in the car we were kind of quiet for a couple minutes so I pulled out my phone and finished the sudoku game I had up in my browser. For some context, I am incredibly good at sudoku relative to most people. This is because I obsessively solved sudoku puzzles as a kid and just had big books of them to solve on long bus rides to school, and it\u2019s still my go to game to play while waiting in line, pooping, etc. I don\u2019t really correlate this with intelligence; my brain is just trained to recognize the patterns and solving them is soothing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe looked over and saw I was playing and asked what app I played on. I said I just play on a certain website I like and when he asked why I don\u2019t use a sudoku app I tried to be as neutral as possible in my response and said that the website had a nice spread of difficulty and that every app I tried had either been all too easy or too hard (admittedly, it\u2019s almost always too easy, but because of aforementioned inferiority complex I was hedging this on purpose) He had a kind of \u201coh really?\u201d response and insisted I try the app he has on his phone because he was sure I would find it hard. So, I maliciously complied. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI opened up the hardest setting of puzzle in his app and solved it in about a minute, beating the record on his phone by at least a minute and a half. I showed it to him and he seemed alarmed and basically said I got lucky. So, I played several more times so that my times flooded the fastest times list until his were all gone. His shock and frustration at this was satisfying on its own, but MANY months later when I had long forgotten about it, he randomly sent me a screenshot of his puzzle in that app with a faster time\u2014except it was for the easiest puzzle setting. So of course to be petty, I immediately downloaded the app, played on the easiest setting, beat his time by a significant margin again, and sent a screenshot. Was this mean? Maybe. Was it satisfying? Yes.",

            "I had a coworker that I really liked who got me started on the sudoku puzzles. I love math and number problems so I quickly got really good at them. He stopped doing them.\n\nHe then included me in his love of cribbage. He carried the game around and we would play at breaks and such. I enjoyed it and he was understanding that it took me a long time to add up my points (good crib players memorize the scores and can add your hand as you lay down the cards). We had been playing for about a year during our breaks when I hit a three day winning streak. We stopped playing crib. \n\nI still enjoyed working with him and it didn\u2019t matter to me if I won or lost a game, but it seemed to bother him.",
            "Oof \u2014 memory lane time.  When my college roommate had a Tetris high score \u2014 on my computer \u2014 I simply could not comprehend.   I\u2019d get to the final stage and the blocks dropped so insanely fast I\u2019d be wiped out in about a minute, every single time. \n\nNo inferiority complex here, by the way.  I\u2019m a pretty smart guy, but I freely admit that my roommate was significantly smarter.  He\u2019s still a close friend and he\u2019s a legit genius.\n\nAnyway, I used to play with the computer music off, and a CD cranking some tunes (this was in the late 80\u2019s).  For months, his high score was safe.  Until one day, on a whim, I turned the Tetris music back on. And that\u2019s when I discovered the secret to beating his high score.\n\nThe final level played a Russian folk song\u2026 and the pieces dropped quickly but at a playable speed.  Until the song ended, at which point they sped up to warp speed.  UNTIL you cleared a single line of blocks, and the speed would immediately slow down again for several minutes.  Then the song would start up again and repeat the cycle.\n\nAll the time I\u2019d been playing with the sound off, that functionality was not there. It was just warp speed the entire time.  Anyway, with the music turned on I finally beat his high score.  It was so satisfying I\u2019m now sharing the story with a bunch of strangers, 25 years after it happened. \n\nBut yeah, he\u2019s still way smarter than I am. \n\nPS - OP, you\u2019d kick my ass at Sudoku.",

            "I had a similar experience playing scrabble. I was hanging out with my girlfriend at the time and her best friend wanted to play a game of scrabble. She said it was probably pointless as she already knew she would win as she was a scrabble master. She even claimed she once got 450 points for a single word which I'm not even sure is possible. \n\nI studied English Lit at university and have had my head in a book ever since I learned to read so my vocabulary is fairly decent. Scores were somewhat close throughout most of the game but with only a few turns left she put down a word that gave me a letter that enabled me to use all 7 tiles on a triple word score and get bonus points. This gave me an almost unbeatable lead and the ironic thing is that the word was CHAMPION. \n\nShe completely lost it and flipped the board sending tiles flying everywhere and stormed out of the room. From that day on she hated me with a passion and did everything within her power to get my girlfriend to break up with me. All because she lost a game of Scrabble.",

Back when Ultima Online was popular, I was the healing mage that didn't get into combat, just supported friends/pets. Everyone sort of talked down to me in game, like \"ok little healer girl\" attitude.\n\nUntil the tournament.\n\nThe mods had everyone that entered split in 2 groups. Group B defeated group A, so A was eliminated and B was split into 2 groups. And so on, down the line. I got paired with the most famous PvP swordsman on the server, so with his sword and my heals, we destroyed the others. Now it was just me and him.\n\nHe asked me if I'd like to just surrender.\n\nI won. Did I cheese him? Hell yes. Poison + paralyze is a hell of a combo, when you know how to run and keep exactly as far away as you need to be to get the spell off before he can hit you.

            "I did this on a plane with someone. On my first flight, I grabbed one of the magazines and solved the hardest sudoku puzzle on the back page. Took me a little while, (it was a tough puzzle, and while being fairly good at sudoku I seem to lack the natural prowess you display,) but I ended up getting all 4 done before the first flight was over. I had a plane change on my layover, and on the new flight, the person I was sitting next to had very poor plane etiquette. Listening to music on his phone without headphones, jostling my armrest, foul smelling food, etc. He pulled out the magazine and started working on the hardest puzzle (I got the vibe he was the yuppie type, someone more than willing to demonstrate his superiority over others.) I could tell he was struggling a couple of minutes in, so I pulled my magazine out, and started solving the puzzle that I had solved previously. I made a good show of acting like I was just a natural at sudoku, even at one point showing him my puzzle almost completely solved within a couple minutes while he had less than a quarter of it filled in and said \"These are fun, I should do this more often!\" He gave me a speechless, surprised look that quickly turned to a sullen glare as he looked back at his own puzzle and then put it back. He pretended to sleep for the rest of the flight.",

            "Growing up, I read a LOT. My dad always did this little word puzzle in the paper that had nine letters arranged in a 3x3 grid, with a black background for the middle one. All words needed to use each letter no more than once and include the center one. There was always at least one 9-letter word. I'd often find the 9-letter word with a simple glance at the page when I walked by, and tell him what it was.

I had an interest in wanting to improve my skills in shooter type games (because I admittedly really suck at them, and I've learnt it's more a physical health issue more than anything), and so naturally he excitedly suggested we play Doom together, the original Doom, I should specify.  I, happy we could do something positive together and agree on something, gladly agreed to play Doom with him.  However, because I have issues with my joints and grip, plus a large lack of experience, I totally sucked.  It was my first time playing Doom anyway, so it should be okay that I was bad at it and didn't know the controls and had some struggles, right?  Well, to him, I was personally insulting him.  He got very angry and used it against me many times, saying I sucked at Doom, constantly lying and telling his friends I hated Doom and used it against him, and even at one point used it to justify him telling me to off myself before he does it for me.

I put up my resignation papers and had 2 months of notice period left. I had informed my manager and team, but didn't account for Mr. S who was technically on my team but worked from the client offices overseas, so I dont get to see him ever.\n\nBackground on Mr. S : He was hired as a mediator between the client and us, but had years of technical experience so he often helped us out with the technical work, but was always a snob about it. He made sure to cc every possible manager in every mail to show that he was doing a lot more than his role was required to do. Everyone hated how commanding and rude he was. Most meetings with him were just the entire team listening to him bitch and moan for 20min.He had no boundaries and would call up at odd hours of the night just to prove  his point. He would promise clients certain results with unreasonable timelines without consulting the team, leading to late delivery and terrible client ratings.\n\nSince I had 2 months left to go at work, I wasn't quick to give up responsibilities and transfer knowledge to my colleagues. I handled an important client facing task and I've been doing it for the 2 years I worked there. I never taught it to anyone else cuz it was a relatively easy task and it hasn't been screwed up in two years.\n\nWe get info from the client that my task was undergoing major upgrades and needed to be done extra carefully and on priority for the next week. I know the drill and get to work as usual. Mr. S calls me up on Skype to reemphasise the importance of the task this week. I just reply to him that I've been following all protocols every week and will continue the same as usual, being careful of the upgrades. He considers my answer as \"unprofessional and inconsiderate\" and proceeds to tell me how I'm not that important to the team and my job was easily replaceable. \n\nHe then cut the call, and proceeded to reassign all my tasks for the next 2 months to someone else, while also formally emailing everybody that no new tasks were to be assigned to me. \n\nThere i sat, maliciously complying, watching my team mates struggle to run my task, unable to help. I sat around doing nothing for the last 2 months of my job. Luckily I was working from home so that meant 2 months of paid leave.",

(I'm convinced this is why that swoosh guy cut became so popular) all the guys would swoosh their hair as long as possible before the dean would force you to get a cut. I hated this rule it was beyond dumb and made 0 sense other than it just being about looking good to a certain type of person. Regardless... every year I would try something new to do to get away with long hair, junior year I read through the rule book cover to cover... scouring for anything, any hope to get my hair to be longer. It suddenly dawned on me... there were no rules stipulating if there was a sweaty boy who liked to wear sweat bands, the rules also just stipulated \"hair can not be touching the ears\". Off to Walmart I went, Found some white sweatbands and some dye, and off to the races I went. \n\nMade some freaking sick sweatbands and off to school I went, hair still within regulation at the time, this was just to test the waters... first day minimal resistance, had a cool teacher say something and i just asked him where it was in the rule book and he laughed and just kept walking... \"Okay so I guess I'm the sweatband kid now...\" \n\nI made it to week two before I had a dean walk up to me at lunch and just start grilling me, luckily it was a dean I was erm... familiar with... I wasn't a huge trouble maker, but I'm sure by this point you realize I'm a bit stubborn if something is technically allowed... so stuff like eating in the halls (I know I'm a monster) and telling the religion history teacher he is wrong, and then proving he was, making them look bad in front of the class... were things they were familiar with me on.\n\nDean was pissed, went and got another dean who my friend was... familiar with... she comes over... \"Oh boy... why... why is it always somehow you two when this kind of stuff comes on my desk...\" \n\n\"Well dean [redacted] you see the rules are quite clear and I believe you have made that very clear to me on several occasions, that Specifically the rules are very clear and very easy to follow. I see absolutely no where that I am not allowed to wear a device that keeps sweat from my eyes as we live in the south I'm sure we can both agree it can get quite hot out. Well I'm a sweaty individual so this is practically a medical device, as in-between classes I could trip and fall and hurt myself with sweat in my eyes and who knows what if I trip into someone that would cause them to get hurt. I don't think I could live with myself...\" \n\n\nWe went back and forth for a bit but I stood my ground on it being within dress code. I mean the rules are very clear as to what you can and can't wear... they had all kinds of shit about your hair and other things like sweaters... all the bs that comes with a typical private school... but nothing against sweatbands. Yet... \n\nI was the sweatband kid for like a year, then wouldn't you know it next year... no sweatbands allowed. Except in PE, but that was more of an unwritten rule I got away with since it wasn't like everyone didn't give a fuck like me, and I say that on a social level, the deans terrified me lol, but the kids I couldn't possibly care any less about what they thought about me.",

But us guys had to suffer through with long pants on every day no shorts allowed. Jeans or khakis were our only option. \n\nA bunch of us guys got the idea that if girls were allowed to where skirts then we would wear a skirt too, so we did. On the same day about 40 of us, doesn't seem like much but that was a lot of people in my high school, my graduating class was just over 100 people for example. Anyway, all of us got called to the office and sent home for violating the dress code and we were additionally told that we were going to be receiving a 3 day suspension for doing so. \n\nAs expected some of our parents were pretty upset with what we had done until we told them why we did it. Then that attention was turned to the school and not surprisingly none of us had to serve a suspension and 2 days later guys were allowed to wear shorts to school. It was my senior year but I was still happy knowing we made an impact for everyone else.",

        "selftext": "  \n\nOk I have been meaning to type this up for awhile, this happened at my last job back in 2018. To give some background, I was working as a Data Analyst at a company in the ed-tech sector. For one of my projects, I created a report that we could give to the sales team, that they could then use when asking clients to renew their contract. \n\nClients were typically school systems or individual schools. The report was all graphs (even adults like pretty pictures) and it showed the clients data on how teachers/students were using the product. Then our sales guys could show hey X% of your students and teacher are using this X times a week, so you should sign a new contract with us. I developed this report for our biggest client, and had the top people in sales all put in input when developing it. The big client renewed which was great! They loved the report and wanted to use it for ALL renewals, and we had 5,000+ clients. I had to automated the process and everything seemed peachy until I hit a problem.... \n\nThe data for the report was pulled from our database (MSSQL if you are curious). Now I was in the Research department and I did not have access to the database. Instead our IT team had access to the database. If I wanted data, I had to put in a ticket, name all the data points I wanted, and I could only name 1 client per ticket. Also IT did their work in sprints which are basically 2 week periods of work. The tickets were always added to the NEXT sprint, so I ended up having to wait 2-4 weeks for data. This was fine for the big client report, but now that I was running this report for all renewals the ticket system was not going to work. \n\nNow if you have worked with sales you know they don't typically plan out 2-4 weeks ahead (at least they didn't at this company). I reached out to IT and requested direct access to the database, so I could stop putting in tickets and just pull (query) the data myself. Well that was immediately denied, all data requests will be filled by ONLY IT, and as a Research person I needed to stay in my lane. You might see where this is going.... \n\nI wasn't happy and sales wasn't happy with the delay but there was nothing anyone could do. Soooo I reached out to one of the sales managers to discuss a solution. Since data was going to take 2-4 weeks to arrive could he please send me EVERYONE that has a renewal coming up in the next 2-4 weeks. With 5,000+ customers that averages about 100 renewals a week. He smiled and understood what was going on, and happily sent me a list of 400ish clients. \n\nQuick note, the IT team spends the day BEFORE a sprint planning the next sprint, and all tickets submitted BEFORE the sprint had to be completed during the NEXT sprint. The sprint planning time was always Friday afternoon because the least amount of tickets rolled in. During the planning session they would plan all the work for the next 2 weeks (for the next sprint). Any tickets that came in before 5pm Friday had to be finished over the next two weeks. \n\nTime for the MC! Armed with my list of 400+ clients, I figured out when the next sprint started and cleared my schedule for the day BEFORE the new IT sprint started (aka their sprint planning Friday). At about 1 ticket a minute, it was going to take about 6 hours and 40 minutes to submit all the tickets so that's what I spent my whole Friday doing. \n\nLets not forget, they had to get the data for all the tickets during the next sprint as long as I submitted them before 5pm on Friday. That meant they had to take care of all 400 tickets in the next 2 weeks plus I submitted tickets throughout their spring planning meeting so they couldn't even plan for it all. \n\nIf you are not tech savvy this might not make sense, but if you are let me add an extra twist to this. They used JIRA at the time and the entire IT team had the JIRA app on their laptops. Most of them had push notifications set up so they got pinged every time a ticket was submitted. I would have paid good money to be a fly on the wall during that meeting watching a new ticket pop up about every minute. \n\nOk tech aside done,  I didn't hear a peep from them at all that Friday. To their credit, Monday I started getting data from my tickets. Now I had automated the reporting process on my end, so each report only took me a few minutes to run. I was churning out reports as quickly as I received the data without an issue and sales was loving it. I saw tickets coming in from every member of the IT team and during the second week many tickets came in after working hours, so obviously they were struggling to keep up. Again, I will give them full credit, they fulfilled every single ticket, but there was a lot of long days for them (everyone was salary so no overtime pay either). This is of course on top of all the other tickets they needed to complete, so it was quite a stressful sprint. \n\nUndeterred, I met with the sales manager again right before the next sprint and asked for the next set of clients with renewals. Then the day before the next sprint I began submitting tickets again....My work day started at 9am and by 10am the head of IT runs over to me. He is bug eyed and asked me how many tickets I was planning on submitting. I told him the same amount as last time (I only had 200 this time but he didn't know that), and I am pretty sure I saw him break on the inside. I did feel bad at this point so I said, \"Alternatively you could just give me access to the database and I could query the data myself\". I had the access before noon. \n\ntl;dr IT says I need to submit tickets for data instead of giving me direct access, I submit hundreds of tickets until they relent and give me access.",

Like, usually when you need information from a database, you need it ASAP so you can use that information to plan what you're doing next.\n\nThat policy might have made sense when computers were room sized, but it just seems strange to me for the modern era. If someone outside IT gives a legitimate reason to use the data, just give them access and set up logging to make sure there's nothing nefarious happening, and get all the relevant NDAs and privacy paperwork signed if necessary. Check every now and then for suspicious activity, and let them get on with it. They brought this on themselves",

We would have to beg and plead for the managers above us to go into the shitty software system to approve the changes.\n\nFinally the engineers decided to give up.  We would submit our changes, but we would not beg and plead.  When the work didn't get done we'd simply tell them, \"you didn't approve the change, so I didn't do the work.\"\n\nThe easy solution would have been for management to use their own shitty change tracking solution, but instead they started working outside of it giving us \"verbal approval\".  This always directly lead to an email from me saying, \"Manager, thank you for your verbal approval of change #12345\".  I had a manager that used to get upset with me saying I didn't trust him because I would document via email the verbal approvals I got.

            "I can sympathize with the IT department to a certain degree. I joined a hospital IT team in the late 80's, and needed some reports from the main patient database for a project I was on. The IT person ran the query for me - it was a Relational Database back when those were new. Unfortunately, the IT guy ran it against the production database, which caused a read lock to go up against the tables (it was a patient-visit table join), which resulted in several applications getting deadlocked. They had to restart the database to clear the locks, throwing everyone who was logged in off; and the IT guy and I got a stern talking to by the program leads.\n\nNowadays, RDBMSes are much more sophisticated, and typically use no blocking locks for read-only access; plus there's often a mirror DB against which these kinds of queries go. But old school DB admins might still be reluctant to grant that kind of access outside their department.\n\nThat said, I'm totally on OP's side here :-)",

            "I\u2019ve worked as a data engineer for a number of years now and I question the line about all tickets submitted before a sprint need to be completed during the next sprint.  That\u2019s not how agile works, and teams bring in the number of tickets matching the velocity that they can handle.  So if there are 400 tickets each being one point in complexity and the team does 55 points a sprint, then they would bring in 55 of those tickets.  If they finish them quicker, they pull in more.  If they finish them slower, then the ones not done roll into the next sprint.  But they wouldn\u2019t just hammer them all through at once regardless of the time it took because Agile teams try to be predictable with their velocity of work output.",
            "Sounds like the IT manager caved too soon.    Instead of granting you access, that report could have been parameterized and automated.   At some later point, a UI would then provide you access to run the report on demand.\n\nAlso, given that IT is running in Agile mode, the work has to be prioritized.   Meaning that just because you create the ticket does not mean that the work must be completed within that Sprint.   It means that the team must figure out what work can be completed.    And any tickets created during that period would need to be added to the following Sprints.   So, if the team has capacity for 100 of these reports (allowing for other work), and you have 250 tickets, then then remaining 150 would end up in the Backlog.\n\nAs a developer, it should be easy to sell the Product Owner on the idea of spending time on automating the report rather than doing it the long way.",

One second I'm driving and the next I'm halfway out the passenger window watching blood run off my head to pool in the glass of a previously closed window. Another second ticks by and I'm in the ER receiving thirteen crude stitches for eleven inches of wide open scalp. I lost more than two pints of blood and a large patch of hair. I also lost my favorite white fishnet t-shirt, but that's a separate tragedy.\n\nThat Friday of a Labor Day weekend was how my name shows up in the newspaper list of \"Labor Day Weekend Accidents.\" Tuesday comes and I go to class at the local college. Being a teenager gave me the gift of immortality. There I was, fully ambulatory, just four days after a serious car accident. For the sake of propriety, I'm wearing a hat to cover the fresh injury. It was a whitePanama hat with a bright 80s style hatband. As this was 1983, everything was 80s style, but that's a separate tragedy.\n\nHobbling along, I make it to Sociology just as class was beginning. I take a seat at the back of class and settle in. \n\nThe conversation went something like this:\n\n\"Excuse me? Could you remove your hat please?\" The teacher had her own sense of propriety. My hat didn't fit with proper classroom attire. \n\n\"I was in a car accident,\" I replied. \n\nDid she hear my words or was one of her rude students muttering another in a career-long list of excuses? Likely the latter was the case.\n\n\"Take the hat off. You cannot wear that in my class,\" indicated she was not happy with my hat. Not at all.\n\nWell, okay then. \n\nOff comes my hat. Roughly a third of my hair had been shaved off. The wound was pink and puckered. The seam had a line of dried blood in it. The wound began an inch beyond my missing hairline and continued back, branching into a 'Y' shape. The surgeon's instructions were to keep the wound clean, dry, and unbandaged. Lucky for all in attendance, my mother had washed my scalp the previous day. She used the word \"gore\" at some point to describe what was washing off.\n\nImagine you're one of my classmates.  Whatever you would say at that point would be something I heard from my classmates and friends. \n\n\"Ahhh, you can put your hat back on,\" said the teacher.\n\nNot before a little malicious compliance, I won't.\n\n\"But I can't wear hats in class,\" I replied. \"I mean, I can do it, but not if I'm breaking the rules.\"\n\n\"Please put your hat on.\" \n\n\"Okay. If you insist,\" and the hat went back on my head.\n\nMy advice is not to engage in malicious compliance on the first day of class. Not in a course where the teacher gives essay questions. That was the only 'C' I received that semester, but that's a separate tragedy.",

He went to get it and then went to his room.\n\n A few moments later he comes outs, beet red, hyperventilating, and holding a plastic ruler of all things. He comes at me and put him in a Full Nelson or Half Nelson or some kind of some kind of Nelson.

The first Matrix had just come out though, and wearing sunglasses every where was definitely a thing. \n\nI had a good handle on it until Mom comes out of her room. Pissed. I realized how the situation looked and I loosened my grip on my brother. Mistake. He now had enough wiggle room to swing his arm around and the tip of his ruler scratched my eye. Ouch. So Mom takes me to the ER, and thankfully no real damaged had been done. Just scratched some thing or other or what ever. They gave me some ointment and sent me home. \n\nWhen I wake up in the morning my entire left eye is blood red. It was incredibly creepy to look at. There isn\u2019t any real pain, but I did have some light sensitivity  so I grabbed my pair of sunglasses and went to school.

Take them off.\u201d My friend looked at him and said, \u201cbut\u2026 I have cancer\u201d. He was so so so mortified and we still chuckle about it today.",

I changed my major and it was not good timing. Oops,\n\nHe graded on attendance. I had an A on every test. No matter. The final letter grade I paid him for, was a D. We pay our professors in tuition to act like demigods. He said I missed three days. D\n\nThat is a separate tragedy.\n\nEach missed class, amounted to a full letter grade, drop. No matter what had happened. He failed the lady who sat next to me, because she took a week off class when her son died. She got an F.\n\nSo, I felt I had no hope. He left on a sabbatical and the grievance committee told me I had two choices. Repeat the Class or wait to file a grievance when he returned and lose.\n\nThat was a separate tragedy.\n\nI repeated his class four years later, and when my endo acted up again. This time I was told I would die if I did not have surgery. This was a week before his final. I was upset. I was angry. I was in the front and center of every class session that second time, even coming in with the flu, a box of tissues, bottled water Lysol spray and a trash can for my tissues. I was there. I cleared two rows, but I was there every single class period. I was told to just talk to him during office hours to see if I could take the final early. Of course the answer was, \"No\".\n\nI was pre-admitted for surgery. I had a hospital bracelet on on the day of the final and a parent waiting for me outside the auditorium, with my other parent waiting to drive me directly to the hospital after the final. I finished that shitty multiple choice test in six minutes. I handed it to him. He looked at my hospital bracelet and said, \"I guess you really are sick\". \n\nHe came into the restaurant where I worked for four years, during school, about six months after that. l walked off the floor.

            "I responded to a MVC with injuries at 3 am. The guy had flipped his truck and wasn\u2019t wearing a seatbelt. He was lucky he wasn\u2019t killed. This happened in a very rural area (in the days juuussstttt before widespread cellphone usage) and he had to walk a little bit to find a house to make a 911 call. \n\nWe got there and make patient contact.  He had flapped his forehead from just above his left eyebrow across his forehead to about four inches above his right eyebrow, transversing the entire front of his head. \n\nI was talking to him as we got him situated with a c-collar, CID, backboard, and straps. He said after the accident he was walking back to the house he had passed earlier to make a call for a buddy to come get him. It was summertime and very warm and humid. He felt what he thought was sweat dripping into his eyes and he went to wipe his brow. That was when he realized, and I quote, \u201cI had done some horrific shit to my dome.\u201d I nearly laughed when he said that.",
            "I was in a car accident my junior year of high school. I hydroplaned into a tree and even though I was wearing my seatbelt, I was thrown into the side window. Had similar issue with my head, as well, my left arm was super torn up (all superficial luckily). The accident was Saturday night, monday was MLK JR day and my birthday (tomorrow will actually be the 14th anniversary of the accident). After being airlifted to the hospital and spending all night in the trauma unit, my parents wouldn't let the plastic surgeon resident do anything to my forehead since she's immediately saying skin graft. Tuesday I go to see a plastic surgeon, who basically says the skin has folded up on itself, I won't need a skin graft, but I need surgery to fix it and schedules the surgery for that Friday.\n\nSo Monday was a holiday, Tuesday I spend meeting with doctors, Wednesday my parents let me stay home and Friday is my surgery. Y'all know parents, education is important and don't want me missing a whole week of school after, ya know I could've died, so Thursday off to school I go with the explicit directions to keep my arm and head bandaged, and try not to tear the stitches in my arm.\n\nEvery time I walk down the hallways or walk into a class, I'm getting looks of fascinated horror. Of course by third period (which actually has two friends who were in the car with me but walked away unscathed) all my bandages are completely falling apart, I'm slightly bleeding from arm and light drip forms on my forehead. That teacher, who was one of the best teachers I've ever had, is horrified I'm even at school and is now watching me bleed in the classroom, goes to call my parents to say I shouldn't be there and they should come pick me up. This is where I maliciously comply with my parents, I tell the teacher how important it is I be there and I'll be fine. I go to bathroom with a friend to rewrap myself back up and continue on with the day.\n\nThen, again, an hour later the good vice principal sees me and tries to send me home and I'm just like nope. End of the day when my Mother comes to get me, my face has dried blood on it, the bandage on my arm is completely falling off and my left sleeve is now quite crimson. I tell her how I had to convince 2 staff memebers to allow me to stay at school all day. She goes \"oops, perhaps we should've given you one more day off.\" Oh well, I was the talk of the school for the next month.",

            "Random story to share. Feel free to read or not. \n\nI had an engineering professor in college who was vehemently against hats. No hats absolutely in the classroom, doesn't matter what. She was also probably the most strict professor we had. Everything must be turned in on time, no exceptions. Any delays will be met with harsh penalty. On top of that, her core curriculum ENGR classes were always brutal. HW every night and random quizzes to make sure you were doing the work. It was A LOT. She was always willing to help, had lenient office hours, and had plenty of willing TA's. In terms of workload though and demeanor, she could be absolutely brutal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo give some context on my professor, she was an older (60's) lady from Poland with an extensive history in engineering and she was tenured. Her hair was grey and short ([Like this](https://www.google.com/search?q=short+gray+hair&rlz=1C1GCEU_enUS969US969&tbm=isch&source=iu&ictx=1&vet=1&fir=5IAnAROL-2AqaM%252CEC7Gw0KW2MdNvM%252C_%253BxOQVsktDLrq1rM%252CR68-4_O7Md26KM%252C_%253BWKfu2nPuYfilaM%252CCFEbjy1hPrwBAM%252C_%253B3djLgzAT-cTejM%252CLhpdn-dc-w9u1M%252C_%253BZjV15UuLSnoTIM%252CSrSaGw_vRyOZYM%252C_%253BDsm7rr4RxbzPyM%252CLhpdn-dc-w9u1M%252C_%253BPV6I8Su5zH5TaM%252CaxjvKMla9vS6nM%252C_%253Bso-rPxrR76vtyM%252CM4lbqVGbHRoloM%252C_%253BfIkzyTUSItJZgM%252CvvcAskzSKZ_aCM%252C_%253BZvTwNjbzIPqByM%252CLhpdn-dc-w9u1M%252C_%253B1lPmCJXSlOwwZM%252CR68-4_O7Md26KM%252C_%253BCXAFoVvOSyIdPM%252C71z_M00N9mCqAM%252C_%253BiDGCJc5D_bs47M%252CDwJeTrXmI2HGyM%252C_%253BPEhm3GO1LPQU1M%252CEiFGEI-AsFNq4M%252C_%253BQWW1uDXg0YkRtM%252Ce0PsfPYeAyRjBM%252C_%253BfrCKYPZoaO9rVM%252CZhGw1JEIpDri9M%252C_%253BZmG57i_WQzmyYM%252CLhpdn-dc-w9u1M%252C_&usg=AI4_-kStoV8ONLigrmT24GmfkLrH6P1OEg&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwja26Wj9bv1AhUQl2oFHVQ7DesQ9QF6BAg0EAE#imgrc=ZvTwNjbzIPqByM), but with not as much flow). She was very smart, but boy could she be strict.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, Senior year, the engineers in our school take an ethics course to cover Engineering topics and she is the professor. Everyone presents a topic twice throughout the semester on various disasters or engineering topics over the years. The presentations are only 20 minutes, but the lectures are student lead, and graded by all students and the Prof. There was always a discussion and questions after and it usually delved into good conversations. Even still in this laid back setting, even if you weren't presenting, THERE WILL TO BE NOT HATS WORN IN CLASS. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost of the topics generated discussion, but there was one presentation I remember distinctly that she was in the back of the classroom, listening and tears forming in her eyes. It was a presentation on Chernobyl, and she was very familiar with that history as someone who immigrated from Poland.  She was a young girl when Chernobyl occurred, so she was still very much a piece of that part of history. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, as a senior and we were more comfortable approaching her, we asked why she hated hats so much. Her answer really didn't resonate with me until years after I had graduated. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou see, It's not that she is against hats, but young people have such beautiful hair. She wants us to show our beauty, our youth, and our hair, even if it isn't in the most perfect state. As weird as it may sound typing out, young vibrant hair was better to look at than hats. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe passed away this past year after a long battle with cancer, and that's when her comments clicked with me. Our hair reminded her of when she was young, vibrant, and full of life, just as we were in our classes. Seeing our hair brought back memories that she can only cherish, never truly relive. To relive them, she has to do so through us, through her messages, and through her teachings. She was a brilliant professor who I really wish I had the opportunity to go back and thank. Unfortunately, I can not bring her back, but hopefully spreading her story will help push her message beyond the reaches she was physically capable of. Life is too short to take things for granted, enjoy your time in the present, enjoy life, and take time to smell the roses. You never know when it'll be your time for your hair to go.",

            "Winter in Alaska.  When I was in kindergarten, we were outside at recess.  Well I was tired of playing (it was cold), so I lined up where we were supposed to, next to the office by the railing.\n\nOne minute I\u2019m standing there, minding my own business, the next thing I remember is being dragged out from under something and being taken into the nurses office.\n\nAbove the office there were some eaves two stories up, and ice had built up really bad on them.  Well just my luck, as I had been standing under them, one let loose and fell on me.  Really the only thing that made this not more serious was the fact that I was (am) short, and the railing took most of the force.  It was something like 6 feet by 4 feet by 6 inches of ice.\n\nMy mom happened to be standing on the other side of the school, waiting with my uncle for me and my cousin to get let out.  She didn\u2019t have a cell phone at the time (1994), but my uncle was my other \u201cin case of emergency,\u201d so they called them.\n\nThey rushed down to the office to see me sitting there in the nurses office.  Pretty sure the first thing I said was \u201cI\u2019m hungry\u201d and the nurse gave me some Hershey kisses.\n\nI was so mad, I had worn my favorite shirt that day - it was a black shirt with a frilly white collar.  Ruined.\n\nSo they take me to urgent care to get sewed up.  I remember looking up and seeing my mom bawling her eyes out.  I guess because this was in the 90s, no one was worried about head injuries.. but I got three stitches.\n\nThe next week at school was a joy. I couldn\u2019t wash my hair, so I had to wear a hat the entire time.  It was pink felt with a flower on it.  Luckily no one asked me to take it off, my hair was so gross.",

        "selftext": "Back in the 1980's I worked for a sporting goods company as a catalog designer. Small company, privately owned. I was the entire advertising department. I created four catalogs a year - these were responsible for most of our mail-order sales (pre-internet) to the tune of around $700K a year.\n\nWe sent the catalogs via bulk mail using a mailing service - this let us send them for a much discounted rate. To do this required the use of a bulk mail permit, and placing the permit info on the mailing area of the catalog. Technically it's called a \"fiche.\"\n\nEnter a new boss, call him Ron. I was #1 - the only one - in my department. For some reason the company owner hired Ron as a favor to a friend. From day one he was micromanaging, questioning everything, and screwing up my very tight schedule. This was BEFORE computers were common. EVERYTHING was by hand. Literally typing out copy and reducing it on a photocopier to fit. Developing the photo film myself, making prints, etc. The actual printer had to add screens to the photos so they'd print, burn metal plates, and so on. All time consuming and expensive. Deadlines could not be missed. So I was stuck with several 16 hour days come crunch-time.\n\nI was complaining to the owner, but he really couldn't care less. I really wanted to stick it to Ron and the opportunity presented itself. Constant threats of \"my way or you're fired\" were getting to me. The latest pre-summer catalog was done (summer was our BIG season.) I had to give him my mock-up (photocopied sheets stapled together) of the final catalog for his approval - a new step added after he demanded it. He looked at it and sent it back with several pointless revisions. And a note to remove that \"ugly permit box\" because it was not needed. Where he worked previously stuffed their mailers in envelopes - the envelopes had the fiche, but their mailer did this last step. I simply asked him to initial the changes as this was the final approved version and was going to the printer the next day. There was no time to check it again. So he did. I knew it would be a total mess and it's something I would NEVER would have done in the past.\n\n50,000 catalogs printed and shipped directly to the mailer. The day they arrive at the mailer the boss gets a call from the sales rep. \"We can't mail your catalogs.\" Boss storms into my area of the building and is literally screaming. Ron is now pissed and yelling at me, joined by the boss. I swear - spittle and froth, vein bulging screaming. Minimum two week delay, wasted money, lost sales. I explain what happened, the threat to fire me, and showed the owner the changes to the final copy. Initialed by Ron. He was going to give Ron a 2nd chance until the bill came in from the printer. They had to stamp 50,000 catalogs by hand. We had to rent their permit, since that's what was on their stamp. Rental and labor was almost $8,000. Adjusted for inflation that's $20,000. Plus our early summer sales boost was off by almost $50K from previous years. Or $200K adjusted for inflation.\n\nRon WAS fired. I was left alone after that.",

This would have made it a lot simpler.

        "selftext": "I worked for a university IT department as a student worker for a little over 4 years. We had a sister department, the media center, who loaned out laptops, projectors, and other technology to professors as needed. \n\nIn my 4th year in employment, I was on a first name basis with nearly all the employees of the university, including the head of the media center. We'll call her Karen, because obviously. \n\nKaren was the queen of her Kingdom and had quite a few obnoxious rules in place, but most importantly was an iron clad employee ID policy for checking out laptops. Under normal circumstances I completely agree with this policy, however this wasn't a normal circumstance.\n\nWe got a call from her at 4:40 on a Friday (we closed at 5) that a laptop she was trying to loan out to a very important professor wasn't able to log into the network, and she requested we come look at it. Sure thing. \n\nI make the 10 minute walk across campus from our office to the media center with my tool kit. When I get there I see the professor and Karen and ask to see the laptop, she says \"Wait sawser, you need your name badge. Where is it?\" \n\nFlash to My name badge, clipped to my jacket, hanging on a coat rack in the ITS office. \n\n\"Ah, It's on my jacket Karen. I forgot to grab it rushing over here.\" I chuckled a bit. \n\nDeadpan, she says \"Sawser, you can't work on this until you go get your badge.\"\n\n\"Karen, I thought this was an emergency. Do you need me to fix this right now?\"\n\n\"Yes of course,\" Karen explained, \"but we still need to always follow policy.\"\n\n\"Fair enough. Policy is incredibly important. I'll go get my name badge\"\n\nI left the office, trekked the ten minutes back to my office. Then I picked up the phone and called her. \n\n\"Hey Karen, just letting you know that because it's 5:20 and policy states student workers can't work after hours, I'll have to come back Monday. Have a great weekend!\"\n\nShe fumed at me for a few minutes until I essentially hung up on her. \n\nPolicy is very important.\n\n\n------------------------------------------\nEDIT: Adding this from my comment below re: \"What happened on Monday?\":\n\nMy boss did not like Karen at all. He was an amazing guy in general (late 50s, survived cancer, has MS, but still ran security at biker rallies.) He'd been with the university for about 30 years and had 8 weeks pto. So he would take months off and ride around the country with his equally amazing wife.\n\nThis was in 2005 and he set the standard for what I would consider a good boss.\n\nSo he came in Monday Morning to a bunch of voicemails from her about it, yells over to me \"Sawser, did you leave Karen hanging on Friday?\"\n\n\"Yeah Chuck (his real name, because he's amazing), forgot my name badge.\"\n\n\"Yeah you are pretty forgetful sometimes.\"\n\nHe shrugged and that was that.\n\nKaren had to loan her individual work laptop to the professor for the week.\n\nFor the curious, the problem was that in windows XP days, when logging in Windows would attempt to connect to every saved wireless network top to bottom.\n\nBecause this was a loaner, and there were literally hundreds of hotel, airport, and restaurant wifi, it was taking ~8 or 9 minutes for the logon prompt to come up.\n\nIt took me around 30 seconds to clear out all the saved wifi connections and return the laptop to them. Karen was not in the office when I went to work on it Monday morning.\n\n--------------------------------------------\nEdit 2: \n\nI 100% was in the wrong here, because I forgot my name badge. I didn't flout the name badge policy on purpose - it was a mistake. Anyone familiar with the midwest will confirm that sometimes it's bitter cold in the morning, but by late afternoon it's warm enough you don't need a jacket. During my morning tickets I was wearing a jacket and had my name badge on it. Over lunch, I took my jacket off and didn't need it. It was a mistake, and Karen decided that the badge policy was too important for her to overlook my mistake. Which is definitely her prerogative. And it's mine to overlook the 'student workers cannot be paid overtime' rule. The laptop was fixed within 45 *business* minutes of her reporting the problem to our office, which in my opinion is relatively fast.\n\nName badges and security policies *are* important. And I could understand her not wanting to let me 'check out' the laptop as if I was a faculty member using their services. But I was an it employee working late on a friday even though I wouldn't be done in time so we both could take care of that professor. I wasn't taking the laptop home, I was working on it in front of her.\n\nAdditionally it was HER departments policy that she wouldn't let people handle laptops without signing them out, but not ours. Our department had no official name badge policy.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nEdit 3: \n\nWell there are a lot of assumptions going on. Guys this was 2005, the purpose of the name badge was so when they wrote down who has the laptop, they could write down who had the laptop. But I wasn't taking the laptop anywhere. \n\nIn no other department and in no other course of our job was our ID required, and at no point in any other part of our jobs did we have to sign for equipment. \n\nIt was literally this one woman's department.",

Karen was saying stupid things like \"make sure the virtual machine you buy has lots of memory\", you know, all the things you don't need to run Apache with some mostly static content. I made the mistake of commenting that they should really consider a few other important things that were not yet mentioned. And carried on with my day.\n\nIt went about as well as you'd expect.

        "selftext": "Here\u2019s a way I used malicious compliance to get paid for doing nothing for the next year, while dedicating my efforts to the success of the competitors of the people who are paying me. This one is EXCEPTIONALLY long, but I hope you consider it worth the time.  \n\n**The Setting:**  \n\nOffice of a small plumbing company offering residential and commercial services, 6 days per week plus emergency service after hours and Sundays. 3 employees that handle dispatching technicians, invoicing, scheduling, parts ordering, etc. We all have the same skill set and cover each other\u2019s backs. Technically, we\u2019ve all been hired as Dispatchers, take note. Administrative stuff like payroll, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, Marketing are all done at Head Office, which has another 2 locations just like ours.  \n\n**The Cast:**  \n\nOP:  30\u2019s guy, single, no kids, very flexible schedule.  \n\nSmashley: Late 20\u2019s, single Mom raising 3 brats between 5 & 10 years old. Constantly leaving early and missing days due to Motherhood duties\u2026doctor appointments, school meetings, etc.  \n\nHoward: Older than dirt, I think he helped Noah build the Ark. Has even more elderly parents with dementia, and has an arrangement with his Sister. He lives with his parents on Fri-Sat-Sun, and works Mon-Thurs. Not available on the weekend under any circumstances. His Sister lives with the parents Mon-Thurs. Howard doesn\u2019t need the job, but if he leaves, then his Sister will offload some of these days onto his plate, and he\u2019s having none of that.  \n\nSOB: you\u2019ll meet him later.  \n\nSo the way this worked was Howard would come in at 6am and work until 2:30pm, Mon-Thurs. Smashley would come in and work 9am to 3pm, Mon-Fri, after getting her kids off to school, and leaving early to pick them up. She would cover the weekends remotely from home. She also came in at 6am on Fridays, since Howard wasn\u2019t in. I would come in at 11am, work to 7:30pm, Mon-Fri, and cover on-call emergencies after hours. My hours were altered from the 8-4:30 in my contract by verbal mutual agreement. I didn\u2019t mind, I like to sleep in.  \n\nAll went along fabulously for a couple of years, until Smashley fucked it all up. One of her duties was vetting and submitting timesheets for payroll, and Head Office noticed that one of the techs was consistently making more than the others. It turned out that Smashley was doing some horizontal dancing with one of the plumbers, and was inflating his hours on the payroll. It all came to light when a customer called for a warranty issue on some work that was done, and we could find no records in our system. The customer insisted that our tech was out, and \u201cthe lady on the phone\u201d had told them that there was a 20% discount for cash. Emails were sent to Head Office, GPS records of the truck were examined, and their little scheme was discovered. She was puffing hours for the plumber, and they were making money on cash side jobs on the weekend. Both were fired for cause, and Smashley was stuck trying to raise 3 kids with no job and no unemployment.  \n\nSo now it\u2019s just me and Howard. HR and Owner called us into a meeting and explained that Smashley was no longer employed. We worked out a \u201ctemporary\u201d arrangement for scheduling until a 3rd person could be added to the team.  \n\nHoward would work his usual Mon-Thurs, staying until 4pm on Mon & Tues. He would predispatch any late calls, which we would try to avoid. The Field Supervisor for the plumbers would take after hours calls directly on Mon & Tues.  \n\nI would work Wed-Sun, and come in at 8am on Fri, and work until my regular close time. I would predispatch the plumber\u2019s first calls on Thursday nights. I covered after hours calls Wed-Sun.  \n\nWe were assured that this was a temporary arrangement until a replacement for Smashley could be found. She was let go last May. With only 2 people covering the office, neither Howard nor I could take any time off, as there was nobody to cover.  \n\nSeptember 1, Enter SOB.  \n\nSOB was brought into the picture to handle administrative stuff, which admittedly, had gotten a little loose when only Howard and I were covering. Things like missing PO\u2019s on parts orders, missing packing slips, reports of revenue and expenses being incomplete, that sort of thing. We were far too busy just trying to keep things running shorthanded to deal with any of this stuff. Howard and I were also told that SOB would \u201ccover the dispatch board\u201d if required.  \n\nHe was an ass. He came into the shop claiming that he had been brought in to \u201cwhip us into shape\u201d. I couldn\u2019t stand him from the beginning. Abrupt, aggressive and with a vocabulary that used a lot of swear words. Just a dick.  \n\nWhatever. Let him handle the outward-facing stuff, dealing with vendors, ordering parts, fleet maintenance, all that crap. He also handled timesheets for payroll and reporting to Head Office. Fine. I am good with that, and if I have to deal with his bullshit for a couple hours 3 days a week, fine. I only worked under the same roof with him Wed-Fri, from 11am until his departure around 5pm. It was endurable.  \n\nI had requested time off twice after he arrived and had been denied both times. Worthy of note is that my contract specified 3 weeks holiday a year, and up until he arrived, I had only taken 2 days off in the spring.  \n\nFast forward to late November. If anything, SOB had gotten worse. He was really getting under my skin, and I had just about had enough. I have a teensy issue with anger, and it was becoming more and more difficult to reign in my rage and kick the shit out of him.  \n\nThen came the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. I looked at my pay stub and saw that I was short 5 hours. I get paid, not only for the hours I am scheduled, but also for time I put in covering after-hours emergency calls. This routinely put me up around 46 to 48 hours a week, with overtime after 44 hours. So these 5 hours I was short were OVERTIME hours.  \n\nI went to SOB on the Friday payday, and asked for an explanation. He replied that he had been directed to bring overtime down, and if I check my email, I will see a directive that states that under NO CIRCUMSTANCES is anyone to work overtime in this office. This was clearly directed at me and me only, as Howard only put in 36 hours a week, and didn\u2019t cover on-call.  \n\n\u201cSo why am I short 5 hours on this pay?\u201d  \n\n\u201cI deducted 30 minutes each day for lunch.\u201d  \n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t take a lunch. I just eat a sandwich at my desk.\u201d  \n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. I can take 30 minutes off your pay each day as unpaid break time. It\u2019s the letter of the law.\u201d  \n\n\u201cBut I actually worked these hours. Are you serious? You\u2019re deducting time for breaks I didn\u2019t take?\u201d  \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the letter of the law. You don\u2019t like it, take it up with the labor board. I don\u2019t have time for this shit. Get back to your fucking desk and do your fucking job.\u201d  \n\nAll right, motherfucker. NOW it\u2019s on. Piss me off all you like, be a dick all you like, but fuck with my money? You are going to pay. I will fuck you over HARD.  \n\nI have a good friend, Eric,  that I have known since High School who is an associate at one of the better law firms in town. I invited him out for a few beers and some wings on Sunday night, and asked him if his firm handled stuff like this. You know, it\u2019s amazing the amount of advice you can get for a few pieces of chicken and some beer.  \n\nMonday, I drove across town to a store and bought one of [these]( https://www.amazon.ca/Monichamp-Recorder-Reduction-distance-Recording/dp/B07HQBZ1Q4/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=pen+audio&qid=1555899834&s=gateway&sr=8-10). They are pretty easy to get, just Google \u201cspy shop\u201d for your city or order one off Amazon. I fiddled around with it, and figured out how to get it to work.  \n\nOn Wednesday, I showed up for work at my usual 11am start time, and things in the office were business as usual\u2026until 4pm on the dot. I took my sandwich, a Coke, and a paperback novel, and sat in my car.  \n\nIt didn\u2019t take long. About 10 after 4 SOB comes storming into the parking lot and demands to know exactly what the fuck I am doing. \u201cTaking my lunch break,\u201d I replied.  \n\n\u201cThe phones are ringing off the hook, Jeff needs to process a credit card payment, and Mike is just about to clear his call. I need you back in there, right now.\u201d  \n\n\u201cSorry, SOB, but if you\u2019re not paying me for my break time, then I am not working through my break time. Either you handle it, or I\u2019ll take care of it in (checks countdown timer on cell phone) 17 minutes\u201d. And then I rolled the window back up.  \n\nIt was beautiful. SOB turned red and stomped back in to the office. When I returned, he demanded to know what the hell I thought I was up to.  \n\n\u201cI am entitled to a 30 minute unpaid break. You took that time off my time sheet, so now I am taking my break. I am entitled to it. It\u2019s the letter of the law.\u201d He sputtered, but had no response, so I went back to my desk.  \n\n5 minutes later I get an email instructing me to take my break before 2pm, so I can be back at my desk before Howard leaves for the day.  \n\nI replied to his email, BCC copying the owner of the company, and HR. I replied that I was unable to do so, because, as per labor law, I was not entitled to a lunch break until 5 hours into my shift. Therefore, I would continue to be away from my desk for 30 minutes beginning at 4pm. I even snipped and pasted a paragraph from the labor board website to support my position.  \n\nHe came into my office and chewed me out at length. I wouldn\u2019t budge. I told him, \u201cIt\u2019s the letter of the law, if you have a problem with it, take it up with the labor board.\u201d  \n\nOn Thursday, just after SOB left for the day, I composed and sent him an email, again BCC copying in Owner and HR. I explained that I had agreed to changing my hours on a temporary basis until a third person could be added to the office. I also agreed to continue to work them until the transition was complete. As SOB was now firmly in the groove, I now withdraw my consent to the change of hours as contractually specified, and beginning Monday, would revert to the hours in my contract.  \n\nFriday I show up at 11am, and SOB is waiting for me with a printout of the email. \u201cHR and Owner have been calling me, what the fuck is this all about?\u201d  \n\n\u201cSimple. When I was hired, my hours were in the contract. Monday to Friday, 8am to 4:30pm. They were changed by verbal agreement. Well, I withdraw my consent, and stand on the hours specified in my contract.\u201d  \n\n\u201cFuck that. You work the same hours until I tell you differently.\u201d  \n\n\u201cThe hours of service in the contract are the letter of the law, contract law. If you want to change the hours, we can always renegotiate the contract. You want to alter the hours, fine, then I want to alter my rate of pay.\u201d There was a flurry of emails\u2026he would sent them to me, and I would copy HR and Owner on my replies, since he wasn\u2019t copying them in at all.  \n\nSo I worked Sunday, as usual, then showed up Monday at 8am. Howard asked me what the hell was going on, because SOB was badmouthing me all over the place, to him and to the techs.\nOne thing you should know is that a good dispatcher in the service industry is a rare thing. There are trucking dispatchers, and taxi dispatchers, and tow truck dispatchers, but finding one that knows how to balance plumbers and customers and solve problems is tough. I get along with all my plumbers and they are asking me what\u2019s happening. I take the high road and basically reveal nothing. I get along with these guys quite well.  \n\nTowards early afternoon I send SOB an email explaining that there are some late calls\u2026.how late do you need me to work? He replies, \u201cUntil the calls are run.\u201d Perfect. So I end up working until 6:30. Same on Tuesday, but 7pm. Wednesday, too. Sent emails both days, and SOB told me to stay both times. He replied to me only, and I sent an \u201cOkay\u201d email reply copying the bosses in.  \n\nBy Thursday morning, I had racked up 39.5 hours. 38 were in the office, and 1.5 hours taking after-hours calls. About 10am I sent an email, again copying the bigwigs, and, detailing my hours for the week,  explaining that at 12:30pm I would have a total of 44 hours, and as per SOB\u2019s directive of such-and-such a date prohibiting overtime, I was left with no choice but to go home. Just before I hit \u201csend\u201d I turned to Howard and said, \u201cYou might want to make some popcorn.\u201d  \n\nSOB comes storming in, and demands to know what the fuck. \n \n\u201cWell, SOB, I am only following your directive. You said no overtime, right? Well, as of 12:30, I will be on OT. Unless you say different, then I have to go. So it\u2019s either rescind the \u201cno overtime\u201d, or I head out. Your call.\u201d  \n\nSOB is now fucked. He\u2019s been told to dial back on the overtime, and now he\u2019s going to have to pay me OT for half of Thursday, all of Friday, and all of Saturday\u2026.or cover the dispatch board himself. \n\u201cWork the fucking weekend, goddamn it, you miserable fuck. You\u2019ll pay for this shit.\u201d  \n\n\u201cOkay, I need that in writing. And I can\u2019t work Sunday, you have to.\u201d  \n\n\u201cListen, you little shit, you don\u2019t tell me when I have to work, I tell YOU when you have to work, and you\u2019re working Sunday!!\u201d  \n\n\u201cNope. Labor law says specifically that I get one day off in seven. I can show you. Since I worked last Sunday, and I am working every other day this week, I get this coming Sunday off. It\u2019s the letter of the law. Howard can\u2019t work it, I can\u2019t work it, so I guess you have to.\u201d  \n\n\u201cBut my kid has a tournament on Sunday. Can\u2019t you bend the rules?\u201d  \n\n\u201cSorry, it\u2019s the letter of the law\u201d  \n\nSOB was a real treat to be around for Thursday and Friday, I assure you. And my little spy pen recorded every word out of his mouth.  \n\nMonday I come in, I think this was the 26th of November, and the Owner, and HR, and SOB are waiting for me. Owner and HR want to know what the hell is going on, they are getting reports that I am being insubordinate and threatening to abandon my job. SOB wants to can me, and up until 2 weeks ago I was a model employee.  \n\nI explain everything, and refer them to the emails that I copied them in on. They ask what started this whole mess, and I told them that SOB had said he was told to reduce overtime, and took time off my check that I had actually worked. He demanded that I go back to work on my break, and that I schedule my break 3 hours into my shift. I laid it all out.  \n\nOwner gave SOB the stink-eye and said, \u201cI never told you to dial back OT\u201d  \n\nThey asked me if I would be willing to go back to the hours I was working before. \u201cWe can discuss it, but since this would be a major change to my employment contract, we will need to renegotiate it. Including my rate of pay.\u201d  \n\n\u201cCan you go back to those hours, and then we\u2019ll schedule a meeting?\u201d  \n\n\u201cNo, thank you. If I revert to previous hours then you have no reason to schedule a meeting. We do the meeting first, then once we have a deal, you get the hours changed.\u201d  \n\n\u201cLet us talk about it, we\u2019ll get back to you.\u201d  \n\n\u201cOkay, but you need to discuss this soon. I am taking the last three weeks of December as vacation time.\u201d  \n\nSOB explodes, with Owner and HR right there. \u201cYou cocksucker, you\u2019re not taking any fucking vacation without my approval, and I\u2019m not approving a god damned fucking minute of vacation for you.\u201d  \n\nI turn to Owner and HR. \u201cBy labor law, I am entitled to vacation time yearly. By contract law, I am entitled to three weeks. So far, I have taken 2 days this year. I have requested vacation twice, and SOB denied it both times. I couldn\u2019t take it in between when you fired Smashley and hired SOB, because there were only two of us in the office.  \n\n\u201cI get three weeks a year, and we are coming up to the end of the year. Company policy is \u2018use them or lose them\u2019, so I am using them.\u201d  \n\nHR says, \u201cWe\u2019ll pay you out the accrued vacation time.\u201d  \n\nI look at her and reply, \u201cI don\u2019t agree to your offer. I am entitled to the time. I want the time, not the money.\u201d  \n\nShe thinks for a minute, and says, \u201cWe\u2019ll roll it over into the new year.\u201d  \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree to your offer. I am entitled to the time this year, not next year.\u201d  \n\nSOB pipes up, \u201cBut Howard already has 2 weeks booked off. And I\u2019m taking my family to Florida. You can\u2019t take the time, there\u2019s nobody to run the shop.\u201d  \n\n\u201cWhat? You\u2019re going to Florida? So you expect me to run the entire show, alone, work 7 days a week, and you send an email saying No Overtime? Are you fucking serious?\u201d  \n\nBack to Owner and HR, \u201cLook, I had to work a full year before I was entitled to a vacation. All of the plumbers have to work a full year before they are entitled to a vacation. Labor law says you have to work a full year before you\u2019re entitled to a vacation. And he\u2019s telling me that I am not allowed to take my vacation because he\u2019s going to Florida, and he\u2019s only been here for 3 months? Is THAT what I am hearing here?  \n\n\u201cYou guys told me to hold off on vacation time until we got a third person\u201d Points at SOB. \u201cWell there he is, right there, and I am taking the vacation I am entitled to. No payout. No rollover. And if you want to renegotiate my contract, it can wait until the new year.\u201d And I stormed out of the office.  \n\nI don\u2019t know what the rest of the meeting was like, but about an hour later SOB starts chewing me out again, saying how he\u2019s out thousands of dollars and now he has to tell his kids that they are going to Disney World. Calls me every name in the book.  \n\nThe next 2 weeks were hell. What an asshole. Calling me names, telling me he won\u2019t rest until I am out on my ass, telling me I\u2019m the worst piece of crap he ever worked with.  \n\nSo I took my vacation time, didn\u2019t do a damn thing, didn\u2019t travel, just kicked back and relaxed, and spent time with my parents over the holidays.  \n\nI get back in January and there\u2019s a new face sitting at my desk, and SOB is there with a shit-eating grin and my separation papers. HR put \u201claid off\u201d rather than \u201cfired\u201d, so I had that going for me, which was nice.  \n\nNow where I live, if someone calls a former employer for a reference, all the former employer is permitted to say is the timeframe the former employee worked there, and whether or not he would be eligible for rehire.  \n\nSo a few days into January, SOB gets a phone call.  \n\n\u201cHi, SOB, my name is Eric, and we\u2019re looking at OP\u2019s resume, here. He says you were his most recent employer. You\u2019re on speaker, what can you tell us about him?\u201d  \n\nSOB goes off like a stick of dynamite, calling me every name in the book, saying that I was a horrible worker, lying about missing time, telling all sorts of bullshit. I let him go on and on.  \n\n\u201cHey, SOB. Recognize my voice?\u201d  \n\nHe stops his ranting. \u201cYeah. You fucker. I know your voice.\u201d  \n\n\u201cEver hear of the law offices of Dewey, Screwem, Ober, and Howe? They\u2019re lawyers. And this call is being placed from their conference room. Nice talking to you, SOB. The next call we\u2019re making is to Owner, and getting his lawyer\u2019s name.\u201d  \n\nIt took a while, but a meeting got scheduled with Owner, HR, SOB, Owner\u2019s Lawyer, me and Eric. Eric explained that I was starting a claim for wrongful dismissal, and this meeting was to explore the possibility of a settlement. We laid out everything. Every email, a timeline of events, and then the piece de la resistance\u2026.a supercut of the audio of SOB yelling, threatening, ranting, and just being SOB. It was beautiful.  \n\nSOB went white. Owner stared at him the whole time like he wanted to erase him from the face of the Earth. They asked us to excuse them for a few minutes, so Eric and I went for a coffee and chuckled. They texted us within 20 minutes to return.  \n\nOwner\u2019s Lawyer explained that they were admitting no liability or wrongdoing, but that, as a gesture of goodwill, they were willing to offer me three months severance, if I would sign a waiver. Eric smiled, declined, and then played the tape from the conference room about the reference. He also mentioned that he was present at the time, and so were 2 of his colleagues, and all were willing to file affidavits to that effect.  Another break.  \n\nWe came back, and they upped the offer to 6 months. We countered with 2 years severance. Eventually we settled on 15 months, with me to collect a check every 2 weeks, as if I was employed, based on an average of my hours for the past 6 months of my employment. And I had racked a LOT of overtime in those 6 months. They even tried to stick a clause prohibiting me from working for anyone in the same industry while the deal was in effect, but Eric spotted it and had it struck out.  \n\nMy skill set is in demand, and it didn\u2019t take long for me to find another job, doing the same thing, but for one of their competitors. It\u2019s awesome. These guys pay me on one Friday, and my working job pays me on the next. I am racking up savings like you wouldn\u2019t believe, and Eric was pretty gentle with his billing.  \n\nSOB? He was canned in no time, and between me and Owner\u2019s network of contacts, the rumor mill has basically made him untouchable. He\u2019s still looking for a job, as far as I know. I did tell my new employer to shitcan his resume if they ever got one.  \n\nBut if I ever get a phone call asking me for a reference for SOB, all I can tell them is that I worked with him for 4 months in 2018.  \n\nI can\u2019t say more than that. It\u2019s the letter of the law.",

I'm assuming this all happened in the US; if not, then the laws might be different. In regards to the breaks, if you work 8 hours, they are required by law to provide you with  two 15 minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch break. They are however allowed to demand that you take your break at your desk in situations like the one you were in, BUT then it would be considered a \"working break/lunch\" and they are then required to pay as if you were never on break. So what they were doing before were you were working at your desk and eating and they were paying you is legal. As soon as your manager stopped paying you, then THEY started breaking the law. \n\nThe situation where a company can provide working breaks is in a situation where an employee has to be on shift at all times and it would be an undue burden to have a second employee come on shift just to relieve the employee for the breaks. A good example would be a graveyard shift employee at a hotel where he/she is the only employee running the hotel. Companies can also get away with it if the employee and the employer both agree to doing a working shift, but if any of the employees would prefer to simply take off for the break, then that tends to ruin it for everyone else that just wants to do the work and go home. That second option really isn't legal, but a lot of companies get away with it, because sometimes the employees prefer it and they don't complain.",

            "Knowing that someone who tried to screw over someone nice and competent was given more than a taste of his own medicine while the nice person defended himself right and got what he deserved was orgasmic.\n\nAlso, fuck the company for not standing up for its base. Lay too much stress on the main cogs of the machine and forget the right amount of grease, don't be surprised the machine stops working altogether. SOB was a true SOB, but he was enabled by management. Make no mistake, management did put pressure on SOB. Maybe HR screwed up hiring him, but no one will have me believe everything about his behaviour was purely a matter of personality.\n\nI assume it always kind of boils down to something like \"you're hired, want to stay beyond trial period, make more cash for us, we don't want to know how, you said you could, do it\".

        "selftext": "Long time reader, first time poster. I don't even know if it goes here, so please correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nBack in 2006, I worked for one of those big box stores that had an IT desk (formally known as \"Nerd Herd\" LOL) where people could bring devices in to get serviced if there was a problem. We were located in Columbus GA, which is right over a bridge from Phoenix City, AL. This is important because, where our store was placed, we would normally get a lot of servicemen and women coming up from Fort Benning who were generally pretty cool. But we would also get folks, mostly from Alabama, who were... let's just say, slightly unfavourable to folks of a certain skin colour or gender. (no offence to those who live in AL who are totally awesome. You know who you are. <3)\n\nNow, I'm a 5'1\" girl who (at the time) weighed a total of 120lbs soaking wet. I was practically a hobbit. I was also one of the lead technicians in the department. I was the one the new hires went to if they were confused or couldn't troubleshoot certain problems. The team I worked with was AMAZING. The general manager of the store was great and the supervisor of my department was THE MAN. I would regularly go out for drinks with these people. One of the best places I've ever worked, even though it was retail.\n\nOne day, I'm working the counter to check customers in and do evaluations and diagnostics to give an estimate of what the repair price would be.\n\nIn comes... let's call him Joe. He's wore a cut-off t-shirt, worn denim jeans, and a baseball cap with a confederate flag on it that just barely covered his business in the front, party in the back hair cut. I am not one to judge on looks. I've had plenty of people come in looking exactly the same way tis guy did who have been an absolute *delight* to work with. Never judge a book by its cover, kids. But I still have my defenses up, just in case. I really hoped it wasn't going to go the not-so-friendly route. I was unfortunately wrong about dear Joe.\n\nJoe walks up to the counter with his PC tower and practically *slams* the unit on the desk.\n\nJoe: I need this fixed. It's broken.\n\nMe: Okay, sir. Let me have a look and I'll see if I ca\u2013\n\nJoe cuts me off and stares at me with a disgusted look on his face.\n\nJoe: Excuse me?\n\nMe: If you give me a moment, sir, I'll be able to take a look at your computer and\u2013\n\nJoe: Aw HELL NO!\n\nIt was at this point that I realised where this was inevitably going to go wrong.\n\nMe: Unfortunately, sir, I won't be able to give you an estimate if you don't let me diagnose your computer.\n\nJoe: There is no way in HELL a *woman* knows about computers. I'm not letting *you* touch my computer. Get me the manager.\n\n*Oh, yes.* I thought. This is going to be fucking awesome! I'm sure he wanted to talk to the general manager of the store, but I couldn't resist.\n\nCue malicious compliance.\n\nI could have pulled the \"I'm the manager\" thing, because I was one of the senior staff, but my direct boss was actually out back working on repair projects and I couldn't help but get excited about how this was going to go down.\n\nMe: (*as lovely as sweet tea)* Of course, sir. Right away, sir.\n\nMike, my superviser, the guy who ran our department (and NOT the general manager of the store,) was elbow deep in a motherboard replacement when I walked in and gave him the biggest, shit-eating grin.\n\nMe: Hey, Mike. There's a guy out there asking for the manager.\n\nHe looks at me confused because he was just supervisor, but I then proceeded to tell him *exactly* what was waiting for him out front. His face split into the brightest smile. He then proceeded to walk out to the front.\n\nHave I mentioned that Mike is a 6'3, 280lb black man who looked like he could eat a mack truck for lunch? He was such a big, loveable, teddy bear. We all adored him.\n\nThe *moment* Mike stepped out, the customer *freaked*.\n\nMike: Hello, sir. I hear there's a problem?\n\nJoe *LOST IT*! It start with a \"fuck no\" before devolving into a racist tirade that I have never witnessed in my life. (I'm from Massachusetts, so this was awful, yet amazing to watch. Like a car crash. I just couldn't look away. Not that we have no racism in the north east, but DAMN.) Joe kept screaming, using the nastiest slur (you know the one) over and over again while staff and customers alike watched in blatant horror.\n\nSecurity ended up having to come over to try to calm the man down. Our *entire* security team was black as well so, naturally, Joe went even MORE crazy.\n\nEventually, the police had to be called because the man was threatening me, calling me a cunt and a bitch, and threatening security and my boss, using that word that is *not* okay.\n\nMy general manager got called out of his office and immediately called the police to have the man removed. God bless whichever dispatcher who received the call was, because they dispatched *two black officers* to the scene. Me and my general manager were *literally* the only white people involved in this train-wreck (aside from bigoted Joe) and I watched with unbridled glee as Joe was cuffed and taken away by the police. Watching Joe foam at the mouth as he was dragged away made my whole week.\n\nThank you for the entertainment, Bigoted Joe.\n\nEDIT: Thanks to all of you telling me about CHUCK. Now I\u2019m up at 5AM binging this show. LOL",

            "Good for you. I worked many years in computer support and have had similar problems. Am also a small woman and often referred to by unassuming customers as a secretary when I was customer facing. As the only software tech in the store they had to talk to me though. I would always smile and be perfectly courteous, secretly reveling in their embarrassment.\n\nYears later as a escalations advisor in the phone queue I learned that some men refuse to let women help them with computer issues, even really simple ones. So we had a lovely thing to say \"Sir, here at [company] we do not discriminate. I will be glad to assist you with your computer concerns. If you do not wish to work with me we can disconnect now.\" Usually they would relent. But this one guy...\n\nEscalation from one of our new advisors. It was her first day solo on the phone and she was in tears. Apparently he read her to filth for simply being female and daring to pretend she could help was the most horrific thing he could imagine. I provided her with the company SOP for discrimination, told her when and where to use it, authorized her a 15 minute break and took over the call. I don't think it lasted 2 minutes. He was swearing and refusing to believe that I, a mere female, could act in a supervisory position. Hanging up on him, knowing the queue was 30+ minutes, is one of my favorite moments.",

I also did a snazzy little diagram stating that my 5ft 1' self has a much smaller bladder than anyone else who works in my department which means I cannot retain as much water in my bladder. I also showed the side effects of holding your pee too long and how it could be detrimental to my health as well as the side effects of not drinking enough water for the weather conditions. \n\nMy HR manager was not impressed my supervisor asked me to stop peeing when I needed to go.

            "I've worked at jobs like this. Restroom breaks for hourly employees only at scheduled break times. (mid-morning, lunch break, and mid to late afternoon).\n\nLike someone else has commented: When you have to go, you have to go.  I once had a urologist who told me he had a name for it. \"teachers' bladder\".  The sudden, uncontrollable urge to pee. He'd seen people (many of them teachers) who had basically ruined their bladders because they were forced into taking pee breaks only two or three times a day. Not when they actually needed to respond to what their bodies were telling them. Holding it for hours at a time weakened their bladders so much they lacked any real \"control\". He'd have to put them on drugs to help keep them from peeing themselves at their desks.",
            "I drink about 4 cups of coffee and almost a gallon of water a day. I can't make it an hour and a half without needing to pee.",

            "I had a similar issue with my fast food job. \n\nI habitually worked the drive thru window. Constant talking all day. So, naturally,  I drink to not get dry and hoarse. So, *naturally* I have to pee a lot. \n\nAnd that was a no go. \n\nToo busy. No one to cover me. \n\nAnd then, after some people were fired over some pedantic cash issues, I wouldn't let anyone use my till, even for just a potty break. \n\nIt was my first job and I was a fucking doormat because I was desperate for a job. I was 17 and on my own trying to pay rent with a minors wage - 2$ less than adult wage. I spent a year looking before this place hired me. I would cry myself to sleep at the prospect of losing my job. Which was a constant threat, because they were an at will employer and the boss's preferred method of discipline/reprimand was to threaten your livelihood and remind you that you're replaceable.  \n\nAnd so I didn't drink at much. And I got dry and hoarse and coughed until I got a throat infection. \n\nSo I drank. And refused to take extra toilet breaks. Until I couldnt feasibly hold it anymore. And then got a bladder infection. \n\nAnd so I took to chewing gum. That helped keep my mouth salivating. But gum isn't allowed. Because rules. \n\nAnd so I got hard candies to suck on. That wasn't okay either. Unless I shared with the whole crew. \n\nAnd so I got cough drops. Cant tell me i cant have a cough drop when I sound like I'm trying hack a lung, right? Except eating too many of those upset my stomach and made me sick more than once. Also, they \"burn\" the tongue and palate after too many, causing mouth ulcers, which last for a couple days at least. \n\nSo I spent more years than I would like to admit with chronic illnesses that I hindsight I realise were entirely caused by my job. But honestly,  they'd have thrown me out on my ass of I'd tried too hard to stand my ground. \n\nTLDR: spent my fast food tenure in and out of urgent care with various work related sicknesses because they dont think were people.",
            "Wow that\u2019s wild. I would\u2019ve quit instantly. \n\nNot worth my time going to a doctor to get a note so I can pee.",
            "I used to work in a restaurant where the owner was a huge jerk about calling in sick. He would try to get sick people to come in anyway and would slam the phone down if they would refuse. So when I got sick I would just tell him that I was vomitting and having explosive diarrhea from food poisoning. Most of the time it was the case anyway. He would just say ok and tell me to get better. I was the only one he wouldn't get mad at since it's really hard to argue with that one.",
