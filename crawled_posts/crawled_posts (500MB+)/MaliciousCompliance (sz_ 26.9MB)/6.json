        "selftext": "So I used to work for a large retailer in the UK. I worked there for 12 years in total and ended up as a manager. When you want to become a manager they make you fly through 1000 hoops, do a whole bunch of training and do the job for 6 months without any extra pay. I did all of this and was finally officially signed off as a manager. \n\nAfter I was officially given a job I got my pay rise but was never given a new contract. I asked multiple times for a new contract and was fobbed off each time. Fast forward about 9 months and another large retailer started hiring lots of managers and was poaching a whole bunch of staff. I applied for one of these jobs as they were offering \u00a38k more than I was currently on but for the same job. \n\nI got the job and went to hand in my notice. Managers have to give 4 weeks notice whereas General Assistants only have to give a week. So I decided that I would follow the exact terms on my contract and provide them with a weeks notice rather than the 4 weeks they wanted. \n\nSuffice to say that they were not happy with that and I got called into an office to ask why I had only given 1 weeks notice. I explained that per the terms of the last contract that I signed with them that is all that I was required to give. They were really not happy but there really wasn\u2019t anything that they could do about it. \n\nAlso my wife says Hi, she wanted me to say hi to whoever I was texting, I said I was writing a Reddit post and said to say hi to Reddit for her.",

            "Haha, my brother did this exact thing. They trained him up, gave him the extra \u00a3, but never re-did his contract, so he never got the other benefits (mostly mileage and medical). His notice period didn't change from 2 weeks to 8 weeks.\n\nSo when he handed in his notice a year and half later (unrelated reasons), they said it was 8 weeks. He asked them to show him that in his contract, and they went all quiet.",

            "This will get buried, but I'm a lawyer and was once negotiating a new employment contract with the then current CEO of a client's company (who wanted more pay, benefits, etc).  \n  \n  \nCEO held out and refused to sign last and final porposal, which was generous, and included 6 months of severance.  \n  \n  \nNegotiations leave bad taste in clients mouth, and by total coincidence some issues pop up with CEO in the months following the rejection of the contract.  Client can't uncover enough to terminate for cause, but go ahead and terminate CEO in a \"we're going in another direction\" type manner.  \n  \n  \nCEO gets zero severance because they never signed the updated employment contract (and they clearly would have been entitled to it had they just signed it).  It was one of the most astonishing examples of someone overplaying their hand that I have ever witnessed in my career.  \n  \n  \nPost script:  CEO hires lawyer who sends letter demanding severance.  We reply with copy of former CEO's email to the board expressly rejecting last contract proposal and never hear from lawyer again.",

Min 30 hours a week OT at our regular hourly rate, comping the client 90 mins extra a day and working Saturdays for at least 6 months. About 4 weeks prior we had signed new contracts which were like our old but cut our notice period from a month to a week.\n\nI hit reply all, said nope, I\u2019m sticking with my old contract. Then I went back to the hotel and got myself a beer and a curry and put my feet up.\n\nNext day I was dragged over the coals and was quite pissed. I was driving back home to my house and GF, fucking raging at the whole thing when I get a call out of the blue. Local company needs a dev ASAP. I interview the next morning and am hired by lunchtime. And they are literally across the hall from the agency.\n\nI gave my weeks notice that day.

In total I\u2019ve had five different jobs.

Our business is loud *and* can cause traffic congestion so it\u2019s vital that we run during times and places that we don\u2019t make everyone pissed.\n\nThey\u2019re very smart to only do the live music occasionally, because loud noises like that can actually lower property values & if you consistently piss off your neighborhood they\u2019ll come for you.",

As a newly minted adult, I was happy to have it.\n\nAbout 3 months into my lease, my car went to the great scrapheap in the sky. I had gotten used to the local transit system and discovered a nearby store would drop off groceries for me. This was long before Walmart and other stores started doing it, so it was cheaper than figuring a month's supplies on the bus. So I opted not to replace the car and utilize the bus pass my work reimbursed me for. I went to my leasing office and told them I no longer needed the space, and would you please remove the extra charge from my bill. The manager at the desk was new and had never been asked that before. She promised to look into it and let me know. I was naive and figured it would be gone come next month. Nope! It was still there. I paid all but the parking space and called up the complex. Same girl. She said she was awaiting word from higher ups and offered me a credit for the charge as a one-time courtesy. I reminded her that I no longer owned a car -- I hadn't just changed my mind. I told her that the space had been empty for close to a month now and that I won't be utilizing it. She said she understood \"loud and clear\" and would get it sorted by next month. 3 days before rent was due, she finally got back to me. Apparently, it was in my lease and couldn't be removed without breaking the lease and signing a new one. Even if I didn't move out, the lease breaking and initiation fees would be charged to me, and my rent would go up to the new current market value. This would be over a thousand dollars, so not an option for someone freshly on their own. I kept the parking space on the lease.\n\n3 weeks later, I was reviewing my lease to get the phone number for maintenance, and noticed the clause for the parking space. Essentially, I could park \"a motorcycle, scooter such as vespa, car, truck, suv, or *trailer*\" in the space. Gears were TURNING! For me to be in compliance, I had to have wheels on anything parked in my space. So I went to my local version of Craigslist and found a wheeled container similar to a shipping container. It wasn't cheap but it was worth every cent. The complex offered storage sheds at an upcharge too. Being fresh out of High School, I didn't have much to store. My neighbor though, did. I threw a lock on the unit and offered it to my neighbor for half the cost of a shed; $35 a month. He was able to move his stuff out of his storage unit where he was paying over $100 a month, and the container was available 24-7-365. He was happy for the arrangement and paid several months in advance.\n\nThe complex put several tow stickers for \"out of compliance\" on the trailer, but I called the Tow Company and faxed them a copy of the lease where it says trailers are allowed. The container was registered with the county as a utility trailer, so there's nothing they could do. They tried to fine me for improper parking, but again, I had proof I was within my rights. They even offered to remove the charge for parking on my lease if I would relocate the container. With what my neighbor was paying, I could cover my water bill every month, so I declined.\n\nI stayed 18 months, and sold the trailer to my neighbor when I moved out. He had to rent a car to relocate it to his assigned space, but he said it was worth the couple hundred he paid. He ended up saving over $1000 a year renting from me. Other neighbors even started bringing in their own containers too, even if it meant getting a second space. Sheds were being vacated at such a large volume, the complex tried to give them away at 6 months free. Few took them up on it. The  complex amended the new leases to exclude trailers, but could do nothing about those that already had them in the spot. Instead of moving out and giving notice, renters would reassigned their lease to new people so they could be grandfathered into the trailer clause.\n\nI drove by the facility 2 years or so after I moved out, going to a friends for Thanksgiving. The complex had been sold to a new owner and changed their name. But wouldn't you know, there were still about a dozen wheeled shipping containers parked in the lot.\n\nEDIT as there's some confusion and people are fighting:  \nThe trailer was small. Think of 4 dog kennels in a 2x2 configuration. You could fit a table and chairs in there but you'd scape the ceiling. It was in rough shape. This was back when the dollar store (not Dollar Tree) sold spray paint, and I took care of repainting it myself. I negotiated drop off to the complex from the seller, and with the spray paint and delivery, I think I was out like $700. Keep in mind, this is not the massive 40 foot trailer picture I posted a few times as a reference. It's that *style* of trailer.   \nRegistering the trailer was super-dooper cheap; like around $30 and possibly even less. When I sold it to my neighbor, I got $300 or so for it. I took a loss, but without a car, I didn't want it and he approached me first when he found out I was moving.  \nThere were a number of colleges and universities near where I rented. Most leases banned subleasing, but lease change overs were commonplace. You go to the complex and tell management, \"I'm done renting here, but instead of breaking the lease, my friend is going to do the rest of my term.\" You usually didn't get the deposit back as it stayed with the new renter, but you didn't an exorbitant pay a lease break fine. It also kept the apartment seamlessly occupied, without tenant gaps, which most places needed. If they sold the trailer to the next guy or to their neighbor, I am uncertain. I wasn't privy to those decisions. All I know is 2 years later, they were no longer \"XYZ Complex,\" but under a different name and a dozen or so trailers still remained.  \nAs for the 18 months I stayed, 1 year in a lease, 6 months at month-to-month. In my state, addendums to leases require you to enter into a new leasing term and that was not gonna happen. IDR if they charged a month-to-month fee if I didn't renew my lease as it was close to 20 years ago. I've been month to month for 3 years at the place I have been living for 4. Some places charge one, some don't. Rent can still go up, but changes to the lease that are \"substantial\" cannot take place unless I sign a new lease agreement. I have had to look up laws and advocate for myself a lot because of BS like this.   \nThe tow company was mom and pop. They were not predatory and I knew that multiple illegal tows could get their license pulled. The *minute* that first tow sign went up, I was practically shoving my paperwork down their face. No way that could play the ignorance card after that. They still exist to this day and now have multiple locations. In fact, they are the assigned tower for my current complex too, ironically.   \nFinally, storage sheds or units are required by my state to be month to month. It's a state law that goes back to at least the 1980s, and I have had to memorize a lot of laws regarding storage for my job. So, the apartment couldn't force anyone to keep their sheds, so my neighbor cancelled at the end of his next month. Great guy. Lived in a 3 bed with a set of twins -- 1 boy, 1 girl. \n\nAs for this being \"***FAKE OR MADE UP,***\" I feel like I have enough specific info to prove that it's not. And if you still don't believe me, oh well! I posted this for y'all's enjoyment; I really appreciate the awards and upvotes, but IDC about internet points.

It was a great place to train up his workers and be able to keep an eye on their work basically from home.  \n\nPeople were complaining they felt he was paid too much and it was costing them too much so they eventually decided to switch to a property management company and wanted to cut his pay etc, he quit, letting them figure things out for themselves.

Obviously he declined.  \n\nEvery so often we get jobs in the area and the place has completely fallen apart. Pool is neglected and not operational, roads still aren\u2019t done years later, they had to abandon and tear down tennis courts because it turns out people usually charge a ton to re-do big retaining walls etc.  \n\nThe only buildings in good condition are the ones his crews had completed before we left many years ago.  \n\nVery sad honestly because a handful of HOA bad decision really fucked over so many people.",

If your grass was too tall for too long they'd send city workers to cut it and then charge you for the service. You did get multiple warnings before that would happen though. If your fence was falling down and considered a problem you'd get notified too.

The per-week max for collection was 12 bags. I produced one bag, sometimes two in a week. \n\nSo, rather than having \"unsightly\" bins visible for a couple of hours on the day they are collected, I saved up all my garbage over the course of weeks, sometimes months. Then when I had the maximum 12 bags saved up, I put it all out at once on collection day. Instead of a bin or two sitting quietly at the curb, there was now a *massive* mound of garbage bags, that had been ripening for weeks, wafting their atrocious stench all through the neighborhood.\n\nI think this went on for six months or so before I moved.

This us a little gated community by a lake un the mountains, in the summer there is a population of around 400 - in the winter around 150.  Almost everyone is retired.  The adjacent community is only about 4,000 total.  (The school has less than 300 K-12, all in one school).  Everyone knows everyone.\nWe rented there because we were told that there was snow removal on all the roads during and we got a great rent if we signed a 2 year lease.\nOur kids were 12 and 14 when we were there, boys.  That made them targets of suspicion.  I actually got called when one of our kids walked a different route home from the bus stop.  I got a call that  my son was \"loitering\" when he was fishing from a community pier, also skipping rocks another time.  My husband restored an older Corvette, it was his baby, the HOA \"required \" a sticker on the right front of vehicles.  My husband refused, and put his on the visor, which he displayed each time he approached the gate.  There was a delay and lecture every time he approached the gate. (He was the only Corvette in the area). Rent o cops justified their employment by following various recalcitrant residents around the area watching everything they did.  They also enforced garbage cans, house colors, yard art, pets, wildlife and waterway safety.  They were just busybodies in every phase of lives.\nWe broke our lease early when we realized that the most fun people had was trying to be scofflaws.  I have to admit it was kind of fun to torment these crazed people.  But it was not a good example to set for kids.  And kids spent their days staying hidden from guards and getting in trouble for everything they did.  \nI always referred to the HOA and the gated community as something designed to keep the riffraff in.

So you stink to high heaven for the rest of the day.\n\nSo I would walk the track w/ all the girls. Pissed off my coaches something awful. So they flunk me in my junior year and won't let me double up my senior year so I would have to stay back.\n\nI had already picked out my college and was accept (tech school). Just had to finish my senior year. So I figured I could work out something w/ the guidance counselor and the coach. Nope, neither would budge.\n\nOk I walk away thinking I'm screwed and have to basically take one class my 2nd senior year. Then it dawns on me, can I just start going to college now? Are there other alternatives?\n\nSo I call my college admissions and college guidance counselor. Explain my situation and what other options are available? Since this is a non-traditional college (No SATs) you can start w/o a diploma. The caveat is you must have one (or equivalent) to get your diploma. The state I'm from they don't distinguish between to the two so it won't be an issue later on.\n\nSo I called another meeting hoping the HS admin would change their minds. No joy, they stuck to their guns. Thinking they had me cornered I stood up and said \"Well I'm just going to have to drop out then. I cant see missing a year of college to just do gym class.\"\n\nThe coach thinks he's all cute and is \"You can't go to college w/o a diploma\". I relay what the tech school admin/guidance told me of their policy on this.\n\nFaces dropped. It set into the guidance counselor that a drop out looks bad on her and the school (small school) when the state audits. She starts back pedaling and I wasnt hearing any of it. Later on that night the principle and vice principle call to talk.\n\nI wasnt interested, I was all excited about starting classes in the fall.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nMy HS tried to hold me back a year for 1 gym credit. I was already enrolled in a non-tradition tech college. Tech college would let me start classes as long as I got my GED prior to graduation.

            "It sounds so strange to get a grade for gym class. We don't have that, it's just a class that you have to attend. \n\nWe have school leaving exams called Senior Certificate, and there are specific requirements (subject choices and final grades) that determine whether you can go to a university or college for a degree course. So you can be home schooled and so long as you get the right grades in an approved combination of subjects, you are OK.\n\nForcing a student to repeat a gym class sounds extremely petty.",
            "Interestingly enough, I was convinced to drop out of my senior year of high school for a similar reason (I forget which credits I was missing but it was only one or two). I later found out that the school was still boasting a 100% graduation rate and that they had done the same thing to other students. Apparently the graduation rate doesn't take into account dropouts, only students who have to repeat the year.",
            "High school counselors are the absolute worst. Mine would not let me graduate on time, or even attend the ceremony with my classmates, due to half a credit she screwed me over on.

            "This is so petty, when I got to my senior year and my AP test-taking self was somehow short a credit (because screw our useless guidance counselors for actually doing anything, I swear they just had to sit and collect paychecks) the school at least shoved me in the back end of some random history class for 12 weeks so I could retake tests and get a credit, they weren't malicious just incompetent. This is straight maliciousness by these admins.",
            "It's absurd that schools want to be punitive over one damn gym credit instead of trying to find an equitable solution to help you get your diploma. Nowadays there is \"virtual PE\" where you track going to the gym and such, you could easily have done both your final PE credit and classes. Heck, your college probably had some fitness classes that you could have done to qualify both. Education requires flexibility, and when we lose sight of that, people get screwed.",

Absolute garbage when it came to actually teaching.\n\nIn college they had this mantra \"old PE vs new PE\" and no kidding, these teachers were all: \"here's the balls and jump ropes, go play and behave\", and they would leave the kinds under our supervision. New PE was about actually focusing on teaching skill development, motor learning and skill application. Yeah, not always fun but they would learn stuff.\n\nThe elementary teachers had an incredibly short fuse. How the hell can you have a short fuse when dealing with kids?! They're kids! They would engage in screaming matches and get right on the kids' faces. Smh\n\nThe high school teacher ran things like if it were a prison, and kids saw that. Most miserable class I've ever had to teach. And don't you dare deviate from the curriculum of basketball and volleyball, how dare you suggest we add a robust curriculum that goes beyond two sports?! Yeah, we spent 4 months teaching just two sports...",

            "A similar thing happened to me.  Despite having a great GPA, I missed too many days during my senior year to graduate because my mother had four brain surgeries my senior year and I was her primary caregiver.  The surgeries were actually performed 90 miles away and I had to drive her as my father had already noped out.\n\nI didn't graduate despite completing all the classes and getting a 3.9 GPA before it being adjusted down, so I quit school two weeks before graduation and got my GED two weeks later.\n\nWent on to get a bachelor's, two master's and a PhD and now teach.  The administrator who refused to make an exception for me had a rather unusual name and a few years ago I had their son  in my class.  When I once mentioned where I went to high school the student excitedly asked if I knew his parent (we were not geographically close to that area).  \n\nI just laughed and said I think I remember him.

Hygiene issues are a factor if they impact your education. Which they did. \n\nThere should have been better answers.\n\nFor me, being in that position was about gearing people for the future. Lining up their coursework to match their intended goals after high school so they had momentum. Getting those trade job connections, or those university acceptances. Dealing with the clinical side too. Coping skills, maturity, social skills. Why be a stickler for trivial rules at the cost of the individual? There\u2019s so much more to the job they could have gotten right before getting it wrong. Guidance (school) counselors have no win in a power trip.

            "Something similar happened to me. My HS had a policy to drop you from a class if you had 13 absences in one semester (90 days). Doesn't matter if the absences were unexcused (skipping) or excused (doctor/parent note) or you went on vacation or you were dying in some hospital.\n\n13 days out? dropped from your class. In my case it was all of my classes due to orthodontic appointments, vacation and just being sick once or twice. In my first semester of HS 9th grade. Gee, Thanks. All were excused absences via doctor, dentist or parents. All of my classwork and homework was up to date with passing A or B grades. \n\nI went to the principal and asked if there was any way to work around this drop all classes issue. Nope. None at all? \"We cant change the policy.\" I would have to make up the entire semester again. All six classes. Screw that. I looked for alternatives. Found a homeschooling curriculum that would net me a HS diploma and be flexible around my schedule. \n\nWent to see the Vice Principal to ask one more time if there was anything I could do to stay in my classes. Nope. Told him my intention to drop out of school and switch to homeschooling. He didn't seem to care at all and was more interested if I had any library books on loan from the school library. It was my first semester, I told him I didn't even know where the library was located (big school). Whole meeting took less than 5 minutes. Such a bizarre wall of non-negotiable policies that does not exist in the real world. Way to fail our youth, the system that was setup to nurture it.\n\nI ended up going on many more vacations (and orthodontist appointments) during my high school years, including an epic 60 day journey to multiple countries in my senior year. Which obviously would not be possible if I was still enrolled in the standard high school. Got my HS diploma and learned that no one gives a toss about a high school diploma anyway. Never had to present it for any job.\n\nWhat a waste of time and space. I just wish people had let kids know school is not something to worry that much about. Stressed me the fuck out over nothing. \n\nI can imagine some kids right now getting stressed out about missing \"real school\" or getting behind because sitting in front of a screen at home is oh so much different than sitting behind a screen at a desk in school. Wish I could tell them all not to worry.",
            "Wow, I didn't know you can be held back by a gym credit. Fucking public school is bullshit",
            "Don\u2019t you love how in every single gym class in America there\u2019s a handful of girls who are just allowed to refuse to participate and they still get passing grades?",
            "So I had a similar situation in high school.  95% or better in all classes all through from grade 1.  Skipped grades twice before high school, then took far more credits than required.  I could have graduated after two years of highschool, but I chose not tol enroll in one last course because my competitive ass wanted to finish all of the available advanced courses, a feat that hadn't been done in my district previously.\n\nThat was where shit went wrong.  My final year I needed exactly one credit to finish.  I lined up four advanced courses, an extra english course, and a mathematics course.  It left me with a half hour gap, two days a week.  \n\nIn the board's infinite wisdom, they decided to eliminate free periods for all students that year.  I was forced, under coercion from the principal, to take a class to fill it.  How did they propose to fill my time?  There was only class available during those slots that I wouldn't be arriving in the middle of was a bullshit literature class intended for students who were slow.  Seriously, they had seniors doing book reports on Seuss and Goodnight Moon.  And so, I was slotted in for one hour of that class out of four per week.\n\nSo here I was, taking advanced everything and able to declare my graduation before Christmas.  The literature/gym teacher decided to use me as some sort of pet project.  I guess he expected me to be a literary master.  He assigned fucking War and Peace (not an exaggeration) while everyone else had to read The Hobbit.  All well and good if the courses I actually wanted to take weren't so demanding.  All well and good if I didn't have to read a book the size of a coffee table and write a fucking dissertation on it just so I could get the Mickey Mouse course credit.   Teacher, you saw me for one hour a week. I was your prisoner because of policy, not your ticket to greatness.  \n\nSo through a mix of me giving zero shits and rebelling against the ridiculous demands of what was supposed to be an easy filler course, I fucked up my midterm in that class I graduated with 98 to 100 in all my remaining courses and a fucking 15 in my Literature joke class.  The grade was suspect as I had 80+ all through but he zeroed me on my final because he personally disagreed with my assessment of War and Peace (not because of my final paper on any technical level or lack of evidence I read and understood the material).\n\nI explained the problem to the principal and then the board.  I asked to strike the class from my record, the same as they've done for friends trying to get admission in to school.  I had big scholarships riding on my final year average.  Nope, nobody bent.  I ended up getting one of the scholarships stewards to accept me conditionally while I fought it out in court.  Funny enough, I got the course dropped in a flash when I brought my lawyer's letter with me at the next meeting.",

In his junior year of high school, he took an online English class with a university and graduated as a junior. He met all local and state requirements. \n\nIf I could find his original first grade teacher, I'd love to shove it in her face.",
            "Experienced a similar situation 27 years ago, they\u2019ve always gotten a power trip out of fucking up ambitious learners. I finished my junior year while taking a college course in the evening, and realized it was a waste of time to stick around for a year at my high school learning absolutely nothing. Everything seemed so remedial, and there were no opportunities for students who were advanced. So, I asked how I could finish my first year of college while finishing my last year of high school. They were very concerned about setting a precedent, and clearly stated that what they were concerned about was funding. They didn\u2019t want to lose money they would receive by having my bored ass in a seat in our little podunk Missouri town. Tried to propose several solutions, they wouldn\u2019t budge. So, I dropped out of school. Took 5 correspondence courses from the University of Nebraska Independent Study High School, the minimum they required to grant a degree because I already met all their requirements to graduate. The petty school district superintendent called the dean of the college I was going to and demanded that they only let me take 9 credit hours my first semester, out of spite, when he no longer had control over me.

I was like, \"LOL, nope!\" and instead picked up my diploma from them a week later while waring a T-shirt with a big pot leaf on it.  Totally against dress code, LOL.",
            "My father's drop out story is a little like yours and one of my favorites. He went to high school in Florida where all the resources went straight into the football program and everything else was left to rot. My father had always been smart, and skipped a grade in elementary school. So, like you, he thought about going to college a bit early. He sent out college applications that strongly implied he had already graduated when he still had a year left. He was accepted and most of the way through his first term before they realized he had no high school diploma. As they were getting ready to kick him out, his old high school lost accreditation. The school had neglected the curriculum so badly in favor of the athletics that a diploma from them was now worthless. The university decided that since he was getting good grades there and it would destroy his academic career to force him to go back to his old school they would waive the requirement. My father continued on with his education, eventually earning a Ph.D, but still has no high school diploma.",

            "I had a similar situation when i was graduating. About a month before the end of senior year, one of the school counselors pulled me aside to tell me that my credits were counted wrong and that I had less than they thought i did and would not be graduating on time. After some arguing, I stormed out of school and went to dig through my mom\u2019s file cabinet because she saves EVERYTHING. All the paperwork we had showed that I had exactly what i was supposed to have and no way there could be a \u201cmistake counting\u201d like they claimed. Went straight back to school with my proof and said i would be getting an attorney if they tried holding me back. \n\nThe next day the councilor pulled me aside again and apologized for the mistake, telling me that they checked again and this time they realized that i had more credits than I needed to graduate. I ended up graduating before the rest of my class because apparently high school teachers/counselors cant count for shit. Im pretty sure they were wrong the second time as well because I never did anything for extra credit, but I wasn\u2019t going to argue with getting an extra month added to my summer vacation.",
            "Honestly, fuck American high schools. I had a similar situation happen when I was in HS. I was technically duel enrolled at my HS while going to school full time at a community college. The program I was enrolled in gave me just enough credits for free to earn an associates degree in 2 years. My HS was going to make me pay $400 for a single PE credit or else I wouldn\u2019t graduate from HS. I couldn\u2019t rearrange my community college credits without loosing the chance at my associates. Guidance counselor and PE teacher wouldn\u2019t budge. Asked my community college counselor and found out I could pay $10 to get a HS diploma with any Associates degree they offer. My HS guidance counselor lost his mind when I told him I wasn\u2019t going to try for my HS diploma at their school.",

No one told me until my senior year that my new school wouldn't accept my old school's credit. Tried to make me repeat the year and wouldn't let me walk.

I proposed he let me use the school gym during PE when my eczema was bad, instead of doing a written essay, which was the norm if you missed x amount of PE classes. \n\nHe agreed to let me use the gym and work out at my own pace and checked up from time to time what we were doing (at one point we had 4 guys there, one with a broken leg and one with a sprained wrist). \n\nWe pretty much got to work out anyway we liked and could, with a stereo playing our own music and had a lot of fun during those hours. \n\nThat guy was awesome!",

            "High school was more than 20 years ago for me.  I have a different perspective on Physed now than I did then.  At that time I knew I wanted to be a game programmer (and big surprise, I am one now).  I only took Phys-ed in 10th grade because it was manditory, and I blatantly half assed it.  I had no interest in any sports at all.  I had allergy / exercise induced asthma that made any kind of sustained running a miserable experience.\n\nBut today?  I developed an interest in MMA around 2008 and I do Judo, and I exercise regularly.  I still hate running but I can manage other exercise without too much misery.  \n\nThese days I think that Phys-ed (and the associated team sports) are more about general life skills.  It is basically an activity that promotes competition and lets people learn how to deal with failure (ie, you lost the game / race / whatever) with no significant consequences.  Pushing through adversity (regardless of context) is a damn good life skill to have.  And the benefits of being physically active are more than worthwhile.  \n\nI think Phys-ed is not presented in a way that provides a good value proposition to anyone like myself (which is profoundly unfortunate).  I do not give a damn about exercise for it's own sake, but I do see the benefits now.  \n\nI also figure there should be other ways to earn that credit (if a student can prove they participate in a regular yoga class, martial arts, team sport, etc, let them skip the damn class if they want).  The OP should not have had to bother with Phys-ed if he was active on sports teams.\n\nEND COMMUNICATION",
            "I knew a kid who was in the IB program, which for whatever reason at our school precluded you from taking traditional PE classes. you had to take one quarter of physical education (rather than the 2 semesters required through the traditional high school program) and sign a contract essentially saying you were okay only taking the half credit of PE and you would complete further physical education independently or something like that. \n\nSo it gets down to this guys senior year and apparently they lost his contract. They won\u2019t let him resign one for whatever reason so instead they\u2019re like, sorry, you need to take two PE classes on top of all your IB requirements in order to graduate. But because of how IB works he technically had credits to get a traditional high school diploma by his junior year, senior year was fully just IB requirements. so instead of doing what they wanted he was just like \u201cfuck it okay\u201d and dropped the entire IB program and basically just took a full schedule of PE classes his last semester",

            "Ugh, gym teachers are dicks. I remember in my high school gym classes, we had to do warm-ups where we ran in lines back and forth across the gym. I was already very anxious and self conscious and rarely participated in gym class outside of warm-ups. Anyway, this particular year, there was a weird side-step exercise we had to do at the start of class called karaokes that I couldn't get right, so I started sitting out for warm-ups too due to getting mocked about it by my friends.\n\nGym teacher tells me I'm losing credit every day, I break down and tell him why. He says to do warm-ups the next day, he'll take care of it if anyone says a word. So I roll into class the next day, and we get right into warm-ups when the teacher yells, \"Hey! Guys! Look at Cvab's sad excuse for a karaoke warm up!\" Cue the laughter. I ended up losing my temper and cussed him out enough that I got sent to in school suspension, but I was generally a really good kid so the school called it a wash and let it go."

Part A, involved making an application, and writing a report about it (50/50 split) . Part B, we got feedback from part A and had to improve upon it. In total it was 100% of a module.\u00a0\n\nIt is also important to note that there is a group contribution report (gcr). Where each student puts in how much they think each student has done.\u00a0\n\nI was in a randomly selected group with 4 others, we each picked a parts of the work that we wanted to do.\u00a0\n\nI was apparently the groups most confident coder so assigned myself about half of the code. And finish up my work in about the first 3 weeks and work on other projects I have for other modules.\u00a0\n\nThen soon after I finished my work,the others ask me if I can do their parts of the code too,I initially protest as I have my other coursework due but eventually I say fine, but so long as it is noted in the gcr they all agree. I sweat it out over the next 3 weeks or so alongside my other coursework.\u00a0\n\nI contacted my module organiser explaining that I had done half the work and they suggested if people weren't pulling thier weight to leave the group (taking my code with me) and do the report. That would mean I would need to work flat out to produce the report and probably would mess it up. I didn't want that. The deadline was in about a week. And I honestly I CBA.\u00a0\n\nThen I got asked to do some report too, because they didn't understand how the code worked. By this point I felt pretty used by them. Didn't really mind so long as I got the marks.\u00a0\n\nAll in all I worked out that I had done the workload of 3 people. There was talk amongst the others of all writing that we each contributed 20% of the workload to \"make us look better as a team\". I flatly refused. They exploded calling me with every name under the sun, swearing at me, telling me to \"fuck off\". \n\nI sent off my GCR with 60 for me and 10 each for the rest. And thought that was that.\u00a0\n\nMy module organiser then emailed me asking if I had any proof of this as they all put me at 0% and themselves at 25%.\n\nI'd worked my ass off on this project putting in 150+ hours on the code and another 50+ on the diagrams and report. All while attending lectures 20 hours a week. Over 7 weeks which if you do that maths averages at an extra 4 hours a day. Ontop of all my other assignments and commitments etc. There was no way I was letting it slide. \n\nI emailed him back linking him to the github I used to share the code with the team (github is a source control that shows who made changes to the code) and showed him that all the commits (version of the code) were done by me proving that I did all of it. And thankfully we did the whole report on Google drive so I could also see the history on that document and send him screenshots of all the alterations made by me proving that I wrote ~20% of the report also.\u00a0\n\nHe added it all up and made a special exception for my group. Saying he would give me most credit for the work.\u00a0\n\nI think I ended up with a 65 and they all get 11 for the whole coursework part A. They would need 69% to even pass the module.\u00a0\n\nSo turned out I fucked up a bit on the code only getting about 50% of the marks with like a massive issue in it (dumb me, for anyone interested I didn't make a MVC structure correctly) but my report sections were near perfect. Spelling mistakes (a common thing I do) and formatting etc. There were a few glaring mistakes from the report that they had written but other than that not bad.\n\nWhen they found out their marks they started calling me up and emailing me and messaging me almost for about 3 hours, I was happily out at the time and didn't have my phone with me so didn't respond. My module organiser sent an email explaining that they had lied and he had proof about it so corrected the marks according.\n\nWhen I got back to my phone I screenshot all the messages they had send and recorded all the voicemails including the ones they had sent previously. Including multiple occasions where everyone in the group told me to \"fuck off\".\u00a0\n\nAnd f off I did. I sent all these voicemails and screenshots to my module organiser requesting that I leave my group, and understand that it is more work for me but I'd rather not deal with that. He agreed and also escalated the messages to someone higher up.\n\nAt this point I quit the group, and decided to work on part B by myself. TAKING ALL OF MY CODE WITH ME. Removing thier access to all of it. I of course asked my module organiser first and they said it was fine as it was my work and if I was no longer in thier group the others couldn't submit it.\u00a0\n\nI fixed the error in the code in about 2 weeks. Then did the whole report from scratch almost and added a load about the fix taking me about 7 weeks.\n\nI then get messages from the group to please come back, we really need you kinda stuff on the end few days of the assignment. They even offered to pay me. I screenshot it and send it to the module organiser, just to let him know what is happening and then just ignore them.\u00a0\n\nI ended up submitting 2 weeks early for the deadline and got 100% on the whole section 2. Which is basically unheard at university, especially by your self for group work.\u00a0\n\nLater that day I get an email from a plaugurisum and collusion officer. Not someone you ever want to get an email from. Basically says I'm summoned to a hearing as an external body looked at both my group (me, myself and I) and my old groups coursework and thought it was very similar. I get the whole project that my group handed in and my own back as evidence so I can look and prepare my answer to their questions.\n\nI email my module organiser ask if he supports me in this because basically they can punish all of you or 1 group (never nobody). He says yes he supports me in this. Perfect.\u00a0\n\nI prepare for this meeting by going though the hundreds of commits I have made while they had access to find the one that is most similar to it. I find a PERFECT match, 0 differences, not even a single character. Through the thousands of lines of code.\u00a0\n\nSo I turn up to this meeting there is the VP of computing there (guy who could basically do whatever the hell he wants to us). My old group when asked to present their answer as to why this has happened go on about how they did all of it by themselves blah blah blah. You get the point, this goes on for about 10 mins. Then I am asked to present my argument. I ask if I can share my screen. VP: \"yeah... Okay...\" puzzled. So I share it. Show all the screenshots I took as some of the people in the meeting weren't aware that we knew eachother, including them basically begging for me to come back offering money to. And as if this wasn't enough to convince them, I then showed me downloading a fresh version of what they submitted, and a fresh version of one of my commits on the github, and running it through a trusted comparison software. I narrated this to explain what I was doing just to be clear. Took a while but came up as I knew it would 0 differences. Everyone was stunned. One of the group members uttered \"but...\". I just laughed. And was quickly asked to hang up as I was no longer involved.\u00a0\n\nTurned out they had cloned one of my commits and still had a copy on their laptop when I blocked their access not been able to fix it atall so just submitted it and hoped for the best.\n\nOne of my friends who is friends with one from my old group asked what grade they got and they said that they failed the whole module as they got a 0 for the second section giving them just 5.5% overall for the module (you need 40 to pass) and would have to retake it over the summer costing them and everyone in my old group their placement year jobs, after all who wants someone who failed a module so badly and who was intellectually dishonest working for them. This ment that they all lost out on being paid ~20k each for the years work. Which goes a long way for a uni student. While I happily get mine.\n\nTL:DR\n\nOld group tried to screw me over and told me to \"fuck off\" and I did taking all of my work with me causing them to fail the class.\u00a0\n\nEdit: thanks for the awards. sorry its so long\n\nEdit2: to everyone asking, it was on pro revenge it got removed quickly from there so I thought I'd put it here instead.\n\nEdit3: I can't spell \"their\"\n\nEdit4: tried to shorten it a bit.\n\nEdit 5: thank you to everyone for all your comments, I am sorry that I cannot respond to them all, I will try my best, really didn't expect this to blow up.",

We didn\u2019t complain, we just picked up extra work and gave him nothing (which he was thrilled about) and ended up with one of the highest marks in the class. The best part is the lecturer could tell from our regular group meetings with him that the lazy guy clearly didn\u2019t care, and changed the rule about grading so that the 3 of us got the same grade and he got about half of what we got.",
            "unpopular opinion maybe but you really should have split the code work. May have saved you the error early on. Does not excuse the later behaviour but I think it may have gone better in the inter group relations.",
            "I did have something similar happen in college. Engineering 101 class, doing a stupid project that required almost no real thought; just collecting data about companies or something.\n\nHad a guy that did nothing. Day before asked what he was supposed to do when we presented. I said nothing. No response.\n\nNow day of project presentation, he shows up, again asking what he needs to do and I let him know to just sit there and enjoy the show. I'd already told the professor about his non-compliance with the work and just wanting to present so he could get a grade. \n\nI think he was a bit of an introvert, but that's part of the point of college IMO. You have to learn to talk with others and work together.",
            "This is like wet dream honestly.\n\nI swear I always do more than half the work, but we don't get graded individually like that - we have no way of letting the teacher know who does what - is that common in uni?",
            "The ending is very satisfying indeed, but I gotta say... Every job you have in the future is going to be group work. And your coworkers are going to be just as entitled, selfish, and lazy as your classmates are being now.\n\nYou're going to have to learn to set boundaries, to equitably divvy up work, to collaborate in both coding and documentation, without the option of taking your ball and going home.\n\nThey acted shitty 100%. And you're obviously a talented programmer. But you should also think about your part in this and what you should have done differently: how you as a group could have set equal workloads from the beginning, for instance (and held your peers accountable to that, instead of gradually agreeing to do more and more of the group's work).\n\nYour application succeeded, but your group failed, and as a part of the group, in that respect you have failed as well.",
            "Man I worry you're going to take the wrong lesson from this experience. This whole thing, while \"satisfying,\" could have been prevented by standing firm when your group asked you to do the extra work in the first place. You could have at least told them \"sure I'll do the extra work, but I'm going to take credit for it in the group evaluations,\" instead of springing it on them last second.\n\nI'm not saying they were right, and especially once they doubled down and used your code they deserved the punishment, but I doubt they started this whole project with the intent to have you do all the work. More likely the project just sort of evolved that way as they realized your coding skills. Maybe the guy that was supposed to contribute half of the code just didn't understand yours or wasn't a great coder him/herself - its always tough if you're paired with someone that's way better than you at something.\n\nAgain, not necessarily saying you did anything wrong - just, if it were me in your shoes, I would have looked to resolve the situation differently. If you had all managed to find a way to work together and all got a good grade without you needing to write the report, wouldn't that have been a better (albeit less \"entertaining\") outcome? Back in college I wouldnt have had this perspective, but when I reflect now, I find that the times I helped people in situations like this make me feel 100 times better than thinking about the people I've thrown under the bus - even when they deserved it. Have the hard conversations instead.",

            "I like this story because the author seems to have systematically escalated the situation while both covering his ass and refusing to submit to bullying behavior. \n\nThe part that stands out to me, however, is how many people in this thread are expressing resentment towards group projects in school due to the asymmetrical nature of group contribution. I remember hating these groups when I was in my undergraduate a dozen years ago (American here). However, advocating for everyone to pull their own weight is actually a really toxic understanding of how groups of people work together to achieve tasks that are beyond the scope of a single individual. Like software. \n\nI make enterprise, consumer facing software for a living\u2014although I'm admittedly in the UX field rather than being an engineer\u2014and I really think this story would still be a major red flag to a future employer. To be clear, it's not great how his team treated him, but I have personally found that software requires a level of collaboration that acknowledges differences in competence, background, and speed. \n\nI believe, in a professional setting, OP would have been expected to directly support his other teammates with their coding efforts as the relatively Sr. Engineer in his group rather than resentfully complete his piece and chucking it over the fence. The behavior that he exhibited might make sense in the academic scene, where everyone gets an individual grade, but I'd say that product/engineering people are judged much more severely for the final product along with their ability to contribute to group dynamics than they are for the quality of their individual contributions. \n\nI know that's not fair. I'm not defending it. It's a constant frustration that Agile/Scrum isn't structured to reward high performers or provide accountability outside of cursory QA. However, I hope OP doesn't brag about this story when he interviews with a potential employer down the road.",

Cripes.\n\nI was in a group of 3, and unbeknownst to me, the other two guys had been friends since before. One of the two guys kept coming to me and saying, \"I don't know what's going on, I don't know what we're doing, I need you to help me,\" to which I basically said no, if you need help, that's literally what the Prof and TAs are there for. If he had specific questions I'd have been happy to help, but he was doing that bullshit \"I don't understand anything\" \"okay what do you need help with\" \"everything\" thing. I was admittedly being a dick to him, but I was dealing with a lot at the time, and even at my best I've never really tolerated that sort of learned helplessness.\n\nSo I did my part, the third guy did his part, but the complaining guy did jack shit, kept asking for help, contributed nothing. Deadline approaches, we have about 2/3 of the project done, I stay up with the useful teammate until about 3am polishing off the assignment. We submit, it sucks, but it's a pass. Teammate assessment comes up, I give Whiny zero and split the rest between myself and the other guy.\n\nMarks come out, I have about 25% on an assignment that was awarded a C. Whiny and his friend got full marks. I email the TA, ask why my mark is so low. Turns out, Whiny gave me a zero out of spite, complained to his friend, and the other guy gave me a low mark too.\n\nBut I'm thinking, I covered my ass. I have conversations. I have the Git repository. Not only do I have the list of contributions showing that Whiny submitted literally nothing, but I have a message from him *after the assignment was due* asking how to upload to Github. Dude never figured it out, and I can only assume he never bothered asking mid-project because he never finished anything worth uploading.\n\nTA looks at it, hums and haws, and then says, \"well, it's still your word against theirs.\"\n\nI had to redo the class. Despite having evidence that the other two guys were lying about me.",
            "To me, this whole saga was an example of a failure of team leadership. Work needs to be divided evenly. And for school projects that means that everyone should do part of the work, even if they are not good at it. Why? Because the only way you learn and improve is by doing it. Assigning coding to the coders is fine in a business environment, but in an educational class, everyone is learning to become a coder. Also, coders need to be able to communicate their ideas effectively, so they need experience with writing, as well.\n\nThe lesson is this: set expectations and clearly divide the work in an equitable way at the beginning of the school project. If other people are not pulling their weight, first you discuss it with them early on. If there is still a problem, discuss it with your professor. The same applies in a work environment.",

        "selftext": "**TL;DR: Civilian dependent wife demanded to be saluted because her husband was an officer, used her clout to get enlisted to salute vehicle stickers.  Enlisted followed orders and saluted vehicle stickers, prioritized them over officers, and even empty vehicles in parking lots.**  \n\nThere are a handful of rules to saluting in the American military.  The when, why, and how is drilled into you from boot camp until the day you leave.  Even the order in which the salutes are rendered have meaning.  When it comes to vehicles there are helpful insignia and stickers to indicate if its an officer such as a colored sticker located on the front windshield.  \n\nMy base was small enough where it was everyone's job at some point to do sentry duty at the front gate which had housing for military families.  Sentry duty was pretty basic, you'd stop every vehicle, check ID's and then wave them through.  If they were an officer you'd see it coming with those colored stickers and after verifying the identify of the officer, you'd salute and send them on their way.\n\nOne day while on duty I approached a vehicle with an officer's sticker and there was only the officer's wife driving in the vehicle.  I returned her ID, wished her a nice day and waved her through.  Pausing with a stern look, \"Where's my salute Petty Officer CitizenAlpha\".  Now Karen here was wife to a higher ranking officer and has clearly has fallen under the impression people are saluting her somewhere along the way.  \n\nSome of the junior enlisted might've even been saluting her as they're pretty easy to bully and more prone fuck ups.  I politely replied, \"Ma'am salutes are only rendered to commissioned officers.\"  Angrily pointing her chubby little fingers at the front of her windshield towards her husband's officer sticker, \"I have a sticker and you need to salute the sticker.\"  Curtly I continued, \"I'm afraid that sticker is not an officer either.\"  \n\nFrustrated she pulled through and left my post.  My cover guy (the guy keeping me safe with a big gun) and I watched her drive down the street and pull right into the administrative building with the top brass and huffed into the building as quickly as her soft shitty body would take her.  We exchange a look between us with wry smiles knowing exactly where this is probably going.\n\nLater that day we get a new official base-wide mandate.  From here forward all enlisted will salute vehicle stickers of officers regardless of who's in the vehicle.  Rodger that.  This is where the malicious compliance comes in.  It's worth noting that when you salute an officer as enlisted, you do it first, and you hold that salute until you are saluted in return and they lower theirs.  Only then do you lower your salute.  It signals that you're saluting them, and they're replying.  \n\nAdditionally when saluting a group of officers, you generally direct your salute and greeting to the highest ranking individual.  Now as far as I know this stupid sticker salute order has no accommodation for how a 2004 Toyota Camry fits into the officers pecking order.  Additionally if the car is unoccupied, its not like that sticker is removed.  \n\nAfter that order came through we all began saluting stickers.  Personally I'd direct my salute to the sticker.  I would also prioritize sticker salutes over officers.  Let me tell you, walking through parking lots was a blast as I saluted empty cars on my way to where ever.  More and more people saw me doing it, and more and more people started doing it.  \n\nNot long after the order was publicly rescinded, which hilariously had the balancing affect of never rendering a salute to anyone but a clearly known officer cementing Karen never getting her unearned salutes.",

Ive seen them try to cut the line at the commissary based on their rank, trying to enter restricted areas they had no business being in, tried to get out of basic requirements (like showing ID, standing at attention during taps, or wearing seatbelts on base) and a few even barked orders at me or my mom. \n\nThat was the line they shouldnt have crossed. My mom WAS in uniform (SFC USA) and took ZERO shits from anybody not in uniform and even then they had to have more rank on their shoulder than her\\*. I have a \"you are too stupid to live\" look and never realized until now that I learned it from my mom. And you are right - too many didnt know their place in the universe and who would or WOULDNT jump when they commanded. (Nah bitch I dont work for you and neither do either of my parents!)\n\nMom would ask them for the name of their sponsor (military member/spouse), their CO, etc and regardless of the name she would say \"Oh yeah! I know him. I'll tell him about this at the stand up Monday morning. He really HATES dependents who try to give orders to the troops.\"  The thought (or actual reporting) of the military member being reported to their CO because of spouse stupidity usually could put them in their place.\n\n\\*This was in the 70s and early 80s so many folks still werent used to women in uniform (especially the Germans).

            "(This story was taken from my grandfather's diary)\n\nMy grandfather was a ball turret gunner in a B-17. He was friends with and flew alongside [Medal of Honor recipient Maynard \"Snuffy\" Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maynard_Harrison_Smith). Snuffy was not big on saluting and also a bit of a dick. In particular, Snuffy didn't like having to stand up and salute during meals when officers entered the mess hall. So Snuffy came up with his own solution.\n\n(Background: If you've ever heard of Private Snuffy or Airman Snuffy, that fictional character comes from a comic strip from around that time where Airman Snuffy is a bit of a fuck-up. Snuffy Smith was nicknamed after that character, to give you an idea of what his officers and fellow airmen thought of him.\n\nSnuffy Smith (the real one) received the MOH because during a mission, six guys on his plane were wounded. Snuffy gave them medical aid, manned their various guns to fight of a few waves of German fighters, and put out a fire that had started inside the plane. According to Snuffy, he put out the fire by tossing a bunch of shit on it to smother it, and when he ran out of shit to throw on it, he pissed on it.)\n\nOnce Snuffy received his MOH, it meant that as long as he was wearing it, everyone on the base--regardless of rank--had to salute him. He took advantage of the situation. He'd wear his medal all the time and go out of his way to walk past groups of officers so they had to stop what they were doing and salute him. Because Snuffy hated having to salute officers during meals, he made sure to wear it to the mess hall.\n\nThe officers' table was right next to the chow line, so when Snuffy got his food, the officers had to stand up and salute. Then Snuffy would go to sit, and the officers would sit down and continue eating. But then Snuffy forgot to grab a fork. So he went back to the chow line to grab one, and the officers had to stand and salute him again. Oh wait, one of the guys Snuffy's sitting with forgot to grab a napkin. And being the great friend he was, Snuffy went back to the chow line to grab one, and the officers once again had to stand and salute him.\n\nThis went on for a few days until the officers negotiated a truce. Snuffy agreed that he wouldn't make the officers stand up to salute in the mess hall as long as his fellow enlisted men didn't have to salute the officers.",

            "Two decades ago my Dad and I would commute to work/school. He would drive us to the base first, he would be saluted as we drove through the gate, I would then keep the car for the day going to school and killing time until he was done. Every dang time I drove back on base to pick him up, the car would be saluted at the gate. I asked the guard if that was truly necessary since it was clearly obvious I was a teenager and not a military member. With a sad wry grin, he said he had to and we carried on. On a separate, but related note, one of my school friends was boy and officer crazy and always wanted me to drive and go shopping on both nearby bases just so she could be saluted.

When I joined the regular service (1981) however, that particular custom was never mentioned. But I noticed with interest that the condition was *not specifically rescinded*. It could be that it was a condition imposed by individual commanding officers in their respective unit standing orders. In any case, I always applied it during my service career. I just thought it was being courteous.\n\nWith respect to a group of officers, it was my understanding that you are paying salutations to the ***group*** as a whole and not specifically the senior rank present.

The commanding general of Camp Smedley Butler (brigadier general) tried to come on board and the young lance corporal (who wasn\u2019t me, thank god) standing gate, wouldn\u2019t let him through. Because he didn\u2019t have his ID on him.  \nAt 1530 the young lance corporal and the corporal in charge of him (who was me) were standing in front of the Base commander, the provost marshal & the provost sgt, getting a, surprisingly mild, lecture on proper respect and courtesy due flag officers. The LCpl was dismissed, was ordered to stay and thought, \u201c Fuck here it comes.\u201d\nWhen the door closed the Colonel said: \u201c Corporal, I would appreciate it if you discreetly let the LCpl and the rest of the enlisted know that he did the right thing and I\u2019ll always back my orders.\u201d\nI later found out that the Colonel hated the General. And vise versa. Air wing vs ground forces thing.",

Yes, we were called cadets and had the cadet ranks which were structured similarly to the ranks in the real US Army (which I guess were there to help us learn the officer ranks? IDK.) Anyway, our cadet battalion was located at Cornell University and those cadets had a habit of looking down their noses at cadets in the battalion who didn't attend Cornell. There was this one female cadet who was in the cadet battalion chain of  command (I think she was a cadet Lt. Colonel but it's been over 30 years so I'm no longer sure). I was a cadet lieutenant and, one day, after a particularly bad weekend spent in the woods with these clueless cadets, she was approaching me outside, wearing cover. I was in no mood to salute her, even though, technically, I was \"required to.\" Cue her start to chew me out like I'm a basic trainee on their first day. I finally leaned over and calmly told her, \"Look, you're a cadet just like I am. These ranks we're given have no meaning in the real world, and I'm well aware you \"out rank me\". The only way I'm gonna salute you is if you're wearing gold bars, indicating that you've actually been commissioned as an US Army 2nd Lieutenant.\" I then just turned and walked away.

But to her credit, she never took it to the higher-ups to fuck them over for stupid assumptions, although she'd occasionally make them sweat.\n\nThe kicker was that I was a ridiculous, hippie-looking teenager with hair down to my waist and, despite being the passenger, they'd occasionally defer to ME as the man in the car because both of our IDs listed the same rank (mine being in red as a dependant...).",

Now When I did gate duty after 2200 hrs the gate access was by ID card only (No ID card no entry).  Then we saluted only when it was an officer verified by an ID check.

        "selftext": "So this happened earlier today and was too perfect to not share with you guys. I work in construction as the foreman for a new house build. The location is kinda strange, the house is 250 feet up a hill via a foot path only. All of our materials have to come up this foot path by hand, it\u2019s a pain in the ass to manually carry, quite literally, an ENTIRE HOUSE up this hill. One of our saving graces is having the two parking spots on the street at the bottom of this hill marked with official No Parking signs. Unfortunately there is an elementary school about half a block away and the parents of children seem to regularly (at least twice a day) think it\u2019s ok to park in our spots. Now I consider myself a reasonable person, so if someone is parked in the spots and we don\u2019t have a delivery or a need to park a truck I will let it go. If we need the spots and there\u2019s someone parked there, however, I will ask them to move nicely and most of the time they do so immediately. Until today. \n\nI get a phone call from the lumber delivery truck that is en route to our location, he says he\u2019ll be there in about two or three minutes. I let him know I will meet him at the street and make sure he has space to park. He\u2019s carrying all of the material to frame the roof of our house, which is a lot of really big lumber and will take easily an hour to bring up the hill, so naturally I didn\u2019t want him parked in the middle of the street with his hazards on for an hour, when we have a perfectly good parking spot for him. As I begin my trip down the hill, I notice there is a school parent sitting in her car idling, assuming she\u2019s just waiting to pick up her child, I walk up to her car and politely let her know that she is parked in a no parking zone and we really need her to clear it to park a delivery truck. She scoffs at me and rudely states back, \u201cI\u2019ll just be a few minutes, and your truck isn\u2019t here, take a chill pill dude.\u201d Before I can respond, a giant lumber truck comes around the corner and I wave to him, and then gesture towards him to the woman in the car who has now put her window back up to ignore me. I put on my best customer service smile and wave at her through the window, she put it down halfway and angrily shouts \u201cWHAT!\u201d By now the truck has pulled up alongside her car and I politely ask her again, with a stronger tone of voice to move her vehicle, reminding her that she is illegally parked in a tow away zone. Then she gives me this wonderful idea, she says, \u201cCan\u2019t you guys just unload around me? Jesus, it\u2019s not that hard.\u201d I give her another smile and walk away, a brilliant plan forming in my head. I instruct the delivery driver to park as closely to her as possible and block her in with the porta potty that is at one end of our reserved spots and the parked car that is parked just adjacent to our spots on the other end. He smiles because he immediately gets what I\u2019m trying to do, and proceeds to expertly block this lady and her car into a little two parking spot jail. We unstrap the lumber and my guys begin humping material up the hill, meanwhile I call the police parking enforcement to let them know the situation. At this point in time I wasn\u2019t trying to get her in trouble, I just wanted a record of why we were blocking part of the street so we don\u2019t get in trouble with the city. The very friendly traffic officer lets me know that she can be there in about 30 minutes and deal with the situation for me, wonderful! As we continue to unload lumber the child of the parent shows up, and wouldn\u2019t you know it Mom is just now realizing that the lumber truck is parked so close she can\u2019t get out of her driver door to meet her kid. She awkwardly clambers across the inside of her car and stumbles out the passenger door, shooting glaring looks at me and the truck driver in the process. She loads her kid into the back and then begins to realize that she has no way of leaving. She comes storming up to myself and the driver and states, \u201cI\u2019m in a big hurry, you need to move your damn truck right now so I can go.\u201d Before I can respond the driver gets a grin on his face and says, \u201cMa\u2019am in order to unload the lumber on the truck we had to unstrap it, and per our company policy I\u2019m not allowed to move the truck with any unsecured load on it. Sorry.\u201d This sends her into near aneurysm levels of blood pressure, meanwhile I can barely contain my laughter. \u201cFuck your policy I have somewhere to be!\u201d She barks back at him. \n\nAt this point, with impeccably convenient timing the parking enforcement officer shows up and parks behind the truck. She doesn\u2019t see the officer arrive and while the officer is still getting out of her vehicle I just casually say, \u201cCan\u2019t you just pull out around it? It\u2019s not that hard.\u201d With the biggest shit eating grin I\u2019ve ever had I watch as she realizes that I just used her line on her. \u201cFuck you!\u201d She yells, and storms back to her car and angrily clambers back in through the passenger door and into the drivers seat. At this point the officer is walking up to myself and the driver, before she can even introduce herself the Mom in the car slams it into reverse and stomps on the gas, crashing into our porta potty and knocking it over, and then throws the car into drive and tries to mount the curb and drive on the sidewalk. The officer, driver and I are staring in disbelief as she gets halfway over the curb and gets stuck. I can hear her screaming obscenities over the idling truck from inside her car. The officer promptly walks up to the door of the car and orders her out. My favorite part of the entire thing is watching her face go to shock as she realized she just did all of that in front of a police officer. She gets slapped in cuffs as the parking officer calls for a second unit and she is promptly sat on the very curb she tried to drive over. \n\nShe sits on the curb yelling to the now two officers about how we told her she could stay there and that we never asked her to move. The traffic officer responds that she was the one who was originally called when she first refused to move and that she already knows what\u2019s going on. While myself and the driver are giving a report to the second officer, my guys finish moving the remainder of the lumber and the driver finishes his statement and takes off to go back to the yard. By the end of the ordeal she was arrested, charged with Child Endangerment, (her kid was in the back of the car the whole time) Reckless Driving, Destruction of Property, (the porta potty) and Driving on a Suspended License. On top of all that she also got her car towed, the kid went home with his grandma and she went to spend some quality time in a cell. I never expected her to actually heed my advice to \u201cJust pull out around it.\u201d But I think next time she\u2019ll probably think twice about parking in a tow away zone, if she ever gets a license again. \n\nTLDR: Rude lady parks in construction site reserved parking, asks us to unload around her, so we park blocking her to do so, gets mad when she now has no way out, crashes into our porta potty and tries to mount the sidewalk. Gets stuck, and the arrested by an officer who was on scene, and all with her child in the back seat. \n\nEDIT: some people have been asking for pictures of the site, here\u2019s a link\n\n https://imgur.com/gallery/S7JwM\n\nThanks for gold and all the overwhelming responses!

        "selftext": "The guys at prorevenge argued that it better belongs here, so here I am.\n\n\nMy house is surrounded by two gardens, one in the front, facing the street, and one in the back, bordering my neighbours' gardens. When my parents and grandparents moved into our house 26 years ago, they planted a thick hedge around the entire property. They also installed a rose arch over the pathway to our front door and my grandfather was always busy keeping up the garden, planting, weeding, keeping everything very tidy. \n\nMy grandfather died in 2002 and after that, the garden was neglected for a few years as my parents were still working and my brother and I were in university/school. But then, ca. 2005, my mum read something that we should plant stuff to help the bees and she took over the gardens, planting lilac, rhododendron, roses and various berries. Later we decided to also install raised garden beds with various kitchen herbs. \n\nMy mum is now over 70 years old and has officially given the house over to my brother and me, so that we won't be taxed on inheriting it when she dies. Since then, I've been sporadically taking care of the gardens. I like them in their wild shape with all the birds, bees, bumblebees and butterflies flying around, in autumn we get hedgehogs and we've been visited by a fox recently (which send my cats into a panic). \n\nThen, recently, we received a letter from the city stating that our garden was interfering with the safety of the street, because the hedge was overgrowing the pavement and contained poisonous berries which were a danger to children. Now, my brother trims the hedge every month to make sure nothing is overgrowing the pavement in any way, and while the berries are poisonous, to get to them you'd have to be quite resilient because they're surrounded by thorns. They are also know to be ideal food for some local birds.\n\nSo, I contacted our local nature conservation association and asked if they would like to have a look at our gardens and maybe tell us if we could improve anything to make them even more nature friendly. They came, looked around and then told us they rarely see gardens so in touch with nature. They approved our gardens as \"especially nature friendly\" and contacted the city to tell them that from their point of view, any changes would be considered unfriendly to nature, and since our city prides itself with once being one of the \"green capitals\" in our country, they had to budge. \n\nDon't mess with my gardens!",

His neighbours complained to local council that it was unsightly and a fire hazard.\n\nThe council sent him notices to trim it all back and clean it up. He refused them all. The council set a date that they would come and remove all trees, plants and shrubs and charge him for the cost involved.\n\nHe contacted a local environmental agency that came and inspected his property and they found two species of endangered birds had nested there. One was assumed extinct. After that there was nothing they could do as the birds were protected by law.",

Some councils have programs to encourage more native plants in gardens, mine does ten plants per year for a gold coin donation. The landcare groups are experts in knowing about local indigenous plants. This means plants that are not just native to your country but also your specific area. These are the best to plant! If you\u2019re lucky you might be able to find some that are edible too (my favourites).",

Of course I don't want to be bothered, but we also have the best grass come spring because we let the leaves sit and protect the grass from the cold. Why rake leaves only to mulch with something else?\n\nNow I just need to convince the city that there is a difference between \"noxious vegetation\" and tall grass. They will fine the crap out of people for letting the grass get long in the summer under an ordinance designed to prevent poison ivy/oak or other major allergens.

Our car was totaled in the accident and it has been a loooong process. We finally decided on the automobile we wanted, got all our paperwork completed, and had our financing all worked out.  All we needed to do was sign all the paperwork and drive away.  The dealership is 90 minutes from our house so we took the kids out of school early and my husband took off work after lunch.  We wanted to make sure we were home in time to keep our typical school night schedule going.  \n\nWe get to the dealership at our agreed-upon time,  we did one more test drive and were ready to sign everything. Then the games started.  All of a sudden the finance office wasn't ready for us.  Then after an almost 2-hour wait, they were ready.  The finance person started by trying to upsell us on all the add-ons dealers try to sell you. We told her we didn't want anything extra, we just wanted to look at the numbers, read the paperwork, sign it all, and head out.  Due to our wait, we had a limited amount of time to get this done and still be able to get home in time for the kids bedtime routine.  The first thing she does is pull out a different set of numbers than we were originally given and agreed to.  All of a sudden there is a dealership fee for selling us a car at this time of year.  Nearly 1k for this nonsense. Then she states that if we don't like the fee, we could leave as they have people begging to buy cars from them.  So, my husband and I stood to leave.  She then tells us we can't leave as she has already printed the forms.  I laughed at her and told her to go out and get one of those beggars to buy it. \n\nSo far the finance person has called twice and the salesperson has called 4 times.  I guess they weren't expecting someone to get that far and then walk away.\n\nETA:  I didn't update sooner as I really wanted to finish the situation before revisiting this.  The  truly terrible car dealership was Auffenburg Nissan in Shiloh, IL. We went with an auto sales company that was a no negotiation, no hassle, and no hidden fees company.  Honestly, getting my insurance updated took longer than anything in their office.",

He finally brings out paperwork matching the terms I had set with the sales guy, so I sign and they sign.  \n\nThe guy was so pissed off he forgot to take the down payment.  I get the motorcycle home.  I got a couple of calls about the down payment, but I have paperwork saying they received it and as proof I have the motorcycle.

            "My Dad worked for a big car manufacturer until he retired. So when I buy a new vehicle, I use that manufacturer's employee discount program.\n\nIt's great! MOST of the time, it kills all the dealership games because there is a set price on the vehicle based on MSRP minus the employee discount and the value of my trade-in. The sales folks realize this and don't screw around.\n\nAll except one dealership in my area. They pulled out the ol' four square sheet and started their manipulation bullshit. I sat back and listened to their spiel for a minute or two asking myself if they really thought this would work (they did). \n\nThey didn't have the vehicle I wanted, so I planned on ordering from the factory, My trade was still in good shape, so I wasn't desperate for a vehicle. When I got tired of listening to their crap I asked for my keys back so I could leave. Instead they pushed harder to sell me a vehicle on their lot that wasn't what I wanted.\n\nI asked a second time for my keys. Instead they brought out their manager, who had my keys in his hand, but instead of handing them to me, he kept trying to sell me. The third time I asked for my keys, I also pulled out my phone, dialed the non-emergency number for the local police, showed the manager my phone and informed him I would report him for holding my wife and I hostage if I didn't get my keys back right now.\n\nI got my keys and have refused to do business with that dealership ever again.",
            "A few years ago I was new car shopping at a dealership we had bought 4 previous cars from. This time I was recently divorced and was there alone. I had done extensive research on different cars. I knew what I wanted & what I could afford for a payment. I found a new Honda Civic 4-door,  basic model with none of the fancy upgrades. Took it for a test drive, had more room than I expected & plenty of power. Got back to salesman\u2019s office told him to write his best price on the back of his business card. If I could beat it elsewhere I wouldn\u2019t be back, if not I would be back to buy it. After looking at multiple other dealerships at comparable Honda Civics, the first dealership had the best price by far. \n\nI returned the following day to finalize the purchase. And went to the Finance manager office. He went over all the basics, and then starts the hard sale for the extras & extended warranty. I shook my head & told him, \u201c I spent hours with your salesperson telling me what a great car Honda is and I should get YEARS of use out of it & how it\u2019s one of the top rated brands. THEN I come in here to you & you start in about how it\u2019s a foreign car & you can\u2019t guarantee it will make it off the car lot\u201d!!! \nSo I think I need to talk to the manager & figure out which one of you is blowing smoke up my ass!\nThe finance guy starts backtracking, as I stand up & walk to the door.

It felt like this was a trick they have used successfully before to keep someone from leaving.\n\nLittle did they know that I had given them the spare key to my car and had another with me so I told them I was leaving anyway using another key and was going to drive over to the police station to file a report for them stealing my key.... when suddenly they found the missing key...

I don't care about the stereo and don't need all the bells and whistles. I'm not looking for a covertable cause I can't even stand to drive with the windows down. I'm just driving it back and forth from work and the occasional trip to friends. But I would be driving it in the winter so id need the cold weather stuff. Then he ask what colour I wanted. I explained how I didn't have a spacific colour in mind but gave a few ideas (that really dark midnight blue, or that charcoal Grey. Things like that. He goes \"well here's the colours available (giving me a pamphlet) try and rank them to give me an idea.\" So I rank the Metalics first, then the blacks and whites. And say the o ly colours I will not do is these primary school red yellow and blue. As for budget, I said I didn't have a set number but wanted to keep the cost as low as possible. (Already did the research for how much the absolute base model would be so set my mental budget a bit higher then that about 45k max.) But was looking for something in the 35k range. (Giving him room to upsell)\n\nSo all and all, I think I was pretty clear and easy on what I wanted. And he goes we actually have one on the lot I think you'll like.\" Do you want to guess what he tried to sell me?\n\nThat's right, bright red, convertable, with seemingly every single feature possible (Except cold weather package.) Eighty-nine fucking grand! \n\nI was like \"did you even hear a single thing I said? This has literally everything I said I don't want.\" I humored him when he said \"just try sitting in it.

I got the VINs the night before I wanted to buy and had all the CR info in my head.\n\nI went to dealer A first. They immediately turned every price conversation to a 'what do you want to pay?' chat. I said, \"Sorry you don't want to sell me a car today. I'll wave as I drive by in my new Dealer B brand.\"\n\nWalked into Dealer B and said, \"CR says you'll charge xx,xxx for this car, and you're within $1 of what they say. CR says you paid yy,yyy for this car, so I'm going to guess they're also right about that.

It even want to bother haggling it was such a good deal.\n\nWe start going through the paperwork all looks right, get to the price and they were asking 12k for it.

He comes back and says yea he\u2019s not sure why it was set at that price. But he can knock 1 k off. And I said 8k or we walk. I came here to purchase at the advertised prices.

Test drove an obvious work truck as it was a year old model with over 100,000 miles and looked like someone took a hammer to the entire body. It was pretty beat up. I knew I wasn\u2019t going to buy that truck but they had some other models I was interested in, so I allowed them to run my credit report and determine my trade in value. After about 20-30 minutes, a salesman comes back and tells me he wanted to thank me for purchasing the truck. No negotiations, not even an agreement to purchase. I was shocked. I said I had only agreed to see what the \u201cnumbers\u201d would be and that I wanted to leave. Guy leaves and comes back about  5 minutes later, dropping the price from the Hank Hill sticker price of $17500 to $12000. I just looked at him with a blank stare and ask for my car keys. I left but every time I went somewhere else and had my credit checked, the first thing asked is what happened at that other location. \n\nIf anyone wonders why I kept having my credit ran multiple times, I was young and didn\u2019t know it could damage my credit at the time.",

Oh, there's a $5k market adjustment charge that wasn't on the sticker. Got it negotiated in half. Fine, I don't have a car, I need something.

I thought \"wow, what a luck!\" and decided to wait a few days for the price reduction in place. Then I started hearing online chatter that the price reduction is because of feature cuts in the newly manufactured vehicles.\n\nI tried to verify this rumour with the sales person. But I was told repeatedly that the news is untrue and the vehicle will have all the current features. So I paid the initial amount as a cheque. \n\nWell, you guessed it! When the vehicle came, it didn't have all the promised features. I refused to take the delivery and I called my bank to cancel the advance payment. The dealership wasted one more week of mine looking for a 'nonexistent' car that was manufactured before the price cut.\n\nBut wait, the ending is sweet!\nAfter cancelling my order, I went to another dealership of the same brand. I mentioned to the sales person there about what happened earlier and said that I don't want to waste my time going back and forth on the price negotiation again. He saw the look on my face and came back with a price lower than the one from the earlier dealership!\n\nI paid the money and got the delivery of the vehicle the very next day. When I looked at the VIN, I was surprised that the vehicle was the same one I was supposed to take delivery from the earlier dealership.

I was pissd off and said this was false advertisement. I told them they needed to honor the listed price. They wouldn't budge so I walked out.\n\nThe next day, I called one of their other dealerships a couple of cities away.

I just wish I'd heard that answer and not wasted any of our time.\" And I left.  \n\nDec 30th the phone rang and they absolutely could make that deal if I agreed to take delivery before Close of Business on Dec 31st.  Then they took it back as a service call to install the cruise control. \n\nKnowing most dealers float monthly paper for what's on the lot, I'm thinking management didn't want to carry that base model truck into the new year.",
            "My wife and I went into a dealership and said we didn't want to pay more than 350 a month. There then follows wheeling, dealing, getting managers, assessing trade-ins, and all that jazz. About an hour of work and some printed paperwork later, sales team leaves us al one in the room for a moment---probably to figure out what fees to track on-- giving me the opportunity to lean over to my wife and say \"when they come back, just play along.\"\n\nSales manager comes back and announces \"great news, we got it to 350!\"\n\nI look at my wife, then turn back to him shaking my head. \"No, not 350, three FIFTEEN!\"\n\nGuy looks crestfallen, then turns to the sales guy and says \"just give it to them.\"\n\nStill not sure how I won that, but one of my proudest moments!",
            "Went through this myself. Had an agreed upon price (10k out the door total). Put a deposit, got a decent price on my busted up trade in, and off I went. Went back with my son to pick it up and there\u2019s suddenly an extra  500 on it. Tell them no way was I paying a penny over 10k. Do the bs back n forth thing for a half hour, get tired of it, picked up my keys, told my son we\u2019re out , and started walking. Got to my car, got in, and the sales guy and his manager came RUNNING \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\nWhY yOu LeAVinG??? Told them again, not paying more than 10k, and the check was the balance of the payoff. \nChanged their tune right quick. Told them they have one shot at making it right, and I\u2019m not coming back in and leaving if the next round of paperwork didn\u2019t have the checks payoff number on it. \n\nYeah, they blinked.",
            "Best trick I learned.  Come 1 hour before closing to do a test drive because that is when \u201cyou could get there after work\u201d.  Say you have to think about it.  Come back the next day the same hour before closing and say your ready to sign all the a paperwork right now.  They won\u2019t want to miss the sale, so they\u2019ll definitely do it.  If they do everything smoothly they will only have to stay a little late at work.  If they play games they will have to stay very late at work and keep their manager there too.  Then once they\u2019ve mentally committed to this last minute endeavor, do you start to talk about price.  You let them make the initial price statement, and you they you innocently bring up up the deals and incentives on their website and don\u2019t see where those have been applied.  I\u2019ve done it a couple times now, and it ends up being a more pleasant purchasing experience (for me at least).",
            "F&I (Finance and insurance) is the true reason people hate dealerships. Sure the haggling part with sales and the sales manager sucks but the real thieves are F&I. Some examples:\n\n* selling garbage warranties that are marked up 3-400%*\n\n* selling garbage add Ons like TruCoat\u2122 which is really just wax. \n\n* Giving you \"great news\" that you have been approved for 2.9% financing when you were bought at 1.9%. the great news is that they're making a nice commission off that extra 1%\n\n* Usually known for being absolute scumbags in and out of the office\n\n* Special fi. Have bad credit? Great news! We got you approved at 22% for 6 years on this 2003 Ford Taurus. Actual Cash Value is $3,000 but we're going to sell it to you for the low low price of $13,000. Ya know, to get you financed.\n\nAlways and I mean always shop financing before the car.",
            "Sales got from \"fighting for customers\" to \"fighting with our customers\".\n\nIt will only get worse.",
            "Really kind of hilarious to me that there are laws protecting these dealerships. Car makers can't sell direct to customers in many cases and at least in my state there is a limit to how many cars you can buy and sell as an individual before needing a dealer license. All these law are there supposedly to \"protect the consumer\" yet it is mighty hard to find anyone who left a car dealer feeling positive about the experience. \n\nMaybe it is time to trash those laws and let the dealers stand up for themselves? The rare dealer that treats people well should be fine, all these scummy places trying to rob everyone will quickly go under.",
            "The ability to walk away is surprisingly rare. Feel proud.",
            "When my wife got her first car, she had gone with the lot with her dad and she didn't have a ton of money. They found a used bright yellow Chevy Aveo that was a stick shift. The dealer didn't like their offer, insisting it was worth much more.\n\nHer dad evidently smirked and said \"man, you've got a bright yellow bumper car in your inventory. Are you seriously going to have it sit around until you find another teen or twenty something girl that drives a stick?\" And then they left, going to dinner. Within an hour, the dealer was calling them back in.",
            "Best thing you can do is leave reviews on Google and Yelp and mention it on Facebook and reddit. Dice you're both individual people you can actually double up on each and really help drive home the point. It'll help everyone make the choice to avoid those trash bags and hurt them",
            "Yep. We were getting a major run around at the local GM dealer until my husband looked at me & said \"The guy at the Mitsubishi place REALLY wanted to sell you a car\". We got up, sales guy panicked & we got everything we wanted.",
            "When I bought my car, I walked in with a printout of what the price was listed on the website and they came back almost $2k higher.  I said no, I wanted to pay the price I saw.  They said they had already installed certain options (this was a brand new car at the time, they put in window tinting, locking lug nuts, and door corner guards).  I said I didn\u2019t want those options, I wanted the price on the website.  They knocked it down to $500 over the website price and at that point I agreed.\n\nLocking lug nuts cost about $30-40.  Window tinting is in the $300-400 range or so.  The car door protectors are thick clear stickers on the corners and such, I think they cost around $15-$20 or so.  So I paid maybe $40-50 over cost for that stuff they were trying to dealership me on.  Can\u2019t complain.\n\nSeems like every time my mother buys a car it takes all day and they BS her with all kinds of crap.  After Hurricane Harvey her car was totaled so she was shopping, picked a car she liked and she told the sales person she wanted to think over the quoted price while we went to get lunch and she would call him after we were finished eating.  We hadn\u2019t even gotten to the restaurant yet before he called her twice.  She told him he lost a sale because he wouldn\u2019t let her eat in peace.  It was kind of glorious.",
            "We just bought a new vehicle. We went to the dealership that had the exact one I wanted color, options, etc. our trade in was highly desirable and were offered more than we paid new a couple of years ago by other dealerships, but they didn\u2019t have what I wanted.\n\nThey came back and lowballed the trade in, crazy low (like over 12k low) and tried to sell the new one over sticker.\n\nI laughed, he laughed, then we walked out. Told the sales guy thanks but we had better offers elsewhere and were going to buy my second choice.\n\nHe called back the next day to let me know he had worked with his manger and they would meet us half way on the trade in and up charges. I was very happy to tell him we had bought second choice the previous evening and the other dealership actually beat every other trade in offer we had and discounted the vehicle enough so we could add the missing feature I wanted after purchase.\n\nHe was not a happy camper\u2026",
            "Not sure I'd still buy the car from them. However call up the salesguy and give him a counteroffer that is considerably lower than what you had originally agreed to.  It's the cost of him wasting your time.  No way I'd ever wait two hours for their finance person especially when you had an appointment. That should have been a massive red flag.",
            "This is the only way.\n\nDon't just be prepared to walk away, actually do it.",
            "We decided to trade our diesel truck for a smaller gas model.  After research, we knew what we wanted, how much our vehicle was worth, and were completely prepared.\n\nWe arrived at the dealership, test drive the new truck and start negotiations.  We offer to take the smaller truck, they need to pay all the fees, and give us $8000.\n\nThe kid pulls up some dealer-ish-pricing site, tells us the truck is barely worth two grand over their gas vehicle.  We laughed and I said, \"No games.  Just do the right thing.\". He goes to to 'talk to his manager'.\n\nComes back a few minutes later and says, \"We can go to $3500, but you'll have to pay title and licensing.\"\n\nI didn't even look at my husband.  I just got up and started heading to our vehicle.  Hubster remote started and we headed out.  Life's too short to F around.\n\nWe were about 10 miles away when we got a call from the kid's boss' boss.  \"We'll give you $7000, pay all your fees, fill your tank and give you free services for two years.  Please come back.\"\n\nIt took an entire hour to complete every piece of paper and get the check and keys.",
            "Ugh, why must they suck so badly? Why is it acceptable for an entire industry to be based on unethical sales practices? \n\nThe last time I bought a new car (VW, pre-scandal), they did good cop/bad cop to us. Everything went really smoothly the first day and the price was right. Salesman was very professional, we had a handshake deal but - oops - now the finance office was closed so we\u2019d have to come back the next day. They let us leave with the new car.  \n\nNext day, salesman was not in, no one knew anything, had to start over from the beginning with a new clown who was shady AF. Finance manager was a psychopath drenched in cologne wearing a pinky ring. \n\nSeven hours later, we\u2019re in the GM\u2019s office because I\u2019m losing my temper and about to murder the pinky ring guy so the GM is going to \u201cpersonally take care of everything.\u201d He prints the final paperwork. They\u2019ve scammed again with a bogus $2500 charge. I look at the figures, tell him they are incorrect but don\u2019t say how, and that\u2019s the last straw for me, goodbye. He starts trying everything under the sun like I can\u2019t leave because I took the car home, I can\u2019t leave because the paperwork was printed so that\u2019s a binding contract, etc etc etc. It was pathetic. I dropped the keys and walked out.\n\nI savaged them online and with VW corporate and they called for about a month after that but I got the car from another dealer that wasn\u2019t as much of a psychotic bait and switch operation but still an unnecessary hassle. \n\nTwo years later, they had to buy back the car, anyway, due to their emissions fraud. That was a whole other battle. VW is fully dead to me.",
            "A few years ago my wife wanted a new car. I said, \u201cabsolutely!!!!  Once my car is paid off in 6 months.\u201d  A few days later she was off because of a holiday and comes home with a \u201ctest\u201d car. She begged me to take it for a drive and see what I thought. Of course it was nice and shiny and smooth and all that shit new cars are. Told her again, \u201c6 months!\u201d  The next day she took the car back to the dealer and gives her a line about it\u2019s a late model and the pricing only good now because of the holiday sales event. She texted me a picture of the paperwork and I have to admit it was a great price. They even gave her a decent quote on her trade in and interest rate.  Once again, \u201cno matter how great the deal, we cannot afford two car payments for the next 6 months. Sorry. Walk away.\u201d  She calls me a few minutes later and the salesman wants to talk to me. No way Jose. \u201cTell him that those numbers look almost right and the last hang up is for us to sign the papers, they need to write me a check to payoff my car early, roughly $2,000.\u201d  He said, ok!!!  Then I told her to tell him that the $2,000 is separate from her, goes directly to and does not under any circumstance go into her loan balance.  I could hear him in the background scoffing and sputtering about how that\u2019s how it\u2019s done, no other way.  Told her to tell him, \u201c thank you for your time, we are going to go see what xxx company will do for us this weekend.\u201d  Then told her to stand up and walk away. When she got home you could feel the anger in her soul towards me. She didn\u2019t speak to me. The next morning she wakes me up. \u201cGet ready, we\u2019re going xxx dealership!\u201d  \u201cNo we aren\u2019t. That was a line for the other guy. Part of the process. Besides, you don\u2019t like their cars anyway.\u201d  Guess where I was an hour later??  At dealership xxx. After wasting my whole morning, we went back home and she was once again upset and depressed towards me. I tried reassuring her that she\u2019d get a new car when the time was right. She relented and we enjoyed what was left of our weekend. Monday comes and I go to work. Mid morning she calls me, \u201cthe first dealership called me. They said yes.\u201d  \u201cYes to what???\u201d  \u201cThey will pay off your car and it will not go into my loan.\u201d  \u201cReally!!??  That actually worked??  Ok, get EVERYTHING in writing, once I clear the numbers, tell them to find the EXACT car you want. Nothing more, nothing less!!\u201d  After a few fails because wrong color or wrong configuration she sends me picture of a car sheet and the price was over by $1,000. I was now getting mad because I\u2019m at work and this guy is trying to work my wife. I go through every line of detail. Where is this $1,000 coming from. Almost didn\u2019t catch it because EVERYTHING was exactly what she wanted. Then I spotted it, all-wheel-drive. Hmm\u2026that\u2019s a $3,000 upgrade and looks like here it\u2019s only costing us $1,000. Called her back and told her to \u201csign the papers as fast as she could.\u201d  A week later she took delivery of her new car and it\u2019s been a great car. A month later I got a check to pay off my car.  Now we can afford two car payments and my beater is ready to be upgraded. I am getting ready to go back to the same dealership and try to extract another $2,000 out of them for a car they already gave me $2,000 for. My wife says that right. Ehh.",
            "I was at a 4th of July party one time and met the next door neighbor of the hosts. He was a really nice man and we talked for about an hour about raising children (he was a grandfather), local restaurants, etc. \n\nThe next spring I was at a car dealer getting the same run around on the day we were supposed to sign the paper work. We were sitting in the showroom for about an hour, our three young children were miserable--hungry, tired and whining. I saw the guy I met at the party walking past and I said, \"Hi.\" He stopped to talk, and he was wearing the blue service uniform with his name on the shirt. I told him I didn't know he worked there, and asked what he did. He said, \"Oh, a little of everything,\" and asked how it was going. I unloaded on him about his frustrated I was and told him I was ready to leave. He walked into the sales manager's office, came out a couple of minutes later and told us they're ready to have us come in now, and told us he would walk the baby around in the stroller to get her calmed down. \n\nTurns out my friend from the party was the owner of the dealership. I didn't realize because the dealership used his father's first name. We were done in 15 minutes, and they even drove us home because it was too late in the day to submit some of the paperwork to the finance. The owner drove our new van to our house the next day personally.\n\nThe next time I bought a car, the owner hand-picked the salesman for us and made it a great experience. It's all about who you know.",
            "I went to buy my first off the lot car and the sales manager decided that he was gonna talk to me about finances rather than the finance office. After about an hour of being told that myself, my father, and multiple loan calculators were incorrect and my payment would be $100 more than expected, I balled my fists, took a deep breath, and told him to go fuck himself. I walked out and went to a different dealership where I found a nicer car for the same price. My payments were exactly what the numerous loan calculators said they should be. Wasn\u2019t until I posted a strongly worded Yelp review that the owner of the dealership contacted me to apologize and inform me that that wasn\u2019t even the finance office it was the sales manager and they wanted me to come back and they\u2019d take care of me. By then it was too late, they lost their $30,000 sale. I feel bad for the sales man more than anything he was really nice.",
            "I have done this several times. The last time about 2 years ago. The guy was like your really going to walk out over $500? Hell ya I am, called his competitor and had a deal sealed in 15 minutes that beat my target price by $200 once they learned they could screw the other dealer over."
