        "selftext": "Long time stalker, first time poster. Only doing this now because it FINALLY came to fruition last week.\n\nI used to work as a spare parts estimator for a fairly niche industry. My job was essentially to work out what parts of our main product the customer wanted, find out how much it would cost us to make, add a little mark up and send them a quote. My boss was pretty strict on traceability so everything needed to be recorded, including why a certain mark up had been applied to a particular product.\n\nNormal value of these quotes is somewhere between \u00a3200 and a few hundred thousand. Very rarely do we get orders for anything more than that (once or twice a decade in my experience)\n\nA request for quotation landed on my desk when I was WFH during Covid, and it was a biggy. Just looking at the list of parts the customer wanted, this was going to be an absolute killer, over a million pounds all by itself. I was told by the sales guy that if this one went well, there was another to follow of an even bigger size, ultimately looking at ten million over the next four years. So I set to work.\n\nNormally I can do five or six of these quotes in a day, but this one quote took me six weeks to put together. I was in constant contact with 20+ vendors getting specifications, technical details, prices and lead times for over four hundred items. Finally, my masterpiece was complete.\n\nThen came the snag.\n\nSales guy then says that because of the country this customer is in, they need to have four or more quotes in from different customers in order to get it cleared by their government (some anti-corruption policy that had been instituted). We were the OEM of the product and there\u2019s nowhere else on the planet they could get these parts from, so we\u2019d have to work through third parties to get it done, and he knew just the guy.\n\nIn comes a one man band with a dodgy looking entry at companies house to save the day. Sales guy and him go way back, so he was going to be the \u201cpreferential supplier\u201d. I was asked to do the normal quote to him, then to bump the prices up by 30% and send that to three other companies who had been asking about it so they would absolutely not get the contract with the end user. I argued the point, saying that the whole purpose of the anti-corruption policy is to prevent situations exactly like this, but I was overruled. The COO of the company now tells me to just do it over a phone call, at which point I request that in writing before I go ahead and do it.\n\nFast forward two years and there\u2019s still no order been placed. Then I find out through a different sales guy that the One Man Band has been put on a blacklist by this country\u2019s government over this project, the other three companies have been turned down, and the end user is asking other companies to come in and take our product out and replace it with their own. A huge investigation is called for by senior management, my quote is ripped to pieces and examined in microscopic detail, and the question gets asked \u201cwhy did you give different prices to these other three when you knew it was all to do with anti-corruption, we should fire you! That\u2019s millions of pounds of order you\u2019ve lost us!\u201d Out comes the email from my little black book, on the desk it goes, everyone suddenly gets veeeeeery quiet, and the COO starts packing his desk in a box the next week.\n\nAnd the moral of the story is, if someone tells you to do something borderline illegal, make sure to get it in writing.\n\nEDIT: Wow. This really went crazy, thank you so much guys. My first silver too!\n\nFor those asking about the legality of what I did, because all of the third parties were outside of the country where the anti-corruption policy was in place, I didn\u2019t personally break any laws. Whilst the anti-corruption policies are in place for the end-user, the worst the government can do it put us on a blacklist so all of our bids in the future are either refused outright or looked at in far more detail than others might be. I did investigate this at the time, and if there were going to be any implications on me that my company wouldn\u2019t have been responsible for, it would have been a flat no. I was acting against the intention of the policy, but not expressly breaking it. Do not do something illegal just because your boss told you to. \n\nThe issue as far as the company was concerned was the lost millions in revenue and the damage to their reputation (the end-user is a huge company with contacts and is in a reasonably close knit industry, people talk). They ultimately wanted a scapegoat to parade in front of the board to explain why the multi-million pound deal they\u2019d all been talking about for the last two years had suddenly vanished.\n\nI did also look at OEM angle at the time, but because we aren\u2019t the only company who make this TYPE of product, it didn\u2019t appear to be possible to use this as an exception (the reasoning being that the option existed to replace our system with a competitor\u2019s)\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nAfter posting this, I did a bit of research into the final customer and their VP of Finance did some fairly well publicised jail time a few years back for buying an oil rig for the company at a suspiciously low price, so there was no way we would have been able to convince the government that everything was above board with a direct sale.",

        "selftext": "This isn't my story, but I was able to witness it in all its glory because I used to work for one of the people involved.\n\nYears ago, I used to work at a state government agency where my boss was a political appointee. Her mom was a bigwig in our governor's party who wrangled a political appointment for her daughter, which meant she had some clout behind her.\n\nLet's call her Shannon.\n\nShannon was not good at her job. At all. She was frequently out of the office for \"meetings\" (e.g., two-hour lunches, coffee with friends, a bit of shopping).\n\nShe was also a bully and a tyrant. She bullied her staff and would hold the threat of firing over everyone's heads to get them to do what she wanted. She wasn't a micromanager because she was never around enough to actually micromanage anything.\n\nAnd she was widely disliked throughout the entire building. This was a *large* agency, so to have a building where almost everyone disliked you took a lot of work.\n\nThe problem is that, as a political appointee, she was untouchable. The people who had the power to fire her couldn't because of her family. Even the number three person in the agency couldn't do it, and he was a political appointee as well.\n\nBut after a year of mystery meetings and time out of the office, her excuses were catching up to her. The agency director removed her from her job and put her in charge of \"special projects.\" Anyone who's worked in a corporate job knows that people get put in charge of special projects because they were largely incapable of doing their previous job. They didn't get fired, but they no longer had any power.\n\nThis was Shannon's case.\n\nFor a while, she seemed to get the message. She shaped up, didn't have any more mystery meetings, didn't disappear from the building for two hours, and treated people somewhat nicely.\n\nOf course, it didn't last and Shannon returned to her old ways.\n\nAround that time, we got a new assistant director \u2014 we'll call her Tricia \u2014 who was also a political appointee. She was the number two person in the whole agency, and she was great to work for. She was very serious about her job.\n\nShe had access to Shannon's electronic calendar and saw what Shannon had been up to. She then cross-checked the security logs to see when Shannon was in and out of the building.\n\nAfter her brief investigation, Tricia emailed Shannon with a list of dates and said, \"Can you tell me more about these different meetings you were having? And why they took so long?\" (I'm paraphrasing.)\n\nWell, Shannon wasn't having any of that! How dare Tricia call her character into question?! This was an outrage! It was so outrageous, in fact, that Shannon wrote a resignation letter and slammed it down on Tricia's desk! That'll show her!\n\nAfter a few hours, Shannon had time to think about what she had done. She remembered that she had a 1-year-old at home. She also remembered that her husband was an unskilled truck driver who made $8 an hour. (**Edit:** He was a local delivery driver for a construction firm, NOT a CDL driver.) And she remembered that she was the primary breadwinner for her family.\n\nShe went back, hat in hand, and apologized for her attitude, she said she was willing to try harder, and she asked Tricia if she could please possibly have her letter back, pretty please?\n\nTricia said, \"Oh, I'm sorry, you're too late. I already processed the letter and sent it off to HR. I'm afraid I can't undo that.\"\n\nDo you remember in the movie, *The Incredibles*, when Mr. Incredible fought the giant ball with legs? The ball was so indestructible and powerful, the only thing that could beat it was itself?\n\nThis was that moment. The previously untouchable political appointee had just been fired by the only political appointee who had that power: herself. And rather than protect her or do her a solid, Tricia would not undo her self-termination. She just let Shannon be her own undoing.\n\nWhen news of Shannon's self-firing raced through the building, you could hear the cries of \"What? Are you serious?\" followed by howls of laughter as each new person heard the story.\n\nShannon was out and everyone who had to deal with her was much happier than they had ever been in that job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:** Thank you to everyone for the great comments and the awards. That's very cool, and I really appreciate it. You all are awesome!",

But his boss (the owner of the Braves minor league team) wouldn\u2019t let him go, and the new club wouldn\u2019t pay his existing boss for his services.  \n\nSo, as manager he released himself as a player.

            "I had a manager that did this. She was in a position that she was severely unqualified for and should never have gotten getting overpaid. I was abused and harassed by her constantly and I ended up doing all her work and getting paid a low hourly wage despite being more qualified. She was so incredibly stupid that I often felt sorry for her and tried to catch all her mistakes before she royally fucked up. We\u2019re in healthcare so it wasn\u2019t like a minor error. She wasn\u2019t qualified to be giving care or supervising anyone let alone doing anything or even speaking to patients. \n\nIn the entire time she had two meltdowns out of the blue and during one she had actually sent in a resignation email. This would be on days where the rest of the team stepped up and made sure everything had run smoothly. She\u2019d just disappear or clash with the team (especially the women). The management let her stay when she came to her senses because again they needed her. But likewise she needed the job more than anyone. Her son was in remission from leukemia and he\u2019d lost his dad to cancer recently. She was lucky the step-mom was so generous and kind because she really couldn\u2019t support two college aged boys while being one step away from being homeless herself. \n\n\nAnd then some ugliness with the former manager came out and in the interest of transparency I tried to let her know.\n\nShe had me fired after throwing me under the bus to take the fall for it. The entire team told her that it couldn\u2019t have been me but she would not listen. \nI did get asked to come back a few weeks later by management and I needed the job at the time so I came back. It was apparently a shitshow where nothing had been getting done properly and the records were a nightmare that was high risk for an audit. At least this time the management knew it was her fault. But they couldn\u2019t fire her yet bc they needed her and had no replacement ready. \n\nLiterally the first day back she tried to again file a complaint against me because I was acting \u2018shady\u2019 aka being busy with my job while she walked around being a nuisance. This was after she left work to handle personal business while making me do her job.\n\nSo wouldn\u2019t you know it, the second management found a replacement for her, they essentially pulled out her resignation and accepted it effective immediately. The best part for me was that she had bought me a giant birthday cake the day before her firing (she insisted on it) and had the audacity to complain to me about how expensive it was. I knew it was going to happen the next day so I made sure to take the cake home lol. \n\nAnd the day she got fired she confided in me \u2018how could they do this to her knowing her kid has cancer and *needs* the insurance?!\u2019\n\nLike\u2026okay maybe don\u2019t send out resignations to your boss if you have something to lose?",

('You must meet this criteria and continue to meet it for the next 6 months or you will be terminated.') So if a person kept getting them, each was totally separate and we couldn't get rid of someone that would do what they were suppose to do during the PIP and then backslide afterwards. We had to start over 'fresh' with a new PIP. \n\nAfter two PIPs for the same issue, my manager and I were fighting with HR to make it more permanent.

It\u2019s not always obvious to me though and I\u2019d rather be safe than sorry so I always check. It\u2019s also a thing at my cinema where if you sign up for our rewards program (free to join) you save a hefty amount of cash off each ticket so I always suggest joining before selling a ticket. I started my spiel with this guy when he interrupted and said \u2018I\u2019m not joining anything\u2019. So I ask if he has any concession cards and he rolls his eyes and says \u2018no, i just said I\u2019m not joining anything\u2019\u2019 which wasn\u2019t even what I had asked him. At this point I\u2019m getting annoyed cause I\u2019m just trying to help the dude save money and he\u2019s getting annoyed with any question I ask him. I know I have to ask where he wants to sit and when I do he says \u2018in a seat\u2019. I ask if he wants to be more specific and he gives me the filthiest look and says \u2018this is taking so fucking long, just put me anywhere\u2019.

I got so sick of it that when people did that I would put it through as diet coke and when it would come up on their screen they would go \"NO wtf I wanted coke\" and id just say in a real casual tone \"oh sorry, you didn't respond so I thought you would be okay with whatever\".

Then is the time where money is important for him, since he will be paying directly afterwards.\n\nBeing maliciously compliant with a disgruntled customer's requests when the reason for his bad mood can be found in your own behavior (or the setup of questioning as is dictated to you by your boss; I'm not blaming you alone) doesn't fit this sub as much in my opinion.",

She would always find an excuse to lower my grades or blame me for something i didn't do. I was a pretty sick kid that had bad astma, dermatitis and was sickish in general. Thinking back, I think her hating me had a lot to do with that, as she felt i had \"special treatment and privileges\".\n\nOne day we were doing a test and i started feeling very bad. It came to the point of really needing to puke but i held it in because i knew she wouldn't believe me. Then i started shaking and kinda puked a bit in my mouth so i stood up and started to go towards the toilet (we had a rule that anybody who has to go to the toilet can do so without asking).\n\nShe ofcourse stopped me and told me to sit back down. I tried explaining but she wouldn't have it. One girl stood up for me and said something like \"he is really pale and shaking and sweating, i think he needs to go home\". That caused the teacher to go on a 5 minute rant how i'm a spoiled liar who didn't study for the test and now i'm trying to fool everybody and that i'm taking away their precious test time and they should hate me for that\" I said i really need to puke and she just scoffed saying \"You ain't going anywhere with your lies so you might as well do your imaginary puking here\". \n\nYeah... You can guess what happened next. \nNot sure if this is compliance because i couldn't hold it in anymore anyway but i was so happy while doing it.\nFirst i puked a bit trough my arm and then it all went out. Across her desk (grading book was ruined) and all over the floor. She tried to blame me saying that i \"threw up by force\" but the principal didn't buy it after the doctor examined me.

            "I really don't get this level of suspicion with elementary kids. They aren't smart enough to decieve you yet. A sick looking elementary school kid is sick. \n\nThough this story puts some salt into old wounds: when I was eight and on holiday with my cousins family I fell of some playground thing and hurt my arm badly. Now it hurt like shit and it felt numb and hard to move. My aunt kept asking if I needed to go the hospital but I didn't know if I needed to. I told her I didn't know - but maybe that was the right thing to do? So my aunt and uncle drove me a couple kilometers to the next hospital where they took some images and came to the conclusion that it was 'nothing'. Just to be sure the doctor asked me if I was maybe a little bit whiney and well, that was true, I've been told I was whiney before so I said 'yeah maybe'. This made my aunt really mad and passive aggressive. For the rest of the week she wouldn't talk to me at all if she didn't have. Granted, all of this was in Germany and I was insured; she literally just cut me for \"making her take me to the hospital\". \n\nThe incident really soured our relationship, but it helped me appreciate my mother more: she never deligates responsibility shes uncomfortable with downwards the food chain like a little bitch.

Culminated in the school field day at the end of the year, where she refused to let me go to the water fountain at all for the whole day, ostensibly to punish me for forgetting to bring a water bottle (note: I was the child of an overworked single mother; also, I was like freaking seven). After mandatory exercise in 90 something degree weather for a full school day, I'm feeling queasy and ask to be allowed to visit the bathroom. Teacher berates me for being disruptive and gets right in my face about it to really lay into me, saying all sorts of witchy things about my character and what it indicates about my \"upbringing.\" After a few minutes of desperately trying to keep things together as she goes on and on, first grade me gives the jerk a free bile and vomit facial in front of the whole class. More than 20 years later I can still remember the look on her face.  \n\n\nWeirdest thing was, the next year, she made a very visible effort to treat me like I was some former beloved student. My guess is the school district was watching her due to her bullying tendencies and she wanted to prove her victims actually liked her. I certainly wasn't the only student she had that harbored less than pleasant memories regarding her.",

When my mum called my teacher to arrange the homework package her response was \u201cI don\u2019t believe Ladybugs hurt, you\u2019ll have to come in and show me before I give you the homework.\u201d She really had it out for me for some reason and I had to hobble in with my swollen knee and crutches just so I could prove to her I was hurt and not fall behind in school.

            "Man, that sucks... but sounds like she got the rough end of that one.\n\nI have a similar story... I was the youngest and smallest kid (skipped 1st grade), and had several elementary school teachers who seemed to resent that.  My 4th grade teacher was one of them. Once, during an hours-long standardized test, I finished a section early and asked to go to the bathroom. She addressed the class and said, \"\\[my name\\] needs to learn that racing through a test doesn't get him special treatment\" and made me sit back down. Even afterward, during the break, I had to stay at my desk, as a 'lesson' or something. I finished the next section of the test early as well and got up to ask to pee again, but was told to sit back down. I held it as long as I could, but eventually pissed my pants.\n\nFinally we got let out for lunch, and I went to the bathroom and was in there for a long time, trying to dry my pants (I was mortified that all the other bigger / older kids would see I'd pissed myself). The teacher came in and got me eventually, and took me to the principal's office for dawdling in the bathroom and \"making a mess\".\n\nThe principal took me into the office, asked me what had happened, and then called my mom to ask her to bring me some clean clothes. The principal apologized to both of us and privately spoke with my mom. My mom told me later that the principal was going to have the teacher counseled and taken off the gifted program, because she'd been treating a some kids from other groups poorly as well. She was having marriage problems or something, and taking it out on her students. Anyway, we got a really nice new teacher who was way better, and she was the first teacher who helped me realize school could be enjoyable / learning could be fun.",

I was on her shoulders and she was squeezing my thighs(I was very ticklish there). I was laughing so hard. I was laughing so hard, I discovered there is, in fact, a point at which you are laughing too hard. That's when I sneezed and it just messed something up.\n\nThink about the physics of this. My mouth was engaged in the action of laughing very hard. The contents of my stomach physically couldn't exit through my mouth. Instead, they were redirected through my nose. What was below my nose? My mom. I sneeze-vomited right onto her hair. This wasn't a small vomit either. This was a massive one. After my mom cleaned up she put me in front of the toilet in case I vomited again. After a while I felt that it was unlikely that I would vomit again. Boy was I wrong. The moment I close the toiled I immediately vomit all over the cover.",
            "Similar thing happened to me, only I was one of those students that all the teachers liked because I was quiet and got good grades. So my teacher sends me to the nurse because I tell her I don't feel good, and then I can't remember why but the nurse eventually sends me up to sit on the bench in the hallway next to the principals office to wait. The admin assistant in the office wouldn't call my parents to come get me because it was only a half hour before school let out and for some reason thought I was faking. After another 15 min I go in and tell her that I feel really bad, she tells me it's almost the end of the day and to just wait. So a couple min later I throw up all over the hallway.

I said I was done eating but I guess my teacher, who is already bullying me, felt that I didn't eat enough food. So she made me pack her way and told me that I could finish it later for a snack. We went out to recess then came back in. Sometime later I could feel my stomach rumbling and I thought it must be hunger so I asked if I could eat my apple. She said no I could eat my sandwich. I took one bite and hurled all over my desk and the floor. My parents were there almost immediately to pick me up, and according to them they were pissed as hell at her.

We got a doctors note from my school and everyone seemed fine with it except the main office administrator who was constantly calling my mom to bug her about when I was coming back.\n\nAbout a month in she calls my mom and tells her it\u2019s impossible I\u2019ve been sick for this long and if I\u2019m not in school on Monday she\u2019s calling social services. Keep in mind at this point I can barely lift my head, I sound like darth Vader and every few minutes I start coughing like I\u2019m doing an impression of a goose fighting a Toyota. \n\nMy mom was so sick of this shit that she put a mask on me and took me to school in a taxi. She practically had to drag me to my class and didn\u2019t even bother leaving. I got sent home before the bell even rang. \n\nBecause of school policy I was sent to the office and had to be signed out which meant nasty admin lady got to see exactly how miserable and sick I was. She then had the nerve to ask me how could my mom even consider sending me to school. Unfortunately for her my mom just to walk up a flight of stairs to come get me (because she knew what the hell was gonna happen).

            "For all the people that thought whooping cough was gone....you may have heard of it as Pertussis. The infection itself doesn't last for 100 days but the cough can last for months. You are infectious for 1-2 weeks after symptoms appearing and during the 1-3 weeks leading up to the symptoms so roughly a month of being infectious but you don't know you have it for half of that time.\n\nThe bacteria actively damages the cells in your throat and lungs that move mucous so you end up coughing for months until the cells work again, It is particularly deadly for infants as they don't have the strength to clear the mucous and also have trouble sucking due to weakness and general illness.  They don't get the cough as much but have periods of not breathing or slow heart rate.  \n\nSince babies don't get the vaccine for 2 months, it is very important to breastfeed to get those antibodies in the colostrum. Most hospitals are vaxxing new moms before they leave to go home to help decrease the risks of pertussis.  Adults are getting  Pertussis because  the vaccine antibodies decrease with age. \n\nIf you have a newborn, please urge all grandparents or anyone who may be around your baby to go get the pertussis vaccine if they haven't had it in last 10 years.",

I'm being vague but I was 7 with limited understanding of what was going on. I think it was probably pneumonia from my limited memories of that time, in any case we were constantly going back and forth to the doctors, trying all different kinds of medications to figure out something that works. My brother was a lot sicker than I was, I was well enough to go back to school first but my brother was out of school for maybe 2-3 months. He couldn't eat, couldn't breathe, and definitely couldn't attend school. The school kept calling and asking my parents to bring him back to school, my parents kept refusing. They were understandably worried, because we were recent immigrants and they were concerned about a child disappearing like that, so they did send out social workers to check that we were still alive and such. When my brother did eventually come back to school, and they saw what he looked like, recovered from his illness but still near skeletal with bags under his eyes, the school never questioned that any of his future absences were anything but legitimate again.",

She claimed he only had the croup, but never told us about the fever--she had given him Tylenol at 630 that morning and had him at the center by 7am. 1130am rolls around and he had a fever of 101.4 and he had fallen asleep. Called his mom, who said she'd come get him during her lunch break, but did not bother showing up until 545pm (we closed at 6) because she claimed her boss wouldn't let her leave for the day, since she'd already taken off too much time in previous weeks due to her older son having appendicitis and needing to be home for a couple weeks afterward (gotta love empathetic employers, especially ones who specialize in medical insurance, right?). She was told by the center director NOT to bring him in until the fever was gone for 24 hours. Every other day, she'd bring him in since she found a loophole in the policy (I mean, give the kid Tylenol, fever \"disappears\", therefore the time started at that point, and ignoring the fever returning the next morning). After about 2 weeks of this, the director got fed up and would not allow the kid to come back until this \"cold\" was gone.\n\nNeedless to say, this kid was in my classroom, and 7 weeks after receiving my booster, I ended up with a nasty case of pertussis/whooping cough but I didn't know what it was. Since I had just started, I was not allowed to call off because probation there was 6 months instead of 3, and paid sick time was non-existent with that company. They told me that if I needed to go to the doctor, that's what Saturdays were for. The bad thing about that was that my stbxh was a jerk and wouldn't let me use a Saturday morning to go to the doctor to get antibiotics because that was my time to be with our kids and his time to do \"whatever\" with his girlfriend. I tried to get his parents to watch the kids, but they said no, and that it was my job or my ex's job to do so (my folks lived too far away, and none of my friends had kids yet and were unwilling to babysit for a couple hours for me to go to the doctor). \n\nTwo weeks after this, our oldest daughter caught the nasty cold, and this time, the ex made me take her to the doctor myself, saying \"You wanted to be a parent, right? Now do your job!\" At this point, I still had yet to see a doctor myself, but I still took my kiddo in to the pediatrician, who immediately diagnosed her with Pertussis B, which isn't covered by the vaccine (which only covered Pertussis A). She gave her antibiotics and an inhaler, and she recovered in about 4 more weeks. She looked at me, and said, \"Let me guess, you've been sick, too?\" When I nodded, she sighed sadly (I couldn't tell at the time if she was judging me or if she felt bad for me) and urged me to get to the doctor so I could get treated too. Because of work conditions and the ex being who he was, I never did get treated and was sick for 16 weeks (from August until mid-December that year). Ever since then, I now have allergen-induced asthma (they say that pertussis doesn't cause asthma, and while that may be so, the timing of my asthma being triggered was a bit conspicuous) and I have a rescue inhaler for when I'm exposed to lilies, certain air fresheners (typically ones with lilies or strawberries, which I'm allergic to), and certain times of the year when dogs come inside after rolling around on the ground in whatever it is they find interesting (it feels like I'm breathing in fiberglas). \n\nPertussis is no joke--in fact (and I'll probably get a lot of flack for saying this), the current virus going around the world right now was a lot easier for me to deal with than pertussis (then again, there were a couple articles that touched on previous pertussis exposure may enable a patient to have milder cases of you-know-what, but nothing was definitive). I was only sick with the current virus for 2 weeks, with lasting effects for a couple weeks last August/September (not counting taste and smell--those are still ongoing in spurts), and I had it again end of May this year, and was only sick for 5 days with no lasting symptoms afterward. I'd rather go through that than experience pertussis again (though, ymmv, as everyone is different).",
            "No kidding.  Pertussis can last for 3 months (90 days) if untreated.  The treatment is appropriate antibiotics.  I know this from personal experience because I came down with pertussis and did cough for 3 months.  The only reason I finally got treated was that my mom was bothered by the sound of my coughing.  Never mind if I was miserable.  My coughing bothered HER.  So anyways, I was finally taken to see the doctor.  The doctor read my mom the riot act, and again, it was all about HER.  You see, she was mortified that the doctor had scolded her.  Never mind me.  Antibiotics and a short course of codeine cleared things up.\n\nI had been given the old (1960's) pertussis vaccine, which was notorious for not working.",

Next time I was sick I just sat through class coughing and she asked if I wanted to go to the nurses."

At the time I was making 10.50 an hour. Our general manager made a promotion where any cashiers hired got paid 11.25 an hour. So I go talk to my manager like hey, can I get that raise. He said no, it is only for new hires. Well after about 2 weeks I got fed up being the only one who knew how to run the registers because I was really the only one with experience. I was training employees who were making more than me. I asked again to be on the same level of the people I am training. I realized that the promotion ended in about a month so I talked with my parents about my plan.\n\nI waited until I knew that he was going to struggle because of people already asking off. I went in to my shift, and I told my manager I quit. Here is my time card, here is the keys (I helped close once or twice), and here is my vest. He said woah wait lets talk about this, I said no and walked straight out. I enjoyed the weekend off and hung out with friends more often than I normally did, didnt work at all that week and on Friday (a week and a day later) I went on the website and applied again. I was called in for an interview, with my former manager. He seemed relieved and arrogant that I was coming back but at the end of the interview I asked, \"Since I am a new hire I get the new hire bonus pay right? and also, Janice (the only other lady who I liked) gave me her referral code so I get that as well right? I could tell he was very unhappy but I did end up getting both.\n\nI missed 3 days of work but ended up making more from the referral bonus ($250) and got myself a .75 raise.\n\n\\*Edit: Someone gifted me a gold medal anonymously and I just wanted to say thank you!

Ten minute later they had 3 sold out theaters to clean, 2 untrained rookies, and no support. We were still in the parking lot, got our raise, and went back to work.",
            "Reminds me of a time when my manager's hands were tied. The only way (or at least the easiest way) to give me a raise was for me to quit for a week or two and then he was able to hire me at a new rate. Looking back he was a pretty decent manager.",

HR came back and said no because it was for the level of employees below me and not for my level. I went to the union and fought back and forth for 2 months and nothing. \n\nJust two weeks ago I put in my request to self demote and a bump in pay because I qualified for it as the lower level (great logic, right?) I signed the paperwork to demote on the next pay period. \n\nA few days later HR came back to me and said they would like me to stay in my supervisor position and they\u2019ll push through my pay increase for more than everyone else.

And now that we are close to the busiest time pf the year starting pretty much now we were told no new hires would be coming to help during the christmas because apparently it's too much of a trouble. We would be relying on rent workers (is there a real term for that?) who also know nothing and by making constant mistakes make our jobs so much more harder. Annoying. \nIt's already so hard and we have almost no space to move in the storage cause of all the stuff coming in because of the independence day. And Christmas is going to be even worse according to my coworkers.\n\nJesus the only good thing in that place is our coworkers, they are absolutely amazing. And it's not even a small store.

Like you, i found out several new people were being paid more than me including people I trained and who werent to great of workers in my opinion.   I just straight up said I quit and said when my last day would be, didn't explain or tell her why.  Part of why i didn't say anything was because I did avoid confrontation back then, but a lot was bc I felt so undervalued that I just wanted to be done. \n\nA similar thing happened at my last job, but I just told them if I don't get paid more than them then I'm done, and explained why I deserved to be paid more including work ethic and attendance.   I did get that. \n\nI dont get why its so hard for employers to do and understand why it's the better way to do it.  One of the longest jobs I had was at a taco place (not taco bell) and they would actually go into the system and look at what people were making and adjust people's pay if they realized someone deserved more or was there longer than another.

When initially hired by my company the agreement was I would get paid for every hour I worked, usually 40 hours a week when at the home site, up to 80+ hours per week when at the customer's location.  No overtime, just straight time as my position is \"exempt\".  While on-site I would also be paid MI&E (Lodging expenses, Mileage expenses, and Meal & Incidental Expenses) to include rental car. MI&E can add up to a couple thousand a week in places like Hawaii, Japan or England.\n\nFlash forward a few years and the company has been bought and merged a couple of times and the new company decides that exempt employees are now salary and will not pay for any hours over 40 plus of course no discussion of negotiating a new rate due to the change in working conditions. This reduces my annual compensation by over 20K per year as I would be at a customer's site for 4-6 months a year.  I walk into the bosses office to discuss, he says nothing to discuss.\n\nNext time I am planning for a site, the plan is for me and my team to work 40 hours a week meaning an additional 3 weeks on site, neither the customer nor my boss were happy.  The additional three weeks added over 50K in MI&E to the estimate because it isn't just me that does the work and the total number of chargeable hours is the same if we are on site 4 weeks or 7 weeks.\n\nSorry, if you only pay me for 40 hours I only work 40 hours.  A couple of VPs were quickly brought into the conversation and the new policy was quickly modified, when at a customer site we now get paid for every hour we work.",

Despite them leaving early *every friday*, they complained that occasionally we leave early. Despite more often than not staying late.

            "> This reduces my annual compensation by over 20K per year  \n\nGoogle for 'constructive dismissal'.  Shrinking your compensation without your agreement can be taken as firing, and you can collect unemployment for it.  \n\nThink about it.  To make an extreme example--  I hire you as an engineer with an agreed rate of say $80/hr.  I then decide I don't want you anymore but I don't want to fire you, so I reduce your pay to the federal minimum wage of $7.25/hr and never schedule you for any jobs, I then sit back and wait for you to quit, which you of course will.  That's great for me- I never have to fire anyone and pay unemployment, I just shrink their pay to near-zero.  \nThus, constructive dismissal is a thing.  If I did that, you can argue that you're effectively fired, and collect unemployment.  Same thing often applies if your compensation is reduced.",

In WA it is kind of expected to work 50+ hours as a salaried manager. I get grief from my peers all the time. Sure I will work over 40 hours in a week sometimes but I'm not staying on site for 10 hours a day just because that's what people expect. If you want me to stay for 50 hours pay me for 50 hours.

            "I worked for a company a few years ago that decided to put us all onto the on call rota. They also had a rule that the first hour of work if you were called was out of \"expected hours as required\" because we got a standby payment. OK, that's fine, we used remote access to fix issues so my on call hours were at home so I would look at the issue, figure out what was wrong and then spent an hour drinking coffee and watching the world go by before hitting the keys to fix the problem. Didn't care that incident managers were screaming, not going to pay me for an hour, I'm not gong to work for you in that hour. Simple.\n\nThe other aspect I brought tot he table was the EU Working Time Directive. Now this was a clever piece of legislation and to those in the UK who voted Brexit, you're going to miss this one big time. The rule was simple you must have an unbroken break of 11 hours between shifts and you must have an uninterrupted rest period of 24 hours in a week or 48 hours over 2 weeks. You could choose to opt out of this if you wished, but I made sure my contract was explicit when we were forced into the on-call situation. I was very definitely NOT opting out.\n\nThings ran quite well for the first few cycles of on-call. I didn't get called. Then came the first call out. I got home from work at 7pm after finishing at 5:30. My phone rang at 8:30pm and it was a fault on a database server. I did some digging, identified the problem had my coffee, watched a little TV and then fixed the issue. The job was closed out at 11:00pm. I went to bed and the phone rang again at 3:00am. Another issue, so I got up, looked at the issue, made a coffee, read for a while, fixed the issue and closed out the job at 5:30am. I went into the overtime system and booked in 90 minutes overtime for the 8:30 to 11:00 call (2.5 hours minus the hour I had to do for free) and 2.5 hours for the early hours call because you only get the first hour of the on-call session for free. I headed back to bed.\n\nAt 9:30 my phone rang. It was my boss. \"Where are you, we have an important meeting\"\n\n\"I will be in at 4:30 this afternoon\" I said. \"I have to have my break\".\n\nHe went off at the deep end and I just said I will see you later and put the phone down. \n\nWhen I arrived at work I was met by the boss and a representative from HR. He handed me a letter suspending me. I looked at the rep from HR and asked \"Do you really want to do this?\", they responded that yes, I had failed to turn up for work without excuse. My response was OK, that's fine. Let me call my union legal representative, meanwhile I suggest you check my contract and you check the Working Time Directive regarding legal obligations for breaks and then you pull my timesheets for yesterday showing my unbroken 11 hours break commenced at 5:30 this morning owing tot he mandatory overtime I was forced to carry out, then we can schedule a meeting. It's fair to say their face drained of colour. \n\nI pushed this all the way and a few weeks of paid gardening leave later we went to a formal meeting with the HR director where the legal team from the union tied them up in knots right down to challenging the legal status of not paying for an hour of mandatory overtime where staff were called out. The company caved in pretty quickly and overturned the suspension, this didn't go down well with the boos and he made some comment about \"how can I run this department and keep costs down while troublemakers like this insist on using the law to their own advantage?\". I asked what action was going to be taken about the boss and they were \"Oh I'm sure this is a learning experience we can all move on\" and other such platitudes. \n\nMistake number 2.  \n\nI handed in my resignation with a claim for constructive dismissal because I was sure the boss was going to make my life hell from that point onwards. He had make a statement in front of my legal representative and in a meeting where minutes were being taken calling me a troublemaker. Yes I did have this ready to go as I was pretty sure this was the way the meeting was going to go. The boss was a fragile ego and tried everything to cut corners. It ended up costing the company 3 months pay in lieu of notice and another 4 months pay in compensation for unfair dismissal. I moved on to a much better job, have no on call to suffer and my previous employers are legally bound not to provide a negative reference if anyone looks back over my employment history.\n\nThere is a moral to this; join a union, they will fight for your rights all the way.",

Something to do with not being a \"team player\", is sometimes how it is put.  The general argument that gets used is that they support you during slow times so you can pony up when push time comes. That is a valid view in some situations (certainly not all), where slack time is fairly frequent and press time is sporadic. The profit from the overtime supports your employ when you have make-do work for periods of the year.  Places where hourly staff gets furloughed or short weeks if the work is slack.  They keep salary because the time is sort of banked already.\n \nIt seems to me that, in most cases, your on-site work ought to be billable hours though, so the company would be getting paid for your time, and you ought to be paid for it as well.  They are probably charging 2.5-3x your unit wage, all the more reason you ought to get a slice.",

            "Unless you are specialised consultant or doing jobs where the employer is benefitted if you work longer hours (eg.fast food restaurants) why would they pay you on an hourly basis ??\n\nI can see how this is going to end. The new VPs or the board will come up with a revised salary structure (about slightly higher than what is the existing compensation )\n\nFor eg. Assume you get paid $10 per hour, so for an 8 hour shift you would be technically paid $10 x 8x 20 = $1600 per month.  (20 working days in a month with 4 weeks) add another $400 for the mileage expenses and traveling allowances and you make $2000 per month.\n\n\nNow when they  move to a salary based structure- they would ideally be paying  you say 10% higher - so yeah your base salary will now be $1600 + $160= 1760. But expect some reduction in the expense allowances, but still you would make say $2100 as opposed to $2000 earlier.\n\nNow here is where things get tricky. Since you are now paid on a monthly basis and not on hourly basis your working hours will shoot up, you could be asked (not often) to shoulder some additional burden especially if someone from your team is unwell or sick or on leave and also expected to be more available for work calls. They may also take a longer time to fill positions that are vacant. Effectively for a 5% bump in pay, you are going to work maybe 9 hours a day which makes it a total of 12.5% increment in working hours. You would, in most situations,  be getting the shorter end of the stick. \n\nNow is it bad, not exactly. Its a great system if you are able to work harder because that will get you promoted faster. The downside, if you are in your 40s , its gonna be little difficult to compete with the younger guys. \n\nBut yeah that's how things are probably gonna end up in your company. It could be even worse, but you always have an option of leaving. Their company, their rules and employees  don't get dictate terms.\n\nAs for the reasons the company is doing a overhaul of the existing structure,  my guess is that the new bosses want to show \"improvements in reduction of labour expenditure\" or pretty simple, someone's fucking the existing system and misusing the trust the company has, for their personal gain, thereby spoiling the party for everyone else.",

        "selftext": "This happened about 15 years ago. Relatively early in my career as a web developer/software engineer, so some details are not remembered precisely. Names changed etc. Tldr at the bottom.\n\nAnyway, I thought I had landed a dream job at a small media company that had gone all-in on digital media and marketing a few years prior and had started to land some big clients (think NHS etc\u2026).\n\nThe team comprised of two owners, we will call them Jeff and Nige. Jeff was the lighthearted, approachable and more tech-oriented member of this double act. Nige was the straight man, less approachable, and less likely to join us in any social antics but ultimately a seemingly decent guy and the main driver of the business. \n\nIn addition, there was an office manager, James, who was also Nige\u2019s other half and Rachel, an office assistant and a good friend of Nige.\n\nThe rest of the workforce made up the media team which comprised of a senior and a junior designer, a senior and junior dev and me (another senior dev).\n\nWhat made this a dream job for me at the time? Well, on top of the fact they were doing some great work with what was, at the time, cutting edge technology, it was an overall great place to be. Flexible working hours, lots of holidays and lots of social events.\n\nTo give you a better idea, most lunchtimes Jeff and the media team would all go out for lunch together, or play a FIFA tournament, go to the pub to mob on a new idea etc. Most importantly for this story, every Friday we would all finish an hour early, at 4 pm instead of 5 pm, and head to the pub and have a couple (or more) drinks together.\n\nIt was a very open place to work at the time and the two owners were clear on how they expected the business to expand and our future positions within such an expanded company. Basically, all the guff any potential employer peddles when you interview but we were actually doing it and living it. \n\nThey were receptive to new ideas or different ways of doing things, and regularly included us in sales meetings and we could see the direction the company was going in. Everybody who worked there was excited and I honestly thought I\u2019d be there for the rest of my career.\n\nThings, however, change.\n\nAs time went on the company became more successful, and with more success came more recognition, more clients, more money, and greed.\n\nI won\u2019t go into too much detail, but by the time of the main event in this story a couple of years after starting there, this once open and relaxed workplace had become hell.\n\nThere were no longer flexible hours, you had to be in at 8.50 am to get ready at your machine and you didn\u2019t power down until 5 pm at the earliest unless you had been asked to stay late to churn out more work (unpaid).\n\nNo more lunchtime socials, there was a lunchtime rota that stated who could go for lunch and when, so we could no longer take lunch together.\n\nDespite the ever-growing workload of more complex and larger websites, no new members were added to the team. Even when the other lead dev left, no replacement was found. On top of this, despite the growing workload and shortening deadlines, promises of raises and bonuses never came to fruition, which was especially galling when coupled with the fact both owners were by now getting a new car every 6 months.\n\nNigel also made it clear that with the success of the company as it was, his plan was to sell it at the ripe age of 45 (I think) and semi-retire to a life of travel writing and photography (despite being mediocre at both), without a second thought for the rest of us.\n\nThe business was now being run in a manner that allowed the owners to line their pockets with as much cash as possible whilst also making it look like a good takeover prospect.\n\nThe only perk that remained was the 4 pm Friday finish which by this time, instead of all going for a drink together, we just went home early. \n\nMorale was low.\n\nOne Friday afternoon, Nigel, Jeff and James went to visit a prospective client. Rachel was off for some reason which left nobody in charge of the office. \n\nExpecting the usual early finish everybody had completed their work by 4 pm, but having not received any word from the owners, we hung on. At around 4.50 pm and with nothing else to do we collectively decided to \u201cfuck it\u201d, lock up and go home.\n\nApparently, at about 4.51 pm Nige had tried to call the office, probably to tell us to go home, but of course, we had already left. Monday morning, every one of us was called into the main office, given a bollocking and told that a planned upcoming social was now cancelled (it probably already was anyway, but why not use it as a punishment) and that our wages were going to be docked for leaving early.\n\nNow, here in the UK, it is naughty to make deductions from a salary unless it is for some legally mandated reason, e.g. taxes, national insurance, student loan etc. or unless the employee has given explicit written permission so I didn\u2019t think this last threat would actually happen.\n\nI didn\u2019t have to wait long to find out as we were paid weekly, but sure enough, that Friday, there was a deduction from my wages as well as everybody else on the media team.\n\nI approached the owners about it, but I was basically given the same speech as on Monday morning previous.\n\nLaw has been a particular interest of mine, still is, and whilst I\u2019m no lawyer nor any kind of expert, I know enough to stand up for myself and those around me, and so, with the backing of the rest of the media team I sent what may be considered a \u201cNotice Before Action\u201d just prior to leaving on Friday.\n\nThat NBA being a formally worded email to both owners stating my grievance, the illegal deduction from salary, and my proposed resolution, the repayment of the deducted salary in our next wage along with a formal apology to everybody on the team. Failure would mean the engagement of legal services.\n\nOn Monday morning the owners arrived late and instead of Nige\u2019s customary visit to the media room to ask how we were\\* (\\*make sure we were slaving away) they both retreated directly to their office and shut the door. \n\nThis was shortly followed by an email to us all stating that due to my \u201cthreat\u201d and after taking legal advice they had been told to cease direct communication with any of us until the matter was resolved. The resolution they wanted now being a full apology by me to them and the agreement that salary should remain deducted. Any communication should be via email.\n\nNow, I\u2019m reasonably sure they hadn\u2019t had any legal advice on the matter, or if they had, it was shit. \n\nFirstly, a decent solicitor would have told them they were idiots for doing what they did and to give the money back and apologise. Secondly, because the entire point of a Notice Before Action is to try and find a resolution prior to taking any legal action, in closing up shop in this manner they are practically forcing a legal engagement.\n\nMy belief is that they were simply calling my bluff, and didn\u2019t believe I would take this any further. They reinforced this by adding to their email that any further communication about the deduction from our wages would need to come from my legal representation.\n\nI, of course, was not bluffing and complied with their request.\n\nWhat they didn\u2019t know was that a member of my family was not only educated in employment law, albeit not an actual solicitor, but also a union representative at another company, so by the end of the day a legally drafted letter arrived on the owner\u2019s desks laying out the illegalities of what had happened as well as the expected timeline of events going forward.\n\nWithin 30 days (I think) we were to have had a formal meeting between the owners and myself, with me entitled to legal representation present in that meeting, and with the expectation that my demands in the NBA were to be met as they had no defence.\n\nShould that not occur, this would be going to a tribunal or maybe even full court with the company liable for expenses. It was a slam dunk, so they would end up with a relatively hefty bill.\n\nInstead of folding, as I expected them to do, this led to them doubling down on their stupidity. Their door was permanently shut with very little direct communication between the whole media team and the owners, with it mostly being done by email, or via Rachel and James.\n\nAt this point, Rachel and James, who were obviously on good terms with Nige became openly hostile toward me. For a small example, Rachel would make everybody in the office a coffee in the morning, now it was everybody except me.\n\nSeemingly, neither the owners nor Rachel and James seemed to know or understand that I had the full backing of the rest of the team. \n\nThey didn\u2019t have the know-how or the will to fight it themselves, but they were aware of the downhill direction in the working environment and that my actions were preventing the owners from further taking the piss in the future. Now the environment had become exceptionally toxic and nobody wanted to be there. \n\nThey, and I, started actively looking for different employment.\n\nIf I remember correctly, an extension was requested and granted but the deadline for the aforementioned meeting came and went so my representative sent another formal letter to my employers stating that we would be going to tribunal. \n\nIt also now stated that I would be leaving the company immediately and I would be claiming \u201cConstructive Dismissal\u201d due to the actions of the owners, James and Rachel which had all been logged over the previous weeks. \n\nThe only result of the extension they requested being an extra few weeks of workplace bullying logged.\n\nReceiving all this was the last straw and their resolve was broken. An apology was sent via email along with the promise that the money would be returned in our next paycheque.\n\nI\u2019d had enough however and I immediately handed in my notice which I believe was 4 weeks. I hadn\u2019t found another job, but I had decided to move to the city anyway and go freelance.\n\nBefore my notice period ended, the junior designer also handed her notice in, also to go freelance, and within a few months of me leaving the junior dev and the senior designer had done the same.\n\nThe business owned by Jeff and Nige was essentially dead, with many of their existing clients seeking us out to continue doing work for them on a freelance basis.\n\nI learned that Jeff and Nige eventually had a falling out, with Jeff resigning as a director and becoming CTO at another tech company. \n\nNige renamed and rebranded the old company and attempted to carry on somehow but to this day the examples of work on their web page are still the ones we made 15 years ago. Most of them aren\u2019t actually his clients anymore or are defunct. \n\nI also later learned, as we had all suspected, that Jeff wanted nothing to do with the wage deductions etc. Although I\u2019m not sure how hard he fought against it.\n\nAlthough I\u2019ve not physically met them since the day I left, I am connected to everyone in the media team and they are all doing well. Jeff also reached out a few years later and he is doing well too.\n\nAs for Nige, James and Rachel, I have no idea. Rachel was close to retirement anyway, so I guess she was reasonably fine. \n\nLooking at the public details of the businesses Nige now owns it\u2019s clear that none of them makes any money and his travel and photography blogs stopped being updated a few years ago. Nige\u2019s (and James as his partner) plans to retire early and travel the world are probably now permanently on hold. As is his penchant for a new car every few months.\n\nAnd the amount deducted from our wage over which Nige lost his business and planned future for?\n\n\u00a36.80p\n\nTldr; Owner illegally makes deductions to my salary and insists on only discussing it via legal representation, so I get legal representation and he loses his business and dreams.",

            "In the US it is also (super) illegal to deduct anything from anyone's paycheck without prior written *consent*, the obvious exception being any and all state and federal taxes. You have to sign up for and agree to health insurance, 401k retirement deductions, and the like.\n\nYou can, however, make deductions from salaried employees pay for no-shows (call outs, unpaid sick leave, unpaid vacation, etc), as long as it is a company *policy* and the employee was notified beforehand. Typically you have to have a record of them having notice of said policy (as in their signature saying that they read the policy). That becomes their *consent* (meaning they agreed) to have the money deducted because they knew it would be if they missed work. But, yes, here too. You canNOT take money from anyone's pay for any reason whatsoever if they didn't agree to it in writing first. That's, like, the first thing they teach you when doing payroll. I'm surprised they gave you any blowback about that at all. Especially if those were your agreed upon hours. Way to stand your ground, dude. Well played.",
            "The first rule of owning a business, never, EVER, tamper with an employee\u2019s wages. The legalities vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but without doubt, it ALWAYS instills district and acrimony towards the employer. \n\nMy employees received the majority of billable compensation, while my own compensation was a small ($5) management fee for every billable hour. If I wanted to increase my compensation, I could increase billable hours, either through additional workload, not my first choice, or by increasing the staffing level... but my compensation was no secret and if increased workload became necessary, which happened from time to time, the employees generating the increased billable hours benefitted directly the most.",

A relaxed environment that really focused on making sure employees were happy and relaxed so they could do their best work.  Flexible working hours, various lunch get togethers, fridays were days when they'd bring in kegs and let people have a couple drink at the end of the day, and they threw some of the most outrageous holiday parties.  Open bar, live music, great food, raffles for TVs/iPads etc.  The company was making money and everyone enjoyed working there.\n\nThen suddenly there was talk of them getting bought out.  They had to go corporate so the owners could sell off, make their money, and get out.  No more relaxed environment, no more flexible hours, no more booze, no more parties.  Suddenly it was 9-5 with no exceptions unless you had explicit reasons.  Work was crammed down everyone's throats to increase profitability and make the company look as good as possible for a sale.  The products were oversold to new customers and under supported, everyone was running at %500 utilization on case work, etc.  The place became hell.\n\nOnce they sold things eased a bit, yeah the new owners weren't as nice as the old ones in the beginning but they came in and provided much needed support and a more relaxed atmosphere (if still with a larger corporate mindset).  Ultimately a lot of toxic management was shitcanned by the new owners and things are ok now.",
