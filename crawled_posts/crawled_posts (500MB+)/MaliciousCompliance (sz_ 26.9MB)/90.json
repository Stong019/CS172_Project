I live in the east bay and need to cross the Bay Bridge to get to work.  \n\nWe had an important presentation scheduled today.  I wanted to do it \u201cvirtual\u201d because the APEC meeting is in SF this week and everything seems disrupted.  President Biden and Chinese President Xi are here.  It\u2019s a 2 hour commute on a typical day and I told my boss it might not be feasible to come in this week.\n\nHe insisted I come in, so I said OK but don\u2019t blame me if I get stuck in traffic.   We had a pretty heated discussion about it.\n\nSo today there\u2019s a huge backup on every freeway toward the Bay Bridge because protesters have chained themselves across all 5 lanes.  The bridge is completely closed.  \n\nNow the boss wants me to do the presentation \u201cvirtual\u201d but I told him I can\u2019t, I\u2019m stuck in traffic.  I can\u2019t operate my vehicle and do the presentation.   You will have to do it without me (but he isn\u2019t really qualified).",

        "selftext": "TLDR at bottom. Been sitting on this story for a few months now. I work for a small moving company in my city. We move furniture and decor to many different places throughout the city. \n\nWe got a call about moving a large load of bookshelves to a rather large industrial building. We loaded up two 18 foot box trucks full of shelves and were ready to move. When we arrived at the building, we pulled around to the loading dock and began off loading the shelves. \n\nAs we were bringing stuff off the truck, I went to building security to open the door. (There had been a recent string of shootings in our area and everyone was locking all the doors.) They handed me a door stop and told me I could prop the door open since we have a large load. So I propped open the door and we got going. \n\nWe no more had the first pallet off the truck when the building\u2019s maintenance manager came running towards us. He screamed at us \u201cWHAT ARE YOU DOING?! YOU CANNOT HAVE THAT DOOR PROPPED OPEN!!!\u201d Now this man looked like he was somewhere between the ages of 76 and 105. He was as red as I\u2019ve ever seen anyone. I calmy told him that security gave me a doorstop and told me since we have such a large load, we could keep the door propped open. Of course, he wasn\u2019t having it. \u201cI DON\u2019T CARE WHAT SECURITY TOLD YOU, YOU CANNOT HAVE THIS DOOR PROPPED OPEN!!\u201d \n\nAt this point, my Native American temper got the better of me. I replied \u201cYes sir!\u201d I walked over to the door and picked up the doorstop. I walked back to security and explained the situation. They rolled their eyes and explained that this crotchety old fossil is always causing problems all over the building. They told me I could still prop open the door but now I was mad and was feeling petty. He doesn\u2019t want us to prop the door open? Alrighty then. \n\nThere was a buzzer outside of the door so I buzzed security asking them if they could open the door. Well guess who\u2019s office was right by said door and thus guess who security called to open the door and let us in? That\u2019s right, fossil man that was two days older than dirt.\n\nHe opened the door and let us in. We made our delivery and came back to grab another pallet. I again buzzed security and they again asked fossil man to let us in. This happened twice more before he stopped me and said \u201cYou know if you wanted to keep that door open, you can since you have such a big load.\u201d I replied with the biggest smile on my face \u201cOh no sir, this door cannot be propped open. I wouldn\u2019t want to upset anyone by doing that.\u201d He looked at me with a look on his face that was somewhere between murderous and the realization that he had made a huge mistake. \n\n18 pallets later, we had the load delivered. And every single time, guess who had to let us in? It took us a little over 2 hours to get everything finished. The last pallet we delivered, I poked my head into fossil man\u2019s office and said \u201cThank you so much for your help.\u201d I\u2019m pretty sure he popped a blood vessel. \n\nTLDR: Crochety old fart tells me I can\u2019t prop open a door, alright then you\u2019ll open it for me more than 20 times.\n\nEdit: since SOOOO many people want to pick apart the smallest details of this story, the loading doors were basically a giant set of French doors. The building was built way back in the 60\u2019s and wasn\u2019t designed with a modern garage style loading door.",

        "selftext": "First time poster here, and my story happened bout 10 years ago. TL;DR at the end.\n\nI work in an office and, at the time, I was the new guy who only worked part-time, taking shifts here and there when needed. I could do pretty much anything, and did it well, but often had to ask around for extra shifts to make ends meet.\n\nOne day, our supervisor went on short term disability leave after an accident, and an assistant, lets call her Brenda, took over the job, which included the scheduling duties. Brenda was easily overwhelmed, and we believe that she was too proud to admit that she needed help. She had to plan the schedule for 5 teams, and I'd often tell her that I'd be available for more shifts to cover X or Y, as the slots were clearly empty. She was always pretty dismissive, and most times I'd end up not working more. People tried to work around her mishaps, so there was never any direct impact on the overall production.\n\nOne time, I noticed that a lone position on the weekend (that nobody wants to do when that person lady was sick/away), was not being backfilled, even though it was essential to have someone in that chair. Hoping for extra shifts, I sent Brenda a casual email to bring to her attention the fact that the shift was not filled, and if she had plans for that yet. Her response was an extra long email on work ethics and respect for my colleagues' time, that I'm new here and I should learn my place, to stop begging for extra shifts all the time, and that she had nothing else for me that week. Duly noted, ma'am.\n\nCue MC: my last day at the office that week was Wednesday, and I knew that the shift had still not been filled. When I left, I wished everyone a nice weekend, including Brenda, \"See you next week!\". It's important to mention that I was on-call. They couldn't just put me on the schedule and expect me to show up. They'd have to confirm with me beforehand.\n\nI got many many calls on Saturday, about 30 minutes after the beginning of that shift that was not being covered, asking where I was, why I wasn't in, that error alerts were being sent ALL OVER THE COUNTRY because nobody was there to do the job. I told the weekend manager that I was out of town, as I wasn't on the schedule when I left on Wednesday. They'd need to take it up with Brenda.\n\nMonday morning, I was called in a senior manager's office. I was told that they were giving me a written warning, because I didn't show up to work that weekend and it caused a lot of trouble for other managers. I pulled the email thread, and was able to prove that I warned Brenda that a shift was not being filled, that I would be available if needed, but that Brenda made it clear she didn't need me. They then checked the log to see when the schedule was last changed, and yup, Friday afternoon, long after I was gone. I made it clear that she made no attempt to try to contact me. The senior manager apologised, and I was able to return to work.\n\nI don't believe Brenda was specifically punished (as we're all allowed mistakes. It happens.) but she was eventually demoted. She retired probably a year after the incident. I ended up being promoted to full-time shortly after, and as it turns out, 10 years later, I'm now office supervisor, doing a much better job at managing schedules!\n\n**TL;DR** A supervisor dismissed my warning that an essential shift on the weekend was not being covered, and scolded me for always begging for more shifts. I stopped asking, left for the weekend and let them deal with the shit show that would inevitably happen. And happen it did. Manager tried to pin it on me, but I had the emails to prove it.\n\nEdit to add info I've mentioned in the comments: \n\n1. For the \"On-call\" portion. Our union works in a way that if you're not a permanent employee, they have to call and book you. The schedule is posted ten days in advance, and they let us know in advance the days they'd need us. Sure there were emergencies and sick days, but some of the part-time people have more than one job, and couldn't be expected to be available for a call 24/7. If they needed me, they had to notify me that I was being added to the schedule, otherwise I'd organise my time accordingly and they'd run the risk of me not being available. Which is pretty much what happened.\n2. I don't know if Brenda was disciplined, those records are confidential. It's very possible, which might be why she ended up being demoted, but our union has very stiff rules about how to go about it. There's a process to \"improve employee performance\" if they're not good at their job. Only at the end of that process can people be demoted. I know now that it's a gruelling process that has to be thoroughly documented. Managers couldn't simply fire her.\n3. I still believe that Brenda was not maliciously trying target me, but rather she was not competent enough to fulfil her new responsibilities, and got defensive when the new guy pointed out flaws in her work. She blew up at that, and forgot the valid point that I was trying to make. The way I see it, she realised too late that she messed up, and \"fixed\" it the way she knew how. After all, when she left, the schedule was clean, even if one crucial step was not completed. So yes, she was inefficient, and other colleagues regularly had to clean up her mess. That time it was me.",

I'd check it daily to make sure, and up until the last day I was working that week, I was scheduled off that day.\n\n\nWell, like you, I'd be doing something on that off day, and I'd get called, asking where I was, that I was supposed to be working from 8 AM (when the store opened) to 5 PM.  I asked when was the schedule changed.  They'd say last night before closing.  I asked exactly when.  They'd say something like 6 or 7 PM.  Well, that's odd, because when I checked the schedule when I left yesterday at FIVE O'CLOCK, it said I was still off.  They asked if I could come in.  I really needed the hours, but I said I couldn't, I was in the middle of something I can't break away from.  That \"something\" might have been watching TV, playing some game, or washing dishes.

            "Kind of the same thing happened to me.  I work per diem (technically not full time or part time.  I pick up shifts when I can and am first to be asked when someone calls in sick, needs an upcoming vacation, etc).  I\u2019m required to pick up 16hrs a month but I usually work that plus more a week.  I prefer to work overnight shifts and saw that an upcoming Sunday had a shift open (score!  Overnight differential, plus weekend differential = $6+ more an hour).  I emailed my boss letting her know that I could work.  She responded that I\u2019ve been picking up too many shifts and am close to going over the weekly 40hrs, which would put me into overtime.  She said that *other coworker* had asked to work it and since she has seniority, she was giving it to her.  I was kind of ticked off because *other coworker* ALWAYS calls in sick and when she actually does comes in for her shifts, she\u2019s extremely lazy and does the bare minimum.  Fast forward to that Sunday and sure enough, my phone started blowing up.  She called out sick for a shift she had just picked up!!  I didn\u2019t answer any of the calls or texts and went to bed.  I called my supervisor the next day, telling her that I was already asleep when she tried reaching me.  She explained that she ended up calling 7 other people and no one could come in last minute so she had to work it!!  Bahahahaha.  Apparently it was a super busy night and it was extremely hectic for her.  I told her she wouldn\u2019t have had this problem had she initially given me the shift.",

            "Similar happened to me when I worked at a burger place with a yellow jumpsuited clown.  I had gotten a vacation weekend approved and put on the  schedule.  When I got back, the shift leader was wondering why I was there.  She thought I had quit since I didn't come I  on Saturday.  The scheduler had remade the schedule after I left on my last day before my vacation and put me on for the weekend.  It got worked out I  the end though.",

        "selftext": "Long time lurker, happy to have my own story to share. TLDR at bottom.\n\nBit of backstory: I work as a machine operator in a factory type setting. I'm responsible for 2 lines of moving product with the fairly simple job of keeping the machines running and basic quality control. I've held my current position for 3 years, and frankly most weeks I spend more time with these machines than my wife. I know when something isn't right. Our engineering department doesn't always agree. \n\n2 days ago one of my two machines begins making a clanking sound. I give it a quick once over, seems like 2 metal parts are slapping together, probably just a loose bolt. I grab a radio and call for an engineer. Oh great, its one of the newer ones fresh out of school. He listens to it run for a few minutes. ,\n\nHim: \"It's running fine. Why did you call me out here?\" \nMe: \"Don't you hear that noise?\"\nHim: \"It's fine. It always sounds like that.\" \n\nHe makes a note in his log and leaves. The machine is still operational and my shift ends in 20 minutes so I let it go. The next day I come in for my shift and it's still making the same noise. I ask the previous shift's operator about it. They repeat a similar story with the same engineer. 3 hours into my shift the noise has gone from occasional to near constant. I call for an engineer to come check it out again. Our newest engineer comes down.\n\nHim: \"What's wrong this time?\"\nMe: \"You seriously don't hear that? Can you just give it a quick check?\"\nHim \"You guys need to stop calling us down here for this. Look at it, it's running fine.\"\n\nHe makes another note in his log and walks off. 4 hours later the clanging has gotten louder and the machine is beginning to jostle with each impact. Concerned I again call for an engineer. This time he doesn't even bother inspecting the machine. \n\nHim: \"Damnit Kingler, I told you, it's fine. Don't call us back down here unless it breaks.\" \n\nCue compliance. I run it as is for the rest of my shift. The noise and movement of the machine growing worse the entire time. I check it every other hour, hasn't broken yet. I inform the relief shift of what's going on and go home. \n\nI come in today and the noise is nearly deafening and the entire product line is shaking with the strength of the impacts. The previous shift informs me that the engineering department still hasn't looked at it. I stop the machine and give it a quick look. Still not broken. I run it as is. 10 hours into my shift and we are suddenly bombarded by a symphony of metallic noises and screeches. Half of the machine is now on the floor, while the other half gyrates wildly as it attempts to continue. I press the emergency stop and make the call. He begins to complain before he even makes it to my lines.\n\nHim: \"Listen damnit I told you......... WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO TO THE MACHINE KINGLER\"\nMe: \"It broke.\" \n\nFor the last 2 hours of my shift I enjoyed the luxury of only having to focus on one of my product lines and the blissful noises of our good friend being royally chewed by his boss as an entire engineer crew is now attempting to salvage the machine. When I clocked out it was still lying in ruins.\n\nTLDR: Engineer refuses to inspect unusual sounds coming from machine. Machine eventually destroys itself in a marvelous way.\n\nEdit: Wow this blew up. Currently reading comments, I'll try to address some of the more common questions in a comment below.\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for the gold kind stranger!\n\nUpdate: As expected there was no significant fallout. I came in this morning and the machine was operational again. According to the operator I relieved it was down for a total of 6 hours. No one lost their job and the company didn't lose any significant amount of money. (Probably. I don't actually know how expensive the replacement parts were but considering the speed they had it back up they likely had some on hand.)",

            "\"Why didn't you go over his head?\" : I could have, I have before when I thought an issue was a safety concern . In this case, I was not expecting a mechanical failure of that magnitude. I was expecting a bolt to go flying and a part to fall off, well, I was half right. His own attitude combined with the fact that I'm not held responsible for mechanical faults led to the compliance. Honestly though, breaking the chain of command always carries a bit of risk with it. If I had went over his head and then no fault was ever found it can lead to some real problems down the road. \n\n\"What was the fallout?\": No Idea, I'm currently home relaxing in my off time. I go back in tomorrow morning, if anything significant happens I may do an update. Most likely: Nothing. They will eventually get it put back together and running again. I won't be blamed for it in any way. Jr will be given a talking too, and one of the more experienced guys will likely shadow him on calls for a while to make sure we don't get a repeat.  If we're lucky he'll learn from it and listen the next time. If not, I may have more stories to share in the future. \n\n\"Floor worker Good; Engineer Bad\" : Not always. We have a small handful of experienced men and women who actually take the time to listen to us and it makes a world of difference. These are the people we call for on the radio by name when serious faults happen and we can trust them to do their best to keep our machines running or get it back off the ground in record time.  On the opposite side of the scale, we have several operators in the building who, in my opinion, should never have been put into the position they are in. Constantly failing to do basic setups and calling for assistance for basic everyday problems that they aught to know and be able to fix themselves. I'd honestly place more blame on this kind of situation on them than the engineers. They get so used to being called for stupid bullshit that when an actual problem shows up, they don't believe it. Basic boy who cried wolf scenario. If you work on a line, learn from your maintenance and engineer crews. I've even picked up a few tricks from our janitorial staff. If you ask a question odds are that they'll show you how to fix something yourself so they don't have to keep answering calls for the same problems.   \n\nEngineer vs Mechanic vs Machinist : At my place of work there's no clear distinction.

They know all the tips and tricks and best ways to do it even if it isn't the official SOP.\n\nUnfortunately it seems I am on the minority end of thinking this way. Many young engineers seem to think they are hot shit as soon as they get their first job and looking to show it and they seem to get that attitude from the old engineers. Where I had my internship there was a very obvious disdain between the floor guys and the engineers. I had to video tape the guys doing their stuff and the first couple months they really didn't like me, but how I interacted with the guys the news spread that I was eager to learn from them so they relaxed when I came around.

The company\u2019s insurance for the machine or even the whole facility almost certainly has a condition/clause that requires the company to only operate machines that are in full working order, to ensure employee safety. So basically through negligence that engineer voided the company\u2019s insurance! That is probably the reason management chewed him out.\n\nNormally, local & national (federal) laws and insurers demand scheduled and unscheduled preventive maintenance, and in some industries they also demand a CMMS (computerized maintenance management system) to record that maintenance. So that engineer probably also caused the company to break the law by not performing unscheduled preventive maintenance. Another good reason to get chewed out.\n\nTLDR: That engineer probably voided your company\u2019s insurance and caused a breach of law.",

They do their checks every morning before handing over to operations, so if they say it's fine, it's fine. I'm covered. I stopped calling them every day and made sure I made a note of it in my \"shutdown remarks\", at end of day. Pretty much a handover back to engineering with any concerns. This continued for another week. \n\nOne morning I come in, I go to get my paperwork and keys for the ride only to be told \"you won't be on that one today, it's going to be out of action for at least two weeks.\".

There is this one particular shirt we get all the time that has a diagonal closure, so the left side of the chest is essentially covered by a huge flap coming from the right side. There is such little room on the left side that any logo bigger than an inch looks like it\u2019s going into the persons armpit. After a few complaints, we made it policy to only allow that shirt to put logos on the right.\n\nA big company we work with likes to make massive orders with generalized embroidery placement (ex. 10 different types of garments, all embroidered with a logo on the left chest). Whenever I would see that this particular shirt was in the mix, I would reach out to them to let them know we needed to switch the logo to the right side.\n\nOne (difficult) manager from that company reached out to their client with my suggestion, and got an earful because the client insisted that their logo could ONLY be placed on the left, due to company policy. Instead of smoothing it over with her client, this rep took it out on me. She sent me a very aggressive email stating that we were perfectly capable of embroidering this shirt on the left side because we had done it in the past, and to STOP blowing up her inbox with our \u201csuggestions for a better embroidery location.\u201d From now on, whatever embroidery location the order requests is FINAL.\n\nI saved the email and got my boss\u2019s blessing to immediately stop all quality control emails for this company, \u201cper *manager*\u201d\n\nOne day a HUGE order comes in, ALL diagonal-closure shirts, ALL left side embroidery. I maliciously complied and sent the order on its way, with no hassle to the manager. \n\nA week later an executive from that company emails me, horrified. He forwarded photos of the clients shirts, all with the logos in the armpits. He said they were having to refund the client over 10k and that the client was in an uproar, never wanting to order shirts from them again! Why did we NOT tell them this was a bad location for the embroidery?!\n\nI didn\u2019t say a word, simply forwarded the email the manager sent me, telling me verbatim that I was to no longer waste the company\u2019s time making useless suggestions  for those shirts :)\n\nEditing to add fallout: It was confirmed they had to do a big fat refund and I did not see a re-order, so I suspect the client dismissed them as a vendor (was a huge client, think a very swanky hotel brand, we don\u2019t usually get emails from the executives so I think they were really hoping for big bucks with these guys, oh well). As far as manager goes, I suspect she was demoted. They sent us a VERY polite, groveling email introducing a new manager, and requesting that we resume our quality control, emphasizing that we knew best!\n\nOne more edit to add photo, I can\u2019t post the real one for privacy reasons but I found an example blouse that has a similar ratio as the mentioned shirt, so that you guys have an idea:\nhttps://www.overstock.com/Clothing-Shoes/2019-New-Irregular-Diagonal-Collar-Long-Sleeve-Blouse-Shirt/31150817/product.html",

They\u2019d find it and update the quality sheets we use for recording data. The biggest thing they did? Checked incoming parts against the latest released version to make sure they were in spec. \n\nTo this day, we still have issues occasionally because we just receive parts in and the only thing the replacement quality person they hired does is badly update the documents for us to record data - I usually update my departments myself because I got tired of fixing their fuck ups. They still fuck up the other departments so it doesn\u2019t go unnoticed. \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate, to because sometimes we\u2019ll have riveted or welded a whole orders worth of parts then when we go to function it at the end find out somethings binding or colliding because the supplier sent an old revision of parts from an earlier CAD and no one verified the parts until after the damage is done.

            "I guess it's way off-topic, but all this discussion of embroidering shirts reminded me of an idea for a business that I had back around 1985.  Cast your mind back to that era.  Skiing had just really taken off because women could finally buy flattering ski wear.  Snow was reliable in the major ski centers.  Many newbies, especially young urban professional singles, took up skiing -- and the after-ski partying -- for social reasons as much as anything.\n\nNow you're out there on the slopes for a few hours, impressing the ladies.  You go back to the hostel and change and hit the bar -- and nobody knows that that they were admiring taking the moguls on the black-diamond trails.   You're just one more nobody at the bar, and only by bragging about your day (which no one wants to hear) can you re-instill the ardor you \"deserve.\"\n\nEnter my idea, based upon that of the knights in shining armor.  Same problem (different audience).  On the battlefield, encased in armor, nobody knows you. Solution:  A coat of arms.  Your unique logo that lets everybody know who you are, how important you are, and what ransom will be paid if you're captured by the enemy.  (If you're a nobody prisoner, they'll just kill you and be done with you.)\n\nSolution:  Coordinated ski clothing, casual clothing and evening wear all emblazoned with your personal, distinctive \"coat of arms\".  The business would have employed artists to design such unique logos.  It would have contracted embroidery of custom ski wear, jackets, ties, etc.  Mufflers and watch caps could be knit with the logo or a close proximity thereof, or woolen caps and mufflers could be embroidered with them.  For the ladies, there's be scarves and other feminine items all emblazoned with their logos.  Now after a day on the slopes showing off, you could walk into the bar and be *recognized!*\n\nMy problem was that I had a full-time career with no time for a side business and no relevant experience contracting out such work.  I tried getting others interested in the idea but never quite convinced anyone.  Too bad.  The era is past.  Snows are disappearing.  Opportunity missed.",

It's just how I was raised so I'm fine with it.\n\nSooooo one day I make some homemade ice cream. I'm loving its texture, its flavor, its everything! Husband walks by and sees me eating, so he says, \"I'll have some ice cream\" then sits his ass down in the living room.\n\nHE WAS RIGHT FUDGING THERE!!!\n\nI was pissed!! He was so lazy he wanted me to serve him when he already has to walk past the kitchen, where I stood eating right out of the container like the fatass I am, to get to the living room.\n\nCue malicious compliance.\n\nI grab a bowl and fill it up. I call out, \"You want toppings?\"\n\nHe yells back, \"Hell yeah I want toppings!\" (He's not being mean, he's just excited)\n\nI'm preparing this bowl of ice cream with everything he loves: chocolate syrup, caramel drizzle, homemade whipped cream, maraschino cherry, crushed up peanuts, hell, even a sliced up banana to turn it into an amazing banana split!\n\nAfter loading up the huge bowl of ice cream, I get two spoons and put one in the bowl. On the other one, I add a tiny piece of banana, tiny bit of ice cream and a touch of all the toppings (except the cherry).\n\nI walk over to him and he's rearranging his gaming stuff, preparing to take the bowl from my hands. His eyes are glowing with joy at the sight of my beautiful creation and he's got a smile a mile long.\n\nI sit in my chair, hug the bowl and pass him the spoon of ice cream.\n\nThe look on his face was well worth my efforts! He was so sad for like a second before he broke into a fit of laughter. He acknowledged he was being lazy, thanked me for making ice cream in the first place, then got up and fixed himself a bowl.\n\nWe still laugh about it months later and he goes out of his way to serve me more often now :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Edit\\* Thanks so much for the support for my marriage! I'm really happy my story was so well received. Also, thank you to the kind strangers for the gold & silver!  \n\n\nFor those of you who asked, the ice cream I made was vanilla bean and I used the following recipe.

He gets his own the rest of the time, so it irked me that he suddenly felt so entitled.",

        "selftext": "Sorry for formatting, I really don\u2019t know what that means. So I\u2019m now the owner of a landscaping business that my father started. He retired last year. He still checks in and helps a lot on the business end of things until I get my footing. We work in a city in south Florida, and about 95 percent of our customers are above the age of 60. My dad has 3 clients that we charge at a very low rate because they\u2019ve used him since the start of the business. 2 out of the three are great. They understand that they\u2019re being charged a low rate and love us for it. But we have one lady that is very hard to deal with. My dad refuses to let go of her contract without a legitimate reason, That\u2019s just who my dad is. she has 2 daughters and they both own homes with their husbands. We get a call from this lady asking us to take on her daughters. I told her if she would like to give them our number I can talk with them and get it figured out. I was going this as a favor to my dad really because adding the two extra properties right now stretches us pretty thin and I\u2019ll probably have to help out as well as my cousin who basically manages the crews. Anyone will tell you expanding with a landscaping company is not as easy as it seems and it\u2019s bordering along the impossible without proper planning. So one of the two daughters call in and give me their details and I told them I could come out and meet them and give them an estimate as soon as possible. That was met with a few seconds of silence. And followed by \n\n\nDaughter:uh my mom had told me about the rate she paid, and we were under the assumption that we\u2019d being paying those same rates. \nMe: unfortunately we won\u2019t be able to do that ma\u2019am. we give her a special discount for being with us for so long. \nDaughter: ma\u2019am is my mom and I\u2019m sure she won\u2019t be happy to hear about this. \nMe:okie dokie \nHer: click! \nAnd after yelling click she hung up the phone. (Not seriously just a joke)\nSo I don\u2019t think anything of it, tell my pops what happened. We had a laugh about it and how entitled the people where we live are. Late that night I get the call from the crazy lady.\nMe: ellooo\nHer: Let me explain something to you. We have a way of doing things in this town and you just broke rule one. The customer is always right. You told me you would take on my daughters and I expect you to do just that. \nMe: I told your daughters I could take them on but not at the same rate. I never said I would be charging the same rate. \nHer: yes you absolutely did and I expect you to hold to your word like your father would. He would be so disappointed in you right now. \n(I\u2019m guessing she didn\u2019t know my did still took part in the business because he avoids her at all costs) \nMe:ok ma\u2019am I\u2019ll see what I can do. \nHer: you better. This is just not how you do business\nMe: ok \n\nI went to my dad and told him about it. He told me to end her contract. I told him i had a better idea. And he agreed to it. Now I say contract but it\u2019s just a monthly billing for her contract. Due to it being so low. So I call her back the next day. \nHer: hello\nMe:ellllooooo there mrs (insert old hags name) it\u2019s me ____ your landscaping company calling you back. \nHer: I hope you have some good news because I still feel slighted.\nMe: oh I have some news we will be giving your daughters the same rate as you as you insisted. \nHer: perfect. When can I tell them you\u2019ll be over. \nMe: we\u2019ll get to that but we have to discuss your new rates first. \nHer: what new rates? I didn\u2019t agree to new rates. \nMe: oh well you requested to pay the same amount as your daughters so we\u2019ve taken away the special discount we\u2019ve given you and your new rate will be 800 a month. That will start in 2 months from now. \n\nWhat came after was incoherent screaming and her hanging up. She called back the next day but refused to talk with me. She tried talking with my cousin but he referred her to me. She tried getting ahold of my dad but he shut off his work cell long ago. She eventually calls back and tried to negotiate with me but I told her it was all at her request and too late to go back on it. She dropped us the next month. She had been a thorn in my dads side for so long. He was relieved when I told him about the call. He didn\u2019t want me to have the extra stress of dealing with her anyway.\n\n\nEdit: this is a little of topic but This is for those of you upcoming entrepreneurs out there. It\u2019s very easy and satisfying to tell someone to go fuck themselves, but my dad lived by a set of business rules that his dad taught him. My mom saw \u201cDexter\u201d now refers to him as  Dexter because of his fanatical obsession with these rules. \n\nRule number 1 is very simple but huge. Don\u2019t ever give someone a reason to hate you. It\u2019ll serve to bolster your pride and can only hurt you in the future. \n\nAnd two: \"Don't ever, for any reason, do anything, to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what, no matter where, or who, or who you are with, or where you are going, or where you've been, ever, for any reason whatsoever.\"",

A lots been going on with my parents even outside this post, so I really needed to get out and not be around it. Thank you so much to all of the amazing commenters and your incredible advice, it means so much to me. \n\n\nThis malicious act of compliance is still ongoing. For some context, I\u2019m a university student who\u2019s living on my parents couch for the next 2 weeks before I move back into my school\u2019s town. They are currently redoing their pool, with employees working M-F. I pay my own rent at a room near my university, so I signed up for a clinical trial to take off the added burden of paying for my expensive medicine while getting some grocery money at the same time. \n\n\nI had an appointment early this morning for the trial, and I told my mom about it last night. She immediately disapproved, stating that she didn\u2019t want me to be a \u201cguinea pig\u201d for money. \n\nSo she woke up before me and took my car out so I couldn\u2019t drive it. The only other car in the driveway is her big ass truck, which I\u2019m uncomfortable driving but will if I have to, so I called her and told her that because she took my car, I\u2019ll be driving her truck to the appointment instead. \n\nShe of course flipped her lid and screamed at me about being a sell out (y\u2019all I\u2019m just trying to get some grocery money here!!). My mom also made it clear that she has her own plans and won\u2019t be back with my car until later today. She then ended the call saying that I am, in no circumstances, allowed to drive her car. \n\nFine. Whatever. I rescheduled my appointment and went back to the couch to try to sleep, when the pool workers showed up. \n\nThey have a huge concrete truck that can only be used when the driveway is empty, but my mom\u2019s car is of course plopped in the middle of it. So they can\u2019t start working until my mom\u2019s truck is moved out of the driveway, and with no one else home this means that I\u2019m the only one who can do it. \n\nOh, except for the fact that I am in no circumstances allowed to drive her car. \n\nWhoops.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m a 21 year old female",

Clearly you can\u2019t trust her. Tell her a lie, like you\u2019re going to a drs check up since you\u2019re home or seeing a friend or meeting someone in your desired career field. Then drive there. Research public transportation as a back up. Turn your phone off so she can\u2019t track you and pray she hasn\u2019t put a tracker in your car. If she asks where the money came from, lie again. Do not spend it in front of her or in ways that make it obvious. DO NOT LIST HER AS YOUR EMERGENCY CONTACT. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t know how much rent you are paying to sleep on the couch, but unless it\u2019s literally like less than a quarter of the cost of renting something for a month, I would consider other options.

If your brother or parents eat groceries you pay for, I hope that will not be held against you, and I\u2019m seriously concerned they might not feed you... \n\nHugs and love and finally: your sense of humor about all this is so much better than most would be.

Part of this was faking being a supervisor so the actual supervisors don't have to be verbally abused. Garbage system I know but what can you do. \n\nWell I get a call from a front line person telling me this guy (Lets call him Kyle) has asked to speak to someone about his 3 rental properties. I take the call and get on the phone with the guy.\n\nMe: \"Hi there, thanks for choosing \\*corporate drone speak intensifies\\*\"\n\nKyle: \"yeah you said that I wouldn't have to pay for long distance on these 3 accounts.\"\n\nMe: \"Oh well let me go have a look at the notes on the accounts and...\"\n\nKyle: \"NO YOU WILL CANCEL MY SERVICES AT ALL THREE PLACES\"\n\nMe: \"I just need to look at the notes written on your account to...\"\n\nKyle: \"NO YOU WON'T IF THIS IS THE SERVICE YOU ARE PROVIDING JUST CANCEL THEM ALL\"\n\nBegin Malicious compliance, I need to make sure he is in fact the guy who can cancel these services at all 3 accounts, I ask him when he would like the services to stop. \n\nKyle: \"WHY ARE YOU STILL ASKING ME THINGS, IMMEDIATELY\"\n\nMe: \"Ok sir, I just want to make sure you are asking to me cancel all services, phone, cable, and internet?\"\n\nKyle \"\\*series of swears\\* YES ALL THREE SERVICES AT ALL THREE PLACES\"\n\nNow I should point out that it was pretty close to midnight, and these places being rental properties on a Friday night probably had people living there. Also it didn't seem that he lived at any one of them. So I went about going through each of the three accounts and shut down the services, the phone, the cable and the internet. \n\nNow before anyone says oh you took their phone away that's dangerous! Well you can plug a phone outlet into anywhere and even if it doesn't have service you can still call emergency services. \n\nI went through and told the system to shut everything down, it also gives us the option to immediately stop the services from working. So I told it yes. Now this meant that everything stops at the properties at once. \n\nEverything, immediately. Watching TV, not anymore, looking at memes? NOPE. Oh where you making a phone call? NOT ANYMORE.\n\nI can only imagine the series of panicky texts and cell phone calls that guy had that evening because everything was shut off. \n\nThe next time I was at work, I checked the notes on these closed accounts only to find that the tenants had called in and were told the services were cancelled. Followed by notes from an actual supervisor, because if you get loud enough the real supes have to do their job, that said after reviewing the call Kyle had with me they felt I did exactly what the customer had asked and there was nothing else we would do. Turns out Kyle was mad at me for following his directions and then got his tenants to call him enraged after midnight about how nothing they had was working.",

But, I could never grasp how people get pissed off at the customer service rep on the other end of the phone line. 1st of all, they are just doing their job. 2nd, they don't really have much say in what happens as far as your service goes. My Mom is the worst when it comes to dealing with customer service reps. Somehow, she usually manages to get whatever it is she is after(probably because she has years and years woth same companies with no late/missed payments ever), but I would cringe sometimes listening to her talking to them. Like, seriously Mom, the person you are talking to doesn't really give two shits if you take your business to blah blah other company. Actually, they would probably gladly welcome it, so they don't have to continue talking to you.",

I asked her if I can speak to her husband to get his permission to talk to her and it went on nicely until she insisted that we waive the late fee on the account. Sure, I can do that but if the account has been charged late fees every month despite other agents telling them when their due date is every time they call and what options they have available to avoid paying those pesky late fees. I would have waived the late fee too if only she was being polite to me but no, she went full on Karen on me. Bitch even had the audacity to demand to cancel the account, an account that does not even belong to her! So I asked her once again to pass the phone to her husband to get his approval to cancel the account. Explained to him that his wife wants to cancel his account, he said yes, then BOOM. Karen and her spineless husband were so mad that they asked to speak to a supervisor who then proceeded to take the call from me. A few hours later I went back to their account to see what happened and their account is still closed. The notes say they want their account reopened but at the time it will take three business days to reopen a recently closed account so they're gonna have to wait. The call was placed on a Friday and during the nice part of our conversation before they went ape shit they mentioned they were planning to take a trip somewhere that weekend and they are planning to use the husband's credit card so they were calling to have the late fee ($30 at the time) waived so they can use that $30 on their trip. I really hope that trip as cancelled. :-)",

Be nice to me and I will 100% do everything within my power to help you and try to save you money.  Demand I do something and not be willing to help me help you by refusing to give me even basic information like your name or the issue you're calling about, you're going to be very frustrated. \n\nAs a customer, I always try to be polite. I just spent 3 days without internet on a single device that I have to have for work. I reached out after doing extensive troubleshooting with my company's IT person to about 4 hours to run through everything. Work IT did everything short of coming to my house to troubleshoot equipment and my home connection. \n\nWe were able to determine the problem the first day. My work computer which is directly connected to the modem stopped connecting to the internet out of the blue. Ok, did the basic troubleshooting including changing cables and swapping ports just to be safe.  Work IT team was able to determine my DNS lookup was failing and a simple modem swap should fix the issue. We even confirmed it by hooking up to another coworkers service in another unit in my complex with the same company and with another ISP in yet another location across town. Covering all bases basically. \n\nContact ISP, explain what the issue is and because this one device is the only one not working in my entire house, it stands to reason that my work equipment is at fault and they can't help me.  Kept transferring me back and forth between tech help and customer care team, after 2 hours the call dropped. I was emotional at this point but it was late and just before 5 so I waited until they opened the next morning. Apologized if I react irrationally upfront, explained issue all over again, providing exact examples of what we found and steps taken to troubleshoot.  Again, issue is with my computer and nothing to do with them, nothing we can do to help you. \n\nThird day, I'm upset, my company is upset because I'm not able to work from home as they need me to. I again call, again apologize in advance and this agent listened to me, understood what I was asking for and why but explained that it would be 10 business days before a new modem could be shipped to me. \n\nNo local office or even within 200 miles where I could exchange my rented modem. There's all kind of offices in the area but all customer accessible stores have been closed due to pandemic so not sure why on 10 days before they can ship. There's literally an office 1 mile from my house that techs are based out of as I found out on my last service call which was an upgrade visit. \n\nShe said I could purchase one of the 3 they were willing to support, again 10 days to ship or find one locally in another store. Willing to consider this option I let her know I'd see what I could find out and get back if I wanted to have one shipped.  I checked around and no stores carry those models. I could get them on ebay but it's just as long of a wait so no relief there.\n\nI ended up going to another ISP in the area as same day self installation was available. Using the exact same cabling and just by swapping out the modem, my internet on the work computer was back up and running. So be canceling service Monday with original ISP because of their refusal to work with me for the first 2 days.\n\nIf you made it this far, thank you for reading.",

I believe this happened around 5 years ago. \n\nAs mentioned, she ran a day care business out of her home, and since her child had autism, and she had all the skills an equipment to handle special needs children, she opened her home to other children with similar needs. As you can imagine, this service is incredibly hard for parents to find. \n\nAround five years ago, the state and local governments were on a bit of a kick to revamp the rules and regulations that affected in home day care providers. Most were innocuous and weren\u2019t that big of a deal, like having a redundancy built into the HVAC system so that temps in the house could never drop below 63\u00b0 and that water systems need to always be operable, and other such human needs based rules. But others were major issues that it seemed like like \u2018common sense\u2019 rules, but it was obviously not thought through past the initial feel good fuzzies they brought. \n\nThis is were the MC begins. The county passed a new rule stating that in home daycare providers may not allow any person to enter their home that they themselves had not run a background check on. Again, sounds reasonable and was meant to protect the children. That is, until one day when the main toilet in their home started overflowing and needed immediate attention from a plumber to save the rest of the surrounding area from water damage. \n\nBut remember those new regulations? She couldn\u2019t turn off the water, because the new regulations that required at least one operating toilet (they were remodeling their second bathroom) so legally couldn\u2019t turn it off. She called a plumber, but legally couldn\u2019t allow him to enter the premise without running a background check herself. \n\nObviously, she ignored these rules to save the kids and her home from damage. But word got back to to the regulatory body and she ended up with a \u201csurprise inspection\u201d later that week, where they wanted to inspect the bathroom and cite her for her violations. \n\nBut when the county inspector showed up at the door and asked to come in to inspect the house. She stated that she would need to run a background check on the inspector prior to entry and closed the door in the inspectors face. \n\nThe rules were amended later that month (edit:) to exempt the regulatory body from the background check requirements.\n\n",
