        "selftext": "Back when I was in college, I lived in a 2-bedroom apartment with a nice German student. \n\nHe was a nice guy, and he would often have his friends over. I didn\u2019t mind it at all because I just moved to the are and needed new friends anyways. \n\nOur landlady though, she was a nightmare. She was this small grumpy lady who would complain over the smallest things. She doesn\u2019t live with us, but tries to control everything - the color of our sheets, the scent of candles that we light, where we put our stuffs, etc. Needless to say, we hated her.\n\nWe pay for our electricity and water, so it doesn\u2019t matter if we have our friends / family stay over once in a while because whatever they consumer more of we will foot the bill ourselves anyways. \n\nMy sister visits me once a month for one night, just whenever she\u2019s in town. One day, my landlord found out and got so mad she wanted to call the cops on us for not respecting the rule of \u201cguests cannot spend the night\u201d at her property. \n\nThe only reason she does this is because she feels if a guest would stay a night they would have to pay her the full rent for the month. THE MONTH. \n\nBut que malicious compliance...\n\nWhen one of my German roommate\u2019s friends was laid off from his main job, he was left homeless with only a grave shift part-time job. He asked if he could stay with us for about a week or two. I told him I didn\u2019t mind but my landlady might mind. They told me not to worry. \n\nAnd she was fuming when she found out (easily, the day after he decided to stay with us because she checks on us unannounced every other day, and has security cameras outside our door). She threatened to call the cops on us again, and all my roommate said was:\n\n\u201cBut you told us explicitly no one can spend the NIGHT at your property. He is never here at night because he\u2019s working, so there\u2019s no rule broken here.\u201d \n\nShe had nothing to say and left. We could hear her screaming from inside her car that was parked right outside.\n\n\nEdit: I had to pull my copy of the contract out, and we didn\u2019t have a specific clause on overnight guests, nor do we have a clause on visits. It did say at the end though that whatever isn\u2019t explicitly stated, when questioned, will pivot on California state laws. So this was totally illegal. My roommate and I were just young, stupid international students who let her get away with it. But it definitely makes for a fun story though.",

            "Man I know what you mean about crazy landladies. \n\nMy **first** landlady was a \"Reverend\" (she wasn't), who asked me if I was into *satanism* before I moved in. (Should've been a red flag but rent ain't normally **that** cheap where I was moving). \n\nHere are some tidbits about my time with her:\n\n1. she was extremely racist. Didn't like asians, mexicans, or blacks. (She was, herself, black.)\n\n2. She accused me of trying to make her son's plane crash with voodoo because I was stupid enough to ask her who was the person in the picture nailed up outside my bedroom\n\n3. She did a 2 hour sermon to her living room every day. This was the only time it was safe to leave your room as she wouldn't stop for **anything**, but would glare at you the entire time you walked by. \n\n4. She accused me of satanist-feng shui-buddah crap on **NIGHT ONE** because of how I arranged my groceries in the pantry. \n\nhaha, fun times, I hope never to see Mad Margaret ever again.",
            "Qu\u00e9?",
            "I had a previous landlady who would pull the same crap. I was in an apartment complex and would often have a friend who was transitioning at the time from female to male that stopped by and hung out with me and my daughter. She had a service animal that she would bring with her when she visited us. Her visits were usually only a few hours at most and then she would leave again. Never stayed the night. While she was visiting, my daughter would walk her dog for potty breaks.  \nMy old land lady started playing 20 questions with me about if my \"friend\" stayed the night *hinthint* and how we couldn't have the dog over without paying a pet deposit and how she was going to raise our water/sewer bill which was based on occupancy if we kept having any guests.  \nI pretty much pulled out the lease, printed out regulations in regards to service animals and went to her office to legal her to death. She dropped it after that.",
            "I'm dealing with a b-tchy landlord now. I live in a RV park and when we first moved in we were informed that rent (all included) would be $400. In two years we were never late, never a problem, and even made things for our Land Lady (Becky). Now fast forward to April 1st, and I am told rent went up to $450, for May? Is this my 30 day notice?, nope for April. Now this news was dropped on me not by Becky but by Tiffany. I told Tiffany that the law requires they give me 30 days notice and she yells at me\n\n\"I taped it to your door\" \n\n\"where is the proof?\"\n\n\"What do you want? For me to take a picture? If you dont like it then get out!\"\n\nSo stupidly I paid the extra $50 but she got an earful about her behavior. After that Tiffany would call my husband about things and not me. Which is stupid because he is a truck driver and never home. Now I get a letter on the door saying they are postponing the rent increase until June and I will be credited the $50. \n\nWhen I do pay the rent in May, I will be showing her how a contract/changes to contracts is suppose to go.",

            "> ...because she checks on us unannounced every other day...\n\nI can't imagine that's legal in California. Do landlords not have to give reasonable notice before entering the property (e.g., 24 hours), unless it's an emergency?",
            "Where I live, the place you rent is essentially yours. The name on the ownership may be the landlords, but while you pay rent, it\u2019s considered your house. The landlord cannot just come over without notice and can be removed if the renter so desires. Damage deposits are illegal and are referred to in the bylaws as \u201cKeymoney\u201d. I\u2019ve had to use that clause a couple of times. Also, pets cannot be used as a reason not to rent to you. \n\nLooking into your rights under the laws in your area is a great idea and helps protect you from unscrupulous landlords.",

There are advantages and disadvantages to both but I'd rather rent from someone who doesn't care about much except that the rent is paid and who understands basic laws like \"24 hour notice\".       \n\n\nOne time we were renting a house and the land-lady's husband showed up unannounced and cut down a tree in the back yard without ANY prior warning or discussion.  My wife found out when she walked out of the shower and into the bedroom and saw him standing (back toward her) in the back yard!!!     \n\n\nI had a chat with the land lady and explained \"Yes, it's your tree and you have the right to cut it down but you just can't come onto the property without 24 hours notice.\"  I did go on to say that I'm pretty relaxed and if they did want to come on with less notice I'd be reasonable.    I did think about it later and it's possible they could have been completely wrong to cut down the tree in a couple of ways.",

I was only staying there for two months and didn\u2019t feel like unpacking all my stuff so I had some boxes stacked neatly in my bedroom. One time she came in to tell me she was going to be showing the apartment in a couple hours. My sisters had spent the night and we were in the process of cleaning up after breakfast. She says to me, \u201cGet this place cleaned up and NO RELATIVES!\u201d Then left in a huff. Like, we were literally washing dishes, and this is my place, I pay rent, I can have people over? Pretty sure now she was breaking laws.",
            "It still boggles my mind that people are so clueless about their rights.\n\nAs long as you're paying rent/the contract is running, it's YOUR home, not hers. You only have to let her in for valid reasons (showing the apartment to new tenants after you gave your notice/shortly before the contract is up ; repairs ; emergencies) and all of that only WITH notice (unless it's an emergency, of course). She isn't even allowed to own a key to your apartment.\n\nCameras only MIGHT be allowed on the outside of the house, not in the stairwell.\n\nAnd she can't make many demands on HOW you're living either. Just the basics like \u201cdon't destroy the property\u201c and \u201cdon't do something that severely disturbs other tenants constantly\u201c (e.g. charcoal grilling on a balcony, no big/loud/dangerous animals/only specific groups of people as tenants - seniors, students, no kids...).",

U/PaleFlyer, you have 30 seconds to hand him a trash can.\"\n\nNever had an issue.  Especially since I proved it ~3 times a year.\n\nNo one ever actually figured it out, ran me through allergy meds, eventually got tired of it in 8th grade, got tested, mildly allergic to hickory tree pollen.  Got off the meds.  Haven't had more than a 24 hour bug since.  (Excluding a 48 at my second man job, because I was overworked, over stressed, and took crap care of my body because I was working crazy hours.)",

            "I experienced almost the same thing in first grade \n\nWe were playing some game around our desks and I got back near my desk and just made a big ole barf puddle on the floor",
            "Ha, I had a similar thing happen to me in 2nd grade. Teacher was strict about nobody getting up from their desk and she already didn't like me for some unknown reason. Teacher was out of the room, instructed us to stay seated, and I started to get tunnel vision/overproduction of saliva, the tell-tale signs of the ol' stomach geyser.\n\nI did what any logical 2nd grader would do. Sat in my seat, threw my hand up in the air to ask the non-present teacher if I could go to the bathroom, and proceeded to spew the contents of my stomach all over the desk in front of me.\n\nGood times!",
            "Similar story from 3rd grade.. kept me at school all day until I collapsed in pain and threw up everywhere. My appendix nearly burst. Good times.",
            "Similar story but I didnt get to actually maliciously comply. Sophomore year of highschool, study hall. I ask to go to the bathroom, teacher asks if I have my passbook, I say no, she says I can't go. I wait 5 mins, ask again and get the same answer. This time I just leave and go to the bathroom. When I come back I get the earful, I told you you cant go blah blah. \"Okay. Next time I'll poop in your trash can.\" Teacher doesn't reply. The next day before class she pulls me aside and apologizes. Idk if she actually felt bad about it or if she just knew I was the type of person that would actually poop in her trash can if given the opportunity lol",
            "I witnessed this exact story I swear. Mrs. Laughry\u2019s (loughry? It\u2019s been years) class?",
            "I did something similar, also in 1st grade, we were told we'd fail a test if we got up, so I threw up on my desk, no one else threw up, but the other kids were horrified",
            "I had a story like this where I repeatedly asked to leave and my teacher kept saying no because she didn't believe me. After a while my teacher froze in the middle of speaking because she saw how pale I was and asked \"are you actually sick?\" as if my answer would change. She then yelled at me to go to the bathroom. \n\nI get up and start puking as soon as I'm through the door. I tried to hold my mouth shut but it kept coming out so I literally left a trail of puke down a 100 meter corridor.",
            "Now that\u2019s what I call a chain reaction",
            "Did you have a stomach condition or anxiety?",
            "The same happened to me in year 3. The teacher wouldn't believe me when I told her I was sick all day - weirdly enough, because I had never faked being sick up to that point.\n\nI made it almost to the end of the day, I think I was within an hour of finishing school when I couldn't hold it back any longer, I projectile vomited on my desk and the boy in front of me.",
            "Same thing happened to me as a 1st grader. My mom have me a bologna sandwhich on the driest bread known to man, and forgot to pack me a drink. So I didn\u2019t want to eat it. The 8th grader, I forget what they are called. Lunch monitor? Student supervisor? Babysitters? Whatever, forced me to eat it. I told her I can\u2019t withhout a drink. So instead of either telling me I didn\u2019t have to eat it, or giving me a drink, she forced me to eat that dry ass sandwhich. So I made sure when I threw up it was all on her. I got to go home and she cried as I yelled I \u201ctold you!\u201d At her. She stopped being our lunch person after that.",
            "I did this in 3rd grade. I had a stomach ache and was gonna throw up. Told my teacher and she sent me to the nurse except the nurse had an odd shaped therapy chair that's curves so laying on it only makes me throw up more. The nurse told me to just relax. I told her I needed to throw up. Didn't even give me a trash can just sit in the horrible chair and power through it. She walked out the room and I ended up throwing up on the carpet underneath. As soon as I did that my mom arrived to the school and signed me out. I just got out as soon as I can. That was a stressful day",
            "There's still a stain on my parents' living room carpet from a time where they refused to believe that I was about to throw up and felt too sick to get up and run to the bathroom/trash.\n\nAlso in HS there was one instructor who tried to be Daddy Hard-Ass and refused to let students so much as get up to get a tissue and blow their nose. One brave, gross student with allergies  started horking snot directly onto the floor, loudly tried to crumple paper and blow their nose into that, etc. We were allowed to get tissues after that.",
            "What did she say after you told her about being forbidden?",
            "Haha before I saw what subreddit this was from I thought I was about to read a r/nosleep story.",
            "Damn you savage!",
            "\"You told me not to move. Now get to cleaning this up, bitch\"",
            "Similar thing happened to me but i needed to pee. It was the beginning of the day in 3rd grade and we had a bell ringer i had tried to finished but i had to pee SO BAD i couldn\u2019t concentrate. I asked my teacher 3 times and she said no and accused me of procrastinating so i could just get the answers when she went over them. She also told me to stop acting like a little boy because i was holding my crotch. I ended up pissing myself in my chair and she was SOOOOOO nice when my mom came to get me. She apologized so many times. I wish we had sued that bitch.",
            "I had a pe teacher that wouldn't let me go home because there was only half an hour left in that class (this was probably 1st or 3rd grade). I had been out an entire week with stomach issues. It was square dancing day... so when I threw up, it was all over the other 8 people in my group. \n\nHe did get a nice reaming out from my teacher... and then my mom. He was a dick for other reasons too, so I dont really feel bad.",
            "Ha I did this during lunch, we weren\u2019t allowed to leave the lunch room unsupervised. I asked to used to the washroom cuz I was about to be sick. The teacher said no go sit back down and wait for the bell. I projectile vomited all over the floor after waiting two minutes and said well I told you I needed to go to the washroom. So funny. She felt so bad.",
            "In 6th grade, I had a stabbing pain in my stomach. My mom drove me to school and told me if I didn't feel better by lunch to have the nurse call her.\nI didn't feel better by lunch, went to the nurse who took my temperature. No fever. She refused to call my mom. My stomach HURT, I wasn't nauseated, I was in pain. I argued with her to call my mom. She still refused, but said I could lay on one of the cots they had for sick students.\nAbout 30 minutes later I ask to use the restroom. She let me. I went back to the city, sat down. I got a weird feeling in my throat and I got up to go to the restroom again. The nurse told me, \"you just went to the restroom, you need to go lay down!\"\nI went back, sat on the cot, threw up, and called the nurse in. She asked why I didn't go to the bathroom. \"I tried, but you told me to go lay back down.\"\nThey called my mom and I got to go home. I felt 100% better after vomiting, so I had a great rest of my day at home playing N64.",
            "11th grade history teacher was a stickler for raising your hand and waiting to be called on for everything. One day I was feeling nauseous, so I asked I raised my hand and started to ask to go to the nurse. I was stopped and told to wait my turn. A minute later he called on me and I quickly asked to go to the nurse because I wasn\u2019t feeling well. He rolled his eyes, but let me go. I only made it to the trash can before ralphing. 1 other student threw up too and 3 others asked to go to the nurse because they were now feeling nauseous from witnessing it.",
            "I'm actually really bad at realising when I'm sick. I try to muscle through the minor pains and next thing I know I'm rushing to the bathroom in the middle of lunch and toss it all up halfway there and get sent home. teachers watched me closely for the rest of the year after that. good school, wish my secondary school had been as nice.",

            "When i was younger i was really sick in the morning before school. After lunch i was so freezing to the point of shivers and i put my jacket on and a friend let me borrow his and didnt warm me up at all. I threw up all over the nurses office and was picked up by my uncle. The next day at the bus stop my moms friend was like i heard you said u were sick bc you wanted to stay home and i was like no bitch i threw up.",
            "This reminds me of when I was in school in 1st grade. We were told not to leave the computer when we were taking book tests to make sure we read the books. The test I was taking had a lot of questions and half way through I really had to pee. I was afraid of getting in trouble for leaving the computer and I ended up peeing in the chair, finishing my test, and then running to the bathroom. My teacher was super mad at me and my grandmother brought me extra clothes. I wasn't embarrassed, just scared as all hell to get in trouble.",

When her mom came to pick her up she was like when a 6 year old says they have to pee, THEY HAVE TO PEE",

            "I have a similar story from either second or third grade. I could always tell when I was getting sick and going to throw up. I politely raised my hand as the teacher was in front of the class and asked if I could go to the nurse.  She told me I had to wait until the lesson was over even though I told her I was feeling nauseous. I tried to wait but ended up running to the trash can under her desk and throwing up in it. She was so disgusted but finally let me go. I hope she learned a lesson that day.",

Later on there I would be trained on everything else, from shipping, kitting, put away, everything. But I was a perfect fit for that since I LOVED driving order picker. I was especially good at it. \n\nThe bare minimum you had to hit in an 8 hour shift was around 230 boxes pulled, or 230 labels if you want to be precise. Since organization was a strong suit, after a few weeks I was consistently able to hit over 350, then 400, topping out around 425. I always worked and with other people quitting, within a year I was one of the most experienced people in my area. With training new employees, helping on certification of vehicles, and coming in on weekends when work needs to be finished I felt like an asset to the team.\n\nBeing one of the most experienced people over there, I was offered a raise to keep my numbers over 400 daily. Sure, it\u2019s a college job, but if I\u2019m able to get more money by doing my job as well as I usually do it sure! I accept and they said my wage was updated and approved so I got right to work and pulled my end of the deal. A week went by, same paycheck. Another week, same paycheck. Huh? What? I go into my managers office and tell him calmly that my raise didn\u2019t get put into my paycheck. I get told \u201cWe thought about it, and we feel as if it\u2019s within your job responsibilities to be doing what you\u2019re doing, so we will not be giving you a monetary increase.\u201d \n\n\u201c...we feel it\u2019s within your job responsibilities to be doing what you\u2019re doing...\u201d\n\nSo in order to get back, I realize that if they don\u2019t think I deserve a raise then why should I do all of the extra stuff around my work place? Suddenly I dropped my daily quota to the bare minimum. You need me to stay over to help complete orders? Nah I\u2019m going home, my shift ended five minutes ago. Shelves started to become disorganized because I didn\u2019t fix them as I went. Anything small that I would do to help out I stopped doing. Little by little complaints started to file in. From the lowest on the totem pole, working it\u2019s way up slowly.\n\nWith in two weeks I got called back in and was told that i was given the raise and it would be in this weeks paycheck. \n\nEDIT: I QUIT 5 MONTHS AGO, IM\nNOT GETTING BACK PAY\n\nDouble edit: About the disorganized shelves. As people pull parts stuff gets a little disorganized. We had cubbies, technically it was put-aways job to reorganize the shelves but I did it as I went. They never did it cause nobody ever would correct them. I did it cause it made every ones job a little bit easier and it looked better.",

            "Around 2002-2004 I worked for an off-brand cable internet company. Served places like Fargo. I was tech support but basically slumming it after my dot-com network engineer job imploded. I was good at it, like freakishly good. They first thought I was dumping calls but after monitoring me both with and without my knowledge they had me re-write their support methods and processes. \n \nFirst call resolution goes up, across the board. Way up. They still had to take me out of the metrics though because I consistently did 2-3x as much as everyone else per day. IMO people were just not motivated but I did not really care. Shit was getting done.\n \nMy manager retired and they brought in someone from some midlevel position at a local bank and she hires a new group of employees. Some of them get promoted from tech 1 to tech 2 a couple months later. And then another. And some of them get promoted as well. Meanwhile I am still tech 1. \n \nNow I never caused any drama, I just came in and did my job. I sometimes brought twix for everyone. Everyone was surprised that I had still not been promoted to at least lead... but there was a large disconnect between management and staff so it never really went anywhere.\n \nThen they decided to start scheduling me alone at night, since I typically pushed through more calls on my shift than came in on that timeslot and everyone on nightshift was a student and would be leaving soon anyhow. So I pointed out that nightshift needs a tech 2 to authorize dispatching and some other higher level admin functions. \n \nThey give me permission to 'act' as a tech 2. \n \nCouple weeks pass. I dont really mind, the night shift was nice. Then they decide that in addition to clearing all the calls I can run all the maintenance tasks which included physical backups to tape and offsite shipping of those cans. This was lead level stuff, but I had done it before so I was like sure. I did it for a couple weeks then decided that it was time to ask for what I felt I had earned.\n \nMe:\n>Can I get a bump to Lead or at least 2, since this includes a significant increase in responsibility?\n  \nManager:\n>No, you do not need it and besides you have all this down time anyhow.\n \nThe next day hold times were through the roof as my handling time shot way up. Backups did not get made because I was back to back calls all night. Reports were not generated. Other sites were calling the escalation number which paged my manager asking if I was out sick. She naturally called me to make sure I was in. \n \nThings repeated the next night.\n \nAnd the next.\n \nThen friday comes around and she meets me at the start of my shift to ask why my performance has dropped so far below expectations. \n \n> My performance is exactly at expectations for tech 1.\n \nUpset she demanded I do better since everyone knew I was capable of doing better.\n \n> Sure I will do better.\n \nShe expected a fight and left all smug and haughty when she didnt get one, assuming she had got submission out of me.  \n \nBut after that I was only there to empty my desk, I had a new job lined up for Monday. It was not like I was planning to leave suddenly, its just a happy coincidence that a place I wanted to work opened up a spot and brought me in right away. I had planned to work my shift through Sunday and let them know they had a couple days to staff up my spot... But karen decided to be a jackass.\n \nSo I go to my desk and send an email to everyone on the management chain and the local directors letting them know that karen had encouraged me to find a position where I could do better and that she will need to come cover the phones at night that night and the rest of the nights until they hire a couple people to fill that shift. \n \nI heard that they hired three tech 1s and moved a pair of tech 2 into nightshift, as well as karen to do all the management tasks. Then they fired her once one of the 2s learned it all and made him the new lead. \n \nAll I wanted was a bump. And she cost them 6x my pay by not giving it to me. ",

He said when raises come out, I'd be at the top of the range.\n\nRaises come out, it's 2.85%. He said the average raise was 2.5%. While technically he may have been correct/honest, this just didn't sit right with me.

            "I had a similar situation. I worked as a cook in a restaurant. I had no real experience when I started, but I worked hard and tried very hard to learn the ropes.  In my case you started as fry and prep cook, the next step was grilling (steaks, fish, veg, etc). And the final step was sauteeing and basically being the chef's slave. I learned it all and learned it quickly. The problem was the chef was verbally abusive all the time and mean spirited, he always kept us  on our toes. He made us do menial chores on a regular basis. We were overworked and underpaid. Long story short, I began looking for other opportunities and something came up. But, even before I began looking, I decided to work extremely hard, and output more than humanly possible for the average human to put out.  My goal was to leave a gap so large in the work output that they'd have no choice but to need to replace my spot with more than one person. Long story shorter, when I left, the chef stormed out within one week of my leaving. I cost him his job because he himself could not handle the work load I had been undertaking. I eventually became the chef to this restaurant, but the owners were pricks themselves, and then that's another story where I had to stick it to the man. The raises were meager and only upon threat of leaving and they never paid me vacation time as the other workers received them. Later, I learned they hired a significant larger staff for the kitchen, paid them more than I had ever hoped, business went down, and eventually the business got sold.  Funny how thing's go down.",

            "This resonates with me in a very surreal way. I used to work for a very similar sounding company years ago. Honestly, reading this made me wonder if it could have been the same place, but I doubt it.\n\n\nI worked for a third party seller on Amazon. You know when you go buy something on Amazon, there's the \"also available from these sellers\" link? It was one of those sellers. I found the job on Craigslist after I had to drop out of college. After putting in a lot of resumes everywhere and not hearing anything or being straight up told \"there's nothing available\", I decided to check the ol' CL. Found a job offer that sounded really simple. Sounded like typical secreterial stuff. Answering emails, doing business stuff in Excel. That sorta thing. Went to the place for an interview, and let's just say the position available was NOT what was advertised. They basically needed another person to pull and process orders. We did more than just sell stuff on Amazon, it also doubled as a buyback company. All of the warehouse inventory originated from people mailing books and stuff to us, which we'd then grade on quality and list on Amazon using some black magic programs and custom made front end software. The person who sent the books would then be paid by the system automatically based on the quality of the items. I took the job because I didn't have anywhere else to go, and they were eager to hire me. So I did it.\n\nNow...this place SUCKED. The people who I worked with had seen tons of people come and go. Some left after day 1 never to return again. The warehouse had no heating or cooling. And since it was full of books, some interesting thermodynamics would happen. In the winter, it was around 20 degrees cooler inside. In the summer, about 20 degrees hotter. The books basically acted like an insulator. Trapping cold air in during the winter and releasing humidity and moisture in the summer. When it was cold, it was COLD. Four layers of clothes and your still shivering cold. And when it was hot? Fuck me. It'd feel reasonably nice outside, but the instant you walked in you felt like you were right in the thermal wake of a blast furnace.\n\nApart from that, hours were LONG. This didn't bother me until I felt I was not making enough money to make me feel like it was worth it. I'm talking wake up and leave when it's dark and come home when it's dark. 12-16 hour days were commonplace. Weekends too, of course. We had propane heaters to use in the winter but the boss rarely refilled them. Most of the time we'd rotate on who gets to chip in that week to refill the tanks. We had some big monster propane tanks as well as some garage blowers, but we weren't allowed to use them. Those were to keep the label printers warm for shipping. The boss was shitty too. On some levels I think he was a well meaning guy but there were lots of things he did that were contrary to that. Around February we got a lot of snow and ice. Our usual shipping person had to leave to pick up her kids from school, so it was up to me and my other coworker to not only process all the buyback orders, but pull the rest of the shipping orders and process them and get them over to the post office before 2. We had to load up 3 carts, maybe 1500lbs total, and get it all over to the post office. It was right down the sidewalk.\n\nWe were carting the first batch of bags out the warehouse, and it was damn near impossible for us to get it through all the snow. We had to get it maybe 60 feet down the sidewalk. It took us 20 minutes. Our boss came out, and said \"maybe you should shovel this\", then hopped in his massive Escalade and drove off.\n\nAfter getting two of the three carts finally to the receiving deck at the post office, my coworker left to go get the final cart. As I'm loading all the bags in, the postmaster tells me we're too late. It was 2:05. I'm pissed. My coworker was even more pissed after she just moved the last cart over by herself.\n\nWe brought everything back over and informed the boss. Of course, it was all OUR fault. That was when me and her decided it was probably time to find some new work. That was a really hard decision for me to make because I didn't want to leave my co-workers behind to handle all that bullshit without me, but getting a new job was the best thing I've ever done. I put in so much time one week, more than I ever have, and barely broke $1,000 on that check. That was what really did me in. \n\nI still drive by that place every day on my way to my new job (I've been here for 4 years now). I still wonder how many of the original crew is still there...\n\nAnyway whoa this is a huge wall of text. Wasn't expecting to go on that much of a rant.

It was just starting to get warm out and the store didn't have much AC, so I was looking forward to a magical date where certain employees were allowed to switch their pants for shorts.\n\nProblem is that we had a new department manager, I'll call him Dick, who was aggressively chasing a promotion to Assistant Manager, then store manager.

The reason I know better is because I'm one of the weirdoes who actually read the entire Standard Operating Procedure document, the employee handbook (which is actually just a subsection of the SOP), and I really hate being wrong, so I checked the SOP before doing anything different day-to-day. In my store, the SOP was like invoking god. If the SOP said so, that won every single argument.\n\nSo I go home, change into pants, but bring my shorts back to work with me. By now, Dick's shift is over and I ask the new morning Manager On Duty, Daren, to meet with me.\n\n\"Why, what's up?\"\n\"Oh, just an SOP issue.\"\n\"Oh... ok. Give me like, 10 minutes?\"\n\nSo I swung bynmy desk and printed out several things.\n1. My latest pay stub that included my official job title and department number.\n2. The company directory that listed the department names and their associated numbers.\n3. The SOP that dealt with when and which departments/employees can wear shorts.\n4. The annual email from the Regional VP confirming which departments could wear shorts starting when, which also included the line \"and this letter is to be posted at the time clock between the dates of xxx-xxx\"\n5. The SOP detailing the company transportation and mileage reimbursement policy.\n6. A Google maps route that mirrored the route I take to and from work, with the total mileage highlighted.\n\nSo, I meet with Daren and explained what happened and handed him each page in turn as they became relevant. At the end, we agreed that I was right on every single account and asked me what I wanted.\n\n1. I want the time. I was turned away before I could clock in so I want to be paid starting at 5am. Feel free to check the CCTV if you want to confirm when I arrived.\n2. I want the mileage, because Dick sent me on essentially a company errand with my own vehicle through no fault of my own.\n3. I want this letter posted at the clock, like it says it's supposed to be.\n4. I want you to talk to Dick about this, because I told him this was the SOP before he sent me home.\n5. I'm changing back into my shorts.\n\n\"All of that sounds more than fair. Get the paperwork for the clock adjustment and mileage to me today and I'll sign it.\"\n\nThe letter mysteriously went missing from the time clock the next day, but I replaced it everyday until I happened to see Dick angrily snatch it off the board and throw it away. I reported that as well and the letter stopped going missing.\n\nHe didn't talk to me much and I was tranferred to another department a month later, so all in all win-win I think.\n\nEdit: Now that I'm home and at an actual computer, minor edits for spelling and grammar.",

        "selftext": "Longtime lurker, so I thought I\u2019d share my favorite story from my time in foodservice, years and years ago. \n\nI was a shy, quiet 15-year-old when I first started working at a certain fast food restaurant in my small town. Then I encountered the general public. \n\nMany of the morning rush customers were super kind regulars who I got to know and liked. But then there was Penny Guy. \n\nPenny Guy was not a regular. He placed his order with no initial sign of anything out of the ordinary. His change came to twenty-nine cents. \u201cNo pennies,\u201d he said gruffly. \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want your pennies, sir?\u201d I confirmed. This was not unusual. We had a charity donation box right by the cash register where customers often left unwanted change, or had us deposit it. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t give me any damn pennies.\u201d The guy was glowering at me now. \n\n\u201cOf course, sir.\u201d I handed him his quarter. I dropped the pennies in the charity box. \n\nAnd then he exploded. \n\n\u201cWhat the F\u2014 is this F\u2014ING QUARTER? I WANT THIRTY CENTS! HOW F\u2014ING HARD IS IT TO ROUND THE HELL UP?!\u201d\n\nI was caught off guard. \u201cI\u2019m sorry sir, but I can\u2019t give back extra change. We donate what customers don\u2019t want, and it all goes to Charity. I apologize for the confusion.\u201d My drawer had to be correct at the end of the day, so this was absolutely true. \n\nWell, that was not all right. He went on a very loud tirade about how cheap our restaurant was and how ridiculous it was to round down. He called me a cheap-ass bitch. Then he demanded his pennies back. \u201cYOU WON\u2019T RIP ME OFF LIKE THIS!! GIVE ME MY TWENTY-NINE F-CKING CENTS!\u201d\n\nAt this point, I could have given him a nickel from the drawer and replaced it later from my own pocket. If he\u2019d been speaking to me like I was a person and not a corporate punching bag, I would gladly have done so. But that\u2019s not what he was asking me to do. \n\nI put on my sweetest smile. \u201cOnly the store manager has the keys to the donation box. Give me just a minute and I\u2019ll go get her.\u201d\n\nAt this point, one of the regulars behind Penny Guy speaks up. \u201cDon\u2019t make her do that. Here\u2019s your pennies.\u201d He offers PG some pennies from his own pocket. \n\nPenny Guy\u2019s face flushes and he mumbled about it being the principle of the thing. \n\nMy coworker was managing the line so I decided that this man was going to get his pennies. \n\nIt took a minute to explain what was happening to the manager. She laughed and said she\u2019d be there in a second. It took her a suspiciously long minute to retrieve the key and get to the front. Meanwhile Penny Guy mumbled and glowered and for some reason stuck around for those four pennies. It was a PRINCIPLE apparently, and it meant he waited a good ten minutes while his to-go bag cooled on the counter. \n\nEvery now and then, when a new customer came to the till, I\u2019d look over at Penny Guy and assure him, \u201cDon\u2019t worry sir, the manager will be here shortly to return your four pennies from the donation box.\u201d This earned him a few looks while he waited. \n\nWhen my manager finally came to the front, we opened the donation box while the busy store watched. We counted out four pennies and handed them back over to a now very red-faced and much quieter man. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for the confusion,\u201d I told him. \u201cHere is the rest of your change.\u201d\n\nHe took the pennies and left, still mumbling about what a rip off the whole thing was. On the bright side, a larger-than-normal percentage of customers decided to donate their change to the charity after watching his tirade. \n\nI took some pleasure in the thought that even at minimum wage, my time was worth more than twenty-four cents an hour.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the awards and comments! And my first gold ever\u2014 thank you, kind stranger!  WHAAAT platinum?! Ahhh you guys are too kind!",

Rather than just tack it to my bill the following month, the apartment complex mailed me (with a stamp!) a letter explaining the discrepancy and asking that I supply the 8 cents by the end of the week or I would face a $50 late charge.\n\nThis was not a large complex. It was a form letter and the $0.08 had been written in by hand.\n\nSo I took an envelope, put a nickel and three pennies and dropped it off in the rent box in the office. \n\nA few days later, I got another letter, again mailed with a stamp, letting me know that the complex was not able to accept cash payments for rent and that I needed to write and submit a check for the $0.08 by the next day or I would face a $50 late charge.\n\nSo I wrote the damn check.

Well today my manager told me that instead of not answering the phone due to us not being open. I now have to answer it and put their order in as a timed order. Along with not telling them that it wouldn't be ready for pickup until 11, I guess he's after more sales, I don't know. Cue malicious compliance, and this morning we happened to get a lot of calls. By the time it was about 10:45, I had 10 orders in, along with that's when the first customer arrived. Well see the issue was that by company policy and rules, we cannot unlock the doors until 11, or when we're supposed to be open. We can send deliveries out early, yet we cannot open carryout early. Well as you can imagine the customer became pissed when I told them they have to wait until 11 before I can serve them due to policy. With the cherry on top being my manager heard the commotion, and decided to forgo the rule. Well in walks in his essential boss, he trains managers and employees mainly. In which he sees what he's doing, and promptly gets in trouble as a result. After his boss talked to him for a bit, my manager pulled me aside and said we're no longer taking orders early, nor are we allowing customers to enter the store early.\n\nTL;DR: manager told me to take orders before we're open, customer got mad as a result as they couldn't get thier food when they got here. Manager then allowed customer in early, in which his boss happened to show up. Got in trouble and the rule has been revoked.",

            "When I worked at Pizza Hut years back I'd be there at 7am to help open and we would always get calls. Not because it was someone actually wanting pizza at 7am, but because it was schools or businesses that were ordering a large amount ahead of time. \n\nMade sense to me at the time, because it was good to know we need 20 pepperoni pizzas ready at noon instead of getting these huge orders at 11 while customers start coming in too.",

Yes, I am aware of that.  I'm still going to provide the information.  If people don't listen, that's a *them* problem, not a *me* problem.  Thanks.",
