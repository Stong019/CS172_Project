        "selftext": "So I just had a lateral sphincterotomy for chronic anal fissures. It\u2019s just as painful and terrible as it sounds. It\u2019s also kind of an awkward topic to get into with 99% of people, so for the most part I\u2019ve been deliberately vague about my surgery with people. My husband, parents, boss, and closest friends know the details. But as far as anyone else knows, I\u2019m just having a minor procedure and will be out of work for awhile. \n\nIf people have reached out to check on me and see if I\u2019m okay, that\u2019s fine. I appreciate that. But if they keep prying despite my obvious attempts to be vague, my strategy has been to tell them in graphic detail exactly what the surgery entails and make them regret asking.\n\nIt goes like this. \n\nThem: \u201cHey I heard you were having surgery, is everything okay??\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cYeah, it\u2019s just a small elective procedure. Everything is fine! Thanks for checking in.\u201d\n\nUsually the conversation is over here or the subject is changed. But if the person wants to be nosy, it continues: \n\nThem: \u201cOkay good, just making sure.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cYup! All good.\u201d\n\nThem: \u201cWhat\u2019s the surgery for?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cIt\u2019s for a digestive system issue, nothing to worry about.\u201d\n\nThem: \u201cOh, what is it?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cMy butthole. I have chronic anal fissures, which means my entire anus splits open every single time I poop. It\u2019s excruciating. I\u2019m having a sphincterotomy. That\u2019s where they cut into the sphincter muscle from the inside, and then cauterize the fissures to allow them to heal better.\u201d\n\nThem: \u201cWell that\u2019s graphic...\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cI tried to be vague, but you still felt the need to ask, so. I felt the need to tell you!\u201d\n\n\nI really just hope it makes them feel awkward and like they shouldn\u2019t have asked such personal questions when someone was clearly trying to be vague about something. Mind your own damn business and get your nose out of my ass. Literally.\n\nEdit 1:  Whole lotta people in the comments like \u201cThat\u2019s not fair, they might not know they\u2019re being intrusive or nosy! They might just genuinely be concerned!\u201d But like. I know these people on a personal level. I know who\u2019s concerned for my well-being and who is being willfully intrusive. I know I could just say \u201cI\u2019d rather not discuss it\u201d, and I do say that to some people. I adjust my response to people accordingly based on their intent.\n\nEdit 2: I did not make the advice animals post. Someone else liked my story so much they decided to make a meme out of it! Hopefully some people who need to see it, see it there. \n\nEdit 3: \u201cYeah but you\u2019re talking about your DiScREtE pRiVaTe MeDiCaL iSsUe oN tHe iNtErnET so clearly it doesn\u2019t bother you to talk about it!\u201d I didn\u2019t say it did. I said I have an issue with people deliberately prying into someone else\u2019s information. Also you didn\u2019t have to read this post or the comments, so don\u2019t get butthurt that you now also know more than you wanted to about my anus.",

THEN he needed to 'be in charge'.\n\nI have this belief that both a wedding and divorce actually happen AFTER the event.  That is, a couple commits themselves to each other BEFORE the wedding sanctifies, recognizes and legalizes the marriage.  Likewise, a marriage is irreparably broken long before the divorce papers are finalized.\n\nThus, the day after the wedding shouldn't be much different then the day before the wedding.  There shouldn't be a major shift in roles and/or expectations just because your commitment was formalized.\n\nAnyways, it sounds like you will also be 'the one that got away' and I have to wonder if that's because he knows he messed up but can not, WILL not either apologize or change.",

            "Good girl, and what a way to assert yourself!  You did well to get out of that relationship so quickly.  In that brief time, he tried to utterly and completely dominate you, and control both how you thought and what level of independence you had.  The inevitable result, if you had stayed longer, was that he would have completely estranged you from everyone who would have listened to you, strictly controlled who you could and could not talk to or be friends with, and would have told those he was friends with that you were always the reason for any of his personal shortcomings as a man or a human being.  \n\nI know that old attitude well:  when the ring goes on, one becomes a possession and a free, completely pretrained housekeeping service with benefits, rather than a spouse.  Obviously, I had one of those peculiar creatures myself, and that lasted 9 years before I escaped that situation.   I recognize so many things in your posts, but the one thing we share is a love of books, and a man who did not want us reading and expanding our minds.  At one point, my ex refused to provide me with any ride from school during my senior year, as I got off at 11:30 am.  I still insisted on walking the 4 miles every day, while pregnant.  I graduated.  During the divorce, he admitted that he did that because he did not want a woman who was better educated than he was.  To this day, I snarl a bit when I recall those words, but I also feel a thrill every time I go into my personal file and see my diploma in there.  \n\nWhen I remarried, it was to a man who views me as an equal, as it should be.  I went into the second one declaring, with absolute sincerity, that the word \"obey\" would not be in the vows, and that if he was trying to find a homemaker with no original thoughts of her own, I was a very bad choice due to my personal independence.  He married me anyway.  We have been together over 20 years now and we enjoy our shared life.  \n\nI went through the protracted, post-divorce custody battle royale, as well.  I had remarried, which was why my ex tried to take the kids...He actually told me that if I left my husband, then he would stop going after me (a lie, of course, it was all about control).  The attorney who took our case was rather tepid until the day my ex called my cell phone while we were at the law office.  I put the phone on speaker and my ex, oblivious, did his normal combination of outrageous demands, ominous threats if I did not comply, and general verbal abuse.  When I hung up the phone, I hung my head; it was a really bad call that had gone on for 15 minutes, despite my saying almost nothing.  The attorney, who only moments ago had that business-as-usual, bored look, now had clenched fists as he growled, in oddly measured tones, \"I'm gonna to bury that son of a...\"  And he did, with a ferociousness that astonished me, because he had zero tolerance for people who used kids as pawns yet portrayed themselves as perpetual victims.  I owe a great deal to that attorney, who realized that he was dealing with an ongoing domestic violence situation where the abuser was attempting to maintain control through the only area of my life where he still had any legal standing: through the children. \n\nMy ex has also been through several alcohol-soaked and ultimately failed marriage and informal relationships in the years since we split.  His kids barely talk to or go to see him, and when they do, they express disgust.  He's not yet 50 and looks like he's knocking on 70, which may just be his liver attempting to turn cirrhotic, but his lifestyle does not help.\n\nI have a feeling we could share more than a few war stories on this particular subject.  You have a great strength of character that I recognize, and acknowledge.  I see you.",

            "The word \"romance\" stems from the courtly romance epics of the middle ages, when chivalry had clear expectations. One of them, the respect a knight had for his lord's lady, was because the knight had to honor all property of his lord - and that's a large part of what marriage was established back then. For a knight to pine for a lady was often therefore inherently adulterous, but it was never consummated and the emotions expressed within strict etiquette in order to remain acceptable.\n\nA modern-day romantic must be careful that his wooing of a woman as if she is a respected lady doesn't flip into owning property once she becomes his lady.",

        "selftext": "This happened about ten years ago at my (American) university. I enrolled in a class that two friends also happened to enroll in (an elective for our major). The professor, whom I will call \"Prof Y\", told us straight off the bat that our entire grade would be based on two exams that would be open book and we could collaborate with anyone else in the class, as long as we cited that we did so. Additionally, it was the kind of exam where you could submit it as many times as you want before the deadline. Prof Y's rules though were that he'd grade easiest on the first try, and much tougher with each subsequent try. Fair enough.\n\nNow, some background on this professor.  I'm not defending him, but I do think this context is important. He immigrated to the States from another country where women are seen as inferior, and the often expectations of women are to be meek and quiet (maybe less so nowadays, but definitely more so when he was growing up). In class one day, a female student challenged the professor; he argued back, she admitted he made a good point and he said to her, \"You are very agreeable. You'd make a great wife.\" Now, at this point I probably should have reported him for sexism. However, we all apparently let it slide. He was in his late 60s, he had tenure, so I think we all brushed it aside as harmless (hindsight 20/20). I am female, btw.\n\nFast forward a few weeks into the semester and the first exam is given to us. My male friend, David, and I did the test together. We submitted it on the same day. On the bottom of my test, I wrote \"worked with David\" because I wanted to follow the prof's rules. A few days later, we all got our first attempt at the test back. David scored the equivalent of about a C (remember he had further chances to improve); my test had a big fat zero at the top with the words \"CHEATER\" written on it. I was shocked. I obviously held back after class and asked why this was written on my test, and Prof Y started screaming at me.\n\n\"I HATE LIARS!!!! I HATE PEOPLE LIKE YOU!!! YOU ARE SCUM!!! YOU ARE A LIAR!!!!!\"\n\nI could not believe what I was hearing. I was sobbing, explaining that he SAID (and it was in the syllabus) that we could work with other students. I asked where I had cheated and Prof Y had literally underlined the first five words of ONE question where both David and I had started off the paragraph saying something like, \"The reason that we are seeing these results is.....\". And that was it. I asked him why he thought **I** cheated, and not David? But Prof Y would not listen to me, continued to insult me until I left.\n\nNow, my university was SUPER strict about plagiarism and cheating. We got emails like once a week about the Honor Council. All the emails said that anyone caught cheating would be reported to the Honor Council and sit trial. So I went to their office and reported myself. They were all confused and were like \"wait....you're reporting yourself? Not the professor?\" and I told them calmly that I had been accused and given a zero without any evidence, so I wanted to sit trial. They incredulously told me no student had ever asked for a trial, but I was following the University rules and I was confident I would win.\n\nNeedless to say, Prof Y was not happy. At the next class, he pulled me after class and screamed yet again that they were HIS rules in HIS class and HE decides the grades, not the Honor Council. I said that's not the university's policy and if he thought I was cheating, HE should have gone to them. Since he didn't, I did. He was livid and tried to bully me to back down but I didn't.\n\nWe had the trial, and I obviously won. At the end of the semester, I organised a meeting with the Dean of the school and filed a formal sexism complaint against Prof Y. The Dean, also incredulous, promised to launch a formal investigation into this professor and would be meeting with him to discuss. I'm sure that nothing happened besides a slap on the wrist, but even a slap on the wrist was worth it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Wow what a nice surprise to wake up to!! Thank you all for the awards!!\n\nI also want to add that I looked it up and he is retired, so nothing can be done now. I also stumbled upon his \"ratemyprofessor\" page and LOL his rating is 1/5 stars. Most of the comments are \"his tests are stupid and he grades based on his mood that day\". I'd be very curious to know if these are all women writing these reviews. Also, my major is in a STEM field. I forgot to add this note, but there were only three women in my entire class (of like 30 students, but still). One woman was told she'd make a good wife, and I was accused of cheating. It's just such a shame that women are trying to break into the hard sciences and yet sh\\*t like this happens that discourages us. \n\nI also am SO curious about why so many people have guessed BYU and why if it were BYU (it's not), it would \"change everything\". Someone please provide more information!!!\n\nSecond edit: thank you everyone who has offered more information on BYU\u2019s honor council. Thankfully this honor council was more focused on academic integrity and nothing like the HCO at BYU",

Due to the pandemic the test was virtual so he made it longer and made it open book. \n\nIm sure some kids may have cheated, but how can you honestly think that adding an hour onto an exam and making it open book wont increase scores? \n\nAnyway he flipped and made the next exam harder to spite us. We all did well again anyway and he flipped but didn't report anyone because, big surprise, he had no evidence at all.",

So my group of friends would work the problems together on a board, and then copy it down to turn in. Me and my other female friend were constantly getting 50% lower grades on our homeworks then the guys even though we had all the same work. He made at least two girls cry.\n\nWe reported him, but he was tenured, and nothing came of it, we were just told to keep out heads down.\n\nSo we started putting the male equivalent of our names on our homeworks, and low and behold our grades went up. (our school used student numbers to enter and track grades, so the different first names didn't matter). It just sucks that we had to do that because our teacher was a sexist asshole.\n\nI feel for you. Good on you for getting one over on him.",

What happened was the professor printed out the previous year\u2019s problem set but with this year\u2019s date on it. Somehow it was passed out to me. Did it, turned it in, only to be accused of cheating and given a zero. Luckily cooler heads prevailed once I showed her the problem set I was given.

            "I got accused of plagiarism is an english literature class. We had to write an essay on epistolary novels. So I wrote an essay on the topic. I didn't cite any sources, I just wrote what I understood about epistolary novels. \n\nTo those of you wondering, epistolary novels are those written as though they were real life documents (diaries, letters, etc.). The Diary of Anne Frank and The Perks of Being a Wallflower are both considered epistolary, for example.\n\nIn my essay, I defined epistolary novels pretty much the way I did above, though I listed more examples of the kinds of documents. I got the essay back with a big red 0 and a note accusing me of plagiarism and requesting me to resubmit with sources cited. \n\nI asked my professor why she thought I was plagiarizing and she told me \"your definition was very clearly copied from somewhere else\". I asked her how she knew that and she said it didn't read like a college student and was almost certainly a dictionary definition, which needed to be cited. While having this conversation with her, I pulled out my laptop and typed in word for word exactly the part she was saying was plagiarized. I googled it with quotation marks and got zero google results back.\n\nI'll give her credit. When she saw the google results, she accepted that I wasn't plagiarizing. Then she went on to basically say that at my academic level, I was required to cite sources for things I already knew because I'm not actually an expert.\n\nI found a website that defined epistolary novels, dropped it in my works cited section, and got an A.",

            "I did some creative writing modules at university. We were encouraged to share our work and get feedback. I made a blog and got my feedback that way, rather than sending round word documents. Approximately 6 hours before the final midnight deadline for a poetry collection my professor sent me an email saying that any poetry on my blog counted as being 'published' and so if I used it for the assignment I'd be committing 'self-plagiarism' and that she really hoped I had other poetry to submit instead.\n\nI did not, and my family was visiting for the evening, for the first time in months, so I hatched a plan.\n\nThere's two key things you need to know. We had to submit a set number of lines of poetry. My professor really loved gore and gruesome twists. Even if they made no sense. I once wrote a poem about two people on a date. She hated it. I changed the ending stanza so that the girl stabbed the guy in the face with a fork and left him bleeding out. She loved it. \n\nI therefore spent most of the evening with my family, and then in the final hour set out to produce 'stylistic' randomly violent poems that had very short lines so I would meet the requirement. \n\nMy usual line length tends to be about this long:\n\n> There are times when conversation isn\u2019t necessary\n\nHere's one of the poems I submitted. And yes, I did do it in 'caveman grammar' just for fun. \n\n# Thor\u2019s Hammer\r\nStood near cave. \n\r\nWaiting for mammoth come. \n\r\nFour-legged springer, fawn, \n\r\nBounds across the plain. \n\r\nMan chase, he stumble, fall. \n\r\nHe hungry still. \n\r\nTake stone, use as tool. \n\r\nMake throw-stick from flint. \n\r\nSee hungry man\n\r\nWaiting by stream for beast. \n\r\nGo to. Stand behind. \n\r\nKill with stick. \n\r\nEat man then fish then beast. \n\r\nSleep safe. Full. \n\n\n\nShe ended up loving it and giving me a first. I think it was crap, but that's what happens when you try to tell me I'm plagiarising myself.",

            "I also was going to ask if this was BYU until I saw your edit hahaha. To answer why so many people asked if this was at BYU:\nBrigham Young University has a reputation for having an INCREDIBLY strict Honor Code, which extends to dress attire, educational conduct, and personal behavior to name a few. \nWomen tend to bear the brunt of most of the punishment coming from the Honor Code Office. BYU is a hot pile of shit. I didn\u2019t attend there myself, but I\u2019ve plenty of horror stories from my girlfriends that went. I think you could browse the exmormon or BYU subreddits if you want more details/examples.\nSo, an old, woman-hating professor and a school with a hella strict Honor Council?

Did the design, graphics and basic functions.\n\nWe started getting some troubles with the rotation of the blocks. As you may know, you can't just use the entire block in Tetris since you have to be able to remove bits of it once you get a full line, so we had to write coordinates for every single block for every possible rotation (left button, L-block 1 goes X+20, Y-20, or something like that, for every little square block, for every shape, for every possible rotation.\n\nFor that tedious part, we decided to exchange some of our code, because the idea was the same. We just had to adapt the coordinates to make it work for our specific lay-out.\n\nTurns out, my friend forgot to modify some comments in the code, so it was clear he had used some of my code. And although in the real world, people re-use code all the time, this was not allowed in class.\n\nGranted we weren't supposed to do that, so a few points off would have been fair, but the professor was convinced one of us made the entire thing and the other ripped it off (just ignore the lay-out, graphics and functionality, the only similar code was the coordinates) and since neither of us would admit who \"plagiarized\", he gave us both a 0 on a project that was 50% of class so we both had to take new final exam in the summer, where both of us got 17 or 18/20.",

Half of the exam was defining terminology and the other half involved excel.\n\nRather than flip through the book to find the definitions, half the class used the internet to define the terms because it was quicker and we were under the clock. He sat in the back of the classroom monitoring everyone silently and at the end of the test, commented that he observed blatant cheating and that everyone involved would not only fail the exam but flunk the class and be reported to the university cheating council.\n\nSome of my fellow students and I had already secured employment after graduation so needless to say we were shitting bricks. I went to his office after to discuss this issue. I told him that there is no engineer stupid enough let alone half the class that would cheat knowing he was sitting right behind everyone watching everything. It was just a misunderstanding of what he meant by computer usage for the test. I also mentioned that if he saw half the class cheating by his definition, he should have realized the miscommunication and immediately put a stop to it instead of waiting for the end of the exam.\n\nAfter all of this, he still refused to budge. So I went for the hail mary. With rage in my face, I looked him dead in the eye and said, \"Listen, there is a lot riding on the line here and I need you to understand that we know this subject very well. Too well to cheat. The people who you accused of cheating will take a retest closed book/notes/computer just to prove that this was just a misunderstanding. \"\n\nHe knew what I was suggesting was very difficult as it entailed memorizing 50 term definitions along with writing a complex excel program by hand. He agreed to the retest and we all blew it out of the park (I did better on that test than the original).\n\nGlad to see everything worked out for you!",

Let's meet in a week. I think I should have a chat with prof X\"\n\nThe story, by the way: prof x doesn't like me. I didn't like him. But damn I was good at math, constantly getting perfect scores. I'm also dyslexic. On a 2 question test, as I'm writing my equations out, I write some digits backwards on line 8 of my work, which were then corrected on line 9 (I had the problem accurately worked through in my head, but i have to write each tedious step to the solution). Despite getting the final solution correct,  entire question was marked wrong, -50% on test score. There were 4 tests total this semester, which meant my maximum score would have been a 88%, a B. Additionally, prof X wrote \"show YOUR work!\" with the word \"your\" triple underlined.\n\nI asked prof X what deal was, he said \"you clearly cheated, but be thankful i didn't report you to honors council, or I could have you removed from this university. Now get out of my office\"\n\nSo, I waited 1 semester so that i couldn't get in trouble for cheating. Then i reported myself. And I had to actually PROVE to the dean, with my evidence, that Prof X accused me of cheating. Dean was convinced. Why is this bad for Prof X? There are 2 outcomes - \n\n1 Prof X accused me of cheating, but the accusation was fraudulent. This would be an abuse of power, a wrongful depression of my GPA, and would call into question his legitimacy as a fair professor. \n\n2 Prof X accused me of cheating, and he genuinely I was cheating. But he did not report me to honors council. This makes him complicit in cheating too, which is grounds for \"having him removed from this university\"\n\n---- fallout time \n\nA week after dean meeting, dean met with me and said \"we had a little chat. He decided to agree that you deserve an A for the class\".\n\nThe following semester, a few weeks in, I got notice from a friend in his class \"yo prof X didn't show up today.

BYU is run by the Mormons, which, like many (most?) Christian Faiths, is anti-LGBT. Being gay at BYU is like putting a target on your head for the HCO to come and find you and make sure you're not being too friendly with anyone of the same gender. The HCO has also long victimized survivors of sexual assault, forcing the victim to go through some crazy repentance process and maybe get expelled while the guys basically say \"sorry\" and get on with their lives. \n\nWhile the HCO does deal with academic honesty (that was the original purpose of the office after all), it has become a sort of sex police without due process. University President Wilkinson took the academic honor code and changed it during the 50s/60s because he was afraid of beatniks and hippies (the honor code also outlines the dress code, which is why Mormons often look alike).\n\nSource: I'm BYU alumni who watched the reveal of the breadth of the abuse of the HCO play out in real time. I started distancing myself from the church after I realized how willing the church is to minimize the needs of the LGBT community.",

        "selftext": "HI, this is my first post in here about a thing which happened half a decade ago, but recent experience made me remember it vividly. I hope you enjoy my story.\n\nTo give context, I live in Europe in a non-Anglophone country. I have always been a language nerd, and since my parents' divorce, English and everything in it (music, movies, internet) was my escape, so I was fluent before most of my classmates and got my CPE (Certificate of Proficiency in English, the highest certificate from the Cambidge Council) at 18. In my country High schools are basically undergrad college and are finished between the age of 19-20, and a problem which almost all public schools have is terrible language teachers - most of them being former Russian teachers with minimal English or any other language education. Also, as my country is small and nobody could reasonably expect to use our language abroad, we put a HUGE emphasis on language studies at all levels of education, and it is often the thing which schools boast about to become more prestigious. So enough context.\n\nFrom early on, my last high-school English teacher and I kicked it off to a bad start. The first test she gave us came back all red because of \"words which are not in the textbook\". The terrible teacher (TT for short) would do this to me for the full final 2 years! She would take my essays and tests, and cross out any word, phrase, or structure, which was not in the textbook we were using! I maintained that I will not go as far as to learn the textbook vocabulary by heart (just to remember which synonyms I was ALLOWED to use) just because of TT's antics. I have managed to keep an A for 3 terms because there was nothing she could mark down on my grammar. The final term, however, TT learned that I wish to go to university to do Anglophone Studies, a specialisation her daughter had failed to be accepted for (she told me that as an explanation why \"I cannot ever hope to be accepted\" at the start of that term) and which, among dozen other things, required good or even perfect marks from high-school language lessons and accepted only 5% of applicants. TT was dead set to make me fail.\n\nShe started giving me the stupidest assignments and extra tests for \"misbehaving in class\" (being finished early and silently staring at a wall), which required me to \"mark the exact position of Disneyland on this A4 blind map of USA\" (exact quote I still remember after all those years), and more of the same shit. You could tell she was so satisfied by me failing these tests, she would have a grin on her face each time handing out the results.\n\nBy this time I have been representing the school in laguage olympics for both English and Spanish. She had no idea, because it was organised by another language teacher, and even though the principal made it into a big deal, TT was plainly uninterested. I have placed 3rd in the Capital City District in Spanish and 6th NATIONWIDE in English. Not to listing this to brag, (ok, myabe a bit), but to use it later.\n\nBy the end of the term she god my mark down to a C- (mind you, all the grammar was still A's, but her blind maps of tourist attractions had taken their toll). I went to her to reason with her, but her reaction was \"If you think a different teacher would propose a different mark, take all of your documents and go to one of my colleagues, but I believe it is clear to anyone that you do not deserve any better.\"\n\nSO I DID, I took ALL my documents. The bloody blind-maps, the grammar tests, my by then a year old PCE certificate and my 6th place diploma. I went to the teacher who organised the competitons and explained my situation. SHE WAS FURIOUS.\n\nShe took this to the principal, and even though I was waiting outside, I could hear him yell at TT, \"You are trying to fail the student who was representing us at the national level of competitions!?\" It also turned out that with the CPE I had, by that time, a higher level of English education than TT had. I got my A. I got to the uni and I love it there. I also started my own tiny language school where, among of course teaching the language to whoever is interested, I help kids whose language teachers are incompetent and/or power-hungry morons.\n\nThe impulse for me to write this was walking by the highschool last week, and meeting TT. She acted like we have always been best buddies (a couple of MY students are her students as well, so she knows about me). She hugged me in front of the High-school kids present and exclaimed that I got where I was thanks to working hard in HER lessons. I am still pissed I did not get the courage to tell her off there and then.\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for the kind comments, I haven't expected the post to get so much attention! Seriously thank you guys for making my day!\n\nAlso, I know that there are mistakes and typos here in the post.

Told her about the room and in less than 5 minutes, I was setting up my equipment :-D\n\nIn another school, I did volunteer to handle a Video workshop (basically, handling the VHS and letting people watch movies). Because I am meticulous in those cases, I made an inventory of each item I took and where it did belong.

This can be weird because sometimes \"have\" is used, but it seems to usually be when talking about something you are doing or about to do that you have done before in the past.  I'm not sure about the specific grammar rules here, just that in these sentences, have looks weird and had would be correct.  \n\n>Not to listing this to brag\n\nYou don't need the first to.  It's just \"not listing this to brag.\"\n\n>The impulse for me to write this was walking by the highschool last week\n\nThe impulse for you writing this was an emotion or feeling, not an event.  A better phrasing would be \"the impulse for me to write this came when I was walking...\" or you could use a word like inspiration (though technically this word has the same issue, it's just more commonly used this way regardless) or idea.  Or impetus if you want to flex your vocabulary.  Also, at least in America, high school is written as two words and isn't hyphenated, though that might vary from country to country.\n\n\nI really hope you enjoy critique because this might be the most nit-picky post I've made lol.  Your English is basically flawless and much of your style would lead me to think that you are a native speaker.  I just figured you might be interested in the tiny little details, mostly because I'm interested in them too.  Keep writing, you're good at it!",

Yeah, because English teachers would dock off for using synonyms or words not taught in their class, right? Could you imagine that? She made me recite the alphabet (a test grade) backwards, lying about how she did that to all of her more learned students and native speakers.

And there were quite a few actual English teachers from this very uni taking the same exam. What struck me the most was that during each break these teachers would complain how hard and stupid the tasks are and how \u201cimpossible\u201d it is to prepare for this stuff. And at the same tine I felt like the exam was quite easy and the task s were just as expected, nothing unusual for anyone who actually invested some time into proper preparation. One of them was complaining real hard about the British accents in the listening part. He wanted American ones. And he seemed to literally hate everything British for some reason.\nWhen the exam was over the only thought I had was \u201cWhy on earth are these people teaching English in a bloody university if they find CAE hard?

            "I used to be the one correcting grammar in my head...because I'm that kind of person (who also is imperfect in grammatical usage). Once I took a linguistics course in college (uni as Europeans usually call it). I then realized there are many ways of looking at languages. Linguistics, for example, is descriptive. English & grammar instruction are prescriptive. Insofar as language is a means of communication, it is typically more important that meaning be conveyed, rather than rules. Rules in English are more like guidelines. Much of word-coining and slang break every rule and historical meaning, only to gain their own use in the vernacular. [Urbandictionary.com](https://Urbandictionary.com) is a great example.  \n\n\nOne exercise we had in linguistics was to decipher a made-up language, and outline the grammatical rules being used. It was sort of like code-breaking, but the difference being it wasn't particularly encrypted. It just didn't exactly translate directly into English noun-verb-direct object format.     \n\n\nThere are weird things in English, like words that can be a verb, adjective, noun, and adverb. I can think of many examples of this, but for some reason, \"purple\" sticks out in my mind as something particularly special. I can't recall why, though.",

He knocked a report out of the park, and my opinion of him changed entirely; once you know what someone is capable of, you give them more opportunities to shine. But this can also be seen as more opportunities to fail.\n\nExpectations can begin to fall back to reality, but it's a double-edged sword. I would get really concerned if somebody turned rockstar and then couldn't do it again: What happened? You were awesome on this other thing, why couldn't you do this? can easily turn into \"What is this? This is terrible. You can do better.\" They're close enough that interpretation becomes very important.\n\nOne person's motivation is another's destruction. It is imperative a good teacher be able to tune motivation and instruction to the individual - even in huge classes.  \n\n\nEdit: The term of the day in schools lately, I gather, is \"growth mindset\", rather than \"fixed mindset\". I'll let folks dig into that themselves. I would not be very good at explaining it.",

Her exams with memorizing nouns and verbs and almost not application of the language. The national exam was a story in Latin and you had to answer question about the story, also in latin.\n\nUnlike OP, I never did fuck all with it but accept the certificate.

        "selftext": "I was an English teacher in Moscow. At the beginning of the school year, I asked for a week of time off around a holiday, so I could travel some. I got denied so the week it came around, I was pleased that most of my classes had been canceled because the students had the same idea I had and were all going on vacation.\n\nI get an email from the administration stating that I was to cover classes for another teacher. Who was taking vacation for the week I had asked for. So I was already a bit upset about that they'd approved him, but not me - especially since I'd asked for it like 5 months ago. Anyway, I accept the hand that was dealt and start preparing lessons.\n\nThe day of the first class, I leave home a few hours early so that I had plenty of time to make sure I could find the place (it was at a location I'd never been) and that I had all the necessary equipment I needed to read the lessons. It was pretty easy to find, but when I rang the bell, there was no answer. I had some time, so I went off to get a snack. I come back to the school about 30 minutes early and ring the bell again.\n\nNo answer.\n\nI try calling the school's administrator.\n\nNo answer.\n\nI try calling the administrator who assigned the classes.\n\nNo answer.\n\nFor over an hour I rang the doorbell and called multiple times to no avail. My contract stated that I had to wait 30 minutes for students to show up before I could leave. So at the 30 minute mark, I sent a text to all parties that read something along the lines of: I was here on time. I waited a half hour after the scheduled time, but nobody answered the door. I'm going back home. It will take me 20 minutes to get to the metro, if you call me before I board, I will turn around and come back.\n\nWhen I got home, I got a call:\n\n\"Where the hell are you?\"\n\n\"At home.\"\n\n\"You have a class.\"\n\n\"I'm aware. I was there and nobody answered the door. I called and nobody answered. I also left a text.\"\n\n\"Texting is not an approved form of communication.\"\n\nNow, this was before I had a phone with a data plan, so text was the only way I could message someone. They tried docking my pay for this, but when I told the owner what had happened and showed him my call logs and the text I left, he made sure that didn't happen.\n\nFast forward a few months. I'd been having a lot of issues with the administration so I'd become an expert on the finer details of our contract. One of those details was that the administration couldn't assign a class with less than 72 hours notice. So when they called on Saturday, to give me a class for Monday, I told them no. Again, they tried to dock my pay. The owner sighed at me and told me I was right.\n\nMy favorite part, though, was receiving a text that said I was to teach a class on a given day. They made special mention of the 72 hour rule. I ignored the text. When the time for class came around, I got another call:\n\n\"Where the hell are you?\"\n\n\"At home.\"\n\n\"You have a class.\"\n\n\"No I don't.\"\n\n\"I sent you a text. I have it saved.\"\n\n\"Texting is not an approved form of communication.\"",

            "I worked as an English teacher in Moscow. Because I really needed my job, I would do much more than my contract stipulated to please my boss and ensure my position was secure.\n\nI once got called into the office to discuss my tardiness. School started at 9am,and I was consistently arriving five to ten minutes late one week (due to very bad traffic on the roads in the winter).\n\nWhen I was called into the office, my boss tried to use my pay as leverage. She asked me, \u201cThis is a simple matter\u2014are you following the contract or not?\u201d\n\nI boldly replied, \u201cNo. I do not. I was hired for one class, but I teach two because you have not hired a second teacher. I take half-hour lunches when it states I can take an hour break. Additionally, there is no head teacher and I have been meeting with parents on MY time without complaint.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t say a word after that.",

            "That is so infuriating when employers claim all the privileges and deny any responsibilities.\n\nMy son was a CNA for a nursing home.  The schedule was posted in the office and it changed a lot due to plenty of unreliable employees.  My son would request to not be scheduled for a particular day and it was hit or miss whether that request would be honored. So he always checked the schedule and abided by it when it came out. Lo and behold, one of the times he had requested to not be scheduled was actually honored and so he made the plans to live his life that day but made sure to check the schedule one last time before he left work the day before his day off.\n\nThe next morning his phone lit up with messages demanding to know where he was and why wasn't he at work.  By the time he got these messages he was far away doing a family event and he responded to them saying he wasn't scheduled as of the night before.  Boss said the written and posted schedule wasn't official and employees must check the official on-line schedule for the real deal.  Apparently, employees must check the on-line schedule daily to see whether it had been changed to indicate they did, indeed, have to show up for work that day even though they may not know it until just hours before the shift is to begin.  My son even got written up for failing to show and had other employees mad at him for stiffing them on staffing.  Absolute bullshit.\n\nMy son is a responsible and caring person and has a serious case of self-doubt.  He felt terrible, he felt he had let down his employer, his co-workers and his patients. He is not the kind of person to advocate for himself. But he was also college aged and so I had to use all my strength to resist the urge to go in and ream their asses on his behalf.  Fortunately he left that place in the fall when he had to head back to school.\n\nBTW, healthcare industry ought to get as much flak as the health insurance industry.  Nursing homes charge residents like $8,000 a month for room, board and the most basic level of care and pay the employees shit wages.

I was due into work the next morning, but woke up with a severe infection that nearly hospitalized me, complete with 104F fever.\n\nI couldn't call or text my supervisor, since I didn't have a working phone anymore, so I did the best thing I could; I sent my coworker an IM letting them know that I was really sick and headed to the doctor, and would be out at least the rest of the week.\n\nWhen I came back in with my doctors note the next week, they tried to fire me for no-call, no-show, and then admitted that they got my message from the coworker, but said it wasn't an, \"approved form of communication.\" I pointed out that they just admitted they knew where I was, and was trying to fire me for being sick.

            "We have mandatory call shifts at my job, it's how they skirt passed \"mandatory overtime\" which is illegal in this state for nurses.

Second of all, if you're going to text me, TEXT ME, why you think Facebook messenger is acceptable is beyond me.\n\nIn the end, they got in trouble, not me, because there's no rule that I have to respond to Facebook about my job, especially, when I don't have anyone I work with, on my Facebook. They had to take the time to search me out and message me, instead of using my phone number, written in a book.",

            "Reminds me of that time in school, where another kid had accidentally smacked me in the face with a baseball bat. Right after it happened, I asked to go home, but it was a traumatized temp teacher who thought I was trying to take advantage of him, so he wouldn't let me go home.  \nSo I just sat there in class while my eye swelled shut and turned black. After class he profusely apologized and sent me home so my mom could take me to the emergency room.    \n \nFast forward: Twenty years later I'd fall and tear my quad, literally detach it from my kneecap so it was lumped up by my hip, and the doctors told me to take an aspirin and see if it got better in the morning. Later that evening I almost passed out from pain and called emergency services again, they told me to try to take two aspirin instead of just one. Next morning I called my family doctor, who proceeded to call said emergency services and rip them a new one, as I would obviously be needing acute surgery and they'd wasted 24 hours of my three day optimal time frame to get fixed. Because of that delay they couldn't get a surgeon in before the weekend, and my muscle had begun to severely atrophy when they reattached it after the weekend on day 6. So instead of taking three months to recover, it took me upwards of a year. Last I heard was they were running an internal investigation to prevent such a case from happening again. They also told me that I should have been more demanding and insistent about my case, as if it's my fault they assumed I was just being dramatic in the most boring, polite and down-to-earth tone of voice ever heard. Pfft! (Both my parents are nurses, I learned long ago to not yell at nurses. I shouldn't be required to yell or be impolite to qualify for assistance.)",

Therefore, you dress for comfort and any situation. Which is generally jeans, t-shirt, sneakers, and for me a fleece jacket because it's cold as balls. \n\nMany years back, our boss informs us that his boss and a few other VPs are coming in for a tour and we need to be dressed up. His boss is new to him and he wants us to make a good impression, but when we ask for clarification, he didn't have an answer, just look nice.\n\nCue malicious compliance - there were only 5 of us working in this location and three of the four guys had tuxedos, the other one, a nice suit. I had a great floor length formal gown. So on the day in question, we arrived earlier than usual in our spiffiest duds. When our boss arrived, he straight panicked. He was convinced that this would not go over well. We calmly explained that he's the one that told us to dress up and we had. Plus, there was no time for us to change before the tour was going to arrive.\n\nA few minutes later his boss rolls up and the 5 of us, plus our boss are in the front lobby to greet him. Our boss is terrified.  He came through the door, took one look and almost fell over. I've never seen anyone laugh so hard in my life. He insisted on taking pictures of and with us and said it was the best thing he'd seen in a long time. Our boss of course then switched gears and acted like he'd been in on it and thought we were hilarious too. Mmmkay. \n\nOur photo made the 2nd levels wall and even went out during a team meeting a few weeks later. It's still one of my favorite work memories. Our boss was much more succinct going forward when he wanted us to \"dress up\"",

            "I worked at a Silicon Valley startup that had a Halloween dress-up tradition. The new CEO who was hired to save the place was not aware of this. He choose that day to schedule a company tour from a potential investor, a large Japanese company. The Japanese visitors were so confused when they showed up and the receptionist behind the front desk was wearing a gorilla suit. They completely freaked out when \"Red Bob\", who worked in IT, walked through the lobby in full scuba gear, walking backwards as one does when wearing swim fins.\n\nIn the end, though, we did get that investment.",

            "I love this stuff.  At my past company I would visit other offices and one year in the Phoenix area I wore Birkenstocks in the middle of summer.  Well one SVP took issue to that.  So when he found out I was visiting again an email was sent company wide to respect office dress codes.  The head of HR did let me in it was because of my shoe selection last time.  Okay, I can comply.  For my next visit I was there in a full suit.  Black shoes with a mirror shine, smart tie.  104F outside.  When getting to the office I did my walk around to say hi, lots of laughs and making sure I visited the SVP office to say hello.    He was not amused.   But I was.\n\nMy next visit I was planning to get a tux but luckily enough the SVP left the company so my reason for stepping up the dress code was done with.  Funny enough when the SVP left the dress code for the office went out the door and people started wearing sneakers again, jeans, etc.",

Paycheck?\u201d\nI looked him square in the eye and said \u201csince this is the first request, I\u2019ll waive the fee this time.\u201d\n\nI never would have charged him, he was a good boss and a good person.",

And decided to dress up appropriately. I went in to interview one poor candidate, who was wearing a perfectly nice sweater vest and slacks, and who immediately broke down apologizing for their clothes. They so far had been interviewed by two people in tuxes and now I showed up wearing a very fancy suit, and no one had explained what was going on. Fortunately I was able to reassure them that (a) they were dressed completely appropriately and (b) no, this was \\*not\\* how we normally dressed for work.

        "selftext": "A couple of recent stories reminded me of something that happened way back when.  \n\nI was a teenager, and had a job at a hotel, as a busboy in a coffee shop. We had about 95 seats, and on a Saturday and Sunday we would do about 400 covers. It was busy, but I was *good*. After noon, things would slow down, so I would jump into the dish pit and help them catch up.  \n\nOne Sunday, the Back of House Manager and the General Manager were having lunch, and they called me over. They asked me to take the next Saturday's evening shift in the dish pit. I reminded them that weekends were pretty busy, and they would have a problem if I wasn't bussing on breakfast. They told me they would get someone to cover bussing, but they really needed me in the dish pit that Saturday night. I agreed, but told them that I would need to leave at 11pm on the dot, as I relied on public transit to get home, and there was no way I could work late. They said, \"No problem,\" and we had a deal.  \n\nI showed up at 3pm to absolute chaos. Guess who they had cover bussing? That's right, the dishwasher. The pit was absolutely stacked with dishes...and then I found out why they needed me on that shift.  \n\nBanquets and the Coffee Shop used the same glassware, plates and cutlery, and there was a *massive* banquet going on upstairs. When I got there the cook line and the Banquet crew were going nuts, prepping and setting up tons of centerpieces, place settings, that sort of thing. We had [bussing carts](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/images/products/large/32034/1117718.jpg) and the banquet crew was loading them up and running them up the elevators to the banquet hall. It was pandemonium.  \n\nThe Back of House manager kept yelling at me. \"I need more forks right now!!\" and I was fishing through the dozens of buspans from day shift trying to get him the stuff he needed. It took a while, but I managed to it for him. I took it with a grain of salt, since he was actually a pretty good guy, just stressed to the max.  \n\nFinally the banquet stuff all went upstairs and I could clear the backlog. It took me until about 8pm.  \n\nThen....nothing. There was about 400 people attending this banquet, and occasionally I would see a member of the banquet team come down, and I would ask them where the dish carts were. These guys treated me like shit, and snapped that they would bring them down when they had a chance.  \n\nSure enough, it was about 10pm when the parade of Banquet Bozos started wheeling cart after cart of dirty dishes in by the pit. There were tons of them, 30 or 40 at least, and none of the bus tubs were sorted. It was all just tossed in. They weren't even scraped into the trash, there was leftover food on lots of the plates.  \n\nJust before 11pm, I see the Back of House Manager talking to his crew, and I went up to him, I was really pissed off. \"What the hell am I supposed to do here?\" I asked, gesturing to the carts.  \n\n\"Wash the damn things,\" he snapped back.  \n\n\"There's no time. I leave in 15 minutes, remember?\"  \n\n\"Well, you'll just have to stay late.\"  \n\n\"I can't. I have a bus to catch. If I miss it, I miss my connection, and that's the last bus. So, no, I am leaving, and I told you that last week.\"  \n\nHe starts getting irate, and I just took off my apron and left without a word.  \n\nThe next weekend, I arrive for my busboy shift and I get called into the General Manager's office, the Back of House Manager was there, and the General Manager is asking me why I abandoned the dish pit in such chaos. As it turns out, nobody on the Banquet crew would work the pit, and in the morning, there was nowhere near enough dishware and cutlery for the coffee shop. The dishwasher they had covering took one look at the hell in back and quit on the spot. They had to close the coffee shop, and lost out on a ton of money.  \n\nI just looked at them and reminded them that when I said I would take the dish pit for that shift, that I would be leaving on time. It's not my fault that the Banquet crew didn't start bringing down the carts until after 10pm.  \n\nThe General Manager looked at the Back of House Manager and asked him what time they served the meals. 6pm. \"So you're telling me that your crew took over 3 hours to roll the dishes back downstairs, and you didn't do anything about it? What they hell were they doing? Why didn't you assign one or two to push the carts?\"  \n\nThen I pointed out that all the carts weren't sorted, and that the plates weren't even scraped. The Back of House Manager gave me the stink-eye, and the General Manager excused me and said to head down to the Coffee Shop and pick up the bussing.  \n\nThe following weekend I came in, and there was a big notice targeted at the Banquet guys. All buspans were to contain only one item, one pan for dinner plates, one pan for side plates, one pan for glassware, another for cutlery. All dishes were to be in the dish pit no later than 15 minutes after being pulled from the table. All plates were to be scraped of excess food waste before going in the pan.  \n\nThe Banquet crew was pissed that they actually had to do their jobs, and the Back of House Manager was pissed that a lowly busboy/dishwasher put him in the hot seat.  \n\nThey never asked me to take an evening shift again.",

            "So relatable. Restaurants try to skate by with so little planning and so much \"do this unreasonable thing because I said so\". \n\nThis reminds me of a time they had way too few dishwashers at the convention center I worked at. Another dishwasher and I were told we had to stay until everything was done, and then everyone else left. Around hour ten, it was after midnight and we were both pretty loopy and we realized there were no rules on when to take breaks after eight hours. We figured we were entitled to as many breaks as it took for us to be able to finish the massive number of dishes, especially since everyone else had peaced out. This included an second lunch hour with tv, and a bunch of smaller breaks. Finished around hour sixteen, so we both got a bunch of overtime. Our manager wasn't thrilled the next day, but he'd told us to stay until everything was done /shrug. After that he made sure to get enough dishwashers for close and I never stayed that late again.",

            "Wait so they got the dishwasher to sub for the busboy so the busboy could work as a dishwasher?? What the fuck",
            "I used to work in banquets. Started as an on-call server and worked my way up to manager. Did it for almost 20 years. First off, good for you for sticking up for yourself. Second, I would NEVER let anyone on my team speak to the pit crew like that. The whole F&B department would be shit without them. \n\nI have never heard of carts and bus tubs being used to clear tables. We used the big oval trays in every hotel I worked at, and you\u2019d better believe those trays were in order. Plates were scraped (trimmings were left on top of the plates), silverware was separated in to three separate piles along the sides of the tray and if you could fit some glassware, then that\u2019s a bonus. After they were brought to the back, servers were required to take off the silverware (a lot made it in to the rubbish bin), rack their own glassware and scrape food of the plates as much as possible as quickly as possible. \n\nTypically a single server has three tables with a max of 12 people at each for a sit down and up to five tables of 12 for buffet. Depending on whether it was sit down or buffet would determine how many plates and such would be used. The less trays you use, the less times you have to walk back and forth from FOH to BOH. Which meant the quicker the servers could get cut to do their side work and then go home. \n\nRegardless if I was a server, a captain or the manager everything was timed. Meaning each course went out at a certain time and with each clearing, whatever was used during that course had to be removed as well. After a certain point, the only acceptable things on tables were water glasses or drinks from the bar. \n\nIf the pit were that backed up at any point, management, servers and the like would have to roll up their sleeves and get in on the action. Dishwashers were hourly at a higher rate than the servers and captains, meaning the dishwashers OT would be more per hour than management. If they knew they would have 400 more covers that night, they would have had the budget to schedule at least one more person in the pit. The servers had their hourly, plus a portion of the gratuity charged to the client. So their OT would be the same as minimum wage for a non-tipped position. (Don\u2019t worry, with the gratuity the servers would be making anywhere from $12-$35 an hour because they tip pooled all the grat on a weekly basis. Should also note this was at least eight years ago or so)\n\nShame on that banquet team for not pre bussing. Shame on the banquet manager for shitting on you. Shame on management not jumping in the pit and bringing in additional help when they knew they would have a lot more covers that night.",
            "Yeah, I'm not spending the night here buddy. I have a bus to catch. If I miss the bus, you'll be paying me all night.",
            "Isn't it kinda nuts that both the managers make much more money than the staff, but if they hadn't shown up at all everything would have run smoothly but if one dishwasher leaves just on time the whole operation shuts down?",
            "As an ex chef of 20 years, one thing front of house never learn is DONT FUCK WITH THE POT WASHERS!!!\n\nThese guys who get paid the lowest of the low are fucking absolute warriors. Chefs treat good pot washers like rocking horse shit because of how valuable they are, you make sure when you put stuff on there benches it's organised, tidy, stacked properly and you for damn sure they get smoke brakes and get fed. If they're in the shit and you've got a spare few minutes, you damn well better know we'd be jumping in and helping them clear the shit storm. \n\nA happy dish pit is a happy kitchen, I've had full on blazing rows with managers well above my pay grade for how badly the front of house team and front of house managers treated pot washers.",
            "I'm wondering if the banquet people leaving dishes to the last minute meant that the night dishwashers stayed late, or if there were always dishes left the next morning. If they started doing their jobs correctly, did that also have a positive effect on the next morning crew?\n\nI once worked a job at the Chinese hot food section in a grocery store. Night closers started at 5 pm, dealt with the dinner rush, put away remaining food to make cold to-go containers the next day, and cleaned the case, did the dishes, took trash to the back, and cleaned floors and surfaces, and turned off lights on our way out.\n\nThere was a daytime person who worked 8 to 5. She was the first one in. She turned on the lights, made to-go containers from saved food, and started serving customers who decided that what they absolutely needed at 9 am was the best grocery store chow mein in town. Over the course of the day, the daytime cooks made food and she served customers. When there were dishes, cooks would serve food if there was one customer while she did dishes, then call her upif there was a line.\n\nTwo or three nights a week, I did the night job. On Saturday and Sunday, I did the daytime job. We had a very nice balance with just the right number of servers and cooks. Our manager did five days a week as a cook, including taking weekend shifts. He trusted us to make decisions and never criticized us afterwards if we made the wrong decision, just gently suggested what might be better next time. He listened when we had ideas for improving things (most of us were college kids) and put the best ideas into practice. If you wanted time off, he found a way to make it work. The overall manager for our section and the deli was around, but mostly kept her hands off. It was hard work, but it was great (especially compared to the deli manager, who was a nightmare).\n\nThen the weekday lady needed a week off to go on vacation with her husband. She asked me if I wanted to do her shift, which I was happy to do because it was summer and money. I couldn't work my evening shifts or weekend shifts, so the others covered that. It worked, until one night later in the week when our manager had to schedule the cooks to do our job, because no one else was available.\n\nThe next morning, the place was a wreck. The garbage wasn't taken out. There were a bunch of dirty dishes. The case wasn't wiped out and the floors weren't cleaned. There are intense levels of heat in this place and the way we keep it clean is by cleaning it every night. Over the course of the day, a lot of that stuff baked on. I was pissed.\n\nOur store happened to be one of the first ones ever built and the corporate offices were in our city. We were also one of the highest performing stores, so the corporate guys loved to just swing by. They came through often enough that they actually got to recognize some of us. Guess when they decided to come chum around with the store manager? I'm watching as they come walking through. They stop and see the pig sty, with me just standing in the middle of it. Luckily, they got that I had just gotten there and it wasn't my fault. Also, our great manager got pissed with the cooks and they had to stay some extra cleaning shifts.",

            "I was a manager in several hotels for years across different brands and management companies. I have seen this same stuff happen. I have also seen the manager in the dish pit catching stuff up. \n\nYes, managers are incentivized on cost/productivity. But, if that shit happens to you, go to the Sales and Catering Manager responsible for booking and planning that event. They will raise holy HELL to everyone! \n\nThey get bonus on customer satisfaction and return business. If the banquet staff f**d up my hard-won event, I would go nuts and make sure EVERYONE knew they better staff that shit right.\n\nYes, Sales ppl can be jackasses. But, they can also be your best ally because they are considered the money-making department. What they say carries more weight, even though back of house should get just as much reaction.",

The rule we have is for them to bring back all of their dishes to the pit no later than 45 mins before shift change. Otherwise, they're the ones staying late to wash them.

I must have quit on the spot about 3 or 4 times.  \n\nA kid would barf in the booth, and the manager would call me out onto the dining floor (where I wasn't allowed if on dishes) to clean it.  \"I quit, bye.\"  they they would make someone else do it, lest the dishes all pile up without a dishwasher.  \n\nWhen I did work the dining room, after a 4-6 hour shift, the manager would reach into a coffee can full of cash, pull out 3 or 4 bucks and offer that as my tip for bussing tables.  \"I quit, you wont see me tomorrow\".

I worked as a cook for about 2 or 3 days, when the kitchen manager (my boss, nice lady) told me that the two people she had in the dish area were not really working, and asked me to go over and 'help' them. It turned out that these two were just talking and playing grab-ass rather than working. \n\nI knew nothing about the setup but I took over and started shoving dishes at them to run through the machine. Pretty soon, I ended up taking over the dish area but kept my pay as a cook (at the time it was like $10 an hour) and since it was on the Navy base, Government labor rules dictated that overtime was paid for any time worked past 8 hours on the clock, not 40 hours, so that was a nice bonus.\n\nEventually, one of the dishwashers left and moved to California, the other one got pregnant (her husband was enlisted) so she 'couldn't do dishes any more' so I was left as the only dishwasher for around 5 or 6 years, they would give me help every so often, but for the most part I was on my own. \n\nNow we were not a full-time operation, during the week they might have meetings, change of command ceremonies, or retirements, and on Saturday we always had weddings of 150-200 people.

        "selftext": "So this isn't malicious compliance in the exact sense of the word but pretty much the same effect.\n\nI (26m) started my first job after college 3.5 years ago. I was hired with a group of 25 people. I used to run a lot of clubs in college and had this I need to finish my job as best as I possibly can attitude when I first joined. I was good at what I did and put in considerably more work than other people who joined with me. Another huge motivation behind this was that since the initial pay wasn't good enough, I wanted to impress with my work and get a really good raise at the end of the year. \n\nSo throughout the year, I kept working late hours, stayed at the office for 10+ hours on a regular. The way our work dynamic was I was the only one under my manager and we were both supposed to share the work on the projects. And slowly and steadily my manager started noticing I'm taking up extra stuff and he started offloading his work onto me too. Now I was essentially doing my own job and half of his job as well and had reduced the time it took to do those things by at least 40%. I was stressed and overworked but was getting exceptional weekly ratings so I felt it was worth it. How naive I was.\n\nAppraisal time came and I went into the one on one with my manager. This guy tells me that while I have one of the best performance ratings in the company, they're not allowed to give freshers a huge raise and I received the same raise that others who joined with me did by doing the bare minimum. I was pissed. I told me manager that since the company has declared me average, that he should expect average performance from now on. He laughed there thinking I was kidding. I wasn't.\n\nNext day onwards, every task that would be done in 2 hours now needs 8. Won't stay in the office for more than the agreed upon 8.5 hours. Won't finish up lunch quickly to get some more work done. Won't do any of your job for you. 'oh the client is asking for this document that I prepared in an hour? Sorry an average person wouldn't do it in less than four so I'm going to keep it with me while I take the next three hours to figure out how to update the table of contents (it takes 3 clicks btw)'. Oh there's something you need to ask after work hours? Sorry, it'll have to wait till tomorrow.\n\n Complaints started coming in quick about the delays in deliverables. Manager started spending a lot of time frustrated because he wasn't very good to begin with and now I wasn't taking up his workload. I spent the entire year working 2 hours a day while I spent the rest of the time listening to music, browsing reddit and watching him struggle. Left at the end of the year for a job that paid 3 times the salary. Some details of our projects get published online and last I checked this guy was running 7-8 months behind on some of the projects and, from what I heard from some of my friends in the company, didn't get any raise last year.",

            "There's a great story online about a welder who saw an ad for a welding job that paid $18-$28/hour. When he applied for the job, they asked him to turn in an example of his welding.\n\nWell, he goes and turns in two examples instead of one. The first is an ugly misshapen mess of a weld that, while technically held together, is utterly unsuitable for professional level work. The second example, on the other hand, is an absolutely beautiful smooth, even seam, perfectly joining two pieces of metal with the minimum amount of flux necessary.\n\nThe hiring manager, of course, asks him what the deal is with these two examples. He points to the misshapen weld, and says \"That's an $18 weld.\" He then points to the beautiful weld, and says, \"That's a $28 weld.\n \nMoral of the story?

            "Had a situation like this at my last real job before going self-employed. Did tech support at a company that promised me they\u2019d be creating a tier 2 support position in the next few months and it would go to me once I was up to speed. \n\nFast forward a year and a half and I\u2019d earned the trust of all the dev teams and was doing lots of coding fixes that the regular support people couldn\u2019t do. That job never materialized but they kept promising. \n\nMy boss\u2019s office was right next to my cube. One day I overheard her talking to someone about how it would be at least six more months, if ever, that they officially promoted me because that place was a dumpster fire and they couldn\u2019t afford to take me off of low level bullshit. \n\nDecided that day I was going full time with a hobby I had that was making more monthly than my day job, and spent the next two months doing exactly my job description. Then I handed in my notice when my boss pulled me in to discuss \u201cmy decreased performance and bad attitude with management\u201d that resulted from having zero fucks to give.",
            "The company I used to work for measured our performance with a, \"needs improvement, successful, or over performing\" grading scale. In 4 years I was always successful, could and did the whole job above my pay grade, and the final year received over performing. They denied a promotion 3 years in a row stating each year that \"promotions don't happen for a single good year.\" Needless to say I work elsewhere now.",
            "I did this exactly too... Worked for 3yrs on hourly. Two guys quit, I picked up the workload. They never back filled those positions and I worked 65-70hrs for a couple years.  I make alot of extra money (about double my regular 40hr/wk wage)\n\nFinally they decided that I was racking up too much overtime. \n\nSo, the have me a \"promotion\" from being an hourly support tech to being a salaried administrator job.  (I had been doing BOTH jobs for last two years).  \n\nHere's the catch... My support tech salary was something like $45k. But with all the OT I was making $90k the last two years.  My new \"promotion\" was $55k/yr... But no overtime because I was now an \"exempt\" employee. They called it a promotion because it was $10k more than my 40hr/wk salary....even though I had never once only worked 40hrs in 3 years. \n\nThey wanted me to keep doing the same job I had been doing (for 90k) now for $55k.  \n\nSo... You pay me 60% of what I made last year, expect the same work and call it a \"promotion\". \n\nNope. \n\nI started working 8-5 like all the other salaried office weasels.  No OT, no weekends, no coming in early, no staying late.   I an emergency happened and I went over then I came in late the next day. \n\nThey noticed... And didn't understand why I wasn't appreciative of my promotion.  \n\nI got fired.  They hired TWO folks to replace me and paid one of them 55k and the other one 65k. \n\nLOL",

            "British Aerospace (BAES) had a performance scheme where our salary varied between 80 - 120% of average for your grade and you got pay rises depending on your annual appraisal and where your current salary sat between the 80-120%.   I got promoted into my new grade and my salary sat at 80%.  Fair enough.  Then I got given a job that should have been done by another grade higher.  My time to shine and I worked by socks off.  It showed because I got graded A at my next appraisal.\n\n\nGrade A and sat at 80%? \"Woo hoo, here come the big bucks\".  Then I got my pay rise.  A 3% raise that everyone got plus a 2% performance raise.  Worked out yet just how long I would have to be working at a A grade before I got paid *just* at a C grade?  10 years.  How long would I have to be performing at an A grade before I got paid an A grade salary?  20 years.\n\n\nYes I was pissed.  So I went to my boss and told him I was not prepared to work at a grade above my grade at 82% grade salary, so give me a proper pay rise, a promotion or move me to a new lower grade job.  The answer was basically \"I hear what you say, but my hands are tied\".  Whilst I was waiting for the answer I went searching for a new job, so all I did in response was thank him for his 'assistance', reached into my pocket and handed over a letter of resignation.  My new job got me a pay rise of 50%.\n\n(Edit. They tried to get me to withdraw my resignation, but I refused telling them my resignation was a resignation, not a negotiating ploy.)\n\nIn case you have not realised it yet, Fuck You British Aerospace (BAES).\n\n\n(P.S.

            "I had a similar situation. I worked IT at a title company where, for a while, there was a side project that basically allowed unlimited OT (dealing with digitization of old documents). I was single at the time so instead of complaining about my crappy regular rate of pay, I just worked about 30 hours OT/week. In addition to that, during my regular work hours, our metrics showed that I literally did double the help tickets the next closest IT dude did AND handled some side projects that needed doing. Suddenly, and for no reason given (the owner was a cheapskate and figured he could pay someone less to do it I think), they cut off the OT. By then, I was about 2 months overdue for a yearly review and raise and I asked for it and said I needed at least 10% or so because of all that I did, the loss of OT, and because \"I can't afford to live on the base hours alone.\" My boss replied \"Maybe you should get a roommate.\" I shot back \"Maybe I should find a new job.\" Within a week, I had an offer making almost twice as much and was out. I think I gave them like 4 days notice and at my exit interview gave my reason for leaving as \"I could make more money with less stress delivering pizzas. The way this place is managed, it'll be out of business in a couple of years.\" Sure enough, I was right.",
            "I feel this so much.\n\nI worked at an office job where I had to simply run spreadsheets and update clients' accounts. About a year into my six-year term I ended up automating about 98% of my workload. I could get work done in one hour that would take some people the entire day, or even longer. Most of the bigger workloads would get handed to me as well, stuff that manually would take months to accomplish, which I would complete in a week or two.\n\nWell. I managed to also consistently score high in QA and one year I got 100% all year in QA. I didn't get a single raise that year. I was pissed. The year after, I got a $0.05 pro-rated raise since the minimum wage went up and the company decided to prorate our raises.\n\nIt was at that point where I slowed my roll and started completing just as much as everyone else, in just as much time as everyone else. Things quickly started to back up, the client became very angry, and their customers got frustrated with us. Oh well, no raises for me in 3 years? Fuck you. And because most of the people around me were complete dodo heads that couldn't learn BASIC, there was no one to take my place. My other 3 cohorts who knew how to do what I did left for better jobs.\n\nThe company crumbled and is now dead, but that's because they refused their contractual renewal with their client and then couldn't find a new one to take its place, because they were that fucking dumb.",

Well when the one year review came around they went on about how great I was and how they felt I was the best employee the company had ever had in the entire time it existed. After the glowing review they tell me that the owner wants to save money and won\u2019t let anyone get the full potential raise anymore and that I\u2019m getting $0.25 an hour. I said \u201cThank you the review and i\u2019ll be looking for a new job.\u201d The new job paid about 5 times more with way less stress.\n\nMoral of the story is that no company cares. Just do what\u2019s right for you.\n\nEdit: spelling. Maybe that\u2019s why I got the shit raise\u2026.",
            "well yes, they want to to super perform but not pay you for it, this is what they get. Why work hard when you get the same as the ones who don't? The company comes out ahead and you don't. Screw them",

            "Frankly, I think more workers need to adopt this attitude. There are far too many companies who take advantage of people who put in 150% for the \"chance\" at a promotion and/or higher pay that the company has zero intention of ever offering. I wish I'd had an understanding of this when I entered the workforce in my 20's. I had that overachiever mindset for over a decade, where if I wasn't performing above expectations, then in my mind I was failing. In school it had served me very well, in the workforce I now understand I set myself up to be taken for granted and used for everything they could while giving me \"raises\" of a few cents a year and \"promotions\" that only benefitted them. Fuck that.",

            "I have gotten so lucky with my managers over the years.  Had one guy tell me that he didn't like giving perfect reviews because he always felt there was something people could improve on but he had noticed me around doing lots of other people's jobs including excelling at my own and he ended up giving me a perfect review and the highest raise the company would allow.  Had another one nominate me for an employee of the quarter after working there for two months.  That one didn't come with a raise but being recognized, and seeing other managers in that meeting that I'd been helping outside of my department nod as he praised my work, felt very nice.  The ones that recognize hard work make it feel so much more worth it.",
            "I had something similar to this several years ago.  I had been with the company for a few years and transferred to a different plant to help them improve their performance.  I was rocking it too; exceeding goals well before the deadlines, implementing much needed process improvements, all this good stuff.  Review time came and although I rocked the appraisal, my raise was the same that everyone else got because the company decided that since the entire plant's performance was a compilation of everyone's performance, everyone would get the same raise.  So I got the same pitiful raise that the biggest slacker that avoided getting fired got.  I immediately stopped overly caring about performance.  I just needed to avoid getting fired or written up.  It's been pretty much the same ever since.",
            "When I was once a manager many years ago I was tasked by my boss to do reviews on the 27 employees we managed. The review was based in just checking boxes that confirmed that the employee was keeping up with compliance, daily tasks, getting along with clients on site and showing up on time, simple stuff but not everybody could manage to do all of this stuff hence the reviews and subsequent mentoring. One guy out of 27 went above and beyond and I scored him as 100 on the review because he was rocking his job and checked all the boxes. I congratulated him, told him he was doing great and left to submit the reviews to my boss.. I get a call later from her telling me I had to redo his review because nobody should be scoring 100. Fuck that shit and nobody told me that was what was expected from the reviews of their work. I let her redo the review and give him the bad news. I left that shit job soon after, thats no way to treat someone's hard work.",

Don't work for free. Charge the company for every minute that you work. Not only does this benefit you, but it really does help the company as well.

Cos I swapped very close to the appraisal window.\n\nSame company that denied me going from 18k to 20k when I got promoted to team leader because salary increases \"cannot exceed 5%\" AFTER my manager agreed to it in the interview. I left shortly after, they asked what my new salary was in some half arsed counter offer  play but when I said 25k they went oh no, can't go that high.\n\nI've been in the industry long enough to know they just don't care about customer service as they're too big to fail basically.",

I've taught countless others who have came up the ranks. I'm really good at my job and give out advice to everyone from new boot CO'S to the warden. However, I've been getting fucked for the last 5 years. Usually our most senior sergeants end up on first shift(545am-230pm). Currently there are 4 positions on 1st shift. Two of them are filled with absolute garbage. They both show up late everyday, usually after 7am, or just call out. The wardens notice, all of the upper administration notice, yet nothing happens to them. I have more time than them by a long shot and I never call out. Ive been placed on 13 differnet shifts in the last 4 years to help clean up their fuck ups. I've been stabbed, shit, piss an God knows what else thrown on me... Yet here I am stuck working nights. I've gotten to the point I've said fuck it I'm not doing their work for them anymore. Inmates will have set fires or flooded out their housing area and I could not give a single fuck.

A fair arrangement of reward for working above and beyond - especially taking on the work of the roles at pay levels I\u2019d never be considered for - existed only in my mind.\n\nWe were indoctrinated by parents, teachers, coaches, media figures, authors, mentors\u2026 *people we fucking trusted*, to believe working at our highest ability and waiting patiently without complaint would pay off one day.\n\nWhat I had to realize was that *the company* didn\u2019t agree to this! They happily accepted my overtime and emotional labor and intellectual property. As a donation. A volunteer effort.\n\nEveryone quits, but the shareholders just shrug, and figure all must be well when the workload of 6 full time boomers being paid a living wage is now being handled better and faster by 1 millennial working parent who barely scrapes by.\n\nWhat we have to really internalize now is that our employers *never* had any plans to reward us in any measurable way.\n\nThe company values our output and will suffer without it, it\u2019s true. But why should they worry? The capitalists always win at capitalism: a few loyal workhorses with Stockholm syndrome will compensate for the company\u2019s many failures. Yes, they will eventually work themselves into an early grave.\n\nAnd then when the company can no longer function without workers, they will be exposed. A top heavy company with no skills or labor, will fail to produce whatever it is it exists to produce. \n\nAnd then, we\u2019ll finally see justice! They shall have their comeuppance!\n\nNope.

My brothers called her \"V\" because her first name begins with \"V,\" so I'll refer to her as \"V.\"\n\nThis happened many years ago, about the time I graduated from high school. V had taken a job (her first since she and my dad got married) in a public kindergarten. Now my dad was always a bit of a bully, especially towards my mother. My dad was not a nice person, and that's a whole story in itself.\n\nV had survived ovarian cancer at the age of 33, so she was probably about 38/39 when this happened. Now my dad insisted that if she was going to hold down a job, she still had to do all her \"chores\" when she got home.....cooking, cleaning, laundry etc.  I can't remember exactly what prompted the argument about her \"chores,\" but something didn't get done that he expected and demanded that she do. He informed her that she WOULD tell her boss that she was quitting when she went back to work the next day. Before he left for work the next day, he reminded her that she was to tell her boss that she was quitting.\n\nCue \"malicious compliance.\" I loved my mom.  She went to work that morning, stopped at her boss's office, and said these exact words....\"My husband said to tell you that I was quitting,\" and then moseyed on to her classroom.  A few minutes later, her very puzzled boss popped in and asked her if she was serious. She said \"no, but my husband told me to tell you I was quitting, so I did.\"  And no.....she didn't quit her job until she was good and ready, several years later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I can't believe how this has blown up.

            "I\u2019ve read some of your comments, and damn it is heartbreaking. My wife and I have always made sure she prioritizes her career, even if that means we have to make sacrifices in our shared goals. Her mom recently went through a divorce with her dad, who she had sacrificed everything for to make sure he could focus on making his business successful. Neither of us can even entertain the thought of being divorced because we truly love each other, but are both very aware of that fact that we simply don\u2019t know what the future holds; I could die, or either of us could change, who knows\u2026 Prioritizing her career is not just because we want her to feel financially capable of supporting herself and our future children, but also because we both want our love for each other to be a choice, and not forced due to circumstances. Stories like this remind me how important that is, even if it means us packing up our bags tomorrow and moving away from my family to make sure she remains satisfied in her career. I love that woman :)",

            "While reading this was pleasant. I felt terrible reading the comments. \n\nIt's amazing how two mothers from entirely different parts of the world can marry similarly. \n\nMy father was the same way and was abusive his whole life. \n\nHe still is. And was a long time alcoholic and is an ex con. \n\nThere was also a time where, just like your mother did, mine \"let him back into our lives\" it was miserable and basically destroyed us. \n\nSeveral years later me and her are still dealing with the fallout of the damages he caused. But we take each and every day with happiness and love and grace. \n\nSometimes me and my mom heckle but for the most part we maintain a good relationship. \n\nAll the rest of my family is toxic and she's all I got. She is 63 and has been chronically ill since ~30-32. \n\nSo idk what kind of time left I have with her. I'm praying she lives to be 89 like your mom. I want those 26 more years like nobody knows. \n\nThat's why I'm trying my best to improve myself and our lives and make sure she enjoys what happiness she can. \n\nCheers to ur mom.
