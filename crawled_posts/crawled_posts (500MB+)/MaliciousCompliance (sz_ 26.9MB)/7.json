        "selftext": "This happened last week. I was swimming laps at an indoor pool near my house. I\u2019m a woman who has had a double mastectomy without reconstruction. My chest is flat. I\u2019m totally comfortable with how I look but prefer for my scars to be covered in public. As far as swimming goes women\u2019s suits have extra material to accommodate typical chests so when I wear them they\u2019re baggy. For backyard swimming I just use a couple safety pins to keep it in place. For lap swimming it balloons open like a parachute full of water and creates so much drag that it\u2019s difficult to swim. Tight competition swim suits don\u2019t have enough coverage for the way the scars wrap around my sides under my arms. To get around this I wear running shorts and a tight fitting full coverage synthetic fabric dark colored tank top. It works great. \n\nLast week I was approached as I left the pool facility by a worker. He said that they had received a complaint that a woman in the pool was wearing a shirt, which is allowed, but no sports bra underneath. He then said their policy requires women who are not in swim suits to have sports bras under their shirt. He told me that the policy started when they had a problem where a woman would come in to swim and only wear a thin white shirt and no bra in the pool during family swim hours. \n\nI explained politely that I\u2019ve had a double mastectomy and do not need a bra. I said that swimsuits don\u2019t fit me and my top is very dark and not see through plus even if it was see through all anyone would see are scars. He said he understood and felt bad but the management requires that the dress code be followed. I explained how I was much more covered up than anyone else in the pool and in fact was wearing exactly what he was minus the whistle - he was in shorts and a tank top. There were guys in there with just tight fitting swim bottoms on and women in bikinis. I look Amish next to them. He again said he was sorry but couldn\u2019t make an exception to the rules. I asked for the rules in writing and he gave me a printout which did say what he was telling me. \n\nThis brings us to yesterday. I dug a sports bra out of a bin of old clothes and brought it with me. I wore the same shorts and top otherwise. When I got in the water I put the band of the bra around my head with the straps sticking up like bunny ears. People in the other lanes got a kick out of it once I explained what I was doing. I started warming up with my kickboard thinking the guy would come over and we would sort this nonsense out. \n\nWell, a lady in business clothes comes over and tells me I need to take the bra off my head. I would like to say here that this was adult lap swim, there were no kids in the pool area. I explained it all to her and said I was following the rule to the letter. I was wearing a bra which is all that is required. We went back and forth with her saying I knew it had to be worn \u2018normally\u2019. I said I couldn\u2019t wear it the way others do because I don\u2019t have anything to fill it and it would ride up to my chin while swimming without anything to hold it in place. She said I could use skin safe glue! Yeah, no. I\u2019m not going to glue unnecessary garments to my body and I told her as much. \n\nI finally said that unless she could state the rule I was breaking that I would like to continue with my workout so I could get home to my kids and let the babysitter go home. She walked away. I swam for an hour with that bra perched on my head (lots of readjusting it and once retrieving it from the bottom of the pool) then showered and went home. \n\nThis morning I checked my email, which is linked to my membership at the aquatic center, to find a message from her. They will not be changing their policies but I have been granted a special exception to the rule provided I wear continue to wear non see through tops. I wish they would have just gotten rid of the silly bra rule but I\u2019ll take this and if I ever see another woman struggling with their swimsuit over a flat chest I\u2019ll let them know they can wear something more comfortable. \n\nTLDR: I\u2019ve had a double mastectomy and was told I had to wear a sports bra in the pool so I wore it on my head.\n\nEdit: thank you very much for the gold and award!\n\nAnother edit: whoa! I just finished getting my kids ready and checked Reddit. Thank you so much for the upvotes and awards. I was hesitant to post this but now I\u2019m so glad I did.\n\nYet another: I can\u2019t believe how this blew up. I have tears in my eyes reading the wonderful supportive comments. Thank you, truly, you\u2019ve made me feel amazing. I will always keep my elastic tiara in my swim bag just in case.",

            "This is very reminiscent of my mother. She was an RN and her nursing home dress code was ARCHAIC, they still could only wear white head to toe, white stocking, white nursing cap, and this was the 90s so it was dated even then. She hated the nursing caps, so she found the smallest flimsiest cap and folded up as small as she could, and every day pinned it to the back of her hair so you could barely see it. It looked ridiculous, but I respected it. Thank you for reminding me of her. And for standing up for yourself. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nEdit: Thank you for the award and the upvotes.

She had hers partially reconstructed but there were complications, so if I remember right she still doesn\u2019t have nipples. Just a line across each breast from where she had implants inserted and skin rebuilt. I remember she had so much confidence still after chemo and surgery. We had a girls weekend with her near Christmas time and she was bald from chemo. She was still beautiful and would do her makeup and dress just the same as if she were healthy. We went to a play and a woman noticed her in passing while we were waiting in the lobby of the theater. She had taken her hat off so everyone could see she was bald. I was standing next to her. The woman who noticed her stopped and paid her a compliment that I will never forget (I was 9ish at the time). She said, \u201cI just wanted to tell you that you are a beautiful woman.\u201d I have never forgotten that. That woman didn\u2019t have to stop and say that. She was mixed in with the crowd bustling through the lobby going on about her way. But, she made a point to walk over and say such a nice thing to my aunt and that really just warmed my heart.

Every other week I'd get calls by a tradie who wanted to know why I wasn't \"on site, mate\", or \"what I wanted done with building project ABC ..\".\n\n\n\nEvery time I explained at length that they got the wrong number and quite often folks on the other end were absolute rude or thought I was taking the piss and insist I answered their questions or show up \"on site, NOW\".\n\n\n\nI was over it, so I googled my own number and did some digging and eventually found out the guy who had my number before, then his new number and then I called him. I politely explained my dilemma, pointed out that there were two websites still having his old (my now new) number and if he could please change this and let his contacts know about his new number and to delete the old one as it was getting quite tedious for me. By that time I had used my number for work, visa applications and landlords and friends and changing it would have been a huge pain. I explained all of that.\n\n\n\nWell, of course he was just as pleasant as most of his contacts and told me something along the lines of \"I don't give a fuck, mate, that's not my fucking problem. Get fucked, sort your own shot out, mate.\"\n\n\n\nWell, the universe provides and so I got a great opportunity to do just that only a few weeks later. \n\n\n\nI received a call in the early hours of one morning by another disgruntled guy telling me he was early and demanding to know where I wanted the sand put down and how to get in. I asked what sand and was told he had a full truckload of sand as ordered and no one was on-site and it was all fenced off. \n\n\n\nVery briefly did I think about launching into my explanation but I was tired and over it and then realised the opportunity provided, I snapped back at him with no uncertainty: \"Mate, it's all good, dump it all right in the driveway, front of the fence, we'll sort it out when we get there\"\n\n\n\nThe guy said: \"You sure mate? It's a lot of sand.\"\nMe: \"Absolutely sure mate, thanks a lot\"\nHim: \"Alright then boss\" and hangs up.\n\n\n\nWell, I go back to bed, snoozing for another hour with a big smile until my phone rings again and I see it's old mate with his new number who I had saved when I called him a few weeks ago. I pick up rather chipper and he doesn't waste anytime launching into a series of swear words and how he has no access to the site and that he has to move a literal tonne of sand by hand and whether or not I told the sand guy to dump it all there.\n\n\n\nI replied: \"You told me to sort this out myself, this is me sorting this out. You can remove the numbers and let your contacts know or not. Totally up to you. Mate.\"\n\n\n\nHe was fuming, called me a few more choice words, promising to find me and a lot more before we ended the conversation. However the numbers disappeared from the internet really quickly after that and I never got another call again, I still have my number and every time I see a truck with sand I chuckle to myself thinking of this guy moving a tonne of sand by hand and losing a fair few hours of labour because he was a douchebag and couldn't be bothered sending a few texts.\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Got someone's old number, tried to ask them to let his contacts know and was cussed out and told to sort it myself. Guy ends up shovelling a tonne of sand by hand and losing at least a half day of labour.",

            "Let me tell the tale if \"Virgil\".\n\nWhen I moved to where I live now in 2008, I had my cell number changed to a local cell number.  Apparently the number they gave me used to belong to Virgil.  \n\nIt seems Virgil owns some sort of ballroom/dancehall/club.\n\nI would get calls about it all the time, and I'd explain that they had the wrong number.  However, I also got personal calls and texts to Virgil.  I always told them they had the wrong number.  A few would get short with me, but whatever.\n\nAfter a few months of this, it was growing annoying.  When a person called about reserving the ballroom, I told her she had the wrong number but I would like to know the name of the business so I could contact them.\n\nShe obliged and I Googled it.  Sure enough, there was my number.\n\nSo, I emailed them.  I went on Facebook and messaged them.  I never got a response and they never changed the number.\n\nSo, I decided to play the game.\n\nno matter who called about the ballroom, I asked them their race.  No matter their answer, I told them that I don't take reservation from whatever race they happened to be, or if they didn't give the race I told them I wasn't taking the chance on them being one of the \"forbidden races\"\n\nMore than once, i had people threaten to come to the ballroom to inflict harm upon \"Virgil\".  And every time, I welcomed them.  I told them they didn't have the guts.\n\nI wish it stopped at that, but it seems Virgil was in debt to the tune of $400K.  I assume those were all business debts.  When the collectors called, I explained that they had they wrong number but you know they hear it all the time.  They would threaten to sue and I told them to just do it because they weren't going to see a dime of that money from me.\n\nThen his insurance company called.  Virgil was the perpetrator of a hit and run incident.  To the credit of the insurance company, they actually understood my dilemma and never called back after I notified them of the number mix up.\n\nDuring the pandemic, I stopped getting the calls.\n\nBecause Virgil went out of business.\n\nI would like to think that I helped, but it was likely because nobody could fucking call the business.",

I called the taxi firm and they said not my problem deal with it. I used to say you had the wrong number etc. until they said that. So cue revenge. I then started telling people I was just round the corner erc. people started getting more and more abusive. I took a call at 2am from a bloke saying they had just landed and where the fuck was I. I replied stuck in a bit of traffic be about 15mins. 30 mins later another call where the fuck are you its freezing here, still stuck in traffic there's been an accident on the motorway. An hr later yet another call saying if I didn't pick them up soon they would call another firm. I politely told them that was a good idea as I was going back to bed and they could go fuck themselves.\nI then started seeing reviews about the taxi firm being useless, not turning up, and being very rude to their customers. Eventually the owner of the firm realised it was me doing and rang me up threatening me, I told him this would continue to happen until he sorted out the number listed. The number was changed on the website but the damage was done, and the firm went belly up a few months later as none of the locals would use them.",

            "A few years back, I started getting text messages from H&R Block about my \"upcoming appointment with a tax preparer\". That's weird, because I've had the same mobile phone number for roughly 20 years now and I've never had my taxes done professionally. So I called the location from the message and tried to explain to them that somebody had given them the wrong number and that I wanted them to look in their system at whoever had that appointment time and delete my number from their contact information. Apparently, no can do. They told me to contact the appointment holder to get them to update their information like I somehow magically would know these people and how to get a hold of them. I'm like dude, **you** don't even have their contact information. So they gave me a number for corporate, but I called and got the same runaround. I gave up. It wasn't worth the hassle.\n\nThe following year, I get another message about my upcoming appointment. I ignored it because I got nowhere with them the year before. But wait! This year they got their refund advanced to them on a debit card, which means I started getting text notifications every time they made a purchase. It told me where, how much, and remaining balance.\n\nThe year after that, same thing **again** with the appointment and debit card notifications. I had the conversation muted, so I wasn't getting audible alert tones, but it was still annoying waiting for them to run out of money so the messages would stop\n\nFinally, the fourth year I caught a break. I got a different type of message when the appointment was drawing near: a text asking me to confirm my appointment. H&R Block had upgraded their text messaging system to one that accepts responses. I got really excited when I saw \"Reply STOP 2 end\" because I was finally going to be able to opt out and end the alerts for good. But alas, the universe had bigger plans for me. I was also presented with the option to reply CANCEL. So, being the considerate person that I am, I did just that. A week later another message shows up asking me to confirm my appointment, but this time for a different date. They must have rescheduled when they showed up to the original appointment and found themselves without a time slot. So I cancelled that one too. The evening of the second appointment, I get *another* message asking me to confirm what is now appointment number three. Yep, cancelled that one too. Third time was the charm. They must have finally figured out they had the wrong number because I never got another message again.\n\nCould I have just replied STOP and put an end to the misery? Sure, but that 1) wouldn't have been as fun, 2) wouldn't get my phone number disassociated from their account,  and most importantly 3) wouldn't have been nearly as satisfying as wasting their time on three separate occasions",

For another, our records software required us to have at least one phone number on record for each patient, so I couldn't just delete her number off this file without entering a replacement.

So I arrive with my two kids, to find that my tenants are still at home, along with the husband, the newborn and the other sister's boyfriend. So that's 7 people in a small kitchen already. Then the first prospective tenants start arriving. Husbands, wives, with kids, and some showing up early so there's two sets of them. That's 14 people in a small kitchen...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd I'm a mom. I have magical powers. So I'm holding my toddler, my daughter is safely under the dining table coloring, and I'm chatting with the prospective tenants and directing traffic while my actual tenants prepare to depart. If you didn't know this already, it's common practice in the US to leave the premises during real estate or apartment showings. This was their first apartment, so I actually emailed them ahead of time to let them know what is generally expected at showings (e.g. a relatively tidy apartment, and that they can leave, for their own convenience).   \n\n\nThey do eventually leave, after the boyfriend tells a prospective tenant that he, in fact, ALSO lives there. And I carry on with an exhausting scheduling of showings. And have my new tenants all picked out and lease signed by the next day. Awesome, right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next night, I get a voicemail from the husband (who is NOT my tenant). I saved it, and just listed to it again, because it still gives me that same delightful shiver of malicious compliance..  In his voicemail, he told me how awful it was that MY children touched HIS infant's things (they didn't, because I keep my kids entertained with magical mommy toys, but prospective tenants also brought children), and how they had to sterilize everything to keep their infant from being sick, and how inconvenient it was to have showings with only 2 days notice, and how very unprofessional I was to bring my children, and *asked if I could just be more professional in the future*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can hear it, can't you? The deep shiver of malicious compliance vibrating through my offended being.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next morning, I started issuing *professional* Lease Violation Notices. One for the extra residents of the unit (hubby and boyfriend). One for the extra dog. And a few additional ones for building concerns I noted during the showings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey ignored the violation notice, which I sent by certified mail and, thoughtfully, also by email. I decided to be even *more* professional 30 days later, and issue a 5-day notice to vacate. And I called their mom, who is their emergency contact, as an eviction notice IS an emergency. Did I mention that their lease was due to end just a few weeks later?  But it would be unprofessional of me to let these violations slide until then..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThree days later, they'd magically sent me all the information I'd requested, removed the other dog, licensed the first dog, gotten the required pet insurance...   \n\n\nThey moved out on their lease termination date. And skipped out on their last electric bill, and left the unit in damaged condition. Despite my *professional* security deposit disposition statement and request for payment, they ignored those notices, until I stated I would proceed to small claims court by X date for the total due BEYOND their security deposit. On X date, they replied stating they \"didn't think it was fair\" that they should have to cover damages to the unit, or \"pay any more money\" toward their utility bill.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYep. Two months later, there we were in the lobby of the court house, sitting across from each other on uncomfortable waiting-room benches. They're laughing among themselves about how they're going to get their full security deposit back. And I'm quietly reviewing my presentation notes to the judge and my sizable stack of evidence, photographs, videos.... this was my first time in court, but I wasn't laughing. I was preparing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne hour later, we're back in the lobby and their mom is trying to write me a check for the full amount of the judgement. She doesn't have a pen. Her kids don't have a pen. I, however, have a pen. I cheerfully offer my pen. She writes the check and hands it to me, and... wait.... I hold my out my hand again. Got my pen back too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was so proud of myself for not saying any of the sassy things in my head in that moment. You know why? Because I was being *professional*, as I'd been from the moment he'd left that voicemail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a last note, I do acknowledge that it would have been better if I hadn't brought my children. However, if you have kids, you'll understand that sometimes, they simply have to go where you go. ",

            "This reminds me of my MC story. My girlfriend at the time (now wife) was moving in with me. Her landlord decided to get cute with the deposit refund (\u201ccute\u201din a sexist way with the types of allegations). My gf had the carpets and the whole place professionally cleaned while it was empty. She\u2019d lived there for 3 or 4 years and the place hadn\u2019t been painted or re-carpeted in twice that time so there was normal wear and tear just on the paint. Landlord decides to deduct most of the security deposit and send her a check for about $300 of about a $2500 deposit. \n\nAbout a week after move out date Landlord is cheap and send the response and check regular mail. I tell gf don\u2019t deposit and wait (she wanted to call him I told her don\u2019t do that and trust me on this one). At 30 days from move out date I have a copy of the landlord tenant laws in my state regarding deposits in a letter (sent certified). I proceed to tell him he\u2019s in violation of state laws and if he\u2019d like to make a claim he can do so in small claims court after refunding the entire deposit. State law says that all deposit related correspondence must be in Certified Mail. State law also says he must pay our attorney fees if he\u2019s in violation. \n\nA week later she gets a check with the full deposit and not another word said. ",

Even when you're exceeding every scorecard measure, keeping you head down, not putting a toe out of line, she still asks you to come to a meeting room to discuss some minor issue or another. Recently, she pulled me into a meeting to discuss me being late from work. Protocol is to call in, say we'll be late, then submit a schedule adjustment request when we arrived. She accused me of not calling in or submitting a request but was able to prove I did, only instead of leaving it at that, she insisted I now needed to call her and explain why I was late. That's not the process, I told her, and she said she was making a new one. So now I call her at 6am on her day off to let her know if I'm gonna be late.\n\nShe also had a meeting with me because my scorecard for a stat was 99/100, with a target of 50 - she had to point out the 1/100 I missed. She also did the same for a handling time issue where I am hitting an average of 600 seconds with a target of 1500 - she needed to tell me about a call I took too long on. Suffice to say, complaints have been raised to her manager.\n\nFollowing an incident where she was asked to follow up on something for me, and claimed 'if it's not in writing, it didn't happen,' I've been asking for everything in writing and repeat that mantra back to her when she claims to have told me something.\n\nLast week, she asked me to see her after my call. I walked over and she wasn't there, so went back to my desk. She asked me why I didn't stay around, and I reminded her of the time she put, in writing, that I wasn't to spend more than one minute waiting for her if she asked to see me and was to go back to my desk to take calls, not wasting time. She asked me to come over again, and when I did, she wasn't there. This repeated twice more before my shift was over. Each time I documented \"Logged out at 14:14:35pm, came to your desk, you were not there, spent 45 seconds waiting, returned to desk and took another call at 14:16:38pm\" in chat.\n\nShe messages me to ask what time I finish. I tell her it was two minutes prior, and she says we can catch up now. I tell her that my shift if over, and ask if she'll approve an overtime pay for an out of hours meeting. She tells me not to be silly, and it'll just take 10 minutes. I refuse, and say if I don't get paid, we can do it tomorrow when I am being paid.\n\nShe's typing, then not, then typing, then not, choosing her words. I know she's angry at being challenged, and she decided to employ one of the tactics she used when she managed a team for a company where this was standard practice: \"Okay, well, if you'd like to go home now, I can always make it a formal meeting?\" A 'formal meeting' where I work is code for a meeting with HR, documented on your record, for misconduct and repeated issues.\n\nShe thinks she's won. \"Not a problem. Make a formal meeting, ensure I have 24 hours notice, send a formal invite, and I will bring a support person with me.\" I log out and leave, but not before grabbing screenshots and saving a copy of the chat logs.\n\nNext day, she's called my bluff and has a meeting scheduled. I send it to my union rep, and she comes in on the day. HR sits down with us and opens with \"So we're here today to discuss some concerns. Your team leader asked you to attend an off the cuff catch-up three times, and for some reason you refused?\"\n\nI quickly clarify what actually happened. My manager claims otherwise, and I repeat her mantra - if it's not in writing, it didn't happen. Then I supply receipts - her demands to put things in writing, her chat, my timestamps, my call logs, and her message to me afterwards.\n\nMy union rep stares at the two of them, with a small smile, and asks \"So do you maintain the position that employees should attend meetings unpaid, and that misconduct investigations are a good use of resources if they refuse?\"\n\nHR said there may have been a miscommunication, and that I could return to work. I have it put in writing that I am not accused of any misconduct, and have been cleared of any false accusations, with nothing documented on my staff file.\n\nYesterday, my team was advised that our team leader had decided to pursue opportunities outside of the company and we were getting a new manager.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***EDIT:*** Small comment to those that say it's a shitty place to work, full disclosure, it's actually not. Job is satisfying on a personal and ethical level (I deal with vulnerable people and help them), pay and perks are great, and the people are great to work with. The metrics are more than reasonable and all my managers over the last several years have been wonderful except a couple, who were wrong for the role - and were swiftly removed or made to improve.",

            "Many years ago I worked for a company in a salaried position to take into account the new working time directive in the UK.I was on an average 36 hour week working three days in the week and one at the weekend.\n\nThey estimated my shifts to be 9 hours, but in reality, they were 12 hour shifts with 2 to 3 hours worth of travelling time per shift. So I built up quite a bit of excessive hours.\n\nWhen I came to take time off, my manager said that I had to arrange my own cover and I could only take my leave on my allocated days off and had to work my allocated days.\n\nI said that she was incorrect and she suggested I take up the matter with HR.\n\nSo she was surprised when I did so and bought in my union rep.\n\nIt was at this point HR discovered that I had built up enough excessive hours that I could have two weeks off before even touching my allocated leave.\n\n20 minutes into the scheduled meeting, I was asked to leave so that my manager and the HR manager could discuss this matter.",
            "I used to work credit and activations for a mobile company with a -T- in the name. I got in trouble for my average call time being roughly 2.5 min when they were suppose to be between 5-7 minutes. Many of the people calling in were store owners activating phone for customers, but apparently I was suppose to chat them up to show good customer service. Maybe it's just me, but when I call a customer centre, I just want done what I want done, as quick as possible to do without mistakes.",
            "Oh this triggered my call center memories. I was a fast call taker and my supervisors liked to be on my case about not getting an above-average first call resolution (FCR) stat. However, my call handle time was half of what was expected and easily the best in a 150+ person call center. Every supervisor I had (they liked to rotate employees to different supervisors every 3-6 months) would get on me about my FCR. I'd point out that from my own follow-up the ones I was assigning out were, in fact, not resolvable with our level of access.\n\nEventually they got a system where all issues were marked in the internal system as something we should or should not be able to resolve (password resets we should always resolve, but BSOD issues were an immediate sign-out). Shockingly, while my FCR stat stayed right around the call center average, I was hitting perfect or near perfect scores on what calls should or shouldn't be assigned out. \n\nMy supervisor was completely confused how this could be until I pointed out that if I was taking one and a half to twice as many calls as the average agent I was going to trend towards the actual average of FCR instead of being an outlier who resolved a large percentage of their calls but didn't take nearly as many calls.\n\nThey left me alone after that.",

            "You know I have find tracking everything when dealing with an issue really helps.\n\n\nI used to have Sprint and sold my phone to a friend. Had all sorts of issues with it actually being unlocked so he could use it. I became so frustrated that I began taking notes of times called, who I contacted, who I was transferred to, notes on what I was told. After about a week of getting nowhere on the phone and googling Sprint customer service email (I believe they still do not have a general email) multiple times I found an old Reddit thread I think it was that had VPs emails on it. \n\n\nI emailed a VP out of the blue with my call notes and logs and got a response within 24 hours that it would be taken care of. I had spent 7-8 hours on the phone and in the email advised him how it was valuable time and what I made at work and the time lost and he ended up telling me it was the most detailed email he had ever received on complaints, credited me $150 dollars, and told me if I ever had another issue to contact him directly. \n\n\nDocumentation pays because it proves your side and shows you put in the effort.",

            "The lesson to take away from this is to never, NEVER, involve HR unless you are sure you have the high ground.  HR only works for the best interest of the company and not for the employees.  \n\nHad a Boss like this once, he decided that I wasn't a hard worker and that I needed to be fired.  We went to his boss and he was certain I would be clearing my desk that afternoon.  I walked in, made my arguments against him and was asked to leave.

            "My wife once had a manager like this who nitpicked over details. \n\nMy wife worked in credit card collections, hated it, but was good at her job. They had quotas that they had to meet and then after quotas were met they got a sliding scale of compensation of a percentage of collected funds as bonuses. Her bosses bonus was tied to the department bonuses so if my wife collected more her bosses salary went up as well. \n\nEach month my wife would make quota in the first few days. We also had an infant daughter who was prone to ear infections. We were taking turns picking her up from daycare when she did. \n\nOne day, it was my wife\u2019s turn when the daycare called. She informed her boss that she had to go pick up her daughter from daycare. Her boss looked at her and said \u201cYou need to decide which is more important, your job or your daughter\u201d without skipping a beat my wife replied \u201cmy daughter\u201d,and walked out. \n\nI always wonder how that manager enjoyed her much reduced bonuses at the end of the next month since my wife was responsible for the bulk of the collections each month.",

I told him to put it in writing. He said it wasn't necessary. I told him I wasn't making the adjustment then. He got shitty about it. I explained that I wasn't going out of procedural range without proper documentation covering my ass, and that if he wanted it done he could either put it in writing or do it himself and walked out of his office. He took me to HR over insubordination. I told hr what he wanted me to do was out of company and customer specs, and suddenly he was all \"no no no. It wasn't out of spec. It was just right to the high end of specs.\" I looked him dead in the face , called him a liar, and said that's exactly why I wanted it in writing because I didn't trust him. HR pretty much dropped both sides of it cause it was his word against mine, which normally I'd have been fucked cause he was my boss, but my side of the story was protecting the company so they just dropped it all",

Some learn their place and others eventually get their ass kicked out of the job. \n\nUnfortunately we\u2019ve sort of \u201cDarwinists\u201d their tactics in firing us that makes it more difficult for the Union to defend us. The idea is that\u2019s e can\u2019t be fired for our numbers, so if our average handle time is way above target or average, they can\u2019t fire us for that BUT it puts us on their radar where they\u2019ll monitor our calls more heavily and pick up policy infractions in calls. If they\u2019re lucky they can find an unforgivable sin and fire us and Union\u2019s hands are tied. \n\nHad a guy who was in his 50s, 20 years in the company, worked support and escalations, got fired for hanging up on unruly escalations. Thing is he\u2019s been doing it for years and assumed because he was in escalations that they were empowered to do that if the customer refused to deescalate and management never said anything to him about it. Heck, some or even most of Management probably didn\u2019t know it wasn\u2019t excepted for Escalations. But the policy basically reads as long as you\u2019re not management or corporate you cannot, under any circumstances hang up on a customer. The process is to place them on hold and get management who can and will do it. \n\nBye bye pension. Which was likely management\u2019s primary motive.

Following day he makes an announcement that because we just got a company raise and a bunch of temps we can no longer work overtime at all, my direct is very stern we are not to clock in early or clock out late.

He would have written me up if he could, told me himself! I was ready for the BS though so I had my voice memos recording like I always do at team meetings (in a one party consent to record state). Acted real dumb, made him explain everything out. He ends up getting mad at me for missing the orders somedays because they come between 10-11 and that's when I am legally required to take my lunch. \n\nSo I decide, I've had enough of this and I'll outfox the fox the other way. Email HR to clarify protocol for missing meetings that are both announced and occur after I leave, dropped a phrase about retaliation as the  man did sexually harass me in his first month of employment here. This bitch straight up ignores me, classic boomer can't face up to consequences of their actions. HR never responds but hey, lil bitches will stay true to themselves right? Now I stay until the order is done on days it's delivered and report each day I don't go to lunch at 10 a day I'm being denied breaks according to the labor law. They just emailed me about filling out a form for lost wages because there were some days I didn't even get a lunch and they always dock it/we never clock out for lunch. \n\nThe thing is I'm fucking tired? I've been there like 17 months now, and seen quite literally 55 people walk out the door, one guy died. The dude that has been there longer than me kissed so many asses he got promoted twice even though he always has a bruise line on his nose from doing fucking blow all night before he shows up at 5. Just had a colleague tell me and a new colleague very rudely to take care of something he should have, she left upset for her weekend and didn't show yesterday.

I was a very good employee, great numbers, always going above and beyond, but one call I took went south and the customer asked for a supervisor. Never happened before as I was good at defusing situations. The next day my manager has me come into his office and listen to the call. If I said something, he would restart it. Even after getting through it we listened to it a couple more times. I told him we didn't have to listen to it again, I knew the call, but he insisted. He had been there a few months at this point, and I told him I had never had a bad call before and he looked shocked. Like he couldn't believe I was an actual good employee who did their job well. I don't think he liked me much.\n\nOne week we had a dept appreciation thing, where different depts would buy lunch for us all. It was an hour, but manager decided we had to use our half hour unpaid lunch as part of that hour, and it was mandatory to go.

            "I actually love the \u2018get it in writing\u2019 mentality.\nI was trapped between a boss and a trainee who both had antagonistic attitudes and patterns toward me. My boss made mistakes regularly and dismissed them as simple human errors, not indicative of any deeper problem, but if I made any minor error I was raked over the coals. I tightened my performance and I almost never made mistakes. I was always hyper-prepared. My trainee, who had never been formally assigned to me, but whose performance I was held responsible for after I began offering help, would make constant mistakes. Those mistakes would escalate as they always did in that environment, and usually I\u2019d cover for my trainee. Maybe you can see the problem. So the trainee began expecting me to cover, and I began telling them that if I was responsible for them they would be responsible to me- if I gave them chances and opportunities, and set them up to succeed I\u2019d ask that they performed to standard. So It didn\u2019t work out and they kept throwing me under then bus with our boss. Our boss chewed me out one night for 25 minutes, I started timing it after five minutes, for something that could not have been my fault. My trainee had made a bad mistake for the dozenth time and promptly blamed me. My boss had interpreted that as my failure to take responsibility. So I began logging everything.\n\nI asked the trainee to initial every part of a task sheet I\u2019d broken down when they completed the task. I asked for new printouts or hand-written alterations when our boss made changes.\n\nIm very short order it became super clear that both of them were routinely messing up and that the problem was, in fact, their attitude toward me and my performance, and not my actual performance. I only insisted on recording things in writing for a month, and I really only needed it a few times before it became super apparent that I was wildly over-performing and the people around me had rolled lack of personal responsibility into their own failure patterns.",
            "I don't understand managers like this.  They like to power trip so much that they just make it hard on themselves.\n\nWhen I was a team lead, my metrics leaders never heard a peep out of me, unless they had a demonstrable knowledge gap about a process or were breaking the rules.  I'd let them know I was available if they had concerns or wanted feedback, but otherwise, keep on knocking it out of the park.  You can leave them alone 95% of the time, since they are rocking their job, and focus on your people who actually do need your assistance to improve.",
            "Getting things in writing is a pet peeves of mine. We, the workers, are expected to document everything we do, and organize those documents.

I've always been a bit of a clown but very good at following rules while doing so. After working there a few years and seeing managers come and go we got in a new woman who was just miserable and really wanted to flex her authority. \n\n  Shortly after she started she posted the Uniform portion of the handbook in the breakroom and started complaining about people's attire but clearly took the biggest issue with girls wearing yoga pants. So me being the petty rule follower I am combed through the policy and noticed some things in the wording. The rules stated that yoga pants are allowed as long as the ankles flared and there was no gender designation for these articles. Que malicious compliance, I and a friend went to Walmart after work and bought me a couple pairs of flared yoga pants (Now mind you I'm not a huge guy but I am chubby and have a big beard). I began wearing them almost every day I worked and especially if she was working. This infuriated her, I would regularly hear her protests and even saw her go to the AGM and GM. Their response was always \"I can't say anything he's in dress code l.\" This continued for a month tops before she requested a transfer. But what made it even more fun was trolling weird pervert customers, they would stand at the deli area and gawk at the young ladies working especially if they were bent over the hot food table. When I would notice this I would sidle over beside them and give the boys 2 butts to look at before whipping my head around and making eye contact with them. The level of disgust on their faces filled my heart with joy.\n\nEdit: So, I'm new to this whole reddit thing and I did't know how to edit for an update at first but the outpouring of positivity and support has been wonderful! I do still own the yoga pants so the possibility of pics does exist. And unlike when I worked at Wawa my job is much more physical, so I might fill them out better LOL\n\nP.s.

Girls wore those and leggings as pants for the first time and it had become a new issue with the school that wasn't very clear in our dress code. Our school was in a very populated suburban area with a very even mix of conservative and liberal minded people. My school staff was very misogynistic and one day they made an announcement that GIRLS were not allowed to wear leggings or yoga pants without tunic shirts that went down to your thighs. So, a guy friend of mine decided to protest this sexist rule by wearing yoga pants to school. He paraded them around all day and it caused such a commotion but they couldn't do anything about it because 1. He was not a girl and 2. He wasn't violating any official rules of the student handbook. The staff never again said anything about yoga pants and I'll be 27 in a couple weeks and that kid is still a legend",

This can be hard because I have a limited amount of time, they are scared of new people, and they get bored real fast. A couple years ago, one of my favorite foster families got a pool, and all the kids could talk about was showing me their new pool. I mentioned in passing to a supervisor on my way to the visit that I was looking forward to playing with the kids in the pool. The supervisor made a face of concern. I told her that I'd gone out and bought a particularly covered-up and \"dowdy\" suit for this visit. She said that regardless of the style of the suit, it would be unprofessional of me to wear a swimsuit on the job. The kids (all 5 of them) were really brokenhearted when I told them I wasn't allowed to wear a bathing suit. That was quickly alleviated when I jumped into the pool wearing my office outfit!\n\nI don't know if it ever got back to the supervisors, but I did end up being that family's favorite social worker.",

One of my favorite days with one of my all time favorite kids was when I went over because he was having a tough day, I offered to go with him to a park, and right when we got there the skies opened up. It was raining so hard that everything had instant puddles, the ground was mud, and the rain was bouncing loudly off the playground equipment. \n\nThis kiddo was six at the time, and he looked at me with the biggest eyes when I got right out of the car in the middle od the rain. We took off our shoes and socks, ran through the mud filled grass, jumped in puddles, and he screamed into the sky until he started laughing. We even found an outdoor tap and caught water in our hands to throw at each other. We were both absolutely soaked to the bone. \n\nWhen we got back to his house, his mom took one look at us and said \u201cwell, it looks like you two had a lot of fun!\u201d She wrapped her very tired, very wet, very happy son in a towel and gave him a massive hug. \n\nMom found me on Facebook a couple years ago.

Walked into the office, pants and shirt now thoroughly stained green and brown from grass and mud, and my supervisor looks at me and is like \"WHAT happened to you?\". I explained and she looks at me thoughtfully for a moment and responds \"proper thing!\", her usual way of saying that was exactly the right move.",

It was only one particular social worker who kept pushing it. They had to build a taller gate to the pool area, they had to build a permanent structure for the pump, had to hang up a little lifesaver thingy, had to change the pool cover type to a certain approved brand, it went on and on.\n\nWe also found out this social worker prevented anybody from participating that had a trampoline on their property.",

She usually smiled, asked for stickers, and was quite cooperative. As he got into the pool, he had on standard swim trunks. She saw him, and something clicked in her brain. Her voice lowered to sound like a massive, burly  man of about 40 and demanded: \u201cBob! Take off your pants!\u201d. Her voice boomed and echoed across the acoustics loudly, ppl were almost in shock.  The young man (future psychologist) handled it very well, and continued the program nonchalantly.

        "selftext": "Gramps had just moved into a retirement park with a lot that backed up to county land that was a nature preserve. His backyard was basically non-existent, but he didn\u2019t mind as he got to look out over the preserve, however he did marvel at how his next door neighbor\u2019s backyard extended a good 8ft past his, giving neighbor a nice space back there. \n\nGramps tried to be friendly with all his new neighbors, exchanging phone numbers and the like, and one day he noticed the next door neighbor was putting down expensive pavers that extended from his back door all the way to the old fence posts that designated the preserve boundary. Gramps watched the neighbor yank the three rickety fence posts out of the ground and move them back an extra two feet into the preserve before pounding them back in, then started to clear the land, intending to gain himself more area for his pavers. Gramps used to work for the national park services as a young lad, so he thought he had better warn his neighbor of the consequences of his actions, so he heads out back for a little chat. Neighbor is immediately defensive and before Gramps says much, neighbor tells him \u201cyou\u2019re new here, I\u2019ve been here 10 years\u201d and to \u201cmind your own damn business.\u201d Gramps decides not to press the issue.\n\nNothing happens that year, but the following year when most of the park emptied out to head north for the summer the county comes by to check on the preserve. Gramps notices them going back and forth behind his neighbor\u2019s house, the workers are pulling out maps and taking photos and making phone calls and soon more guys show up. Turns out neighbor has moved the posts several times over the years, and in reality his backyard is supposed to be even smaller than Gramp\u2019s backyard! To make it worse, neighbor put pavers in the back specifically to park both his golf cart AND a cherry red sports car back there for the summer, so the county will have to move them before they can do anything else. They tape a notice to the front door and leave. \n\nGramps goes over to read it, and it states that neighbor was in violation of encroaching onto protected lands, he has 30 days to move his car, tear up the pavers and pay a fine of $11,000 (because of damage to endangered species who inhabit the protected lands, as well as trespassing fees). Failure to do so within 30 days will result in golf cart & car being towed and impounded, pavers will be dug up and carted off at neighbor\u2019s expense and the fine will increased for every additional day past the deadline. \n\n30 days comes and goes, so a week after that Gramps has quite the show as first the car and cart were towed, pavers were dug up and hauled off, and the old fence posts and ropes were replaced with metal posts embedded into buried cement bases, connected by steel cables. Whole process took several weeks to finish, but the preserve looked a lot more legit when they were done. A few solar cameras were installed so the county could monitor the wildlife (and encroachers) remotely, meanwhile more notices were taped to the front door of neighbor\u2019s house.\n\nBy November the snowbirds were flooding back into the park, including neighbor. That was Gramps\u2019 2nd show of the summer as neighbor reads all the notices, digging down until he reads the first one, then runs out back and starts screaming and cussing up a storm before running back to his car to dig out his cell phone so he can call the county to find out where his car and golf cart were. Gramps stays indoors to avoid the guy as he is frantically trying to unload his car, turn on his water and electricity, get the ac and the toilets going, and all the while trying to get someone at county to pick up the phone and give him some answers. He finally gets a live person and proceeds to scream at them while on speakerphone about his car and cart, so the call keeps getting kicked to other people because who wants to help a screamer? Basically neighbor is told to come to the county office to get this straightened out.\n\nThree days later neighbor catches Gramps outside and asks if he was here when the county \u201cstole his car and destroyed his backyard\u201d. Gramps said he was, and neighbor says \u201cwell why didn\u2019t you call me when you saw them putting notices on my door? You had my number up north!\u201d Gramps said he had thought about doing that, but figured neighbor would prefer him to \u201cmind his own damn business\u201d, so he decided against it.",

This resulted in me doing 20- 30 mins a day unpaid but I liked the company and liked a clear desk. Fast forward 2 years and my father in law was terminally ill. We got a call from the hospital telling us we had to get there ASAP as he didn't have long left. I told my manager and left at 3.45 (core hours were 10-4) the next month my pay was docked for half a day. I had already made 2 hrs extra unpaid that week but they told me they couldn't make exceptions and the extra I did was my own decision. Allllrighty then! I came in on the dot and left in the dot. I did this for 5 years, I worked to the letter of my contracted hours. My manager was talking to a new starter and in my earshot she told him she hated 'clockwatchers' who left on the dot as this doesn't show company loyalty. I leaned over and replied loyalty works both ways and being docked half a days pay for attending the death bed of a beloved family member when I'd already done more than my weekly hours was cruel and unfeeling. So I show the company the same level of compassion they showed me. After all rules are rules and exceptions cannot be made. The new starter started on the dot and left on the dot as did the whole staff. I dread to think how many extra hours they lost over the whole department over the next few years.",

            "I was working as a General Office Manager for a small company. The Office was above the Business' Showroom. One day I was asked to 'mind the store' whilst the receptionist took 30 minutes for lunch (I could then go to lunch when she returned). She was 15 minutes late returning from lunch and five minutes before her return an 'extremely difficult/pedantic customer' walked in. I assumed the receptionist would take over but she refused 'its your customer'. She sat at her desk and the phone rang, she didn't answer it. For the next two hours I dealt with the customer and the phone rang, unanswered. At 3 O'Clock she stood up and walked out 'I'm just having a tea break, if the phone rings can YOU answer it! THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE PICKING UP UPSTAIRS'. She left the room and the customer made some remark about 'the people upstairs'. I replied 'I AM THE PERSON UPSTAIRS!'\n\nBy 5 O'Clock I eventually satisfied the customers requirements (got the order) and returned to the upstairs office. The owner of the company was now present and I explained what had happened. He said he would have words with the receptionist and I should go home 30 minutes early since I hadn't had a break.\n\nNo action was taken about the receptionist and I was docked 1 hours pay for finishing early.\n\nThe order was worth \u00a31000's and a Showroom operative would have made a sizeable commission from the deal. I got nothing.\n\nMy loyalty to the company waned somewhat after that.",

            "When I was a manager I tried to be as flexible as possible as long as the team members did their job and the customers were happy. \n\nIf they had to leave an hour early to grab a plane to go on vacation they would make sure the work was done and I had no problem at all with it. \nIf one week we were on a tight schedule, they would stay an extra hour without being asked And, if it was more than that, I would let them come in late (or leave early on a Friday) the next time there was not a big work load. \n\nI learned that having a happy team is better and they are more productive that way. \n\nOddly enough almost no one took advantage/abused this liberty. The two that did were not given these privileges and eventually were \u201cinvited\u201d to leave the project (or the company in one case).",
            "I had a job once that was on an awkward bus route, my hours were 9-5 but the bus that was due to get me there at 8.50 was always late, and the bus that got me there at 8.30 was always late, so I used to get there (and start work) at 8.10 every morning. After work if I got on a bus at 5.05 I would be home at 5.30, but the next bus always got stuck in rush hour traffic and I wouldn't be home until after 7.\n\nBecause of this I left on the dot at 5 until my manager pulled me aside and told me that I was expected to *work* until 5, not just be there till 5, so I wasn't allowed to start shutting down my computer until 5. I explained the bus situation and that I did an extra 50 minutes every day anyway but he didn't care and offered the solution to \"buy a car\". I was just about able to shut down at 5, RUN to the bus stop (often waving it down as it tried to leave) and normally get home at a reasonable time ... until my manager said I was leaving early and that I had to follow the clock on the wall, not the clock on my computer. Even proving to him that the wall clock was 2 minutes slow just made me a \"smartarse\" in his eyes.\n\nSo I started taking a book in with me and reading that instead of working between 8.10 and 9.00, then at 9.00 when he asked why I wasn't working I pointed out that the wall clock said it was 8.58 and since he was so strict with me I didn't want to give him 50 minutes of my time every day any more. That evening he called my agency, told them I was leaving at 4.45 every day and had me fired and blacklisted from getting a new job through them.",

            "Similar thing happened to me when my mom was going through chemo.  I let my boss know that I would have to leave early two days that week to drive her to/from, about 90 minutes early each day.  He said, \u201cOf course, of course!  Family comes first.  Don\u2019t worry about this place. Take care of mom.\u201d  I came in the next week and the office manager said the boss was going to dock my pay for each day.  Of course, I was never paid extra when asked to stay late and help others or even when we all had to come in on a Saturday to finish an important project.  I saw red and stormed into his office, screamed at him that he lied to me, and then told him I would be suing for unfair labor practices.  The whole office heard.  He got up and shut the door and offered me a raise and to pay me in full for the days I left early.  I accepted this, but found a new job within three months.",

            "It's amazing what a big difference little things in management can make. I have a great manager, and as such, we don't mind working extra when needed.

            "When I first started at my job (all salaried) we had \"flex time\".  This wasn't so much for the occasional 20 minutes here or there, but for the coming in on the weekend or evening for 3 hours for an event or after having a week or two at the end of a project where you'd worked a bunch of extra hours, plan to leave a bit early over the next couple of weeks to make it up.  This worked well was almost never abused, and made working those weekend/evening events much more appealing.\n\nDun dun dun, new management!  No more flex time, salaried workers much work as much as is required to complete the job, but not less than 40 (even though most of us were hired explicitly at 35)  Guess who hasn't felt compelled to volunteer for many of those weekend events since then.....  If you're keeping track of my hours, then I should be hourly bitches.  I'd consider working those extra hours if I was getting overtime....",
            "My direct supervisor had the nerve to formally counsel me, in front of the executives about a myriad things because of personal disagreements, chief among them was tardiness and failure to take customers problems to heart.. said other techs were afraid to call me and ask questions.\n\nI put my work keys and access badges on top of the counseling statement and deposed it, line for line, in front of the executives, refused to sign it, called him a coward to his face and told the higher ups if they'd like to continue this meeting at a later time that I could literally riff all day long about the toxic environment that existed in the 2 years I had been at this office. \n\nI routinely work long hours because my work is done to standard, not to time. I had just weeks prior spent 21 hours in one day, servicing outages across our eastern seaboard customers which we dont have the technical coverage for because HE fired or drove off the rest of the talent due to his toxic leadership. I took a 2 hour nap and pulled a full day the next day. \n\nTHEN I chastised the board for failing to conduct proper exit interviews on the tech's we had lost in the previous year. Leaving me ALONE for the entire State. \n\nNow, everyone just stays out of my way and lets me handle business. After all, I work WITH my boss FOR my customers,  not the other way around. \n\nThings couldn't be better. Work is no longer toxic though, i'm still the only tech. Other technicians from outside the state, and even outside the company still call to ask questions, like they did before, my customer relations have never been better and i'm still working to standard. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nThat impromptu meeting was, however, the best 2 hours of my professional civilian career.",

I\u2019ve always done that and enjoy doing good work and being productive. \nI saw that my coworkers began lining up at the door at 4:55pm. It was weird but okay. \n\nThen I realized one day when I arrived at 9:03am that my boss made eye contact with me, looked at her watch and wrote down on her calendar that I arrived late. I began to notice she marked down everyone\u2019s arrival and departure. And that my extra time in the am made no difference if I wanted to leave at 4:58. \n\nI began arriving at exactly 9am (sometimes hanging out in my car for a bit), and lining up at 4:55.

            "I had a similar issue. I worked a salaried position with an agreement of a 50-hour week. Often the hours would be 55 or so per week with no extra pay because the job couldn't be completed on time each day. \n\nFast forward to 1 week and I only hit 45 hours due to a family emergency and the company docked my pay down and because I didn't hit the 50 hour mark. We had physical punch cards BTW so I quickly got all my previous time cards showing 55+ hours per week. They didn't care. I gave my notice the exact same day.\n\nBasically if you worked over you don't get paid and if you worked under they docked your pay. Then what was the purpose of their \"salary\" pay plan?",

            "I had a boss like that and it ended in HR.\n\nA few years ago my wife's mother had to move into a care facility. My wife got a call to say she had been found unresponsive and my wife called me. In my earlier working life I was a Paramedic so knew exactly what that meant. I told my colleagues in the team I had to leave explaining the call we just had.\n\nAs I left the office the boss stopped me and asked where a report I was working on was. I told him I had to leave as we had a medical emergency and I would have to finish the report later. He stood there and said if I didn't stop right there and sort his report out I would be going to HR. My response was fine, do that and I left.\n\nWhen we arrived at the care facility we were shown into my witness mothers room where as I expected she had passed away. The rest of the say was involved with dealing with the formalities of this and I called my direct line manager to say I would not be in for a few days as we had a bereavement. I set about organising the funeral, dealing with the coroner and all the paperwork this involves and ignored my work email and phone.\n\nHR called me in when I returned trying to tell me I needed to give more notice and I should have worked the rest of the day as the boss had a very important meeting and needed my report.

Nail polish and make up kits. They make them for smaller kids as kind of play sets depending on your age range. \n\n4. Legos so your siblings have to step on them constantly. \n\n5. The marshmallow guns we made them one year was tons of fun until you had to pick them all up.\n\n6. Toddler tool kit which included loud drills, saws and musical screwdrivers. \n\n7. Children's cook book. Imagine the mess in the kitchen. \n\n\nAll of those teach skills in one way or another but damn was it fun to see the look on my brothers and SIL faces every year LOL\n\n\nThank God my husband and I don't have kids because we have 20 years and 10 nieces and nephews that my brothers would be calling for payback on.
