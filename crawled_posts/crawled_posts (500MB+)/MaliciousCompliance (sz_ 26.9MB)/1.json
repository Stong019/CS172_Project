They day after the decision, we receive an email that someone reported our Pride flag (that we had in our house since 2016), and that we needed to take it down. We complied and removed the flag. \nLooking through our new rules, we noticed that removable lights are permitted without restriction so... we bought 6 colored flood lights, and we washed our house in pride colors. \nA little less subtle than our simple flag. A lot more fun for anyone complaining about the flag itself and what it represents.\nIf you\u2019re interested, here\u2019s the house now: https://imgur.com/gallery/SHSv6rd\n\n*edit to point out that the flag was displayed on the front porch, not inside the house. It was a typo when I wrote \u201cwe had in our house...\u201d)\n\n*SECOND EDIT: THIS GOT MORE ATTENTION THAN I WAS EXPECTING. JUST CLARIFYING THAT I DON\u2019T HATE MY HOA, I DON\u2019T THINK THEY CHANGE THE FLAG RULE TO ATTACK ME PERSONALLY, AND THAT I DECIDED TO DO THIS TO SHOW MY INDIVIDUALITY WHILE STILL FOLLOWING THE RULES.

We sell everything in 7 days and destroy the rest. Enjoy no rent and the loss of your potential buyers.\n\nI work for a leisure company, think soft play, indoor soccer, laser tag (can't be specific) Prior to lockdown, Managers and the big bosses were negotiating the renewal of the lease on one of our parks. Things were going mostly smoothly, however, the landlords were difficult to contact.\n\nThen 2020\u2019s shit hit the fan.\n\nAll of our sites were closed, and everything was thrown into a mess. Negotiations began to slip down the priority list; nobody thought the landlord would push an eviction for an expired lease during this period. Especially with it still getting rent, despite the sites closure, and the closure of every business and restaurant in the immediate area. We were wrong.\n\nA few days ago we received a letter saying we had 7 days to leave the premises and take everything with us. We are reminded that anything left in the building after 7 days will become the landlord's property! (that line is very important).\n\nNow a lot of construction goes into installing our equipment into a new building, which makes emptying one even harder. Add a lockdown, with no staff and most businesses shut, it meant that saving much of our assets would prove to be extremely difficult.\n\nTo lose a profitable site and all of its assets is definitely a blow to our company. But here is where it gets worse;\n\nA few days into our 7-day eviction, we find out that the landlord has been advertising our park to our competitors. But he isn\u2019t offering just the building, he is offering ALL OF OUR STUFF PRE INSTALLED. \u201cReady to go, just needs re-branding.\u201d The landlord has evicted us from the property in an attempt to increase rent and make a solid profit from our equipment installed because he thinks we won't be able to empty the park.\n\nWe were furious.\n\nAnd here is where the malicious compliance came in, we were told we had 7 days to move everything we owned out of the property. so that's what we did. Local businesses from all around offered up free space to store our things, a few people came back out of lockdown and they all spent the rest of the week removing, selling or destroying everything that was related to us. We didn't even leave light fittings.\n\nIn every other sight vacation we have seen, we always end up leaving thousands of $$ worth of disco lights in the ceilings because they\u2019re too hard to get. We leave most the construction in, as well as things like the bars and kitchens that all stay intact (recognisable as what they once were) but not this building.\n\nWe ripped up the flooring we installed, tore down the walls that were not part of the original structure (Wooden walls to divide up the space) ripped apart our manager's offices and removed all artwork, and lockers.\n\nThe landlord now has every new deal he has been making dead in the water, a large renovation bill to install new flooring etc. (or a company willing to do it themselves like we were).\n\nLockdown has been extended another 4 weeks, so he has at least another 4 weeks without rent (we were paying) and won't have any potential buyers.\n\nSilver lining: The assets we got out of the site (fridges, tv\u2019s, equipment, food, tables) have all been sold, and the lack of rent and additional income has helped the business and paid staff wages.\n\nUPDATE\n\nHi Everyone! I'm so sorry for how long an update has taken, I was waiting for things to unfold.\n\nHere is what happened next:\n\nWe handed in the keys and it was probably the quickest handover we\u2019ve ever had. The landlord Cleary didn\u2019t want to make any kind of conversation and there was definitely an elephant in the room, but he definitely said NOTHING about the lack of our equipment.\n\nComplications did arise when we went to get back various deposits, But he had no case to withhold the deposits from us as the building was in excellent shape. (we had conducted much of the maintenance work ourselves, so the building was in a significantly better condition than we found it, (we also cleaned up 99% of the rubbish and dirt from our demolition crusade so he couldn't bill us for cleaning) )\n\nA very minor bit of pressing from our legal team meant that we received everything owed back in full!\n\nThe building is still Vacant and as of yet we don't know of any potential buyers.\n\nAt this moment in time our company is still standing despite the pandemic closures and lack of business, staff are all still employed and doing well!\n\nA huge thanks again for everyone who took the time to read this and to those who were dedicated enough to remind me for updates :D Big shoutout as-well to the amazing people who gave awards, I really really appreciate it and I\u2019ve been making sure to pass on the good karma :)",

This was a win-win, they were happy to get free shelves and I was happy to not have to deal with getting them out of the apartment. \n\nExcept the super refused to let this happen and insisted the apartment had to be empty between tenants. I knew this fuckers's plan was to go down to the garbage room after I took the shelves down to take them and sell them back to the person moving in after me, because he'd do highly illegal shit like take the bars off the windows of the ground floor apartments between tenants and charge to put the bars back on.

            "I've been dealing with a shitty apartment manager. My boyfriends father had to move out of his apartment and in with a caregiver for hospice care. We had 2 weeks to get the apartment sorted. On our off days, my boyfriend and I have been there with a friend to do what we can. The manager, up until 3 days ago, has acted very nice, saying if we needed a few extra days in may, it was ok, she understood, etc etc. Well 3 days ago, we filled a dumpster with trash (this man seemed to have kept every piece of paperwork he's ever gotten since the 80s.) We left the other dumpster empty, per request, being told to wait until the dumpsters were emptied to put anything else in them. They were emptied today. We put 5 bags of trash in them, when the manager came out screaming at the friend that we were \"filling the dumpsters to fast\" and that \"we've already filled them up after they were emptied.\" \n\nShe also began screaming about rent. So I had to call the office, since they won't let anyone in, and ask her what the issues were. She basically said we had until the end of the day to clear the apartment out, and pay a fine for \"breaking the lease\" (which ended yesterday btw) or pay another months rent since she's still trying to run a business. Oh, and we couldn't put one more thing in the dumpster, since we had magically filled it up with 5 trash bags. \n\nSo, I was on the phone with everyone I needed to contact and get shit sorted the second I was off the phone with her. My boyfriend happened to be at work today, so the job of finishing cleaning out the apartment fell on my shoulders. Within 2 hours, I had a junk remover coming to haul everything off that wasn't already sold or claimed. I had a storage unit for the stuff we wanted. I had the caregiver informed of what was going on, and I had my boyfriend fully up to speed on how the manager suddenly changed her tune and was being as difficult as possible with everything. \n\nIn all honesty, I feel like she was pushing for another months rent to make whatever dollar she could (on an apartment no one lived in or would live in this month btw.) By about 430pm, we were finishing cleaning out the apartment. There was one table we were waiting on someone with a truck to grab and move for me. My boyfriend messaged me saying that the manager had gotten his number and called him. \n\nMagically, we suddenly had the weekend to finish everything, and she was super sweet and nice to him. \n\nI sent him the picture of the empty apartment, saying well it's to late, she's been rude to us all day, and staring at us from time to time. She even told my boyfriend she was concerned cause people were taking stuff out of the apartment. Yes, stuff we had sold or given people. Never once did she call me back on my number I gave her or even tried to talk to me.\n\nThe keys were turned in to the drop box as we left, with a note saying of there were any issues to call his caregiver, which she didn't want to talk to earlier \ud83d\ude44 with some bullshit reason. \n\nI'm just glad to be done with it, and I'm sorry this comment is so long. I'm just still very frustrated with the whole situation.",

            "**Complete post(?):**\n\nTl;dr landlord gives us 7 days to vacate our leisure business from the building, he thinks we cant empty the business during lockdown, and proceeds to advertise OUR equipment for sale to our competition. We sell everything in 7 days and destroy the rest. Enjoy no rent and the loss of your potential buyers.\n\nI work for a leisure company, think soft play, indoor soccer, laser tag (cant be specific) Prior to lockdown, Managers and the big bosses were negotiating the renewal of the lease on one of our parks. Things were going mostly smoothly, however the landlords were difficult to contact.\n\nThen 2020\u2019s shit hit the fan.\n\nAll of our sites were closed, and everything was thrown into a mess. Negotiations began to slip down the priority list; nobody thought the landlord would push an eviction for an expired lease during this period. Especially with it still getting rent, despite the sites closure, and the closure of every business and restaurant in the immediate area. We were wrong.\n\nA few days ago we received a letter saying we had 7 days to leave the premises and take everything with us. We are reminded that anything left in the building after 7 days will become the landlords property! (that line is very important).\n\nNow a lot of construction goes into installing our equipment into a new building, which makes emptying one even harder. Add a lockdown, with no staff and most businesses shut, it meant that saving much of our assets would prove to be extremely difficult.\n\nTo loose a profitable site and all of its assets is definitely a blow to our company. But here is where it gets worse;\n\nA few days into our 7 day eviction, we find out that the landlord has been advertising our park to our competitors. But he isn\u2019t offering just the building, he is offering ALL OF OUR STUFF PRE INSTALLED. \u201cReady to go, just needs re-branding.\u201d The landlord has evicted us from the property in an attempt to increase rent and make a solid profit from our equipment installed, because he thinks we wont be able to empty the park.\n\nWe were furious.\n\nAnd here\u2019s where the malicious compliance came in. The eviction notice that was sent told us we had 7 days to remove everything we owned from the property. So that\u2019s what we did. Local businesses from all around offered up free space for us to store our things, a few people came back out of lock down and they all spent the rest of the week removing, selling or destroying everything that was related to us. we didn\u2019t even leave light fittings.\n\nIn every other site vacation i have seen we always end up leaving thousands of pounds worth of disco lights in the ceilings because they\u2019re too hard to get. We leave most the construction in, as well as things like the bars and kitchens all stay pretty in tact and recognisable as what they once were) but not this building. We ripped up the flooring we installed, tore down the walls that were not part of the original structures (wooden walls to divide up the space). Ripped apart our managers offices and removed every locker and piece of wall art.\n\nThe landlord now has every new deal he\u2019s been making dead in the water, a large renovation bill to install new flooring ect (or a company willing to do it themselves like we are). Lockdown has been extended another 4 weeks, so he has at least another 4 weeks where it wont be making rent (WHEN IT WAS) and wont have any real potential buyers.\n\nSilver lining for us; the assets we got out of the site (fridges, equipment, food, tables, tv\u2019s etc) have all been sold and the lack of rent payments and the extra $300k+ has really helped the business and staff during times like these.",

One apartment had some damage in the hollow-core interior doors and in the sheetrock in a couple of rooms, and the landlord promised to fix it all before we moved in. He never did.

It depends on location, but in the US for example, courts are not processing evictions, and a notice posted by the landlord is NOT an eviction. What they probably sent is a demand letter, which while scary, isn't binding. You say you were paying rent, so even if the courts were processing evictions, the landlord would have an uphill battle trying to convince a judge to remove you.\n\nGranted, you guys are probably hemorrhaging cash at this point and probably want to cut costs as much as possible, so it's probably to your benefit to drop this location.

        "selftext": "I originally posted this as a comment on another thread, but realized it needed its own limelight. \n\nI worked at a company that gave out exorbitant amounts of vacation. Anyone who worked there for 25+ years received 8 weeks of vacation and 2 weeks of personal time. This was a family owned company, but rather large. We ran 3 shifts totaling 250+ people. \n\nEnter Jimmy. Jimmy was a grissled old man, he started at the company when he was just 20, now he was 63 and gave absolutely zero shits. Jimmy also knew how to make a specific part for our product, him and one other higher up in the office. \n\nOne day the plant owner comes out and announces he's selling to a corporation. He's older and ready to retire, he promises that there will be very little change and wishes us all well. \n\nThe new company comes in and immediately goes after many of the great benefits we had. The first thing they do is cut everyone's max vacation down to 4 weeks, and do completely away with personal time. Anyone who's maxed out had until December 31st of that year to use it up, and they wouldn't pay it out. They then go into the office and clean house, firing anyone who's close to retirement. Including Jimmy's back up. \n\nBut they also do away with one very important rule. You no longer have to get vacation approved, you can just call in and take it.\n\nJimmy is pissed, and they know it. They realize he's the only one in the building that can do his job now. So they hire a new kid for him to train, most likely to permanently replace Jimmy. So Jimmy does what anyone would do. He calls in the first training day for the new hire, and lets us know he's going to use all of his PTO at once, and promptly takes 10 weeks off. \n\nWe had a back stock of parts he had made, so it wasn't too unnerving. But for 10 weeks, Jimmy went and applied to other jobs, found one, and started. \n\nFast forward 10 weeks, Its the day Jimmy is supposed to return. He doesn't. For two days they try calling him, and even go to his house. He's nowhere to be found. Finally on day three he calls and resigns, and they lose their shit. The parts he makes are specialized and patented by the original founder, you can't just hire someone off the street to make them. What eventually happened was they had to contract the original owner to come in a teach some new hires how to make them, and when he found out what all they had done it pissed him off. The last I heard he charged them a 7 figure contract to teach them how to produce the parts, and they had to pony up, or close down.\n\nMoral of the story, don't fuck with people's vacation time.\n\nEdit: Jimmy made and electronic control module that was sealed and stayed fixed in a poured unit made of a two part epoxy.\n\nEdit #2: Jimmy didn't exactly \"Miss out\" on a seven figure contract and had zero chance to take one. He left, said fuck em and moved on. When they contacted the previous owner and explained the situation it was basically a \"you need my help? It'll cost 1mil.\" Type of conversation.\n\nFinal update: Thank you everyone for all of the attention this received! I had no idea this would blow up like this. I have immediate family working with the company still, so if I hear of anymore rumblings I'll fill you all in. Also, I worked here for four years. I have a few other Jimmy stories I may post at other times on the appropriate reddits. Thank you all again!",

            "I once spent months building a forecasting model, to forecast how many people we'd need to process varying increases in workloads due to an expected (albeit unknown) change to workloads. Was promised before and during the time I spent building this, that I was oh so valuable, and they had a positioning opening up soon which I would be a shoe in for. \n\nSurprise surprise, I finish the model, and shortly after an email goes round to my department saying that the role was being merged into another and given to someone else. I was understandably unhappy, both due to the way of finding out I could no longer go for the role I was promised, but also that it wasn't available anymore!\n\nI immediately started looking for jobs, found one quick quickly which paid more and had an easier commute, so handed in my 4 weeks notice. No one bothered to ask me to hand over the model I spent so long making, and even after telling my manager that someone needed to be taught it, when I left I was the only one who knew how it worked. Guess who got a call a couple of weeks after leaving because my old team couldn't work out the model?!\n\nTold them I would explain as much as I could in 10 minutes, but after that they were on their own.",

            "At my previous employer they did something similar, MESSING WITH PEOPLE\u2019S VACATION; except it was announced mid-year in an all employee meeting.  Previous policy was an employee could roll over 120 hours (way too high IMO) - mind you new employees start with 160 hours and could work up to 280hrs, by year 20.  \n\nWell that all changed, during this meeting; vacation was now capped at 240hrs - 15yr mark (those higher that that where grandfather in).  The big kicker was by the end of the year, you could only roll over 40hrs and by next year (18 months out) would be ZERO hours roll over.  There was freaking pandemonium, our department alone (Engineering, New Product Development) had to burn an additional 560 hours (7 people x 80hrs) of vacation. \n\n...NEEDLESS to say, project fell behind schedule and managers were pissed.  But there was nothing they could do because company vacation policy stated that employees only needed to have vacation approved if out of office for more than 10 consecutive business days.\n\nENTIRE DEPARTMENTS would take off for a week, and just be gone - it was bananas.\n\n\n**EDIT: This is kind of blowing up\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f, wanted to clarify why I thought 3 weeks of rollover was too much.  As a seasoned salary employee, I was earning 6 weeks of PTO, and carry over 3 weeks - so every year I was out of the office about 12% of the time between PTO and paid holidays.  \n\nPeople need to get away from work and enjoy life; co-workers from Europe (I work in USA) would normally take 6 week holidays/vacation and not blink an eye.

            "Similar story, happened to me.  I had a job at a struggling, small company that was eventually sold.  \n\nI'd been under-paid by about 20% of mkt rate for a while and was really the only one who knew the processes or did anything that could be considered billable hours. I knew it wasn't anyone being cheap as they'd opened up all the books and I saw I was the only one who hadn't taken a big cut.  Being underpaid was tolerable because I had a lot of schedule flexibility, a very, very short commute, the work was interesting science, and job autonomy and I got to bring my dog to work. I'd accumulated a month's vacation and was earning 4 weeks a year.  Taking vacation was tough since there were so few people at the company.  \n\nNew Company approaches my boss to buy.  The New Company didn't seem like a technolgoical fit to me, but they wanted to expand into biotechnology but really didn't understand the field. They'd heard that \"bioinformatics was the future\" one too many times and needed some of that stuff!  They did \"due diligence\" (/s appropriate here) before buying, at which time I'd told my boss that under new management, I'd expect mkt rate.  \n\nMy boss did a magnificent sales job, apparently convincing the prospective buyer that what I did was actually the result of our marvelous software and machine learning process.  New Company never actually asked me about it, but the machine learning was actually me analyzing data and creating linked datasets.\n\nNew Company makes the purchase while I'm using a week's PTO between xmas and the new year. I come back to find I'm working for New Company keeps at my same-old salary, starting me out at new hire 2-week per year PTO accrual. New boss says that we can negotiate, once he sees that we can bring in revenue.  \n\nResumes out quickly.  \n\nFirst paycheck from New Company comes in and I find out my accumulated PTO evaporated, as they didn't actually buy the company, just the assets, dissolving the old company, hiring all the old employees.  New boss tells me that the PTO was the responsibility of the old company, that didn't exist anymore.\n\nA mkt rate offer comes in.  I tell new boss I'm giving 2 weeks notice.   Within the next few days, when he starts looking to train someone else, he realizes that there was never any machine learning, that our software required someone with advanced training to actually use. It was all just me doing work. He'd bought a worthless company  They magically, instantly find enough to kick up my salary 50% above what I'd been making and more than what I'd make with the new offer and give me 3 weeks of my old PTO back.\n\n\nI walked, taking the new job below the new offer from New Company, but they start everyone with 5 weeks vacation a year (*start and cap--they use other incentives to keep people around) and money can't buy me time.  I haven't looked back. \n\nIt was clear that New Company's interests were to squeeze me at any and every point they could.  For a year, I got regular calls asking if I could come in to train someone.  In the next 14 months, they'd cycled in 4 different people who weren't qualified and couldn't do my old job and quit out of frustration.",

            "My old outfit took the Great Recession to heart. Cut staff to absolute minimum, only gave a maximum 3 weeks of vacation (cut from 4 for 20-year workers) with no rollover, only 5 holidays, chopped sick leave to a ridiculous 3 days a year and halted all raises for the next 8 years.

He did it right when I hit five years and was eligible for an extra five days.  It was annoying and I mentioned how wrong that felt to me (after all why not simply cap the vacation or hire more people if the issue was the old timers having so many days off) but we moved on amicably.  \n\nThis year they reduced my bonus for the 2020 period after I delivered record results in the most challenging time for us as a company (operationally, not financially) and me as a person.  Owners and management were also very uncool at times during all this.  So I cleared some time, taught someone to cover the urgent day to day (which was always meant to happen; but I made SURE) and told them listen guys, I\u2019m off to see my family for a month.  That long of a break is kind of unheard of in this work but my manager knows I\u2019m pissed and didn\u2019t challenge me.  It\u2019s really the owners who made things shitty more than him, and while I\u2019m doing this for me, I think it\u2019s also sent the message that I and others no longer feel the kind of motivation we did before, and I think he actually sympathizes.

As a migraine sufferer with a 90 minute commute this was a godsend. 3 days personal time you could take whenever.\n\nCut to 2016ish-new CEO rolls out \u201caccrued leave time.\u201d It combined sick time with vacation. PTO was earned at .2 per 2 week pay period. If you\u2019d worked there for over a year you\u2019d bank 5 days. And then accrue more time after that. People started coming to work sick (I know I did) because I\u2019d let god smite me before losing precious vacation time.  If you ran of of PTO then you\u2019d take unpaid leave. If you were out of time and sick for a week they put you on work disability that you had to buy insurance for through State Farm. It was fucked.  They also created \u201chubs\u201d in AZ and VA and IL for the claim reps. They were told move or lose your job. And even if you did move jobs were not one to one replacements. They laid off a ton of people.\n\nI lasted a few more years but said fuck you once they rolled out more policies that made the higher ups micro manage everything we did.",

They used to be one of the best companies to work for in the country as voted by employees (which says more about how shitty most jobs are, but I digress). They were a family business and still are, but the bosses up to a certain point had *worked* at the store. I believe the grandpa founded it, and made the son work at the store like a regular employee, the son took over and was a bit of a weirdo (weird expensive pimp clothes), but again he felt some sort of connection to the workers and would at least keep them under consideration. This led Wegmans to have arguably the best staff of any grocery store. People were generally happy, especially when comparing themselves to workers at other stores. \n\nAnyways, the son gets old and retires, leaving his daughters in charge. His Ivy League educated daughters who haven\u2019t seriously worked a day in their lives. They start changing everything. Mainly cutting back benefits, and replacing a shit load of full time positions with part time. Which then fucked over the scheduling of all the full timers, as the schedules are defined by the part timers availability. \n\nThe general experience has gone to shit as well. Things are messier, employees less helpful, etc. \n\nBut profits are up, and instead of improving their current employees lives, Wegmans is just aggressive opening new stores.",

Like how do you not have work instructions for this part that is very important to your company? And on top of that, only 2 people knew how to make it? Just moronic and horrific management and it's shockingly pretty commonplace.\n\nAt my old job, we had an entire department whose job was making work instructions and very rarely did we have any issues with a competent employee doing something they had never done before because of the instructions and asking other employees for help. I thought that was normal. It is not.\n\nAt my current job, they wouldn't give someone a raise from $10/hr and she was the most skilled employee we had at building a product line. So she quit and got an easier job that paid her more. There are no work instructions for this product line and they've had to take employees from other departments to figure out how to build this product line, wasting a massive amount of time and money.

One time I got a bit concerned and emailed HR to make sure it wasn't going to go away, and the email I got back still makes me laugh to this day:\n\n\"IT SHOULD NOT GO AWAY.  IF IT EVER DOES GO AWAY, EMAIL US AND WE WILL PUT IT BACK.\"\n\nCaps and all.  Anyway, a couple of years later, they got on hard times and I was laid off.

            "Reminds me a little of my particular malicious compliance.  There are some parallels here but the situation was a lot different in being simpler: I had worked on a job for two years, attempting to complete a task I was not supposed to be assigned.  When given the task, I was told that my work on it was limited in scope and with intent to hand the work off to a replacement developer.  Instead, two different developers were hired and neither were willing to accept the task handoff.  To work around this, the company promoted the second developer to a lead position to give him the authority to delegate the task to me.\n\nIn response, I immediately gave notice of four weeks in an attempt to force the company to transition the task as promised.  Instead, the company directed me to 'finish the work;' one of the problems with the work was no defined acceptance criteria.  I pointed this out and explained that without acceptance criteria, I cannot prioritize fixes, but they didn't care.  So I used the first two weeks to burn vacation time, then told them the job wouldn't be finished.  That finally compelled them to set up handoff meeting.\n\nOne.  One, one hour handoff meeting to cover the intricacies of combining data from two different databases that don't match data at a 1-to-1 level for any identifiable object.  I provided a mountain of documentation and a through walkthrough of the process as best as I could in an hour.  After getting no questions, I strongly recommended the following: if they got to a point where the code was not resolving data as expected and they were unable to identify where in the 12 scripts and nearly 15,000 lines of code I had written to do this, the best approach would be to start over with their own level of comprehension and rewrite it themselves.  I then packed up my shit and left.\n\nTwo months later, my old boss calls, tells me both of the other devs had quit and asked if I would be willing to get on a call to talk about the work because there was a problem they could not figure out how to solve.  In response, I sent them a consultation offer for 10 hours of consulting at $150 per hour, that must be used or forefited within 30 days, and that the terms were not negotiable.  When they responded with an attempt to negotiate, I doubled the rate and reminded them that I was never hired by that company to begin or complete that job, and I don't intend to do either.  My consultation services would only to be to discuss the logic needed to write the transforms.  Last I had heard, they dropped support for the feature I was not asked to develop.",

        "selftext": "So this starts on Monday, the 13th, as I receive an email from a VP not over my department, or Bad VP. I am told  that my team will be required on the 4th. I politely tell them no that our team has been scheduled this day off and people already have plans. \n\nMy team is the IT team and, as many of you know IT team gets shafted every time it can get shafted by any company. \n\nSo over the course of the week I let my team know what is happening. I let them know I have been reaching out to higher ups to fix it. I also tell them that if their plans are ruined, I will make it right at work. \n\nOver the course of 3 meetings, it start to look like things will not go my way. In response I send an email to the CEO of the company. All of my higher ups know I was going to do this and said I should do this as he is very family oriented and that he would not allow ANYONE to work on a national holiday. \n\nWell he is on vacation in the Bahamas until the 6th.  But his assistant informed me he would look at this after he gets back. *Repeatedly slams head into desk.* So I tell everyone that it will be work from home, and that we will be setting my cell phone as priority in the call routing. Meaning I would get most of the calls. To be honest, I was expecting almost zero calls.  Especially since I was asked to send out a notification that IT support would cover the 4th of July. I never sent that email out.\n\nA day later I was given another outrage. I was told in an email that my employees would be required to be at the office, and no one was allowed to work from home. They would be checking the door badge ins to verify we were at the office. I asked why in an email, and they said that they wanted to make sure no one was playing video games at work. We normally work from home about 2/3rd of the week and video game playing is a normal occurrence at work.\n\nSo I walked into the person\u2019s office. After a very long conversation where she was losing the logic war with me, she told me that \u201cIts just IT, you guys don\u2019t have lives.\u201d No I am not kidding you, this is exactly what they told me. I reported this to my VP who said. \u201cI will take care of this. It likely wont be until after the 4th, so get creative.\u201d I know this man well. We have worked together a long time and \u201cGet creative\u201d is code for corporate fuckery. \n\nI asked the person requiring us to be at the office if they cared if we had an office party. They said no, as long as it did not interfere with the call flow. Even suggested using my new company card to pay for it. \u201cGo wild.\u201d Pro-tip, never tell me go wild. \n\nAt this point, it was Tuesday the 21st. I let everyone know what\u2019s up, but that I have something planned. I asked who had things planned for that day. Two people told me they were planning to shoot off fireworks with their family, but the rest were planning BBQs with friends. \n\nI write up an email to the VP over my department and the Bad VP. I tell them all that I let everyone know. We all were expected to work until 8PM Monday. Per the conversation with the bad VP I will be having an office party as a sort of sorry to the guys and gals who got shafted by this decision. \n\nThe bad VP replied again. \u201cThank you for your understanding. Also yes I would expect an office party if I had to work on the 4th of July as well. So go wild and enjoy your time. Use your new company credit card if you need to cover a few expenses. Also I should not have to remind you or anyone else. No fireworks or alcohol on company property.\u201d\n\nSo now it is time to tell you about my office. See a while back, the IT team was moved from the main corp office and into a smaller building by itself. It has a nice gaming break room, a decent sized gym, and a full on drink bar. Soft drinks mind you, no alcohol at work. Out back is a big patio that crosses county lines as soon as you cross a small creek. A creek that just so happens to have a foot bridge over it, leading to an empty field.   \n\nI start making phone calls.\n\nMonday, June the 25th  \n\nI call up everyone into an hour early meeting that morning. I explain to them all that I will be making it right. I asked everyone to invite their friends and family to the office. No supplies will need to be brought by anyone. I tell them all that this will be non-alcoholic, but that I will be planning something for everyone. I told them to expect all food to be provided and they don\u2019t need to bring anything, unless they want to bring some fireworks. IE they wont have to spend a dime. \n\nThe 4th comes and the entire day, we did absolutely no work. No tickets, no calls came in. Well 7 calls did come in, but from the same person. The Bad VP. She was calling to make sure we were manning the phones. All of us were playing video games or watching movies. 6PM rolls around and everyone was told that the food was ready. \n\nPeople were expecting hot dogs, hamburgers, maybe a bratwurst or two. What they got was a full on BBQ feast with pizza and other foods. There was smoked brisket, spare ribs, smoked sausage, smoked turkey, both kinds of tater salad, cole slaw, green beans with bacon and onion, potatos au gratin, pizza from 2 different places, excellent hamburgers, and bratwurst hot dogs. On the deserts side was cake, very good cookies, 4 different kinds of pies, and about 2 pounds of fudge. \n\nFamilies, and friends started showing up at around 6-6:15ish. Some brought alcohol but I told them they would need to leave that in their cars as I was not THAT crazy. Some were not too happy about that but agreed as it was a free dinner for random strangers. \n\nSO let me set the scene for you. I am out there with all calls routed to my cell phone,  and everyone just having a good time. We have a TON of people there just enjoying the fun night, chatting about random stuff, eating the food, and occasionally lighting off some sparklers or throwing firecrackers into the stream. (Its not stocked and only 1 foot deep.)   \n\nMy VP, not the bad VP mind you, showed up with his family and brought some water balloons for the kids\u2026 and manchildren. \n\nAround 8:30ish its getting dark and people want to shoot off more than the simple sparklers and firecrackers we had been using. The VP over the IT dept had everyone cross the foot bridge, over county line and off company property mind you, and we set up a big wooden board using it as our launch pad. \n\nWe fired off what we had for an hour or two, and sort of just hang out for a little while. At around this time people were tired and ready to head home. I told people to take home leftovers, within reason.  We all clocked out at 8 and no one left until about 10:30. The bad VP did call once more while we were out back at the party. It was 7:50 and she called asking for a status update. My exact words were. \u201cWell you were the only one to call us today. The rest of us are on the back patio enjoying the 4th of July shindig.\u201d She simply acted like my boss and said \u201cAs long as no alcohol or fireworks are on company property, I do not care.\u201d\n\nWe ate roughly half of the food catered. The rest was taken home. A small group volunteered to stay behind to clean up including my VP. We had a funny conversation about how this will make waves with the bosses. But he said he had my back and asked me how much this cost. I just gave him a sideways look which made him laugh. \n\nTuesday morning, I submitted the expense report to my VP. This email would inevitably make its way over to the bad VP and up the chain to the CIO of the company. It would be a bad idea to give out the exact cost of the party, mind you, but I can tell you that because of this 4th of July party, new rules were put into place. Any expenses of over 4k or more must be approved by the direct supervisor, VP over the department, and the full expense report must be sent to the financial department for review after the fact. \n\nHint, the party cost over 6k. \n\nThe BBQ was the most expensive part. I did not order from a low or mid tier place. The place I ordered from has consistently been on the top ten in the DFW listing for the last 30 years. I ate at that place so much I made friends with the owner. The BEST bbq I have ever had. \n\nThe pies and cakes were custom made by a bakery and the cookies were made by a boutique cookie place. I had 10 12 packs of coke, coke zero, Dp, DP Zero, Pepsi, and Pepsi zero. I bought 5 pepperoni, 5 sausage, 5 cheese, 2 hawaiian, and 3 cheeseburger pizzas from one place, and nearly the same number from another place. Excluding the cheeseburger ones I subbed out those for a different specialty pizza from the other place. \n\nThe burgers were from an excellent burger place that did catering. I know that owner well. He brought his kids for the night of fun after he heard what was going to be happening. He was also the one who brought the bratdogs as he recently added those to his menu. \n\nThis was the most expensive office party in the history of the company. The only things more expensive than this were some business meetings that the CEO rented private rooms in high end restaurants for. \n\nAs for the CEO, he was outraged. Not at the cost of the party mind you. He knew that the party would not have been necessary if people had been allowed to go home. He was outraged that IT was the only group required to work on that day. When I submitted the logs showing how we received no real phone calls, no service requests, and that we basically watched movies/played video games during our shift, he had heard enough. He apparently sent out a scathing email about work life balance and the importance of our holidays to every upper management.\n\nIt was kind of funny as people wanted me to get in trouble for what I did, but the reality is other departments have done similar things in the past just not on the scale that IT did. The Bad VP was admonished quite effectively and sent me an apology email. I forwarded it to the team with a strong hint to not reply. \n\nThen my VP let the CIO and the CEO know about what the Bad VP said. \u201cYou guys don\u2019t have lives.\u201d The bad VP did actually confirm she said it in a meeting with her EVP. It did not go over well. I have never heard people yelling in an office meeting like that before. The CEO of the company came to our office and YELLED at her. \n\nNot sure if she was fired, but she is not at work today. In Active Directory she does not have the down arrow of death, so not 100 percent what happened to her.  I know she lost whatever clout she had at this company with her attitude. \n\nIf anything more happens, I will update. But so far it looks like the fallout from this is I caused a new rule to be put in place about how much you are allowed to spend at one time. The Bad VP may or may not be let go/forced to resign. I know she got yelled at. Strangely there is now no longer any push back for my bid to get everyone back to working from home.\n\nEDIT: Please stop asking me where the restaurants are. Im not doxxing myself.",

At the time this  happened, I had not called in sick for 9 months, and even then, the  manager had sent me home.\n\nI had  been up all night, swinging between burning hot and freezing cold so I  was obviously feverish, and I had been throwing up 'at both ends' shall  we say. At one point at  about 2 am I was on the toilet, with my head in the sink, utterly miserable. I must have passed out  because the next thing I knew I was lifting my head off the sink and it  was 7 am. I was due to start work at 12 that day but that obviously  wasn't going to happen.\n\nSo I  called up the manager. Let's call the manager Steve. Steve was known for  being a real a-hole. He never believed anyone who called in sick  except his best buds (usually other managers, never lowly staff), but often called in sick himself (a lot of the time we knew it was because he was hungover and not actually sick). The conversation went as  follows:\n\nMe: Hey Steve, sorry, I can't come in. I'm sick.\n\nSteve: With what?\n\nMe: I don't know. I think it might be the flu. I've been up all night being sick, and I have a fever.\n\nSteve: Don't be stupid. If you had the flu you'd be completely knocked out. I need you in. Come in or you're fired.\n\nMe: I can't. I just told you I can't stop vomiting. I passed out.\n\nSteve: (growling angrily) Either come in or bring a doctors note, or you're fired!\n\nIn  the UK, you are legally allowed to self-certify for 5 days. This means  you can tell your employer you are sick and you do not need a doctors  note. If you're sick for more than 5 days, you then need a note. It is  also illegal to demand a doctors note during the self-certify period.\n\nI  knew this, but I was terrified. This was during the recession. I  couldn't afford to lose my job. So I got myself dressed. Almost passed  out trying to do so. Then trudged to the doctors some 25 minutes walk  away.\n\nI end up sitting in the  doctor's office for a little over an hour, which for walk-in was pretty  good. I get in to see the doctor and she is furious at me for coming in.  You're not supposed to come to the doctors when you have a cold or flue, and of  course I knew I should be able to self certify. She told me as such,  saying I shouldn't be here and should have stayed at home.\n\nI  then explained what had happened with Steve and how he had threatened  to fire me over this and I couldn't afford to lose my job - I was  struggling as it was. My doctor  turned her anger towards my manager. She asked if I got sick pay from the company, and I said yes.\n\n\"He wants a sick note does he,\" the doctor says. \"Okay. I'll give him a sick note.\n\nNow, my manager just wanted a note confirming I was sick, but instead my doctor wrote something along the lines of this:\n\n'\\[My Name\\]  has come to the surgery because \\[manager name\\] has insisted she come in,  in spite of the fact that this is illegal and all employees are allowed  to self certify.  Due to being forced to make this unnecessary and  highly dangerous trip when the patient is ill, has a fever of 39\u00b0C, and  almost passed out in the waiting room, I am signing \\[my name\\] off for  two full weeks to recover. Had \\[my name\\] been allowed to self certify as  is the law, they might only have needed a few days, but due to  straining themselves, they now require two full weeks. They are not to  be permitted to work until \\[date 2 weeks later\\]'\n\nThe doctor said she would have signed me off longer but this was the longest she could do without requiring further evidence. So basically, instead of just being off for a few days, I was now signed off for a full two weeks, and I'd be paid for it.\n\nI went to my place of work, at which point one of the duty managers  saw me and asked me what the heck I was doing here, go home, I was  obviously very unwell. I explained what happened. They agreed to help me  downstairs to Steve's office and went with me inside.\n\nI handed Steve the note. He looked worried and tried to say 'I wasn't being serious about firing you.'\n\nWell gee, when you angrily growled it down the phone it sure sounded like it.\n\nThe  duty manager then declared that they were going to drive me home. It  was clear Steve wanted to argue but had the sense to know he shouldn't.\n\nThe  duty manager then drove me home, made sure I was okay, then went back  to work where they informed our union rep of what had happened.\n\nSteve  had a disciplinary hearing where he was given a severe reprimand and a  warning. Steve tried to argue he never said I'd be fired and I was lying  and just decided to go to the doctors, but the duty manager said they  heard him admit to it when he said to me that he really didn't mean it.\n\nI  felt better after a few days, and enjoyed my two weeks off, fully paid,  and enjoyed the nice weather we had. Meanwhile, Steve was forced to  work overtime because we were short-staffed. So thanks to the doctor,  instead of being off for a few days, I ended up getting a nice two week  paid vacation, and Steve was given a final warning, all because he insisted I get a doctors note.\n\nTL;DR: Manager demands I get a doctor's note or I'm fired, so the doctor signs me off sick for two weeks instead of 2 days to teach him a lesson.\n\nEdit: To clarify the whole 'you're not supposed to come in when you are ill'. I should have been more specific - the rule is you're not supposed to come in when you have a cold or flu. The reason is there's nothing a doctor can really do except recommend you take over the counter cold and flu meds. So it is recommended that you do not come in if you have a cold or flu and instead take meds at home or pick some up at the pharmacy instead of risking infecting those waiting in the surgery. Even then, it's not a hard core rule, more a common courtesy asked of people. If you really want to, you absolutely can. ",

            "So GP here. \n\nFew things I\u2019d like to clarify \n\nYou can self cert for 7 days before needing a fit note (we call them MED3) rather than 5 days.\n\nIt\u2019s not illegal to ask for one, however if it\u2019s less than 7 days then the doctor can charge for it as a private service. They\u2019re free if > 7 days. YOU as the individual shouldn\u2019t be liable for a fee, I would suggest passing it on to the employer who\u2019s asking for it. I generally don\u2019t ever charge for anything so it\u2019s a moot point\n\nThe med3 form is a standard form stating either you\u2019re not fit for work, or you may be fit for work taking into account certain stipulations such as altered hours, amended duties etc. Also interesting to note is that the employer isn\u2019t legally required to follow these stipulations however most will do so as it would be indefensible at an employment tribunal. \n\nThe self cert form and the med3 are mostly for statutory sick pay and tax purposes. Your employer may have a specific separate form for self cert purposes that they can require you to fill out.\n\nAlso ring your GP and ask for a sick line rather than coming in. We can issue them electronically now and email it to you. \n\nIve long ago arrived at the conclusion that managers just like making employees life difficult and I\u2019m always happy to oblige if someone is genuinely sick. Having worked in a supermarket in the UK myself you get little thanks for working above and beyond. Ultimately they don\u2019t give a shit about you so don\u2019t put your job before your physical (and mental) health",

            "I had something similar happen to me a few years ago. I was working for a well known mental health charity at the time. I was very very mentally unwell, partly due to the pressure at work.\nI was told if I wanted any time off, I needed a doctors note. So off to the doctor I went.\n When my doctor heard who I worked for and why my mental health was deteriorating, rather than sign me off for the two weeks I had asked for, she signed me off for 2 months and told me not to go back there, that she would keep me signed off until I got the help I needed and found another job.\nThe reason for the note was 'work related stress' and she just muttered 'oh the irony' while signing it.",
            "That was a truly lovely note.  \n\nSo glad you had a union to stand up for you.",
            "You had a good doctor, willing to take your side.\n\nMy first call-center job was an a facility built in what used to be a big shopping mall. I can't be certain that it was \"sick building syndrome\" or just doing a job that required constant talking without the benefit of voice training... but after about six months on the job my throat failed me completely. I could barely speak above a whisper, and any kind of speech was very painful. I'd go an entire week, struggling to be able to speak loud enough to be heard on the phone. Friday evening, I'd go home and do absolutely nothing involving talking through the whole weekend. Monday morning, I'd feel better and go back to work... but by Friday I'd again be unable to speak.\n\nI went to the doctor I was appointed under the company's healthcare plan. He gave me an examination, declared it was something viral (without *naming* anything) and give me an antibiotic. No days off work, and he would never admit it was related to the nature of my work.\n\nAfter a few months of this routine, with no signs of getting better, I finally talked to my manager about it. I explained to her that this problem had been going on for quite some time, and that the only thing that seemed to help was my not speaking for a long period. I asked her to switch me over to something else, temporarily, that would let me rest my voice. Answering e-mails. Chaperoning other people and rating *their* calls. Handling paperwork. *Anything* that didn't entail talking on the phone for eight hours a day.\n\nShe told me, despite having done exactly this for others on the team, that she couldn't do it. Despite my pleading with her in a hoarse whisper (because I physically couldn't talk any louder), she said that my only option was to keep taking phone calls. So I quit, right there. Walked away from her desk to HR, put in my resignation, and told them WHY.\n\nI'd heard from a (now ex-)co-worker that she lost her management position less than a month later.",
            "I swear \u2018Steve\u2019 is a nameplate for a prick of a manager because it\u2019s realistic, haha. An old manager of mine who was actually called Steve was a knobhead. I worked in a warehouse for a printing company, and a fellow colleague just didn\u2019t like me. To this day I have no clue why, but he would constantly tell Steve I was shit and slow, and so Steve would berate me for it. However, when he actually watched me work he would say how well I\u2019m doing and that I\u2019m starting to really pick up the pace. Like, fuck you. This is the speed I *always* work at, you just listen to some wank stain that has a serious issue with me.\n\nI ended up getting sacked because of it, too. Now, they judge your \u2018output\u2019 by how many shipping labels you\u2019ve printed out for finished jobs. The bulk of the work came in the first four hours of the shift as every job due to be delivered on the day had to be done. I would do several pallets worth of jobs, and another colleague would usually help with packing and labelling a lot of this because of the strict deadline. See where that\u2019s going?\n\nMy ID would be listed on a minority amount of the jobs, whereas the colleague would label most of them as if they did all of those jobs. The rule of thumb is generally for the bench hand to use the computer that I\u2019m signed in to because I did the job itself. But yeah. This colleague took most of the credit, which in turn made them look like the best bench hand by a mile while leaving me looking incredibly shit.",

I had only ever been off sick twice in the year I\u2019d worked there, and both of those days I was actually in work but sent home due to being too ill to work (one time I had injured myself, the other time I was being sick at work). I was still really poorly, I was in the stock room coughing until I was gagging, and the relief manager said, \u201cif you\u2019re going to be sick can you please do it quietly!\u201d Then on my way upstairs I got really breathless and felt like I was going to pass out so a first aider was called (it was a department store where I worked for a small concession). They told me I was too ill to be in work but I told them they wouldn\u2019t let me have any time off. They told my assistant manager who came upstairs to see me, basically said I could have an extra 10 minutes break, that\u2019s all. I was on the late shift so 10pm finish, and from 8pm I was sat on the floor sorting out the Christmas card shelves, crying because I was in so much pain.\n\nThe next day was my scheduled day off so I went to the doctor, who confirmed I had the flu, so I got 2 weeks sick note, taking me through Xmas and up to the new year. I was well enough to go in just before Xmas, but I made sure I got a nice long Xmas break leaving the rest to suffer with the mad rush.\n\nAnd when my manager finally returned she threw away the memo to file too.",

            "I used to be the assistant manager at a gas station in California when I was much younger. I got along really good with the manager. We had a good working relationship and he's the one that promoted me. it felt like a real validation to have the responsibility and to help him run the station well.\n\nI had to close out the books every single night, count all the money, measure out all the gas and close up the shop.\n\nThen we started coming up short on the till.\n\nI worked with two other guys on my shift and I couldn't figure out which one was stealing but someone was.\n\nMy manager was really pissed about this and he would call me up every morning at 6:00 and start demanding to know why we were short.\n\nMy answer is ranged from, \"I don't know I double counted the money\" to \"I don't know who's stealing it\" to \"I told you, I don't know where the money is. I counted it multiple times and I watched the other two guys\" to finally \"I'm sorry Jesse but I quit.\"\n\nI mean, I got his frustration, and his job was in jeopardy just like mine but yelling at me at 6:00 in the morning isn't going to bring that money back.",
            "I once agreed to do split shifts for three weeks to cover for a shitty employee who was going on a month long trip. I didn\u2019t love having to do this, but there was nobody else to do it, we couldn\u2019t hire for such a short time. I lived nearby, so it wasn\u2019t hard to go home for a few hours, and it was temporary. \n\nThen I needed ONE Sunday off because my sister was getting married the day before, and there was a ton of work needed for the wedding. Nobody would cover it for me. Not the girl I covered for, not the manager whose ass I saved. When my brother in law got married and I was a big part of helping out with the food for their backyard wedding, I was denied coverage for the next day, AGAIN. This is in spite of the fact that I never used up my full two weeks of time off and never called in sick. \n\nI grew up overseas, and used to go visit my parents in another country every other year for Christmas before starting this job. They\u2019d come back to our country the previous two Christmases, but had decided to move home, so we had one last chance to visit them in the country I grew up in. This is not a short visit kind of trip, it\u2019s a minimum two week kind of deal. We decided to go for a month. Three months before, I went and told my manager I was going to have to give notice because I was going on a trip that would require me to take a full month off during a vacation blackout period. I knew it wouldn\u2019t be approved, and as the assistant manager I knew it would take her time to replace me, so I was giving tons of notice. \n\nShe knew the rest of her team was shit (she\u2019d fucked up a great team when she took over for the previous manager), and that she didn\u2019t have a single good candidate for a new AM, so she begged head office to let me take a leave of absence, because it would take them way more than four weeks to retrain a new AM. They agreed, and everyone who had refused to cover for me in the past was forced to work additional hours over Christmas and she had no AM. \n\nOver the period of time I was away, my former manager, who had opened a new location, gave her notice for mid January. They needed a new manager, and I was one of the more senior/better AMs. I interviewed for the job while overseas and got it. So my old manager was screwed over for Christmas and ended up having to replace me with one of her not-so-great staff anyways. \n\nMoral of the story - if you don\u2019t recognize your more dedicated staff, someone else will, and when that day comes, they will not hesitate to leave you in a lurch.",

            "Did you talk to your manager to say, \"look I appreciate that you come to me for extra shifts so regularly, I need the money after all, but can we cut it down to just once a week I'll do extra shifts for you? Thanks I'm glad you understand.\"\n\nI used to be a manager of a construction site offshore and we regularly had the opportunity to fill extra shifts. I learned who the guys were that airways said yes, but also the guys that said no. I always went to the ones that said yes first, I felt it was my responsibility to give them first refusal. But if any of them came to me and said, I don't want to do them anymore, I'd just take them off the list. Every chance you're manager just thought he was doing your a favour and being respectful to you for your past performance.",
            "Yeah don't answer your phone. Block the number. If you do want to, call back. Seen and lived this from both sides.rostering is shyte when you have unreliable people. I ran small teams of around 20 people. Feom experience I chose to pretty much NOT call people to cover on the same day. You would usually have a shitty day covering.... but everyone did. With most of my guys it got to a point where if they were calling in sick, they were genuinely sick. The whole group refused to put up with the bullshit of someone not respecting them like that.",
            "I was a former director of a memory care unit at an Assisted Living, I lasted about 6 months because of crap like this. Instead of having more staffing to ensure that there was coverage if someone called off they purposely staffed the place low, at just a legal amount. Then when someone called off, damn near everyday, I was suppose to call every single employee on the roster and ask them to come in. They encouraged us to pressure them and hint at their future employment. It was horrible and if you tried to find a nice way to ask them to come in such as giving them a $5 gift card we as managers were written up for bribery. The managers had to cover any extra shifts that they couldn\u2019t get covered even if they had been working 12 hours straight already and this would mean another 12 hr shift back to back. \nAny families out there considering an Assisted Living, I strongly encourage you to consider adult day centers and in home care over night instead. No matter how nice the facility is or how expensive, they ALL do this!\nAdult days have much smaller \u201cresident\u201d to staff ratios and your in home care at night when they need it most will be one on one. \nThe cost will equal out to the the same or less than an assisted living as well.\nJust wanted to put this out there, I advocate all the time for in home care vs Assisted livings because of the lack of care I saw at all levels.",

Then take it personally and dock my hrs the next week because I couldn't cover or because I did too many hrs covering. I'm so glad I left.",

        "selftext": "As part of the plan to return to office post covid, my company has done a lot of re-designating of who can permanently work from home, who can hybrid, etc. I really wanted to work from home full time. I hate the office with a burning passion - it's distracting, it's a long commute, there's no benefit to being there, so on and so forth. I'd just rather be at home.\n\nWell when we thought May was going to be go back to office time they started giving out the new designations. I got designated as in office full time. It made no sense to me. I work on a team of 8 people and each of us is in a different office somewhere in the country. I've literally never been to an in person meeting or needed to do in person work in 3 years at this company. Every single other person on my team got designated to work from home. So I brought it up with my boss and asked to work from home. When I started at this company and lived elsewhere I got to work from home for 4 months before I moved and the past 14 months during covid have been at home, so 18/36 months at the company have been WFH. What I was told is that I go idle too often in chat to trust to work from home. \n\nBasically we have a company wide IM system that shows you as available, idle, or in a meeting. If you don't touch your keyboard for 5 minutes you show as idle. So they've decided to use this as a measure for who is working and who isn't. The thing is, like many people in many types of jobs, I don't have shit to do for a full 8 hours every single day. The amount of work I have to do on a typical day takes 3-5 hours of actual attention. There simply isn't something to do ALL the time. My performance numbers actually went up working from home, by all objective KPI numbers I'm a better worker at home. In fact, in the KPIs that I don't flat out lead the team in, I come in second. There isn't work to do that I'm neglecting or procrastinating, when something comes up I simply do it until it's done or until I can't do anymore due to waiting on someone else then stop. And I've done that method long enough that my work queue stays empty because I worked to get my queue down to the point where when something comes up I can immediately address it and be done with it. But because I have other ways to spend my time in down time instead of messing around online at my cube pretending to be working meaning I show idle more often, I'm a worse worker apparently. I was told if it weren't for that they would let me work at home.\n\nSo I wrote a 6 line powershell script that virtually inputs the period key every 4 minutes that starts running every day at 8am and stops at 5pm. So now I literally never go idle. I do the same amount of work and still read books, watch tv, and play video games on the side. But I have a shiny green check next to my name all day.\n\nBecause of covid complications they eventually said no going back until after labor day. I just had a meeting with my boss and he said over this time they've noticed I go idle a lot less than I used to so they're changing my designation to work from home, all because of a little icon in some software. This concludes my TED talk on why low to middle level managers are the dumbest, most useless do-nothing positions in all of corporate America\n\nEDIT: I do not need to be told to buy a mouse jiggler for the 30th time. I'm aware of what they are. This cost me no money and achieves the same thing. Why would I pay to achieve an effect I've already achieved for free?\n\nEDIT 2: A lot of people are understandably asking for the script:\n\n    $dummyshell = New-Object -com \"Wscript.shell\"\n    $dummyshell.sendkeys(\".\")\n\nThat's the backbone of the whole thing. There's different ways to implement it with for loops or scheduled tasks or whatever, that parts up to you, but that's all the powershell needs at it's core to accomplish this. A lot of people have pointed out that sending Insert or F13 instead of period would be better so change that up if you want.\n\nTo all the people commenting that I'm a shitty employee and obviously trying to insult me over it: I wish I could make you feel just how little I care. To all the people implying a work day isn't valid if you aren't at 100% capacity from 8 - 5, keep it up, you truly are an ideal employee...*to them*. Enjoy the taste of leather, bootlickers\n\nEdit 3: Some of y\u2019all would be pissed as fuck if I explained the concept of firefighters to you",

He worked until they decided they had to close a district down. He had great numbers. He worked hard. He was passionate about the work. They gave him a crappy option of being demoted and moved to a much further location due to some restructuring. Of course it was around when he'd be able to get bigger benefits for staying.\n\nHe tried to find work but realized times had changed. No one wanted him. It wasn't as easy as \"go around and show your resume\" like he had told me. Things went horribly. \n\nLater he got sick and since it was around Covid there were no respirators for him. Insurance got held up and that cost him a spot he should of had. Now I don't have a dad.\n\nA bit extreme to blame it all on that? Maybe.\n\nBut I honestly hate the mindset because it did fuck all for my dad and for me. He could have enjoyed his money and effort in life. Instead he always delayed it for the promised \"when I retire\" which was swept out from under him. My gradma was much the same. She saved and saved. Was nervous about buying anything. She apparently had tons of money, but some inheritors didn't give a crap about her and sucked up tons of that money. Its funny how she worked so hard for someone who ultimately hated her. \n\nIt has taught me that there is no reward for loyalty to a corporation or brand. There is no honor among employers.

The smile on my daughter's face is priceless when I get to pick her up or drop her off at school some days; I save a minimum of 2 hours per day when I don't have to commute to the office; and I'm more relaxed and productive as a result of just these two benefits.\n\nThere's four things employers need to change, if they're going to come out of this thing the same or better:\n\n1.  Stop treating work from home (or any flexibility) like a privilege - make it a benefit\n1. Focus on job watching (outcomes) - not clock watching\n1.

            "It's always hilarious how the people who scream the loudest about their property lines are usually the ones with the incorrect fence/property line. When I was little, our neighbors put up a fence for their yard. We got along okay with them, until we didn't. Nothing else ever really came about it other than them being rude. Basically they thought they were better than us even though they lived in the same type of double wide as we did (with a bunch of useless upgrades like a fireplace that they never used and carpet in the bathrooms) and were up to their eyeballs in debt living above their means.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, my dad put up a chainlink fence when we got a dog. And naturally put the fence up to theirs. Neighbors didn't like that, and said it was on their property, even though they put their fence up first so like, why wasn't it on your line to begin with? Called in a surveyor, found out that the fence company they hired did a BIG no-no. See, in the backyard area there was a large, old oak tree whose roots go over the property line, but the tree itself was squarely on our property. The fence company put the fence at an angle up to a certain point so that the entire tree was within their property. The part of the fence in the front yard was on the line. So now they had to have that piece of backyard fence moved to the other side of the tree, and even further back from the line because they could not damage the roots, making their backyard that much smaller.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the end of the day, we never used that part of our backyard as that was where our septic tank was. We didn't care about the fence thing. But the neighbors threw a tantrum because we *dared* to put our \"white trash\" chain link fence up against their wood one and lost a buttload of money and a sizeable portion of their property. They tried to contest the decision, saying free country and all that, but were basically told that no one forced them to build a fence, and they don't need one to survive. So if they wanted to make the free and totally optional decision to have a fence, they would have to make sure it was all within their property, or ask to buy that 4ft or so from my mom and have the property lines adjusted. My mom absolutely refused and they had to move the fence.",

After the survey, that tree was actually in my neighbor's yard.  I decided to replace the fence (as it was old and falling apart anyway) completely at my expense.

I didn\u2019t think much of it as that land was an empty field at the time but a few years later I was doing some work on that edge of the property and something didn\u2019t seem right. Just eyeballing where the property pins were looked like he was occupying a lot of my land. \n\nPulled up satellite images and cross referenced with the city\u2019s database and it sure looked like he\u2019d taken my property. Went through Google Earth and found older satellite images and apparently he widened his driveway and put in a $50k retaining wall the same year the previous owners bought my house. All without permits or a survey.\n\nLooked to me like he was intentionally doing this when the house changed hands, banking on the fact that the new owners wouldn\u2019t be entirely sure where the property line was. So I went over there and politely talked to him about it. He agreed to a survey which showed he was occupying 1/4 acre of my land with his improvements. All of the new landscaping plus the wall and half his driveway was on my property. \n\nI was going to sell it to him for about $5,000, but then he tried to trick me into signing it over to him for free. Well mama didn\u2019t raise no fool and I read through the contract he presented to me while he got more and more uncomfortable. I politely declined to give him my land - this guy was rich AF, his home was >$500k, he only lived in it a few months out of the year, and he bragged that it was one of 7 homes he owned. \n\nWell he obviously doesn\u2019t like being told no because that pissed him off and he threatened that he was just going to \u201ctake it by eminent domain.\u201d I knew that was BS so I called him on his shit and told him to go for it.\n\nSo he puts the house on the market. I immediately call his realtor and let them know there\u2019s a property line dispute. Next day the for sale sign goes back down and a couple weeks later I get a call from his lawyer. He wants to talk. He tells me a sob story about the guy, tries to emotionally manipulate me into accepting a fraction of the value of my land because \u201cpoor neighbor has all these troubles.\u201d I refuse and tell him to pay me what it\u2019s worth or move the wall and restore the natural state of my property. \n\nLong story short he dragged it out over a year while the house sat empty and unable to be sold. I eventually sold the land to him for $15k. With the lawyer fees and property taxes and so on I figure he spent over $30k to resolve this, if he\u2019d just been nice to me he could have had it for $5k.",

            "I had a fence dispute with a neighbor.  It was awful.  We bought our house, and within the first week we walked over and introduced ourselves to the neighbor.  We also gave them a copy of the survey we had and said that we didnt necessarily want them to move the fence, but to acknowledge that it was over their property line.  This to prevent them from trying an adverse posession claim.  The guy said that the fence was there when they moved in 4-5 years before us and that there was no survey for the property.  I knew the no survey thing was a lie because I could literally see the pins from the survey on their property.  The guy said he would get a survey done and get back to us.  Several months go by and we hear nothing.  I was in the back doing yard work and saw him in the back yard and asked him for an update.  He yelled at me that he didnt need me \"hunting him down\" and that he would get to it when he got to it.   Reached out to my lawyer, sent certified letters which they never signed for.   Then they sent me an unsigned / dated letter saying that they would \"investigate it\".  Few months more, and nothing.  Had my lawyer threaten legal action.  That got their attention.  They moved the fence.  Few months later, we had a really bad storm and a tree fell down and destroyed part of their fence.  They tried to get me to pay for it.  I laughed.  I offered to (and did) cut it up for them.  Told them if they spent the 40-50 bucks on getting the new pole i'd help them install it.  Havent heard from them, and the fence is still broken.",
            "We also had a disagreement over property lines with a neighbor but it ended much more agreeably. We had just installed a fence (with concrete based fence posts) along the property line. Now, we had moved into the house 6 mo-1 year prior and my mom had had the property lines drawn when we moved in, so she was aware of where they were. I think she set the fence 6in -12in back from the line to avoid any issues.\n\nNow, before we had moved into the house there had been a line of several sad, sick pine trees running along the property line, roughly a foot closer to the neighbors yard than our new fence was. When we had moved in my mom had paid to have the trees taken down and the stumps removed. \n\nOur neighbor stopped by a couple days after the fence went up and mentioned that he thought our new fence was a couple inches on his side of the property line. My mom responded with \u201c Well if that\u2019s the case, you just paid a very reasonable price to get all these stumps removed.\u201d We never heard another word about the fence for the remaining 12-13 years.",

He used to park his excavators inches from the edge of the road on some grass which was his lawn directly across from our driveway. It made it very difficult to get equipment in the driveway. He did it on purpose to piss us off. Turns out that our driveway went all the way across the front of his property and he was over the line in another spot where he would park his dumptruck.

            "TL:DR at the bottom. \n\nThis will get buried, but we had a 2 storey end unit in a town house, so five houses in a block and then a gap and another set of five houses.\n\nWhen we moved in we had full access to our back yard through a fence as did the neighbour we shared a common yard with. The other four neighbours in our block had no access to their back yard without carrying their lawnmower through their house. \n\nOur block of five was the only one on the street like this, the remaining blocks on the street had a common access to the back yards through a gate beside the end unit, exactly where the neighbours gate was. \n\nThe first spring after we moved in our backyard flooded and the water took two months to evaporate naturally. \n\nI took notice that the neighbour behind us had poured concrete between our property and theirs  and the neighbour to our right (who has the gate) had put metal sheeting between our yards so his raised gardens would not be washed out in the spring rains. \n\nSo late spring, I call the city and ask about fixing the common drainage on our plan, it\u2019s on public land and they should be responsible. \n\nThe city shows up and the world around me gets destroyed.  Starting with the neighbour behind me who had illegally altered the easement by pouring concrete and preventing drainage, they had to pay to have the hedges removed, the concrete dug up and new mature trees and fences put in. Their yard also lost nearly 6 feet because they were forced to put their new fence off the easement. \n\nThe neighbour to my right was found to have altered the land by raising his property, and changing how the drainage system was designed.  It was also determined that they had removed the access to easement fence and altered city property without permit.\n\nSo his gated access was supposed to be for our block of neighbours to access their back yards through the easement. \n\nBecause the city could only access the whole mess by going between our houses, my yard was raised up by 18 inches at the front, and 23 inches at the back to return it to original construction, I got new fences and for a small fee I put a fence along the back to enclose my yard (vs leave it open along the easement like the other yards had). \n\nIt was sweet justice.\n\nTL:DR My neighbours altered their property and the original home owners never complained; when I moved in and saw the problems I complained they were forced to spend thousands of dollars to fix the property.",

            "Had this house with an attached garage, and barely an inch after the garage an dirt road that lead to the neighbors parking spot ( about a three car sized patch of dirt just off the road) and decent sized wood mill that was located behind our house, on the other side of the road was a small pond pretty sure it was man made. Our neighbors mobile home was positioned so it's long end started just behind and before the end of the pound, and ran until the tree line, so the road had to be where it was. Which was fine, this neighbor, Bob, was one of the best you could hope for, helpful, quiet, and he'd even plow our driveway during every snow storm.   \n\n\nSadly, he became senile, and put into a nursing home. His land was entangled with the mill, and all of it wrapped up in a family trust to protect it from his ex-wife. His nephew ran a mill up the road and the second he got his hands on Bob's mill, he started taking everything he wanted, and selling off the rest, and he was a prick about it. Now Bob used to own the house we lived in, in fact he built it, but lost it in the aforementioned divorce. Bob always mentioned that his property line actually started about 3/4's of the way into our garage, but being as it never mattered to either him or us we never cared to look into it.... Until his nephew started trying to claim half the garage was his, and either we tear it down or he's coming for what's inside. We told him to lawyer up if he wanted, and he let it drop knowing it wasn't worth the legal fee's. We didn't see much of him seeing as he only came to the mill to take things and then he'd go and the house laid abandoned, but we still started going through the process of finding out where the line did infact lie.   \n\n\nThen his mother moved in and started pulling a lot of the same crap, she'd always complain about cars going down the mill road to be parked out back of our house during large gatherings and what not. We'd dismiss her as even if it wasn't our property it was an awfully stupid complaint that wasn't worth anyone's time but hers. Until she started parking her truck next to the garage so that we could not longer access our backyard by vehicle. We found out where the property line was shortly after.  Bob must have confused left for right at one point in his old age as the line was in fact in her driveway, not just the mill road that was her sons only access point, but the small pond, the driveway where she should have been parking in the first place.  \n\n\nWe informed her that the road was in fact ours, but she was fine to use it. She didn't believe us, I suppose to the same degree we didn't used to care. She parked in the mill road again, so with legal proof in hand, I called a friend who worked for a towing company to come out, small area so he didn't mind. She flew out that house hollering about calling the cops on me, and charging him with theft if he tried to move it. Honestly I let her go on for a while, eventually she said she was going back inside to call the cops and that's when I gave her the documentation.   \n\n\nWe had a quick conversation about manners, and respect.

This fence was maybe 2 feet inside her line) and her neighbors have a large wooden fence several feet off of their line. She told me that when they put up their fence, she thinks they crossed over into her yard. \"They're trying to steal my garden!\" she told me (they weren't). \"I remember exactly how much land I had when I moved in 40 years ago!\" (she didn't). \"I'm gonna get a lawyer and sue them so hard they won't remember yesterday\" (I think we know where this is going).\n\nSo I do my thing and flag up all her corners, putting wood stakes every 40 feet on her line so there's no mistaking where it is. She comes out when i'm all done, and starts going off on me for not doing things right. So I pull out my plats stating exactly how much land she's supposed to have, how long the sides of her lot are, and I measure from corner to corner right in front of her. \n\nTurns out, she thought her yard went right up to the neighbor's fence while really it's about 10 feet closer on 2 sides. Also it turns out that her old fence was removed because her neighborhood has an easement clause that says no permanent structure can be put in your 5 foot back line easement. So before she called me, she could have gotten away with claiming about 10 more feet of land on each side of her yard, but now her yard's about 3/4 the size. I've driven past her house since then and she's put up an 8 foot chain link fence with barbed wire on because apparently her neighbors were also trying to sneak in and steal stuff (I heard this from the neighbors themselves). Her house looks like a tiny little prison yard now, which is probably for the best because I don't think that she's all too safe for society.",

            "Fascinating how often this happens. This is in fact almost word for word identical to a MC that was posted about six weeks ago, except in that one if I recall the neighbor's kitchen addition was encroaching as well.",
            "I am a Zoning Board Official. This happens more than you'd think...\n\nNormally the neighbors aren't total assholes and everyone can come to an agreement. Good for your parents!",
            "lmao what a piece of shit. He would\u2019ve kept most of his \u201cproperty\u201d and a lot of money if he didn\u2019t have to get shitty over a couple plants",
            "The r/legaladvice arbor-boner can currently be heard from outer space",
            "My father had a new neighbour move in like that. They\u2019ve put up higher fences, raised there garden height and even moved their property line into council land extending their garden further out. Horrid people. Weirdly the council wasn\u2019t interested in losing a bunch of land, well, they claimed it\u2019s the local transport authorities land. Still annoying to see them steal chunks of land they didn\u2019t buy.",
            "> Later that day my father called the company that put in the plants, and with the warranty we could have them replanted next week for no charge.\n\ndoesn't seem very fair to the company. make your neighbor pay for that shit",
            "My parents neighbours wanted to put up new fences between our properties. They agreed, so long as we got the \u2018ugly\u2019 side of the fence, so that we could put up climbing vines. Now their property is beautifully enclosed in jasmine on both sides.",
            "11 fucking feet! That's like 3 metres. How does that even happen?",
            "Had similar case. Less space gain but bigger cost. We had asshole neighbors like that.\n\nOut of the blue they come to us. They were mad because road to our property was \"catching\" their property. Basically they said we need to move our entry gate. How they figured this out I don't know.\n\nAnyway - my dad told them it's true judging by the plans but also their farm building is standing on ours. One wall go be precise. Can't they just forget about it?\n\nThey went to court. Court decided that they are right and gate must be moved. Ended up costing us like 1000$ to move it since it was dirt road used by tractors.\n\nBut at the same time court noticed their farm building and decided it must be moved too. In same sentence they realized they need to spend A LOT because it was old style building that must be teared down completely.\n\nAnd they asked for it :-) Fun fact, they wanted to back down, talk to my father. Bud judge said it must be done to stop future claims.",
            "Our fence was very old and falling down. We went to replace it and the neighbor told us she was too busy to help pay and it was on our side so we can build it with the nice side on our side. The fence had a 12\" retaining board at the bottom as the land on our side was higher than hers. \n\nWe took down the old fence and install the new one using metal posts that slide into the concrete footings from the old wood posts, so the fence was in the exact same location. the retaining board bulged out a bit onto her side to navigate a root. She complained and put up a string where she claimed the property line is supposed to be. I reinstalled the retaining board on our side of her self-proclaimed property line, and proceeded to complete the rest of the fence. The nice side had to be on our side as she would not let us set foot on her property and as she is retired she was there to monitor all activity.\n\nShe complained to the city and the inspectors came out to look. It turns out that she wanted the fence to be 6' tall on her side so she claimed that we added dirt illegally to our side and build the fence to that level. Of course, we had done no such thing and had built the fence to be 6' on our side, as the law allows. However, as the structure was now over 6' tall, we should have pulled a building permit. So the fence was referred to the building department.\n\nSeveral weeks later we get a call from the inspector to let us know that we may be getting a call from her attorney. She has been calling the city daily to complain about the fence and press for answers, eventually threatening to get an attorney to call them. She also complained about people living in our garage (they weren't, it was used as a study space by our college-age child) and that we had installed an air-handler unit on the back of same which \"blows the leaves on her trees which bothers her when she is at the table eating a meal\". \n\nSoon thereafter, we reviewed our file online and noticed that our city's records for our fence had been closed and the building dept was not going to pursue getting the work permitted. Of course, the inspector found nothing wrong with either the garage use or the air handler and promptly closed both those files.\n\nA few months later, we received a letter from her alleging that, based upon the evaluation of two (unnamed) fencing contractors, the fence was improperly constructed and encroached on her property so she was going to make us take down our fence and pay for half of a new fence built on her side and to her specifications and included language provided by her attorney to try to make it sound legal. Well, I work for an attorney so I showed it to him. He wrote a letter back which got her attorney to respond. Both attorney know each other and were currently representing parties in a different dispute. At some point, my attorney let him know that due to my lengthy employment with his firm and longer-term personal friendship, I would be getting free representation up to and including a trial should the neighbor want to take it that far. Soon thereafter, we received notice that he was no longer her counsel. About a month later, he was back asking for us to go look at the situation. My boss asked if we should go and I said, no, there is nothing to see. So we wrote back the entire story including the fact that she had set the line and watched us construct it on our side according to her calculations and that now she has decided that the 14 year old survey actually showed the property line to be somewhere slightly different.\n\nThat was over a year ago and we haven't heard anything since.",
            "This sounds like the beginning of every story on that\u201cFear thy neighbor\u201d show. Glad your parents came out on top!",
            "I read that story then sat back and smoked a cigarette, completely and utterly satisfied.",
            "Even if you were over the property line, what kind of POS just goes over at 2am and chops down someone else's plants without warning? What a jackwad.",
            "Doing it at 2 am the second time, it's clear to me the d-bag just thought the plants were ugly or something and didn't want them beside his home. He prbly hoped your family would just roll over. Called out by your pops and the police for his BS in the middle of the night, he could only keep up the property line pretense by suggesting a professional survey, and thus played himself."
