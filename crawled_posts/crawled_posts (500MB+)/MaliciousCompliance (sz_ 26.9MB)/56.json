        "selftext": "Shortly before COVID brought all manner of traveling work to a screeching halt, I was finishing up a job and getting ready to book my travel home.  Normally everyone would just fly, and in my case that meant a nice short trip of about two hours in the air.  However, this particular location and the route back home for me had an extremely scenic train route that took about 12 hours.  And as a bonus, I could get a sleeper car for a pretty cheap price.  Less, even, than the flight.\n\nI asked my boss if I there was any reason I had to fly instead of taking the train, as the latter would save them money, and he said it would be fine.  I didn't waste his time or mine by mentioning any of the above details.  I simply booked my ticket and immediately sent in the receipt for reimbursement.\n\nNot 20 minutes later, I get an email.  Paraphrasing:\n\n\"WTF is this?  I thought you said you were going to book travel that would save us money.  What do you think you're doing booking a sleeper car???  You're not one of the big shots out here.  Send me a new receipt for your coach class accommodations.\"\n\nOkay, as you wish: cue MC.\n\nSince this happened so quickly, I was able to cancel my $150 train ticket without issue.  And since there was no way I was taking a 12 hour train ride in coach instead of a two hour flight, I booked my air travel like I normally would and immediately sent in the $450 receipt for my *coach class* flight.\n\nI got yet another email asking me what the hell I was doing.  Now, I'm good at booking travel and I know how to find good prices.  I knew that there wasn't a cheaper flight to be had.  So I wrote back \"sorry, this is the cheapest coach class flight I could find.  If you can find a better one, please let me know before the 24 hour cancellation window closes and I'll be happy to book that instead.\"  Clearly frustrated, they told me to stop playing games, cancel the flight, and just buy the damn train ticket.\n\nI didn't.  I took the flight home and got reimbursed per company policy for my coach class flight.",

            "Yeah, I feel you. My company once decided to get picky about me driving to the airport and parking my car on the valet service area. \nIn this area, I leave the car right at the terminal and someone will drive it away to an off-site parking lot, where it will stay during the course of my trip and be driven back to the terminal upon my arrival. It\u2019s a neat service and never failed. You just walk out of the terminal and your car is there waiting for you. During winter, the car is clean of snow and ready to go, great service. \nSo, let\u2019s say that, for a week of parking, the service will cost $120. On top of that, the company reimburses mileage in my car for work purposes, amounting to about $15. Total of $135. \nBy the second or third time I presented this kind of expense, my boss calls me and says I should park my car on the long term parking lot. On that lot, a week would cost about $80. \nFair enough, cheaper than the valet service but way less convenient. For starters, the bus to the long term parking lot often would take half an hour each way. When added to a 12 hour flight to/ from Asia, for example, that half an hour more makes a big difference, specially when you get back and just want to get home asap. In addition to that, the car remains in an uncovered area and, during winter, I\u2019d have to spend additional time scraping the snow and ice from the car. So I\u2019m definitely not up for that and, next time, instead of taking the car, I call for a taxi to drive me from home to the airport and then catch a taxi at the terminal to home at arrival. That was $150 each way, total of $300. It worked well. I\u2019d fall asleep on both rides. \nI did this two or three times and my boss called me again and asked me to drive my car to the airport and park at the valet. \nNot only that, she encouraged all my coworkers to do the same. And they were parking on the long term parking lot and taking the bus. So, over a period of time, I was considered their savior and, every time one of them had to travel, they would mention about how cool it was to convince the boss that the valet was the best solution. \nA win is a win.",

            "This reminds me of when I was living and working for a financial company in NH but was lent out to a team in NJ who wanted me to come down frequently to work with them in person. Our company had a policy of any air travel booked less than 14 days in advance requiring VP approval, and of course the NJ team didn't plan that far ahead.\n\nTrain travel did not have this rule, however. So my manager didn't want to deal with the bureaucracy of VP approvals, so he strongly encouraged taking the train. Which meant taking a bus to Boston to take Amtrak to NYC before taking the subway to NJ. I would have to leave my house at around 4am to get to NJ at around 11am, and this was happening every 1-2 weeks. Conveniently, I was a very junior employee at the time so I was still hourly instead of salary, which meant lots of overtime ensued from these travels. Add the notoriously poor wifi quality on Amtrak, and it meant I was getting paid several hours of overtime most weeks to sleep on the train while travelling, all to avoid having a VP sign off on the expense report that would cost about the same amount of money but take hours less (paid) time each way of travel.",
            "ProTip for company accountants and managers: do not nickel and dime your traveling employees like this. That they have to travel is already a huge imposition on their time and sanity, and they have worked out the processes that work best for them in order to be productive on the road. Don\u2019t throw in arbitrary rules concocted by non-traveling people that make the process suck any worse for them or they\u2019ll simply quit and go work for your competition instead. \n\nShaving 10% off the travel expense budget may look good for the bean counters, but it\u2019s coming at a wildly greater cost elsewhere in the budget, sometimes on the revenue side.",
            "I used to travel a lot for business.   Primarily for Trade Shows.   I got really good at finding deals.   One trip, the approving manager was dragging his heals approving the trip.

The Exec just so happened to be the CFO.     As we ate, he spoke about the reason for the lunches, direct input from front line workers, direct communication of the Execs to front line workers, yada, yada, yada.  \n\n\nHe wrapped up and went around the table asking each person for a question or comment. I asked about what we could do about managers who delay approvals for planned expenses, till any advance purchase discounts no longer apply.   \"How much of a discount did we lose?\"    $120 vs $1200  \n\n\nThat got his attention.   2 weeks later there was memo sent out encouraging managers approve expenses quickly when discounts would save more than 25% of the non-discounted price and that employees could jump a level if they knew a discount deadline was approaching.",
            "One issue is your time... are you reimbursed for travel? You *should be*. Required travel for work should be paid time. The extra 10 hours at your pay X cost multiplier is surely worth more than $300.\n\nBut assuming you don't charge for that time, personally I have no problem submitting an expense report for travel that meets their written requirements, then using the money to book travel my own way. Especially after I've *tried* to save them money but got rejected. \n\nSo submit the airline ticket, but enjoy your train ride.\n\nI used to volunteer for an organization and we would meet 2x a year. My time was volunteered, but they reimbursed expenses. The options were to either book all travel through their preferred travel agency, or they would pay $0.50/ mile for a personal vehicle. No exceptions (I tried). Min. cost through the TA was typically ~$300, or travel by the quickest interstate route was ~$200. So I would submit an expense report for the $200. Then I would rent a little sports car and take a fun route through the mountains that was slightly shorter but took longer. I usually pocketed about $50 after rental fees and gas.",

        "selftext": "This takes place in the \u201cbefore times\u201d when people could eat out and gather in large numbers. \n\nI used to work as a chef, for an owner who liked to micromanage things and was a bit narcissistic. I\u2019d been working there about 3 years, getting good reviews, customers loved me, updated the menu.  Made everything from scratch, people used to think the place was open box/heat, serve food. Quality had gone up morale was great in my kitchen. Annual sales went from $850k, to $1.4 million, about maximum capacity for the space. \n\nThe increase in sales and income went to the owners head. He was always spending money on frivolous things and squandering cash. Sound system, stage for the event space, ect. One example, I needed a new Alto-Sham, a used one would have sufficed, nope he bought the top of the line one that could be used as a smoker too $12k vs what I wanted could be gotten used for $1,500. Granted I enjoyed that piece of equipment, which after I left they no longer use the smoker function. Years later I still occasionally get emails invoices from a vendor and see they bring in precooked smoked meats now.\n\nI was hourly, but then the owner realized during the busy season I and my Sous Chef put in 70-80hr weeks.  Doing this he realized I made more take home pay from his business than he did. At peak times he\u2019d maybe work 40-50 hours a week.\n\nSo to save money he puts me and my Sous on salary effectively cutting my pay by about $10k a year. My Sous netted a loss of $2k/yr, if we were to work at our current level of effort. \n\nDuring all of this the owner is saying he is not expecting us to work over 40 hours a week, EVER.  He even has this written into our contracts. So with the extra time off at home with family it is ok, I still like the job and my staff. During the slower time this was great. Also during this time I had won a local award for my cooking, and the narcissistic owner was not too pleased.  He was no longer recognized as the creative force in the kitchen that bears his name, so his meddling and micromanaging increased. It had gone from \u201cIts your kitchen CopChef do what you want\u201d to \u201cIt\u2019s my name and my kitchen do it this way\u201d. Morale and quality began to suffer. \n\nJust prior to the holiday season my Sous wants to go back to his home country for 2.5 months, November, December & January peak crazy time for us. I have good help and am good with it, owner approved the time off.  \n\nOwner thinking I am gonna save him some $$ that holiday season by working my usual 70-80 hours a week. Nope, cue the malicious compliance. \n\nI start writing the holiday schedule, Sous is on vacation, I have my 40 during key prep times and peak business times.  The rest if my staff gets serious overtime.  Basically the Sous and I carried a lot of the weight in the kitchen and could out preform most of our small staff. So with Sous on vacay and I only pulling 40 full time staff is now working 60ish hours a week, and part timers are getting 40.  Things are running pretty smoothly until the owner realizes I\u2019m not there like I always am during the holiday rush. He\u2019s in the kitchen more trying to micromanage my staff, giving them poor advice contradicting my directions and timing for events, screwing up the small parties my staff could handle while I am off. \n\nAfter a few weeks of this he realizes he\u2019s going to be paying the staff out more in overtime than he saved on moving me and my Sous to salary. He starts demanding I work more hours to stop hemorrhaging OT to the kitchen staff. I show him my contract where I am not expected to work over 40 hours a week.  Now he says it\u2019s just a guideline. I hold him to the 40 a week, it\u2019s Christmas and now I can for once spend time with my family. \n\nNow with my Sous returning, I\u2019m burned out from the constant micromanaging & gaslighting by the owner I hand the reigns to my Sous and change careers after 25 years in the industry and never look back. \n\nTLDR, micromanaging owner cuts my pay by $10k a year to save money, due to owners stupid spending habits. Says in contract not required to work over 40hours a week.  Busy holiday season only work 40, rest of kitchen staff gets overtime, and no money is saved.",

            "You go you. It\u2019s always nice to see the douche canoes getting what they deserve for their selfishness.\n\nMy brother-in-law did something similar to my husband (and myself). Salary to hourly to force him to work longer hours.  Then he was surprised when he got notice that hubby was leaving for a new job. Plus we were selling our place to move out of state to take it.  He was scrambling to find someone to manage his businesses and someone to take over doing the maintenance also.\n\nHe was p*ssed because he ended up having to hire five people for quite a bit more money than he had been paying before.  I had already quit a few months before due to the *sshattery.  So my management duties (Paperwork, inventory, court, 24hr telephone x2, my maintenance duties, and a whole lot more) were put on my husband\u2019s shoulders.  Yeah, he totally didn\u2019t think that one through.  He was trying to require him to work a minimum of 65 hours a week, ideally 80+. So he took him off salary and dropped his pay to $9 an hour. His thinking was that it would force my husband to go back to putting in the 80 plus hour weeks that he was wanting out of him again.\n\nIt always surprises me that people don\u2019t/will not sit down and reason out the possible consequences and all likely outcomes of a decision.

            "I used to be head chef of a large sports bar that could seat 200 at a time and did about $2m in sales per year.  This is back about 15-20 years ago, and I was only getting paid $36k salary.\n\nI enjoyed it for the most part, there was always plenty of sporting events on, and touring teams would come to us regularly.  It was always very busy though and I was averaging about 60 hours a week.\n\nBusiness picked up to a point where the general manager decided to get me some help in the way of a \"co-head chef\".  We were supposed to be equal, however they paid him $40k per year and he barely did more than 40 hours a week while I still kept up my normal workload.  (I don't blame him for only doing the minimum required, kitchens can be brutal places.)\n\nAnyway, I started getting very annoyed that I was getting paid ridiculously low for someone in charge of so much sales, and starting asking questions about pay rises.  They very reluctantly finally put me on $40k, but by then it wasn't enough with inflation etc.\n\nI was there for about 5 years before I eventually pulled the pin, one thing I had done the whole time was keep records of all my timesheets filling out the hours of work I'd done.  In my original contract I had a clause to compare what I'd actually earnt against what I would've earnt if I was on basic minimum wage - there was a $19k shortfall!\n\nI got this paid out when I left.  I'm no longer in hospitality, but the morale of the story is to check your employee contract thoroughly and keep records of time worked.\n\nSorry for the long story, it turned out a bit longer than I expected lol.",
            "Agreed. I have been on hourly pay at my job for the past 15 years. Putting in 20-30 hours OT during crazy times.

I came to that figure with my current hourly pay at 40hrs a week plus the 10 in ot.\nHis offer was 52k, I did the math and that would be 2-3$ an hour less. He said my math was wrong. So I said it was 60k and that\u2019s my lowest. The surprise on his face when I told him no thanks. \n\nI stayed at 40hrs , he hired someone else the don\u2019t like for 53k a year. Haven\u2019t regretted it since.\n\nDo your math before accepting anything. \nAlso 50hrs a week is the expectation when you are a manger.

It's that *you* were making more than *him*, and his pride couldn't take it.  After all, even if you were making more than him, he was making much more than before you came along, too.\n\nA rational person would see this as a win-win, but to an egotistical, narcissistic prick, it makes you a target.

The gm always took my inventory numbers and would figure it out from there, turned out they had been figuring gross profit margin instead. The exact opposite of food cost. It literally went from them thinking i was running 65+% to 30 something. For years theyd been figuring it wrong, but no one seemed to give a shit.

He would pull 60 hr weeks all while getting bullied and harassed by the Sous chef.

        "selftext": "I replied to an MC story here and it reminded me of the power of building up a mob of people to get your revenge properly.\n\nBackground.\n\nI worked in a building where I was a fire marshal. No extra money and a small amount of extra work but someone has to do it. I was also first aider and somehow got landed with arranging the christmas night out so maybe the building manager saw me as an easy mark. The only advantage that I had was the during a drill or real event I had absolute power; anyone not following an evacuation order swiftly was called up for disciplinary action. We had random drills about 12 per year, my job was to ensure that the building was clear, basically pop my head in each office space, toilets, kitchens etc and see that nobody was there and then take a register outside. 5 minutes tops. Anyone booked into the building that was not registered by me was in trouble. The drills were sprung on me as well as the building manager had the fire alarm keys and it made it a more realistic test.\n\nThe building manager was a dick. He wielded his small amount of power as much as he could and loved to report people for tiny infractions.\n\nDuring one drill he hid in a cupboard and then called me into his office for failing to ensure that the building was clear. Apparently some people may run and hide from a fire instead of leaving the building. I got a wagging finger and told to do better next time or I would lose the marshal role, my 'job' was pretty safe since nobody actually wanted to take over and after hearing the story of me getting into trouble they absolutely did not want the job. The Building manager changed the fire marshal Process Instruction to include checking hiding places. This is a site instruction, he had no power to do so I later found out.  \n\n\nMC begins. \n\nThe alarm went off, the first after my failure to check cupboards. Every one left, crossed the road and stood in the assembly point in (and this is very important) the rain and wind.\n\nI searched the top floor very carefully, opening up large cupboards, opening up boxes large enough to hide a person, looking under each desk in case someone was hiding. First floor ditto (UK so our first floor is US second and our ground is US first). By now people were cold and wet and unhappy but building manager refused to let them enter. He knew that it was coming he was well prepared for the weather, most people had light clothing on as the car park stood next the the building. They don't bother with coats in the 20 feet trip from car to building. Ground floor checked everywhere and finally the basement where the boiler lives and is a general dumping ground for old files and junk. That took ages but I was thorough. Very thorough. And slow. Thorough slow, not 'taking the piss' slow.  \nI left the building, took the register and a mass of sodden people headed back into the building.   \nI was massively unpopular until I showed them the PI that said I had to check all spaces that someone could hide they knew what happened at the last test and directed all the anger at building manager. It was the equivalent of the angry villagers turning up at Castle Frankenstein with torches and pitchforks. People were furious at him some. One of the office staff was a union rep and reported him to the site safety officer who went ballistic at him telling me to remain in a potentially burning building longer than necessary and a number of people went home to get dry clothes and the company had to give them special leave to do so or else the union would have to get involved.\n\nHe got shit from all sides, workers, union, management and site safety officer.\n\nMost of the time nothing gets done when it is just you complaining but it really gets done when the correct people are inconvenienced.",

He instituted a policy of the changing rooms in the building being cleared of all staff property not in lockers at 17:00 on a Friday. Now, I used to commute by bike, so I would shower when I arrived. My towel would be hanging to dry while I was at work, and I would either store it in my locker when I left, or take it home on a Friday. I also worked in IT, and as my job:\n\n* Relied on other people providing information to be processed into main systems, and\n* Was a key part in ensuring that sites could transfer stock between themselves,\n\nI was not able to work to the clock. One Friday in winter, I wasn't able to get away until 17:20 due to one problem site not sending forms through until 16:59, and then I had to call them for corrections (which is a whole 'nother rant). I got down to get changed to go, and not only was my towel gone, but so were the gloves that I'd left on the radiator to air. I had to run around trying to find him, and then *he lectured me* about the need to leave on time and not leave things lying around. I had to explain that not all of us had the luxury of clock-watching.\n\nGit.",

Our fire drill manager always selected 3-5 people who were given the specific time and instructed to \"hide\" in less frequented rooms, such as storage rooms and workshops.\n\nWe had to assemble outside, group up by departments, check who was missing, check if any extermal guests were present as well. \n\nIt was just a general practice drill, so no positive or negative consequences, but we'd get positive feedback for correctly noting who was missing and \"extra points\" if we found one of the people in hiding on our way out. \n\nIt was quite entertaining.

            "By the way, people hiding from fires is absolutely true. Fire fighters will check every nook and cranny of a place they suspect people to be in (this is why voicing the suspicion that someone still is in the house known as soon as they arrive is important).\n\nIt can be argued that someone that is not in PPE has no business staying in the building and looking everywhere for extended amounts of time, because fire fighters will need to start looking for the person - first assumption is that you got closed in by the smoke and need help yourself. At that point, trying to help would have meant stalling the actual help, even if you're uninjured - nobody in the outside knows your status, after all. \n\nIt's less than useless to try to help people inside a burning building and become a casualty that needs emergency attention in the process. First thing I learned in fire drill: go out of the building as fast as possible and don't go back in. \n\nSo that rule was dangerous and stupid.",
            "This reminds me of a time when I worked at a clinic and we had an actual fire situation. A ballast exploded and filled the multi-level building with thick chemical smoke. It was our jobs to check the restrooms for people. I had previously seen a woman enter one of the toilets and she was still in there when this happened. \n\nHer husband came running to get her and I intercepted him and made him leave (policy) I told him I would get his wife. So, husband is. Bothered that he has to listen but leaves. I go back to the restroom and knock on the door. One would have thought that I was the most rude and disgusting person, based on her response. I am thinking in my head, right mam I want to see you going to the bathroom, despite the building filling with smoke and the fire alarms going off. She took her damn time to open the door. \n\nWe were the last two out of the building.",
            "I live in a small town that has a private college in it.  About thirty years ago the (volunteer) fire department was being called out for fire alarms on campus on an increasingly regular basis.   Always in the wee hours of the morning, and always one specific dormitory.   One cold, rainy winter night the chief had had enough.  When the trucks rolled onto the scene he sends guys in with orders to evacuate the building immediately.   \n\nThey worked floor to floor, door to door, waking sleepy students and ushering them out urgently.  They got them all outside and then told them they had to wait until the building was cleared and the alarms checked.    After a fairly miserable half hour they were allowed back inside, and just like that the false alarms stopped.",

If they've been directed to leave and refuse they can be charged under legislation. I don't know if that ever happens in practice but it's at least a law that's on the books...\n\nOh and I get a $1,000 per year allowance in my pay for being the CFW so that's pretty nice too :)",

            "One of my more memorable on-site audits was at an office building that had a flyover in front and was surrounded by graveyards on the right, left and behind (I'm not kidding. I was offered the use of multiple meeting rooms and all had graveyard views except the one that had a view of the flyover.) I was there on an annual basis for months and there will always be a fire drill when I'm there. Management will let me know in advance so I'll lounge in the cafe at ground floor with my laptop until it's time to leave the building. Turns out the only place for staff to assemble is under the flyover. So there will be hundreds of people clustered under the flyover, standing and waiting impatiently for the fire drill to end. The company has to get the police involved to stop traffic during the evacuation process and when the fire drill is over so staff can safely cross the road to and from the flyover (I cannot imagine how this will happen in real life).\n\nIf anyone was on a power trip like building manager, he'd probably be made to dig his own grave in one of graveyards surrounding the company.",

If it was his own responsibility to take role for his own department, even worse as it would cause confusion during the drill, and the next.  If he himself was trapped during an actual fire, Noone would know if he was in trouble or if he was playing stupid games.\n\nAs the EHS manager at my last job, I absolutely would have written him up for doing this, even if it was my own boss.

At any given time, we will have around 200 actors/staff/management in the show, and hundreds more customers in the building. We practice fire drills extensively. If the alarm goes off, each room has a leader that is responsible for getting guests out first. Every room had at least one exit. All the exits funnel into one ten foot wide hall that runs through the center of the house. At the same time regular actors leave to the meeting spot, followed be those room leaders once they ensure the space is clear. At the same time, we have two assigned managers that start doing the deep search through the house. One at the beginning, and one at the end clearing and checking each room till they meet at the middle. The two managers generally meet in 90 seconds. We are doing roll call to see if anyone is missing, and if anyone is, manager goes back in, starting at their assigned location and spreading the search out from there. Regularly, the fire marshal will be there and hide in a random place to see just how thorough our clear is.",

She was to go out of town for the weekend to see her mother, I generally do larger/messier projects around the house when this happens.  I was tired of these rooms and prodded her again for a color, I wanted her to pick from the dozens of samples collected over the last year or so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe told me to go ahead and pick whatever color I wanted, she did not care. Now I have been with her long enough to know this is not true. I will end up repainting again and I hate to paint, so I devised a plan to make this work to my advantage. If I have to paint again I may as well prepare for it, so I did. I went to the local big box home improvement store and bought 15 gallons of white paint. I then proceeded to paint every room in my 1000 sq. ft. house, white. Ceilings, walls, and trim included. I thought it was beautiful, she on the other hand did not. She walked in and was not pleased in the least. It just went on and on and on, stark whiteness throughout the whole house.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNew colors picked and applied within weeks.

Yay! All them pizza! Her favourite frozen types! All of them!\n\nMonday morning rolls around. She gets salami pizza for breakfast. Fantastic! Best parent!\n\nMonday noon.

I was a kid in the 80\u2019s and wanted nothing more than to eat Twinkie\u2019s, bologna sandwiches on wonder bread, koolaid, Doritos, all that good stuff. My mother was a vegetarian hippie so that stuff was out of the question. \n\nAs a matter of fact I even got made fun of because the lunches I brought to school were things like a thermos of water, natural peanut butter on hardcore wheat bread with usually a jelly or jam that didn\u2019t go, like apricot preserves or goddamn orange marmalade, cookies were homemade oatmeal, (the woman never even made chocolate chip cookies) bags if trail mix with absolutely no chocolate of any kind in it\u2026that sort of thing.

That\u2019s right, they let 5 kids ranging in age from 6-12 pick out whatever they would like for dinner but it has to be all junk food. \n\nIt was glorious picking out the goods and we all were in absolute disbelief that this was happening, since these women were so strict about that stuff. They knew what they were doing. Good lord we were all soooo sick after this. Such a good lesson.",

So when she was on the phone with her friend I chose a big fat purple onion, looked her dead in the eye, and took a giant bite. I instantly knew I fucked up as my mouth flooded with raw onion juice and even though the intense, pungent odor was making my eyes tear up, I could see the look of surprise and horror on my mom's face. I wanted nothing more than to spit it out and apologize, but I was stubborn and proud and my mom and I had a very adversarial relationship. So I kept staring at my mom as tears poured down my cheeks, gagging as I choked down that entire massive raw onion. I smiled and tried to look cool and unconcerned as snot and tears smeared my face and my stomach churned and was like, \"That was really good, I should have another one tomorrow.\"\n\nYou guys, my mom brought me home a new onion and left it on the counter for me. But I had spent the night trapped on the toilet, gripping the side of the sink for dear life as that onion exited my bowels at warp speed, so I finally admitted defeat. By that I ignored the onion and pretended it didn't exist, and my mom was gracious enough to let it go-- after she made sure my portion of dinner had extra onion, because I loved it so much.",

            "Depends on the kid, the parent and the food.  I don't like hot food, whether your talking about piping, burn the roof of your mouth, singe your lips hot, or so spicy the first bite makes you sweat hot, I'll pass.  I also don't tend to like food that has too many different things in it.  You can keep your chili five ways, and give me some chili mac, thank you.\n\nOne of my mother's signature foods was homemade beef vegetable soup.  Everybody raved about it, except me.  That soup had everything in it.  Some of everything in dad's vegetable garden and a few veggies from the grocery store because they didn't grow in our climate zone.  My preference ran toward chicken noodle soup from a package, just broth and noodles.  Canned was OK, but I preferred the package because canned had those annoying little bit of chicken meat.\n\nBack to my mother's everything soup served piping hot.  I was about eight years old when soup day had rolled around once again.  Mom ladled up each bowl directly from the pot and the stove and set it in front of each chair at the table.  While I was waiting for it too cool off, everyone else started eating.  After a while my mother noticed I hadn't touched my soup and needed a fresh bowl because mine must be cold.  She took my bowl from the table, dumped it back into the pot and ladled up a fresh bowl.  I was too timid to tell her I wanted it to cool off.  I had tried to explain my preference for luke-warm over piping hot too many times, only to be told, \"That's nonsense, hot food should be eaten hot\".  With my mother, like the Borg, resistance was futile.\n\nI continued to not eat the hot soup while mom continued to replace the soup in my bowl with hot soup until I was the only member of the family still seated at the table.\n\nFed up with me my mother refilled my bowl one last time and said, \"You either eat that soup RIGHT NOW, or you will get it cold for breakfast tomorrow.\"  I said that was fine and asked to be excused.  Mom was dumbfounded, it was one of the few times I had witnessed her at a loss for words.\n\nThe following morning mom woke me up to get ready for school.  This NEVER happened before.  Mom was not a morning person and dad was the one who woke us up on weekdays to give us breakfast and send us off to school.  On this day, however, mom was up and at me.\n\nWhen I walked into the kitchen, she told me to sit at the table.  She proceeded to take my bowl of soup from the night before and place it in front of me.  She said, \"Eat\", then leaned back on the kitchen counter, arms folded across her chest and glared at me.  I ate the soup.\n\nShe watched me eat it, every drop.  I think she was sure I was going to admit I didn't like it cold.  It was better cold, though so I ate it.  She was crest fallen.  I wish I could say my mother learned something from this experience but, she did not.  We would have many showdowns over all sorts of things through her life.  Mom could never wrap her head around the idea that I didn't like things she liked and vice versa.",

So much so that they forbade me from using my chosen name at school or even with my friends. \n\nWell I thought that was a load of crap and changed my name in the school\u2019s system on the first day. (It had my legal name listed but for most purposes my preferred name was used.) \n\nAfter about 3 months they found out about it and were Pissed. So they said to me \n\n\u201cOP, YOU HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR NAME IN THE SCHOOL RIGHT NOW\u201d \n\nSo I was like \u201cokay, I will\u201d \n\nAnd so I changed it from Bob (not my actual name) to Bobb. \n\nThe next day they checked the homework portal again and discovered I had indeed changed it, but not to my legal name. \n\n\u201cOP WE TOLD YOU TO CHANGE IT BACK TO (legal name)\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you told me to change it. And I did\u201d \n\nMy God were they pissed. I was grounded for a month and my phone was taken but it was totally worth it. \n\nSo after that, every time they told me to change it I would tack on another letter. By the end of the school year my name was \u201cBobbbbbbb\u201d \n\nEventually they stopped grounding me and just. Gave up. I was allowed to use my preferred name the rest of high school, provided it wasn\u2019t around them.\n\nEdit: Gosh This really blew up!! Thanks for all the supportive comments, I really appreciate them. Having to live at home again with an unsupportive family has been really hard on me. All this has really made me feel like the world isn\u2019t so bad. Thank you for the Gold and Silver too!!!\n\nNote: my mom has started coming around and I\u2019m planning on cutting of my dad once she divorces him for being a piece of garbage (including what he did to me).",

        "selftext": "I don't know if this is the most appropriate sub for this story, so let me know if it belongs elsewhere?\n\nI work security for a private business campus that has venues that are often rented by outside groups. One particularly large hall was rented by a local church group and we sold their tickets at the box office immediately in front of the venue. Without going into boring detail, there was only one way into the hall for the general public but numerous exits with cameras everywhere. Parking is free in all three of our parking decks, except in clearly marked reserved spaces, which will be important soon.\n\nWhile visitors were still arriving for the event, our dispatch center received a call from our largest campus tenant complaining that a car was parked in one of their 24/7 reserved spaces and they need it moved asap. This company pays for these spaces and is constantly using them at all hours of the day and on weekends, which is why we have numerous highly visible signage for this row of spaces warning people of this fact and that towing is enforced.\n\nWe reviewed camera footage and saw that the owner was a woman dressed in fine Sunday clothes that were an almost painful shade of lime green with a matching hat. This would have been enough to identify her even in our large hall, but we then noticed that she bypassed the ticket line and made her way to one of the venue exit doors. She stayed there several minutes and, when one of the cleaning staff exited, she slipped in behind them. (We're still not sure how she knew she could do this, btw.)\n\nAs the supervisor on duty, I entered the hall and found her in one of the front rows sitting in a group of people. She saw me coming in my security uniform and immediately scrunched up her face.\n\nMe: \"Ma'am, can I-\"\n\nHer, interrupting me: \"Now I juss sat down. What is it you want?\"\nShe was already on the defensive and loud.. Not a sign of innocence in my experience.\n\nMe: \"I'm with campus security and I need to ask-\"\n\nHer, cutting me off again: \"What you need to do is leave me alone. I'm sitting with my family and we're here to enjoy my nephew's concert. Ain't nothing so important you rent-a-cops need to be botherin' me like this.\"\n\nMe: \"Actually it is important. If you wouldn't mind coming with me, we can talk in the aisle and-\"\n\n(Note: she thinks I'm here because she didn't buy a ticket but I don't care about that. I'm trying to tell her about her car before we have to tow it. This is her only chance to move it herself.)\n\nHer: \"No, you ain't kicking me out of here at my own nephew's church concert.\"\nNow she starts avoiding eye contact with me.\n\nMe: \"Ma'am, I'm not here about how you got inside this hall, I'm-\"\n\nHer, raising her voice even more: \"I don't know what you're talking about but you NEED. TO LEAVE ME. THE HELL. ALONE.\"\n\nAt this point it was so comical that I remember getting the biggest smile on my face and telling her \"That's all I needed to hear. Enjoy your show.\"\n\nI left and had her car towed immediately. Two hours later she reported her car stolen to our security desk. The desk officer informed her that she parked in a reserved spot and that security had tried to make contact with her before the show began, according to our log. She loudly demanded to speak to whoever was in charge and that's when I came around the corner and introduced myself. The look on her face was priceless and she didn't say another word as I gave her the information for the tow company's lot, which was closed by that time.\n\nEdit 1: I omitted her physical appearance, other than her outfit, as it was wholly irrelevant to the story as it unfolded. Those of you making this a race or political issue are disappointing. This is purely a wholesome story about a garbage human doing garbage deeds and getting garbage results back in her garbage life.",

As I see it, it was my butt sitting on each flight. I earned those points.",

That's even if you use your personal bonus card. Authorities did a raid on all major airlines and went through thousands of trips paid for by miles to see if the miles were earned in a company and the trip was private.\n\nAnd the value of the trip is not the discounted price. It's the highest fare for that route. The state is practically stealing your miles straight off and you gave to pay full price, just not to the airline.",

        "selftext": "My family runs a small trucking company. Depending on where you are in the world, you might call us a P&D company, a Final Mile company, a White Glove company... basically we handle the kind of stuff that you might buy to have delivered to your home or business, that's too big for someone like UPS to deliver, but not big enough for a tractor trailer to haul, and/or stuff that actually needs to be brought into the home and set up, like furniture, appliances, etc. \n\nA lot of what we\u2019ve hauled over the years is stuff going to small stores that can\u2019t take delivery by large truck, construction sites where large trucks can\u2019t get in and out, neighborhoods and apartment complexes\u2026 we don't work for the people buying the stuff, we work for the people selling or shipping it, but as we tend to see the same business owners a lot, we've developed great relationships with them over the years. \n\nWe don't get rich, but we've been pretty comfortable over the years. Our one major stressor has been a long-time shipper who has - or rather, had - become increasingly demanding as time went on. \n\nNow when I say 'long-time' I mean it. We made our first delivery for them over fifty years ago. Our company has been doing business with them longer than any of their current employees or management staff have been there. There was one point, not too long ago, where the retired guy who came in a few hours a day to sweep our warehouse because he was bored sitting home, literally knew more about this shipper\u2019s systems than their senior field rep who was supposed to be \u2018supervising\u2019 our operations. \n\nWe have been a small, but vital part of their network, for so long that almost no one there really realized how much we did for them. \n\nWe\u2019ve seen field reps come and go. Some have been great, some have been a little challenging, but most have \u2013 once they realized what was going on \u2013 largely left us alone to do our jobs. One even called when he took over our area to ask who we were, because his predecessor had no notes on us at all, because they\u2019d never had to visit. We\u2019ve just been (mostly) quietly plugging along, taking care of their customers, in some cases for generations.\n\nWell\u2026 the latest rep\u2026 was a genuinely unpleasant person. He was arrogant, abrasive, casually insulted our employees\u2026 honestly it\u2019s not worth getting into the minutiae here. He wasn\u2019t someone we wanted to work with. But I\u2019m able to put on a happy face and get along with about anyone, when needs must, so onward we strode. \n\nAs I said earlier, the shipper had been getting more and more demanding as time went on. Systems had been getting harder to navigate, inventory had been getting harder to track, phone trees had grown into Banyan nightmares, more and more layers of bureaucracy had been added, and with every change they\u2019d grown less agile, slower, more difficult to deal with. \n\nOne day the field rep called because he didn\u2019t like how we\u2019d answered an email. Not that we hadn\u2019t answered it, just that he didn\u2019t like the manner in which it had been answered. After decades of dealing with this shipper, being micromanaged to that level was not something that we were interested in. The manager here who was dealing directly with him tried to defuse the situation, but it kept getting worse until the field rep said, \u201cIf you aren\u2019t happy with the way things are going, maybe you should just quit.\u201d\n\nOh. \n\nOk then. \n\nWe started running the numbers, looked at all our other business, decided that we could, indeed, go on without them, and then I called the field rep to have a frank conversation with him. \n\nAnd then I wrote a short, polite, direct letter to our customer of over fifty years telling them that we were firing them. \n\nWe didn\u2019t just pull the plug. We gave them a full 60 days\u2019 notice, so they\u2019d have time to get something worked out. \n\nAnd\u2026 they didn\u2019t. \n\nWe\u2019ve always been here for them. They\u2019ve never had to worry about it. They had someone they thought was going to be a replacement, but\u2026 well\u2026 as of today most of their customers in this area haven\u2019t had deliveries in a week. Some, longer than that. Many don\u2019t know when they\u2019ll get their next shipment. That field rep might still have a job when all is said and done\u2026 but it\u2019s not our problem anymore. \n \n\nOur phone keeps ringing, people looking for their freight from that shipper. \u201cSorry, you\u2019ll have to call them\u2026\u201d\n\n**UPDATE 11-28-22**\n\nSorry it's been so long, but I kind of wanted to let things settle down before I wrote anything else. \n\nFor almost a month our office got daily calls from people looking for their orders. A lot of the regular customers had my and my partner's cell numbers, and we got more than a few calls directly. My most recent call was a guy I've known since the early 90s desperately trying to track down a replacement order that just seems to  have evaporated. Sorry... can't help...\n\nWe have picked up enough new business that we're not worried about the future. We did have to let a coupe of people go, but our remaining employees are happier dealing with the new customers, our working hours have settled down, and we just took our first four day Thanksgiving weekend in probably fifteen years. My wife kept saying how weird and wonderful it was to have me home for the entire holiday, and for my part it was the best Thanksgiving I've had in a long, long time. \n\nThe new company is still struggling to keep up, let alone catch up. We've been told that the old field rep is 'not in a position to be able to treat people like that anymore,' but haven't been told exactly what has happened to them. Their replacement in our region is burning the candle at both ends trying to keep up with his regular work, and get the new company straightened out. \n\nOne of Old Customer's biggest customers in this area told them that if they wouldn't commit to sitting down at the table with us to try to get us back, they were going to look at taking their business elsewhere. We didn't ask for that, but we said we'd be willing to talk if they came to us. They haven't. The new field rep said he passed on our willingness to talk, but that Higher wanted to stay the new course for now. Their call, and I'm honestly not upset about it. \n\nThe new field rep sees the problems we've seen, and it seems like Higher does as well. We handled that business here for a long time, and were pretty emotionally wrapped up in it, and we told New Rep that we were sorry to have put him in this position; he said - paraphrasing - 'no, no this is our fault; we put ourselves in this position.'\n\nI heard through the grapevine that we were one of over a dozen service providers to quit their network around the same time (in the space of a couple months) and asked New Rep about that. He clarified that it was over a dozen *East of the Mississippi* and that there were \"a bunch\" more in the Western region. Putting two and two together, we estimate something close to 15% of their providers. That's been a wake-up call to them; hopefully they'll work toward fixing some of the longstanding problems. \n\nLike so many things in life, it seems like this was something we should have done a long time ago. I still see a lot of our old contacts, and it's nice to have the time to actually stop and chat with them, instead of being on the run all the time. One of them invited my family to his place in the country next spring, and another wants to get together for lunch next week. \n\nThis is good.",

            "Was it Dome Hepot? I know I have had terrible service with their delivery companies, to the point I looked up our local companies llc, and called the CEO directly because he listed his cell number on the application it was on the Dept, of Transportation website, he wasn't happy to hear from me, and we received our appliances in about 48 hours after that conversation.  \nLife Hack: Turns out a lot of company owners use their cell numbers on the DOT registration, something that is public record, if you know where to look. And the DOT license number is always listed on the side of trucks. We got ours from our neighbors ring camera as the truck pulled up then left after saying we weren't home 3 times. Over 4 weeks.\nI haven't bought anything from the Dome store again and made sure that none of the other companies I purchased from use that delivery service.",

There's NOTHING wrong with that and it's commendable, but the heightened abusive tactics and arrogance became just too much and, ultimately, wasn't worth the extra funds you were bringing in from this client. \n\nI'm sorry that you had to lose some of your employees, hopefully it's a temporary setback and you can find other shippers to replace the bad one.  I would be EXTREMELY careful and renegotiate to YOUR company's benefit if you DO meet to \"work things out!\"  But you NOW are aware of the differences in work/life balances so try to keep that in the forefront of your new business model!  You and your families will appreciate the outcome much more if your \"overtime\" and overwork is the exception and not the norm that it was!  \n\nThanks for the update, best wishes and Wishing you, your employees and your families an awesome, Blessing-filled New Year!

You're telling a tale of brutal business-world MC, but you come across like a wise guru smoking a phat spliff while explaining the concepts of karma and the Ying and Yang to your Reddit students.\n\nSo, I might be stating the obvious, but I'm betting that you were not dealing with an unreasonable rep, you were dealing with an unreasonable member or with unreasonable members of The Board (maybe even the CEO or owner). And more specifically, somebody that's entrenched in that company like an inoperable cancer, given how long the difficulties have been building up and how many contractors across the country have dropped them.\n\nIf that's the case, you were wise to get out before it got worse. Kudos.",

Logistics is no joke, and I'll assume you did your absolute best with the tools they gave you. This is typically how I've seen it be, and you had every right to call them out on their arrogance.\n\nSaw your update about how about 15% of their providers quit in a relatively short time and that's the kind of thing that will wake up a company that wants to survive. If they don't change now, they're doomed.\n\nThank you for sharing.",
