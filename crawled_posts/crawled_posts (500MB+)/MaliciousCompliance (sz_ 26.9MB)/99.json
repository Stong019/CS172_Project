        "selftext": "**THE SETUP:**\n\nI have a 2 bedroom house. I decided that I wanted to rent out the other bedroom in the house to make some money on space I wasn't really using after COVID. So I fixed up the place really nice:\n\nThe tenant gets:\n\n- Private, semi-attached bathroom (bathroom is actually outside the bedroom, but I put up drapes between the bedroom and bathroom so tenant can walk between without me seeing)\n\n- Common consumables! (I pay for toilet paper, paper towels, laundry supplies, kitchen supplies, etc.)\n\nI create the lease. The lease is very barebones. It just says \"you get a room at this property. You pay this much per month. Landlord covers all utilities. Your lease is X months long.\"\n\nI created the ad. In the ad I mentioned how \"it's ok to have guests over, but keep it to no more than twice per month\". I did not put this into the lease agreement. You can see where this is going. \n\nI do a showing for a prospect, T. I tell him the guest policy and he seems just fine with it. I do the rest of the showing and all seems grand. He signs the lease agreement and moves in.\n\n**THE PROBLEM:**\n\nThe first month is grand. Anyone can fool someone for a month. But eventually you return to bad habits. His bad habit was women. He would have women over 4-5 nights per week. I did not appreciate this.\n\nI pulled him aside to tell him \"Hey, you're having a lot of girls over. You need to reduce how many girls over or, if you're willing to pay a bit extra for having all these girls over, I won't say a thing.\" He initially agrees with it.\n\nThe next day, he calls me down and asks to speak with me at the dining room table. It's T and his girl du jour, G. T begins arguing, \"How can you ask for more money when that's not in the lease agreement? You can't ask for that.\" I told him the guest policy was in the ad and that we spoke about it when he came here. He said, \"Yeah, but you can't ask for that. If it's not in the lease agreement you can't do that. The guest policy isn't in the lease agreement either, so I pay rent. I can have over whoever whenever I want.\"\n\nG piped in, \"You just need to take the L on this one and write better lease agreements.\"\n\nI replied to G, \"You're not on the lease agreement, so I don't give a shit what you think about it.\" I turned to T, \"It was in the ad. We also talked about it when you came here. You knew about this.\"\n\nT replied, \"Woahhh man calm down. It's just six months man. That's my lease term. I'll be out of your hair in six months.\"\n\nI replied, \"Why can't you stay at her place?\"\n\nG said, \"That's none of your business.\"\n\n\"Shut up, G. I don't care what you think. You want a problem, T? You got one. This is not cool and you know it.  Why does she have to be here 5 nights a week? She practically lives here. I signed a lease with you, T, not with her. Why is she here?\"\n\nHe shrugged, \"Can't help it. Not in the lease agreement man. That's what lease agreements are for.\"\n\nI was infuriated. We talked about this. He's choosing to follow the lease agreement. Okay... fine... what's a guy to do? I want him gone. I don't want T & G teaming up against me in my own house!!\n\nThey walked upstairs and turned on the loud music in their room.\n\nLater in the evening, G was downstairs cooking something on the stove by herself using my pots and pans. She's cooking for herself in my house! She's not even a tenant but she sure is acting like one.\n\nG tried striking up a friendly conversation with me, but I just gave her absolute silence for 10 minutes while I cooked. I took my food upstairs.\n\nThis is war. I'm going to follow the lease agreement TO THE LETTER. If I advertised a feature in the ad but it wasn't in the lease agreement, that thing is GONE.\n\n**THE COMPLIANCE**\n\nEvery day I took something away.\n\nI first started by removing all the common consumables from the house. He texted me later, \"Man, you removed all the consumables? You need to come down on the rent.\" I replied, \"Not in the lease agreement.\" He said, \"It don't got to be like this.\"\n\nI removed the drapes between his room and the private bathroom.\n\nI took away the chairs for the dining room table.\n\nI then shut off the clothes washer and dryer (circuit breakers were in my room) and left taped up the location of a local laundromat.\n\nI also became an absolutely filthy roommate. I didn't clean anything. I left bags of garbage wherever I felt like. I never cleaned the kitchen and left the sink full of dishes. \"Please man can you clean up\" \"No.\"\n\nI had maid service. Cancelled that. I informed him of the change. \"Can you come down on the rent, man?\" \"Not in the lease agreement. You agreed to a rental price.\" \"C'monnnnnn\"\n\nI turned off the breaker to the stove and left out a wall outlet single pot electric plate for him to use.\n\nI turned off the microwave. Not in the lease agreement either.\n\nI actually started feeling bad for him. G started coming around less and less as I made the living situation worse and worse.\n\nFinally, he texted me, \"Do you want me to move out?\"\n\nI replied, \"Yes, when are you leaving my house?\"\n\nHe said, \"End of the month. You'll let me break the lease?\"\n\nI replied, \"Of course.\"\n\nHe left at the end of the month. I had my house back. I made for sure to make my next lease agreement way more specific about EVERYTHING.",

And then the next week she can come back and stay Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday. Legally. And you have zero recourse. There is nothing you can do.  \n\nThat's one of those things about being a landlord that most amateurs seem to forget - you don't just get to decide you're gonna provide arguably the most critical service of all (housing) and not check up on any laws and expect to not pay the consequences *forever*.

Probably not consumables, but chairs and furniture. And def the stove and microwave. What you did is called \"constructive eviction\" and it's an actual misdemeanor, not just a civil issue.b along with being filthy.

So only what ever is stated in the four corners of that document is the contract between the parties. But the judge also says something like, contracts can also be a verbal agreement between parties. If I have understood Judge Judy correctly. Says a verbal contract can not over ride or supersede a written contract. Written contract is the primary thing. If I have understood correctly (no guarantees, lol). Your tenant was right. They only had to obey the written contract. Anything stated on the written contract, any facility or entitlement removed by the landlord breaches that contract. Some landlords who have done this on the show have to pay compensation to the tenant as it  a civil law court. Personally in your situation I would have felt exactly like you.

The building is ~20 years old and though the appliances and wall paint and carpets have been replaced\u2026 the floor has not. It\u2019s painfully thin. Every step we take creaks and groans and it\u2019s ANNOYING. Living on the 3rd floor, we know it\u2019s gotta be even more so for whoever lives below us. So, we\u2019ve done our best to be mindful of their comfort, and try not to make too much noise.\n\nWe had a new downstairs neighbor move in a couple months ago. And she is NOT convinced that we are literally tip-toeing around our apartment. Every time I get home and close my door? She\u2019s banging on my floor with a broom or something. Every time I cross the living room? Banging. Every time I vacuum? Banging. Every time my dog chews on a bone? She bangs on the dang floor and it scares my poor dog. We\u2019ve been living on eggshells trying to be courteous, but she\u2019s driving us mad with her insistent BANGING every time we take a step.\n\nI guess she had finally \u2018had enough\u2019 because she came upstairs to yell at us the other day. \u201cYou are too loud! You need to be courteous and walk normal! You have neighbors!\u201d, she yells. She almost looked like she was going to cry. It was disturbing. We felt bad. My husband tried to explain that, ma\u2019am, we do our best to be quiet, but these floors are really old and they creak. We\u2019re not stomping or jumping or running. We\u2019re living - but we\u2019ll continue to be considerate.\n\nShe was NOT impressed with his answer, and continued to argue. \u201cWell, I lived on a first floor before and my other neighbors weren\u2019t loud like you.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s so loud and my job is so stressful so I want you to stop stomping.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a mean person but I really think you\u2019re too loud.\u201d \n\nSo you know what we agreed to? To walk like normal people. \u201cOkay, okay, we\u2019ll walk normally.\u201d We said. This is exactly what we had been doing. Nothing different. So she still bangs on the floor and gives us nasty looks. But we are being normal people who walk normal and don\u2019t stomp around! Our dog is a normal dog who chews on bones and walks from his bed to his food bowl, and gets excited when it\u2019s time for walkies! We are so normal!\n\nWe\u2019ll be moving in the next month so it\u2019s no skin off my back. Hope the next tenant doesn\u2019t have kids\u2026 or maybe I do. And then she\u2019ll finally understand that we are normal people who walk normal. Maybe she\u2019ll miss us.\n\nEdit:: So I\u2019ve noticed a LOT of y\u2019all upset over me calling a 20something year old building \u2018old\u2019\u2026 \nSorry. I should\u2019ve called it \u2018dated\u2019. I\u2019m in a big city where most apartment buildings around here are pretty new, and have maybe only been around a decade or so. So this one is \u2018old\u2019 to me. Not new.\n\nAlso. Thank y\u2019all for the stories, input, and advice on how to be better neighbors. Some are pretty insightful! However, considering she banged on the floor again today while I was running the bath, I\u2019m not too concerned with wearing slippers all day around the house, or padding the carpeted floors with noise-canceling material. Angry people like being angry. I\u2019m excited for the move-out day, when people will be constantly walking around and moving heavy furniture. (:",

            "For anyone curious, **Impact Insulation Class (IIC)** is the \"rating for the ability of a floor-ceiling assembly to block impact/structure-borne noise from transmitting to the space below.\"\n\n>The Uniform Building Code (UBC) and the State of California set minimum standards of 50 IIC (laboratory) and 45 FIIC (field) ratings in multifamily dwellings. At this rating footfall noise from a person walking on a floor above is clearly audible, and it is possible to follow the progress of the walker around the room. Thus these building code standards do not represent good building practice. Rather they represent minimums below which it is illegal to build. It is only when the IIC ratings are above 65 that heel clicks begin to become inaudible (Kopec, 1990).\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/impact-insulation-class\n\nSo OP could potentially do a test to see if this building is in violation of the building code.

It was in a tiny town, way out away from any major roads, so I thought it would be nice and quiet since there weren't that many people in the building.  Both of the apartments on either side of me were empty, and I was on the second floor, but the floors were nice and thick, so I didn't think I'd ever have any issues with people complaining about me making noise, since I was living alone at the time, and I'm typically a quiet person anyway.  \n\n\nThe first night I moved in and get my bed set up and a few boxes unpacked.  I get ready for bed kind of early because I was tired from the move, and crawl under the sheets.  I'm almost asleep and the I suddenly hear someone screaming like they're being murdered.  The floor was thick enough that I couldn't make out any distinct words, but since I was just out of college and it was my first apartment, I kind of freaked out, but I didn't want to panic, so I called my dad and asked him what I should do?  Should I call the cops?  The live in building manager?  My dad asked if the screaming was still continuing, and I said yes, so he said to try the building manager first, and if I couldn't get hold of him, then call the cops.  \n\n\nLuckily, I did get hold of the manager, and he apologized and said he should have warned me, but the lady who lived below me was in her 60's or 70's (I forget which), and was about 90% deaf. She was screaming at the Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune reruns and did it every night.  Everyone else was used to it, so he forgot to mention it to me.  She only did it at night and only for about two hours.  There was some legal reason why they couldn't ask her to move out, if I remember, so I just had to deal with it.  Believe me, I got a good pair of headphones and started making sure to wear them when I got home to drown her out.  \n\n\nIt was thin walls in that place that really ended up bothering me.  Even though the apartments on either side of me were empty - being renovated - the one two down from me on the left was occupied by a family.  And they were as obnoxious as all get out.  Blasting rap from their speakers at full volume every day, but especially on the weekends, when they would also keep the apartment door open when the weather was nice.  They would also scream at each other - it was a constant tirade of \"F\" this and \"F\" that, and \"F you\".  They were loud enough that my headphones couldn't even block them out.  More than once I went down and asked them to keep it down because I needed to sleep.  That usually shut them up for a day or two, but then they'd be back at it.  \n\n\nFortunately, I didn't end up living there long - about nine months, if I remember before the job I moved there for fell through and I moved back to the same town my parents live in.",
            "Thought the last place I lived had thin floors. We could hear the upstairs neighbours walking around, playing with the dog (by tapping repeatedly on the floor at 2 AM) vacuuming daily, arguing, etc. So when I met the downstairs neighbour I apologized for the noise from us even though we tried to be quiet. She said that she never hears us. I assumed she was just being polite. Well after about 18 months our upstairs neighbours moved out and a new family moved in. I\u2019m not sure what the original couple were doing, but the new family was quieter on the day they moved in than the other couple on any given day. Barely heard anything from them, just enough to know they were there.",

            "I don't know... now that they've heard you \"being normal,\" it might be time for another chat with them.  I hate walking on eggshells too, but at least the neighbor would have an understanding of what you were doing prior to your first conversation.",
            "We live in a reasonably nice place. It\u2019s almost sound proofed except the floor still carries vibrations (we lived in a middle floor so we feel vibrations from upstairs once in a while but not enough to be bothered about). And we had this cranky old dude who kept coming up to complain about how loud we were. We were so new to the country back then and we were worried and went out of the way to be quiet and kept apologising. We basically tiptoed in our own apartment. We even got these shock absorbing pads to put under our appliances.\n\nAnd one day he was ruder than usual and almost got into a verbal altercation with my partner and we had to push him out of the apartment and close the door behind him (we were stupid and allowed him to step inside to talk). We called building security because we were very worried and asked if we did anything wrong. And the security guy assured us he will come up immediately. Then he apologised and explained how he\u2019s sorry we were that worried because apparently that old man was bothering every one. And rather than us doing anything wrong he told to call him immediately if he ever bothers us again and he will handle it right away.\n\nI think the talk went well because we never got another visit and we stopped all the tiptoeing and live peacefully. The cantankerous old dude moved out soon after.",

The lady finally knocked on our door, and told us that our two dogs (~50lbs each) needed to walk quieter. We brought it up to the property manager and never got a comaint again for the remaining 9 months we were there. Funny enough, the meetings we had with our property manager about this sparked a conversation that led to her being our realtor for our current home.",

I'm a masters student who had a bug infestation last year, please pity me because I sleep until 930 am so I need you to be quiet until then.

It was in the south so the stairs to our apartment were all cement but with nothing underneath and they ran along the side of the apartments. Nothing super abnormal about it. \n\nNow since we were military we got up early and wore boots. Our downstairs neighbors were an elderly couple. They HATED the sound of us leaving our apartment in the morning. They complained constantly about us making noise. The complex manager would leave us notes about noise often. We finally realized it was our boots. It was the only time they complained. In the morning while getting ready and hustling around the kitchen right before we walked out (kitchen was right next to the front door) and when we went up and down the stairs in them. We tried to go down the stairs quietly but they were cement and the hallway the stairs were in echoed soo much it was impossible to be quiet.\n\nThey actually tried to get the management to ban us from wearing our boots inside (even though we only wore them inside in the kitchen and not on the carpet for sanitary reasons) and to leave them at the bottom of the stairs outside and put them on then when we left. Like wut?! First off I\u2019m not walking downstairs in my socks and putting boots on while sitting on cement\u2026especially since I was pregnant at the time. Second, it\u2019s the south. Boots outside were basically a vacancy sign for spiders, snakes and who knows what other crawly thing that wanted to kill you lol and third it was a complex (and not in the best area as we were broke airmen) not like a duplex so we weren\u2019t leaving our $100+ boots outside for anyone to take. They were NOT happy with our reasons and even when management told them they couldn\u2019t make us do any of the things they wanted they still huffed and puffed at us when they saw us. \n\nLuckily it only went on for about 5 months. We moved to a better place with less stairs as I got further into my pregnancy and we both ranked up so we earned a bit more money and could afford the better place. \n\nBut man those old people were crazy.

I sympathized, but tbh looking at the layout, I strongly suspected it was a case of poor soundproofing. The stairs to the upstairs apartment ran behind her living room and you could tell they'd just slapped up a wall to partition the back door off to become a private entrance for the upstairs unit, with god knows how little sound insulation. And then the overall quality of the house was...dubious...due to its obvious need for renovations, so I'd be awful surprised if any effort had been made to soundproof the floor/ceiling between the units. \n\nThat wasn't the only reason I turned it down, but I suspect that out of all the issues I found with the place, having to literally tiptoe around my neighbor probably would have been the one that stressed me out the most.",

He'd yell at the kids, at his partner, he'd yell about everything. Nothing would make him happy. I longed for the day this miserable fucker moved out.\n\nAnd one day it happened. They were leaving.\n\nBut was it better? No. New people moved in one floor below us (above Greek man's old apartment) and they were even worse. Fighting every day. Fighting so much that we wondered why these two people would ever be in a relationship with each other. They had parties until 3am, fine, whatever, people need to have fun. I don't know how they made the sliding door sound so loud but it was the most aggressive door opening and slamming I've heard. The guy smoked and it drifted into our apartment.\n\nThe funny part? After months and months of their intrusive noisemaking, she wrote us a letter and left it at our door. Asking us to be quieter. I told her the truth, that it was actually the children beneath her apartment running on their hardwood floors. I knew this because we were on the top floor and somehow it also sounded like people running above us.

        "selftext": "Some background: \nIn high school, I went to an academic magnet school. Essentially it was a public school ran like a private school. You had to have certain test scores to get, no bus transportation (since it was for the whole county), way stricter dress code than all the other schools on the district, and they were able to have a ton of extra rules because it was a \"choice school.\"\n\nNow I was the first graduating class; I was there the first year it opened. At that time it was 5th-9th grade, and I startoed as a freshman. The second year they had completed the elementary wing, and so it was K-10. They added grades until my senior year when it was finally K-12.\n\nAs the school grew, it continued to add more policies. My sophomore year (the school's second year of being open), they began a new policy where ALL students 7th grade and above had to be on a sports team everywhere.\n\nI thought this was really, really stupid. I hated it. I'm not an athlete; I was in other clubs, and I was getting increasingly involved with my church. Being the mature 16 year old I was, my initial plan was to join a team and have a bad attitude. Like an awful, evangelistically bad attitude so that no one would have any fun, and this would prove to the school how awful this rule was.\n\nInstead, for all the lazy kids like me, they started a school walking team. It wasn't power walking - just regular walking. We just had to walk around the neighborhood for about 45 minutes 3x a week after school.\n\nI was fine with this; I didn't mind walking around. Of course there was an adult 'coach', but since the whole thing was ridiculous anyways, my friend and I declared ourselves co-captains. This mostly consisted in telling the middle schoolers to walk faster. No one else considered us co-captains, but we did, and that's all that mattered to us since it was all a joke anyways.\n\nI did that my sophomore and junior years, but fast forward to my senior year. I was 18, working part time about 15-20 hours a week, I was super involved in my church, and my family was a chaotic mess of dysfunction that traumatized me in numerous ways. \n\nThey finally enforced the state law that everyone on a sports team has to have an annual physical on file. I didn't really bother with this since it wasn't a real sport anyways. Eventually, they came to me and said that it was so late in the season that even if I got a physical, I would need to pick a different sport in the winter or spring (walking team was a fall sport). \n\nI was essentially just \"screw this\"; I had enough other things in my life to deal with, and I didn't want to put up with this crap anymore. I decided to do exactly what they say and get the physical; i also decided I would do my best to fail it.\n\nSo eventually I went and saw a doctor. It's important to note that I didn't have a primary care doctor at the time; that's why I didn't get a physical before then. So I just went to some little walk-in clinic, and I tell them I need a sports physical. I didn't tell them what the sport was.\n\nNow as I was filling out the patient history form, I answered truthfully; I did not lie, but I didn't provide any context. So I checked yes to a history of asthma (mostly from when I was a kid), severe seasonal allergies, AND a history of seizures.\n\nSee when I was 13 I had a couple dozen seizures in a day or two; no one knew what was going on, and eventually I was diagnosed with epilepsy specifically having 'absence seizures.' Since then, I \nhad been taking anti-convulsants every day. As far as I am aware - even 20 years after that initial episode, I'm not sure I've had a full blown seizure since then. It's literally the mildest case of epilepsy I've ever heard of.\n\nThe doctor does a quick physical exam - mostly vitals and similar things. As she looks at my patient history form, she asks about the seizures, I explain that I was diagnosed with epilepsy, I take anti-convulsants, and I have a neurologist I see about once or twice a year. She says \"well i can't pass you until I hear from your neurologist.\" \n\nI basically hopped out of the chair, happily said \"thank you\" and walked out. I never did contact the neurologist; instead, i just gave the paperwork to the school.\n\nAnd that's how I (a relatively healthy 18 year old) got medically disqualified from the school walking team.\n\n[Edit: Fixed some typos]",

            "i remember when i was younger, i was on the football team (soccer). But due to my birth month of december, and being held back from starting school so i was older, i was put on a team with the boys a class higher than me.  \nSo i got teased a lot and constantly benched by the coach. So i lost my enjoyment of football.  \n\n\nSo when the school started doing football during classes, i instead became a very direct football player, meaning i went directly after the person with the ball, and hard hitting the ball while they were hitting it too... not doing dirty things, just being very direct and head on.  \nSo the other class mates, refused to play football with me, so we got to play more dodgeball and other fun games.",
            "This story kind of makes me sad. The OP may ha e been busy, but an upbringing that instills a background in physical fitness is an incredible gift to the person who receives it. Without your health your quality of life collapses, and your performance both body AND mind deteriorates. \n\nSports are also valuable character building experiences - overcoming adversity, working as a team, leadership skills, etc. Athletics aren\u2019t required to be a happy and functional human being, but they\u2019re a tailwind for sure. \n\nMaybe the school didn\u2019t go about it perfectly, and maybe the OP was busy doing his work and religious stuff, but ultimately he missed out on something that could have been a growth experience.",

            "I skipped P.E. (one of the most useless subjects when not taught well) during HS.  My high school had obligatory P.E. classes during 1st and 2nd semester, but we were forced to carry stay after normal school hours for about one and a half hours. It was absolutely boring and I was already taking volleyball and karate. The first semester was an absolute mess because they thought it would be a great idea to have 400+ students take P.E a the same time. My friends and I just went around and walked around the school or hid in the library. We just came back when the teacher took attendance. The next semester they organized themselves better, and this was no longer possible.  So, I decided to involve myself with other school activities, and got a teacher to sign for me and a few other classmates so that we could be excused from P.E. It was a win-win situation, I got to stay in-doors with the A.C. , I was able to participate in contests and got an easy A in P.E. I must have gone less than 10 times in the whole year. Seriously though, why bother forcing teenagers to get into a team sport?",

            "I have a similar story, except mine's more of a petty revenge story. So, when I was in 8th grade I pulled a prank that caused my finals scores to become null and void (I blew an air horn in the middle of the math final and was hilarious), placing me in average classes like Algebra 1 and Intro to Biology the next year. They even put me in the basic P.E. class. After about a month of repeating basic bs I learned the previous year, I requested to be transferred into higher difficulty classes, like Biology 2 and Algebra 2. I even went and got signatures from my teachers as proof that they believed I should move forward in my classes. They quickly shot down my request, stating that they were unable to transfer me into higher classes because of my finals scores from the previous year, and because of the prank I pulled during the final, I wasn't allowed to retake the test. So I did the only thing that I could think of: I refused to do any schoolwork, except for test and other large projects. I wouldn't do a single worksheet they gave me, but when they handed me a test, I would pass it with flying colors. I also slept through most of the classes. Even in P.E., I would only do the test they gave us, didn't do warm ups or any of the other curriculum. And I did this until the end of my sophomore year of highschool, when I decided I was gaining nothing from the curriculum. So I walked into the office, politely requested the paperwork for the G.E.D. test, took the test without studying, and brought the scores to the district office, showing them that I was indeed capable of higher curiculum classes, and promptly unenrolled myself from the school. Not as interesting as your story, but I understand the \"I'm purposely going to fail\" attitude. \n\nTldr; I pulled a prank, wasn't allowed to go to classes I qualified for, so I didn't do any work, except for test.",
