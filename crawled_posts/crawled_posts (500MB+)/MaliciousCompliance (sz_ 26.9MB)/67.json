        "selftext": "This story comes from Melbourne, Aus, where the liquor laws are pretty strict. TL;DR at bottom.\n\nWe had a local pub near work that did $5 wines/beers during happy hour. It was a bit of a dump but we didn't mind. Three of us would go regularly every Friday to relax. We usually bought rounds for each other, so 3 at a time, or maybe just 1 each if not all of us wanted a top up. Since this is a modern world, we'd pay by debit and just tap our card on the little machine. Simple. Easy. \n\nOne week I get to the pub before the others so I went to order a wine for myself and reserve a nice table in the sun. When I went to pay, the bartender informed me of the manager's new rule: to pay by card is now a $20 minimum. For cash, a new ATM had been installed in the corner that only gives 20's and charges $3.50 per cash-out, of which the bar gets a good cut. Now I know it costs for every electronic transaction to occur, and it's not unusual to find small coffee shops asking for a $5 minimum to cover those costs, but $20 was outrageous, especially in a dive where all drinks are dirt cheap. It wouldn't even cover a usual round for us 3. The bartender had to shrug and insist it was the manager's new rule. I tried to argue against it, since I just wanted a single glass. The manager came out and firmly reiterated that I'd have to either buy 4 wines or get cash from the ATM. But I refuse to spend money in order to access my own money.\n\nI ask for 4 wines. \n\nNow, I am a petite woman, it doesn't take too much to get me sloppy. I paid by card and sat there at the empty bar and *pounded* these 4 cab-savs with the same speed that I'd usually nurse one. By the time I had finished, my friends were still not there. I asked the bartender for one more glass of wine. The manager was also still there, cleaning glasses. He told me again what he was instructed to say before: there's a $20 minimum, so...\n\nI ordered 4 more wines. The manager looked pleased that his system was working. He was pretty smug about it all and wouldn't budge on any customer's request.\n\nBefore I paid for my second 4-glass round with my card, I asked the bartender, within clear earshot of the manager, a pretty basic question:\n\n'You've both got your RSA's, right?'\n\nAll bartenders and bar owners are required to possess a Responsible Serving of Alcohol licence, obtained through the state's Commission for Gambling and Liquor. It's a heavily regulated industry, and a pretty strictly-enforced licence. Plain-clothed officers will try to catch out bartenders who don't carry their licence on them while serving drinks, and they'll sit to observe in bars for wreckless behaviour, such as knowingly serving alcohol to an inebriated customer. I am not someone with any legal authority, but I know enough people in the bartending/casino industry to be aware of the laws. \n\n'Of course, why?' the bartender asked. He probably expected me to pull out a badge, but I am just a customer who wanted a glass of wine.\n\nI explained that it seems pretty irresponsible to serve a small woman 4 drinks simultaneously, when all I was asking for was one. Seems as though, by the bar's lack of attention, I have become quite drunk, and now you're about to happily process my second purchase of 4 drinks, knowing full well that I'm here alone. 8 drinks in less than an hour? Does that seem *responsible* to you?\n\nThe smug look on the manager's face quickly turned to anger. \n\n'I think you've had enough, then.'\n'No, no! You've already poured 4 more. Here, take my card. Go on. Can't let all that wine go to waste. I mean, all I wanted was one, but if I HAVE to get 4...'\n\nThe bartender was very confused and a little worried. Losing their RSA would mean losing his job. The manager refused to process my order, and angrily poured 4 glasses of wine down the drain, a loss far greater than the small electronic transaction fee that would have come with my basic wine order. \n\nI was sad to see the wine go, but I was happy to tell them that I'm reporting them to the state commission for breaches of their RSA. A petty move, but the manager chose greed over customer service and got what he deserved. I actually downloaded the complaint form online and began filling it out there at the bar, all while my body was now feeling the full force of 4 smashed wines. I was giggling while doing it, and slurring my words while asking for the manager's name and today's date. The bartender was very apologetic, and knowing none of this is his fault, I happily kept him off the form.\n\nBy the time my friends arrived I was pretty drunk. After telling my story we decided to go somewhere else, and we definitely never went back. I don't know what came of the complaint exactly (likely a big fine) but the place shut down about 6 weeks later and became a brunch cafe. Seems like they lost all their regulars to a $20 minimum rule. \n\nTL;DR: Local pub tries to enforce a $20 (4-drink) minimum. Turns out it's not a responsible way to serve alcohol, especially to someone under 5'3.\n\nEdit: Opening a tab is not a regular thing here. Many small bars, including this one, don't do tabs.",

            "As a previous nightclub owner in Victoria here's what happened:\n\n1. There's no actual RSA that you carry in your pocket, there's a register behind the bar that is maintained by management.\n2. Your complaint triggered a \"compliance audit\" which would've happened randomly in the next 28 days. Inspectors would've shown up and asked for the \"Red Line\" which is the licensed area of the establishment, printed on A3, A2 or A1 and kept on the premises at all times. They would've then asked for an employee list from your payroll and compared it against the RSA register whilst manually checking each name/DoB against their tablets to make sure they match. They would've watched service for about 20-30 minutes after coming in and buying ONE beer each then sipping at it extremely slowly, and then interviewed a couple of patrons to assess their level of intox. \"Major\" breaches (Serving intox, underage and two others) cause a \"Star\" loss which increases your next license renewal by 10%, you can incur more than one star in a single compliance audit. You start at 3 stars and gain one per year to a maximum of 5, if you get to 1 star or less you are given a show cause notice to appear at the VCGLR and explain why you should continue to hold a liquor license.\n\nEvery breach is a 900 dollar on the spot fine (probably gone up in the last 5 years), if you cop more than 3 breaches in a visit you get a court date and the fines are withheld. Magistrate can issue upto 9000 dollar (10 times as much as the on the spot) PER BREACH but typically for a first offense you will just get a really, really stern talking to.\n\nMore likely they shut down/re-opened after driving their customers away. High cost ATM's only work in venues where you do cash only service over the bar (a lot of nightclubs due to speed). Most nightclubs that are cash-only over the bar have a sign near the door somewhere so you can go to your bank ATM before you come in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCorrect way to deal with it though. Just lodge a complaint with the VCGLR and let the bored watchdogs handle it. :)",

Cash is logistically expensive to handle, so they wanted in.\n\nAnd then they rolled out a massive lobbying campaign to get both the public and the politicians to consider plastic. Successfully.\n\nExcept the Danish banks hadn't figured that saving money not handling cash was the least of the money making scheme that is card-based payment, so the banks agreed to pay for the cards and they demanded no customer fees on transactions. They even allowed the ostensible debit card to incur overdrafts.\n\nEdit: And their campaign worked. They created a national fee-lees banking card, called Dankort, that has since become utterly ubiquitous, and they even had to fold large credit cards like VISA and Mastercard into Dankort to get Danes to at least use credit cards when they are abroad.\n\nAnd they got this because they argued that handling cash was costing them too much money, so when they came back 20-25 years later and wanted to add a fee to transactions, their words own words were thrown back at them.

        "selftext": "So, about 10 years ago my husband and I were renting a house while we tried to buy a place. The landlord seemed so nice, and it was a great situation. When we found a place to buy, we gave him our forwarding  information along with the keys. It took about two months to get our deposit back, and we were shocked to say the least. He had taken $400 out. \n\nHe had an enclosed porch that had screens with no glass. It had outdoor carpeting that was gross, and we bought a remnant to cover the carpet since we had little kids and it was questionable (no doubt due to the year round screens - including  rain storms, etc). It wasn\u2019t ideal, but it was a rental. When we left, we rolled up the carpet and threw it out. Anyway, the landlord stated in his letter that he was taking out the $400 because we had broken the lease by having a dog - and his proof was the condition of that carpet. We did not have a dog, and that carpet was gross when we got there. We tried to explain that, but he was having none of it and would ignore our attempts to reach out (plus, how do you prove the absence of something?). \n\nCue malicious compliance: you want to follow the lease so carefully as to make up animals? Well, perhaps you should read the laws a little better. According to our state, landlords have exactly one month to send the deposit back. He took two. According to the law, you can be held liable for three times the amount (1800, in our case). So we sued. We no longer wanted the  $400 back; we wanted $5400. \n\nWhile it was somewhat painful (he dodged attempts to serve him, he had out of state attorney friends try to intimidate us) he eventually had to hire an attorney, and we settled on $2000 (in addition to the $1400 we got back). We filed with the help of a friend so we didn't owe an attorney - just filing fees. \nHe ended up paying $2000 plus attorney fees instead of our $400 for a phantom dog.  \n\nKnow your rights as tenants!",

            "When I was in my late 20s and living in Chicago, I lived with a couple friends in a 3BR apartment in a high-rise (over 120 apartments in the building). We had lived there for about three years, and when the time came, we decided to move out and find alternative arrangements (I moved in with my GF, another wanted to live alone, etc.). I did the research on rental laws to make sure they didn't try to shake us down. Our last day was April 30th, and the apartment was empty and as clean as we were going to get it.\n\nFast forward to June 5th, and I received an envelope from the rental agency. It was an itemized list showing all the \"repairs\" needed on the apartment, and how it was exactly the same amount that we were owed for the security deposit. Knowing the laws and how long they had to send the itemized bill in order to avoid returning the security deposit - 30 days - I checked the postmark: June 2nd. That's 33 days after we moved out.\n\nI called the company and told them I wanted the full deposit back because they failed to send out the itemized list within the 30 day window the law allows. They fought me on it, asking, \"But what's the date on the list?\" I would tell them, \"It doesn't matter, the postmark is the date you have to be concerned with.\" They got insistent, demanding to know the date on the invoice. I avoided, explaining the date on the document doesn't matter if it's not mailed out within the 30 days.\n\nAfter the fifth time they asked me the date on the document, I broke. \"May 31st,\" I said. \"Which would be 31 days after we moved out. Which is more than the 30 days the law allows you to send the invoice.\" The call temporarily went silent. \"Please hold a moment,\" I finally heard, and so I waited.\n\nFive minutes went by. All I can assume is they were checking their own records to see if I was lying to them, because the first words out of their mouth were, \"What address do we send the check to?\"",

I stopped by to talk to landlord and ask about the $100.  Basically, he said I was the first tenant to clean well enough to not need to hire someone.  He also appreciated the few things that I noted I damaged so he could fix quickly.  \n\nI also think it helped he rented it out for $150 more a month after I left.

The same day, the landlord advertises the house at \u00a3200 per month more on agency websites and emails her he wants them out in 2 weeks. They remind him they are entitled to 2 months and he won\u2019t be allowed in the house or arrange viewings until they have left.\n\nThe landlord then sends them an email that he estimates she owes \u00a34K to fix the back garden because it wasn\u2019t in a condition to his standards when they leave. ( he peeked over the fence to look). He claimed there was bushes missing, the lawn and shed were irreparably damaged and it would cost that much to fix. \n\nIn fact daughter had just spend \u00a3150 and got in a gardener to deweed, rip out an unsafe dead bush and weed/feed the cut lawn. She had photo evidence and videos of the day she moved in and when she left, which revealed there was little difference. \n\nShe disputed the claim and also pointed out that even though she had asked many times (over text) for the landlord to get the boiler serviced as the certificate had expired, she was ignored and 6 months later he still hadn\u2019t done it. She reminded him the the state of the garden it a matter of opinion, but the status of the expired gas certificate and that the landlord had neglected his duty of care WAS A FACT. She was quite happy to sue him for breach of contract and actively putting the tenants in danger due to neglect. \n\nSuddenly the 4K went down to \u00a3300 for a few repairs in the house. \n\nMy daughter\u2019s stress levels where through the  roof during all this. The landlord\u2019s error was he thought was just dealing with a bunch of young adults who he could intimidate. In reality he was dealing with 4 sets of parents with enough education and experience to read a contract and know the law.",

I would have left them, but she really made it hard to make any favors to her.\n\neventually she threatened me with lawyers and since I was alone, not familiar with law or my rights, I gave up and she got to keep the money I sure could have used back then. at times I wish I could step on cockroaches like her.",

I told our landlord that there was damage in the living room on the floors and I apologized. He said 'maybe it won't be bad!' and he thanked us for being nice tenants. \n\nHe calls us about two weeks later very apologetic. He would only be able to give us part of the deposit and just wanted to give us a heads up. He had sent us back a third of our deposit; to be honest, I was elated.

We did not have a dog, and that carpet was gross when we got there. We tried to explain that, but he was having none of it and would ignore our attempts to reach out (plus, how do you prove the absence of something?). \n\nLife pro-tip: Always conduct an inspection of a rental with the landlord and make a written record of stuff like this before you take possession.

If I'm going to pay for it, I'll be damned if I'm going to do the work for them.\n\nI had one apartment that I shared where both my roommate and I had male cats. You can only imagine the damage.\n\nThe landlord contacted us and told us we owed $800 to re-carpet the place due to urine damage. They had used a black light and had documentation.\n\nThis was not a shock; I was frankly surprised it was that little.\n\nThe roommate situation had not split well, and we had gone our separate ways. The landlord, a large corporation, decided that since I answered my phone first, I would pay the whole thing and collect my roommate's half from her.\n\nI told him that I would give them a check for my half as soon as I saw proof that the carpeting had been replaced. Since both of us were on the lease, it was up to them to collect from my roommate.\n\nA week later I got a call that the carpeting was done. I inspected the carpeting and gave them a check. I have no idea what happened with my ex roommate.\n\nAll things considered, this is still a whole lot less work than having to deal with being a homeowner.\n\nBut that's just me.",

            "I also had to sue a previous landlord for my security deposit. He violated the law in several ways. For the 2 yrs i lived there he never paid me interest on my deposit. He never sent me account statements. He never gave me the info on the account my money was being held in. He did not return my deposit in a timely manner. It was just over 2 months when I received it but before I had a chance to deposit it he messaged me to say he cancelled it and would be sending me the money electronically. Took months for that to finally come in. He also took nearly 2 months to send me the money he promised to pay me if I moved out by a certain date. And he refused to send me the interest payments on my security deposit. So I sued him (this was right after he cancelled the check and before he sent me the move out money). You'd think it'd be an easy win but no. My lawyer was lazy (never again will I pay them in full upfront) and just wanted to settle for a small amount. And no matter how many time I refused and told him I would just go to court he would not listen to me. So what should've been a payout of over $5k came out to about $3k (minus the $1k in lawyer's fees so really $2k). ugh"

        "selftext": "So around July of last year I am coming up on the end of my contract for a big national gym chain that, lets just say, you can visit anytime. So, I try and call and get directions to cancel, and get a voicemail box that is full. I call their 800 number and am told only the local office can cancel me. I call my bank and ask if I can block auto-debit, but because it is a check debit they can only block a specific amount and there is a fee.\n\nI scan my contract and it says I have to cancel in writing with 30 days notice regardless of my contract end date. I am pretty furious at this point because the gym was closed completely due to covid and I was wasting money. I hadn't been too concerned while my contract was going but now I just wanted to end my association with them. I write the letter with my membership number, email, and phone number, and send the letter certified with my fob.\n\nTwo months later, I notice I am still being charged, and they have billed me an additional $60 for my \"annual access fee.\" Now I am livid.\n\nI find the customer service email and explain the situation with specific dates of calls, letters, and attempted visits to the office. I ask that my membership be cancelled and a refund for the past several months and the annual renewal. I receive a rather curt response saying they will start my cancelation, but I will have one more monthly charge because there is a 30 day notice. I respond asking them to read my message and see that is what I did already by mail.\n\nApparently the local manager has been letting mail pile up as they don't even have someone at the office part time. No one has seen my letter. I say this to the email rep. He/she asks me to read my contract and states that even if I can demonstrate the letter was sent I would still be on the hook for the 30 days and the annual fee. She says I need to read my contract if I have any questions. And I do.\n\nTurns out, near the end of this very long document, is section 20.1, which states the following:\n\n\"Unexpected events\r\nWe are not responsible if Members cannot use our Club because of an event caused by a natural force (such as a fire or a flood) or a road or building closure or something similar beyond our reasonable control. If this continues for more than 30 days, then either you or we may cancel this \r\nAgreement immediately by written notice. No Fee will apply.\"\n\nSo, I respond with this new knowledge I have and point out the gym had been closed 90 days prior to my original letter, and even greater than my email cancellation request. I also threaten the following if they don't refund me back to my original contract end date:\n\n1. I will pay people I know to picket their gym.\n2. I will hand out flyers telling people about this provision of the contract so others in the middle of contracts will be able to cancel without a fee.\n3. I will publish an article in our local online newspaper about the trouble I have had offering advice to others.\n\nAnd I make it clear that I have all the documentation including phone statements to prove it is all true.\n\nThree days later I was called by a regional director with an apology and a full refund of over $240 that had been inappropriately taken and a little extra.\n\nFor those wondering, I am sharing this now because I understand many people in California where the lockdown was more strict have gone through this and they deserve to know how not to be abused. And remember, if someone tells you to read your contract, do it!",

So - if you find yourself getting screwed over by a gym - check your state regulations because  most gyms are about as good at following health guidelines as they are at processing cancellations timely.  The big difference with a health violation though is depending on what/where/how many times, they might get shut down over it.\n\nNot all gyms operate like scumbags but I have run into this exact same problem a couple of times.

Worst case just cancel the card outright. Even if they don't want to cancel charges they will do it rather than lose a customer. You are a customer of theirs, the gym is not. You'll win everytime.",

It was the summer before my senior year in high school, and my best friend at the time invited me to come stay with her and her dad\u2019s family in Florida for two weeks. \n\nMuch to my chagrin (on a beach vacation no less) I got my period. I had brought supplies with me just in case, and disposed of them wrapped up in toilet paper in the lidded garbage can in the shared bathroom we were using as one does. \n\nOn the third day of the trip, her dad approached me to say that my friend\u2019s step-brother, who lived with them, had \u201cseen\u201d my period products in the bathroom garbage can (like, were you digging around in there ya weirdo?) and was disgusted by it. He asked me not to throw them out there so his son wouldn\u2019t have to \u201csee that\u201d (again, a lot harder to see than to avoid, imo, but I digress). I asked him where he suggested I dispose of my \u201cdisgusting\u201d products then, to avoid upsetting his son. I thought it was a kind of ridiculous request since this is a natural body process I can\u2019t control, but I wanted to do what I could since I was a guest there. \n\nBut this man goes \u201cjust hold it in until we go out to dinner or something and throw it out in a public restroom.\u201d Sir, you have a daughter. How can you not know that\u2019s not how things work? When I asked him what I should do if that wasn\u2019t an option, he said \u201cjust flush it then, so he doesn\u2019t have to see it.\u201d\n\nCue malicious compliance. Yes sir, instead of wrapping up my used tampon in some toilet paper and tucking it into the trash can (that has a god damn LID), I will flush it down the toilet instead. \n\nThe first one went down just fine. The second time it went down with a gurgle. But the third one made the toilet back up and overflow. I\u2019ll always remember the sight of my friend\u2019s dad pumping that toilet only for a partially dissolved bloody tampon to float to the surface of the bowl. I went back to putting them in the trash, and he didn\u2019t say another word about it.",

            "I don't think of periods as disgusting or bad or anything. It's a natural body process just like anything else. It does, however, remind me of a story of mine.\n\nI'm a man, and I lived alone after moving out of my parents' house. Several years in, I was dating someone long term, and she was staying over 5-6 nights per week. My sink was outside of my bathroom, so I never had a trash can in there (no need, for the most part, for me). I never even considered it.\n\nOne morning, I woke up and went to go pee. While that's going on, I look to my side and see something wrapped in toilet paper. My first thought was that my girlfriend left me a cute, little present. I'm not a big fan of presents/gifts/surprises, but she is. \n\nSo, I unwrapped it. You know what it was, but I had never seen a tampon (used or otherwise). It was completely absent from my life experiences to that point. It legitimately broke my brain for a few moments. I was still thinking it was a present, so I was trying to figure out what it meant. I was coming up blank. Then, I thought that perhaps she had a BAD bloody nose or something in the middle of the night. I worried that she didn't tell me about it - maybe I could've helped fetch some ice or something. Finally, I got there, realized what it was and threw it away.\n\nLater, I told her about it and she was a tad embarrassed, but had a good laugh at my expense. Afterwards, we'd occasionally leave wadded up toilet paper for each other as a joke - in the microwave, under a pillow, in a pants pocket. Good times.",

        "selftext": "I'm a part time home baker. I took it up while I'm studying from home during the pandemic, and it's basically a fundraiser for my charity since I can't do my monthly fundraiser bake sales on campus anymore. I'm also the only person selling baked goods in my entire area, so my items are very popular. Specifically this one particular type of cake I make that people absolutely love. \n\nThe other day, a lady called me and wanted to place an order for 1lb of this particular cake. She said she had tried it at a friend's house and loved it and wanted it for her niece's birthday. I told her that I used the metric measurements, so my cakes are actually 500 gms or 1 kg (1lb = 454 gms). She said she wanted a 1lb cake, I dropped it because it was more or less the same thing. \n\nImportant for later: when I had made the cake for her friend, I had run out of my 1lb cake bases so I had used 2lb cake base. IMO, this made the cake look smaller, but it's possible that someone else might think that the cake was bigger. (Edit: to clear up some confusion - cake base is the cardboard on top of which you put the cake. I use two sizes, 9\" diameter base for my small cakes (500gms) and 12\" diameter base for the big cakes (1kg). When the lady's friend ordered, I had run out of the smaller base so I used the 12\" Base for the 500 gms cake.) \n\nAfter I took the order and quoted the price to her, she started giving me more instructions - the birthday girl is 16, so decorate it according to a 16 year old girl (I know, super vague), add XYZ stuff to it, write 4 different things on the cake. I explained to her that all this is not included in the base price and the kind of toppings she wanted would make it a lot heavier and pricier. She said, make it a 1lb cake for the 1lb cake price. \n\nOkay. I get the hint. You want a 1lb cake with those specific customisations. So I made it just that - removed some of the ganache, made thinner layers so I could incorporate her additions and still keep it at exactly 454 gms, no more, no less. \n\nThe lady came to pick it up and she went ballistic because I was trying to rob her in the name of charity, and the cake I made was in no way 1 lb because her friend's cake was 'bigger'. I tried explaining to her why her friend's cake might have looked bigger, and that this cake was exactly 1 lb as she wanted. She refused to listen and was starting to create a huge scene, said she wanted a refund. \n\nSo I brought my weighing scale out and weighed the cake out in front of her. 454 gms exactly. The lady saw and went, \"Aha! I was right. You are trying to cheat me. It's 50 gms less.\" \n\nI said no, it's exactly 1 lb, like you wanted. I opened up google converter and showed her that 1 lb is in fact 454 gms, not 500. I opened whatsApp and showed her the message where I told her I make 500 gms standard cakes and she said she doesn't care, she wants 1lb. \n\nShe was a bit gobsmacked and said I should have had some professional courtesy and made it 500 gms and I am trying to cheat her. I had it with her. I told her, \"Ma'am, you wanted exactly 1lb cake. You said it to me 4 times. So you can take this exactly 1lb cake, or you can take your refund and leave. I can find other people who would want to buy a 1 lb cake.\"\n\nShe took her 1lb cake and left, saying she will never buy anything from me again and make sure to let others know too. Later, her niece followed my page on Instagram and dropped me a message apologising for her aunt, said it was the best cake she had ever had and she will surely tell everyone about my bakery.\n\nEdit: I don't see exactly where the weight confusion is coming from, but basically, I have two standard sizes for my cakes which are 500 gms and 1 kg, because we use the metric system. Because of the American influence though, people have become used to cakes being either 1lb or 2lb in weight but don't often know the difference between the two. They just assume that 1lb = half a kg and 2 lb = 1 kg.\n\nEdit2: TIL America doesn't sell cakes by weight lol. It's the standard practice over here that the rates are fixed by weight. Also, the cake in question here was not a traditional cake, so there was no way she wanted a pound cake.\n\nLast edit: I'm a bit overwhelmed by the comments and I can barely keep track of them. The cake was a tart cake - it's layers of shortbread cookie and chocolate ganache. I've uploaded a picture of it as a post on r/baking\n\nActual final edit: the amount of positive feedback I've received through this post is crazy. I've had a very difficult few days and some of you were so nice to me, a complete stranger on the internet, and it made me a little emotional. If I received this much attention on my Instagram, I could probably become a full fledged food blogger lol. One thing I want to address because so many people started messaging me about it - I use gms for grams because it was drilled into us in school to not use g but gms. 'g' was apparently the symbol for something else (I don't even remember what) but we've had marks deducted from exams for not using gms, so I stick with that.",

When I was asked why, my brother (who was in the office with us) said that he had to wait until Grandmother got off her phone call to tell her. \n\nMy grandmother had to explain to them what was going on. I do remember a social worker ushering them out of the room and asking some questions. After that, both grandmother and mother explained to us that if it\u2019s an emergency, we need to tell them right away.",

            "I\u2019ve mentioned this before. Teach your kids when it\u2019s ok to be loud and  interrupt and scream, before you wind up in situations like these. \n\nA little girl I babysat was stuck in a play thing for who knows how long. She was always quiet and sweet but one day it had been a little too long so I went looking for her. I found her stuck and crying. I asked her why she didn\u2019t tell me and she said she didn\u2019t want to interrupt me. I told her that when she\u2019s hurt she\u2019s allowed to interrupt or even scream, but she didn\u2019t believe me. I told her even if she\u2019s just really scared and needs help she can scream or be rude or interrupt. \n\nI could tell she wasn\u2019t going to accept this from me so I had a talk with her dad when he picked her up. \n\nPlease teach your kids that sometimes it\u2019s ok to yell, scream, be rude, or not listen to adults.",

            "I don't remember how old I was, somewhere around 6 or 7. My teacher had a rule about waiting our turn to ask questions. I was standing by her desk waiting my turn. I wasn't feeling well.

            "My first grade teacher learned to let me interrupt sometimes when I threw up on her. It was lunchtime and she was talking with another teacher. I waited patiently next to her and she ignored me. I tapped her on the arm and she more pointedly ignored me. It wasn't until the other teacher saw me heaving into my mouth (which was already full of puke) and mentioned that my teacher may want to take care of me that she looked at me and asked me what was wrong. I couldn't open my mouth (due to the puke) so I tried pointing. When that didn't work, I just let it out.\n\nActually, my second grade teacher learned the same thing when I raised my hand during math corner but she wasn't taking questions just then and ignored me. I just turned to the side and threw up on the carpet. Then I was told that I could get up and go to the trash can if I felt sick without asking for permission.",
            "I was in the backyard.  I literally chopped off my big toe.  Blood was spurting everywhere like a  blood fountain.    I screamed for my mother telling her I chopped off my toe, without looking out the window she yelled back, I'm busy come here & let me have a look.   So I hopped into the house, blood going everywhere.  All over the carpet, all up the wall as I hopped up to her bedroom where she was folding laundry.    After she saw the mess I was in she told me to go sit with my foot in the bath while she called my father.  So I sat bleeding in the bath until my father got back home from a friends down the road.   He put on the tourniquet & took me to hospital.   Apparently the blood in the bath set like jelly an inch thick she had to clean out  & she never quite got the blood stains out the carpet.",
            "I think many of us have been in this sort of situation with our parents. It\u2019s an understandable response when your child is constantly interrupting to establish boundaries for them. Then the nuance is teaching them when to cross that boundary.\n\n I had a sports practice where I injured my hand and went to get my mom from the car for assistance. I kept playing and took a ball to the face. When I tapped on the window of the car to get her attention she was reading and gave me the one moment signal and finished her paragraph. When she looked up in my face was covered in blood she screamed and felt terrible but it was kind of funny.",

            "A similar story happened to my brother.  When my older brother was a pre-schooler, he would do typical little kid things, like avoid bedtime by asking for water, bathroom, etc.  Finally, one night my dad got so fed up with it that, after the final interruption, he put my brother to bed and told him to stay there until morning, **period**. (My dad's not the yelling type, so when he gets frustrated, we listen.)  \n\n\nLater that night, my parents heard my brother whimpering from his room. They went in to check on him and found his bedroom *filled* with smoke- the old chimney that ran through the corner of the room was working properly anymore. My dad felt ***terrible*** for scaring brother so badly that he wouldn't come and get them.   \n\n\nFrom then on, my dad (and later my brother, to his kids) would tell us to stay in bed until morning, unless there's a fire.",

            "Crying and interrupting were not really okay in my household so I learned to repress that. At daycare I broke my arm and calmly, without crying, told one of the workers there my arm was hurt. I didn\u2019t SEEM to hurt so she brushed it off. My stepfather did the same when he picked me up. It wasn\u2019t until my mom got home from work at around 10pm that someone actually looked at my arm and took me to the ER and I finally cried because I realized that I wouldn\u2019t get yelled at... Parents who prioritize their convenience over their child is absolutely mind boggling to me now that I\u2019m an adult and put myself in their shoes, but as a kid I thought that was normal.",

            "My Dad and I were at a independent league baseball game when I was little. Out by the cheap seats was a large grass area you could let kids roam free in. I got my foot trapped under the fence and for about 3 innings I sat there, stuck watching the game. \n\nI don't think I had a fear of screaming or causing a fuss, I was just chilling. It was after sitting for so long that my Dad finally got out of his seat to figure out why I decided to chill by the fence. He of course, got my foot unstuck.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading my little story. :)",
            "Worked with children for 15+ years. A few of my rules were: don't break your face, your parents (guardian, aunt, uncle, grandparent...)like it. No screaming unless you are hurt, someone else is actually hurt or someone is trying to take you or someone else. There's almost always an exception to a rule, and kids don't always get that.",
            "What's with falling out of trees at grandma's house?\n\nI did the same, and at 44, still have a scar behind one of my ears, from the stitches needed. I didn't break anything, but a branch put a big hole in my head. Luckily I've never needed to use it much.",
            "My mum had a similar rule but remembered to include the clarifier \"unless there's a fire\"\n\nWhen I was ~5 she was making mine and my sisters' lunch boxes for school, she had a habit of making them on the stove, which at the time was a gas stove(is now induction). My dad had a habit of leaving the stove on when he left for work.\n\nShe put my sister's lunchbox on the stove when the phone rang(can't remember who it was or what they talked about). So she looked away to answer the call. While she was on the phone not looking at the lunchbox it caught on fire. We were trying to get her attention, unable to get any closer because we had a rule not to \"cross the imaginary line\" and get too close to the stove(because 3 kids getting in the way while you're cooking would be really annoying and dangerous).\n\nShe remained completely oblivious, saying not to interrupt her unless there was a fire. Until one of us(I think it was me but might be misremembering) said \"Mum! There's a fire\"\n\nAt this point she freaked out and said everyone stay calm everyone stay calm. Told us to go into the garden. We did so calmly because we were too young to really get how serious it was and we'd had fire alarm training from school at this point. She managed to turn off the stove and put out the fire(I think wet tea-towel but I don't know).\n\nSo it's important to have an exception and to actually believe them when the exception is used.\n\n*All quotes are paraphrased.",

            "The only conditions under which I was ever to interrupt my mom on the phone were if I was \u201cbleeding, dying, or the dogs ran away\u201d... so if I broke my arm I guess I\u2019d have been waitin too lol",

Well, im hooked up to about 50 (in my kindergarten mind, really probably 3) ivs, heart monitors, etc, so my range of walking was woefully small and boring.

            "I have a somewhat similar story. When my siblings and I were younger, the sliding back door was really hard for us kids to close all the way so our parents made a rule that we were never to open it. NOTE: I have no memory of this event from happening \n\nAnyway, we had a tree house in our backyard and one day my brother (3 or 4yrs at the time)was playing with a friend up there and she purposely pushed him down to the ground. My brother started crying and she left our yard to ride her bike up and down our street. My brother managed to pull himself up and walked to the sliding back door. I (7 or 8yrs) was on the other side of the door and my brother began knocking to be let in. But.... rules are rules so I gestured for him to go through the front door. Turns out that his arm was badly broken and he needed to be in a cast for a few weeks, which was hard because it was his dominant arm that broke. \nThis happened over 15 years ago and my family still tease me for not opening the back door",

            "I have telephone rules. I just cant stand it at all when Im trying to talk to someone on the phone, and they are having side conversations with everyone else in the room, when their being interrupted by their kids every two seconds, stopping to talk to the dog, everyone being so loud in the background I cant hear a word theyre saying, all that.  Its not just kids, grown adults dont show manners when someone is on the phone, nearly all my friends that have and SO get interrupted by side conversations. I just tell them I'll talk to them when they're free and excuse myself.\n\nNow, the, \"unless its an emergency\" thing wasn't my method. Cause I felt like that was a lot to expect a kid to understand what an emergency was.  Like in all the wisdom of a 3yo, not being able to find the red crayon so that she can finish her drawing may well be in her mind an emergency.  From my perspective, I didnt expect her to be able to make the decision of a good and not good reason to interrupt me whether on the phone, or when in discussion or when I was busy doing something or whatever.\n\nSo, I taught her it was impolite to interrupt AND we sat down and came up with ideas of how she can still communicate with me.  She came up with the idea herself to draw a picture  (since she couldnt write yet) and it also served as great writing practice when she did start learning how to write. But yeah, Id be on the phone and she would slip me a piece of paper with a picture or note on it, Id check it out and either make a motion that it can wait, or if it was something I could handle while on the phone Id go ahead and do it, such as help find that really important crayon she needs.  Shes in her 20s now, and I still have some of the notes she drew and wrote to me, one of them when she felt it was very, very important to tell me she loved me lol\n\nBut yeah, just cause its impolite to interrupt, doesnt mean shes completely unimportant to me when Im on the phone or whatever, I made it clear her needs still mattered and that I would be there for her if she needs me.",

            "Actually although the plastic from plastic straws is technically recyclable, a lot of times straws are too lightweight for the sorting machine and end up getting disposed of in the trash\n\nhttps://www.mydisposal.com/plastic-straws",
            "So how many McDonald's straws are actually recycled?  Cause I've never seen a recycling bin for them here in the US.  There is a difference between \"can be\" and \"are\" recycled.  Especially since, even if they are put in recycling, the sorting machines don't really catch them\n\nAt least the paper straws have a secondary use (over using fossil fuels, which is a good thing), don't kill marine life, or go away in the landfill.",
            "Let's be real. No one takes their straw from the cup and recycles it in the bin for bottles.\n\nAnd I promise you no employee sorts out the two straws that do end up there for recycling.",
            "Not that I\u2019m defending McDonald\u2019s, but you don\u2019t have the entire story there. The straws may be recyclable but they aren\u2019t made from recycled material. By not buying millions of straws a year demand will drop and fewer will be made.\n\nWhatever the straws are used in when they get recycled will have a small carbon footprint but those straws themselves are far from free.",
            "This article is purposely misleading with out of context but technically correct facts, which ignores the reality that plastic straws are recyclable but are almost NEVER recycled because they are simply put into garbage at restaurants with non recyclable material, and the fact they are so small that more than half of them dont even get picked up by the sorting machines should they even get recycled. \n\nPaper straws will biodegrade at a reasonable rate and are also so small that the idea that UK landfills can't take them is absurd, and the CO2 release from burning is less than from burning plastic. Which often also releases toxic fumes depending on what plastic you burn. The CO2 from burning these types of papers will be around the same that will be absorbed by trees so there is still a net decrease in the carbon footprint.",
            "Why not try to reduce the use of straws in the first place?",
            "This will probably get lost in the sea of comment but after working in McDonald\u2019s for 4 years I can tell you the paper is better. No doubt about it. \n\nThe recycling bins you see on the dining area almost always have to go in general waste. Not because of lazy employees but because it was always contaminated with general waste so the recycle would never get taken.  And no crew member is going to go through all the bins to sort it out. \n\nThe paper straws have greatly reduced the amount of contamination, therefore more recycling gets recycled and less straws go in the sea. \n\nI don\u2019t understand why everyone has an issue with these paper straws, yes they get ruined in your \u00a32 milkshake but just ask for an extra one. They biodegrade anyway.",
            "Since when does McDonald's have recycling bins? Those straws get tossed out with the garbage. Recyclable or not. I've never seen anyone take the plastic straws home from McDonald's just so that they can recycle them.",
            ">non-recyclable material that is burned to produce hundreds of millions of tonnes of CO2 every year, speeding up global heating and intensifying the climate crisis.\n\nIf the straws are made from trees that aren't replanted, I suppose. But if they're made from managed forests, then they're carbon neutral.",
            "Kinda completely missing the entire point of the paper straws here. Yes, the previous plastic bottles *can* be recycled. The problem was that the vast majority weren\u2019t (when have you ever got a McDonald\u2019s drink and not put the straw straight into the landfill bin?). This meant that a lot of plastic straws ended up in the ocean, causing severe damage to marine habitats.\n\nOn the other hand, the paper straws are so biodegradable that they usually disintegrate before you even finish your drink. This means that when you inevitably put it in the landfill like every other time you\u2019ve ever disposed of a straw, it will not have any negative environmental impact. \n\nBiodegradable is better than recyclable in this case (technically plastic carrier bags can be reused and recycled, but the majority don\u2019t, it\u2019s much better to have either reusable products like metal straws and canvas bags, or biodegradable products like paper straws and biodegradable food waste bags).\n\nI *hate* using the paper straws, particularly for the aforementioned disintegration, but they *are* far more environmentally friendly.",
            "I hate paper straws, they\u2019re trash and make drinking beverages an unpleasant experience.",
            "I think the straw issue is less about recycling them, and more about harm to wildlife from ingestion, etc.  I'm sure we've all seen those videos of sea turtles with a straw stuck up their nose, but I find it hard to believe a paper straw would pose the same problem, because it wouldn't hold its structural integrity when wet for that long.\n\nI figure the solution here is to compost the straws, rather than try to recycle them.",
            "Nice, but I noticed how you escalated from hundreds of millions of straws to hundreds of millions of tons of CO2\n\nLike what. Each straw produces one ton of CO2?",
            "If they are paper based and would rot, they would release their carbon anyway. Getting the energy out is a bonus.",
            "Paper is composed of \"short cycle\" carbon. Paper straws are made from trees which absorb CO2 as they grow and then they are harvested and new trees are panted to make more straws, long term this cycle is carbon neutral, possibly even carbon negative.\n\nPlastic straws are made of deep cycle carbon. They are made from carbon that has been sequestered deep in the earth for millions and millions of years. This adds carbon to our existing ecosystem. So, as much as it will pain the smug, anti-environment reader, paper straws are better than plastic straws, even if they are burned.",
            "Local coffee shops around here (USA) use biodegradable straws. They feel like plastic, but they decompose naturally because they're made from plants. I don't see why everyone can't just switch to those.",
            "Do you actually think that McDonald's was recycling the plastic straws?",
            "I don\u2019t think you 7nderstand carbon emissions.\n\nFossil carbon<> burning paper",
            "Ty e thing with paper and wood and burning it is it's actually (ETA: relatively) carbon neutral. It's absorbs as much in its life time as it produces when it's burned.\n\nSo if they get used to burn to then create power instead of oil, coal or gas it actually is a carbon neutral heya source to produce cleaner energy.\n\n(Whereas the fossil fuels use carbon that has been essentially removed from the atmosphere for hindreds of thousands of millennia so is carbon positive)",
            "This has nothing to do with this sub at all",
            "Aren't paper straws still preferable for their biodegradability? That seems to me to be just as important as recyclibility in reducing environmental pollutants.",
            "God, as someone who is deep into environmental activism, I am so so so sick of the \"stop using plastic straws\" thing. It doesn't actually matter. Individuals cannot come close to creating the amount of pollution and toxic waste in a YEAR that Fortune 500 companies spew every DAY. And regardless of that small fact, I'm disabled and literally cannot lift cups to drink from them. I require a straw. Not to mention the hundreds of variables leading to the necessity of single use plastic straws for disabled people everywhere. \n\nTL;DR I'm fucking over it lmao stop harassing people for using single use plastic straws.",
            "Super stupid take.\n\nThe paper straws are made from renewable sources, thus when burned they create a net zero emission.\n\nThe plastic straws are made from non-renewable sources.",
            ">Go from a 100% recyclable material with negligible carbon footprint to a non-recyclable material that is burned to produce hundreds of millions of tonnes of CO2 every year\n\nSo I did some quick maths and the total weight of the straws used in one year in the UK is less than 400 tonnes, and that's just the weight of the straws themselves. That's a pretty damn far cry from hundreds of millions of tonnes of CO2.\n\nAlso recycling plastic will reduce the carbon footprint from the new production but only by 30-70%, I would hardly call the remainder negligible even though it may be much much smaller.\n\nLastly burning paper is generally carbon neutral because, unlike plastics, it's made from non fossil materials and thus they only release an amount of carbon equal to what the trees previously absorbed themselves.",
            "Yea but the paper comes from trees.  I thought burning wood and paper was effectively carbon neutral?",
            "To be fair paper sourced from trees only releases carbon trapped in the last 80 years or so, not the last 100 million, so its more or less a biofuel",
            "Hundreds of millions of straws result in hundreds of millions of tons of CO2?  The fuck kind of straws y\u2019all using over there!?",
            "Plastic recycling isn't reliable, particularly when it comes to small or light plastics. The bulk of such materials ends up into grains, which get carried by the water cycle into marine biomes or the soil, and get absorbed by organisms.\n\nCarbon pollution on that scale is a lot less damaging than plastic pollution. The reason being that burning paper produces zero **net** carbon emissions. That carbon was already in the atmosphere (part of the active carbon cycle), then got pulled into a plant, which got made into paper, which gets burned to release that carbon back. The problem with carbon emissions is when we burn fossil fuels, because we are releasing carbon that was trapped millions of years ago. Burning fossil fuels means we are reversing the atmosphere to a state it was millions of years ago, when carbon dioxide was a lot more in the atmosphere. Burning paper means we are reversing the atmosphere to the state it already is today.",

Wood is carbon neutral, because it captures existing CO2 from the air to grow. Turning it into paper *might* release carbon into the air depending on how you power it, but I'd be willing to bet it's less than turning oil into plastic (which is likely to use the most convenient fuel source - the oil they already have on hand - to produce).",

            "Does anybody want me to go in depth about this and ruin the fun? No, but I will anyway.\nTLDR: paper straws are better in every way than plastic ones\nPreviously, the straws were pretty much never recycled, instead, they were thrown into the bin. The sorting machines wouldn't ever separate the plastic out because the straws are too skinny and light to be picked up.\nNow, the straws are paper. The main ingredient in paper is wood, which is from a tree. A tree's mass is almost entirely from carbon dioxide harvested from the air, therefore when you burn the paper, there is no net increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, in fact there will be slight net negative because the wood chips could be from waste of another wood use, like furniture. \nAlso, the straws biodegrade. This means that in the event they are littered, and end up in the ocean, they don't contribute to the  ocean plastic crisis.\nFinally, in landfill, they degrade into soil, releasing a tiny bit of methane or CO2 (not much, it's natural, like leaves on a forest floor)",

They cannot be reliably recycled because the polymer will just break down. Use bamboo. Better yet, just don\u2019t use a straw.

            "Not really how it works\n\nA. Most if not nearly all straws aren't recycled, so this entire basis is moot. How many recycling bins do you remember seeing in a McDonald's?\n\nB. Burning paper is different from burning, for example, coal. Paper contains carbon that a tree took out of the atmosphere during its life. Re-releasing it is overall a net zero to the atmosphere. Net negative if it was planted for this purpose of straws.\n\nC. Burning paper in a power plant provides power. Once again, this is neutral to even positive. Burning centered power plants aren't inherently evil; the problem is coal. Burning coal releases giant carbon stores that used to be buried underground, letting them into our atmosphere. Paper is not that, as explained.\n\nD. I find it hard to believe landfills \"refuse to take them\". For not having space? But the fry containers and soda cups, twenty times bigger, are fine? It was probably decided to do this because it provides usable power as opposed to natural decomposition.\n\nE. The main issue with plastic straws is not climate change. It's that when they're littered they will never degrade, and pile up and can even harm wildlife. Paper straws fix this.",

            "No. The plastic straws are not better for climate change. This post is wrong. \n\nPaper straws are carbon neutral. Trees suck co2 out of the air, creating a net reduction in co2. If they're then burned they release that co2 back into the atmosphere creating a net zero increase (excluding manufacturing and transport emissions, but that'll be about the same for plastic and paper).\n\nPlastic straws use oil dug up from the earth bringing carbon that was nicely sequestered up and out. These straws may be recycled the first time or even the first hundred times, but ultimately they will either be burned or end up in landfill. If they're burned that's a net increase in co2 in the atmosphere. \n\nI completely support making the paper straws recyclable, but I think it's very important to not encourage people to use unnecessary carbon.

            ">Net result: Go from a 100% recyclable material with negligible carbon footprint to a non-recyclable material that is burned to produce hundreds of millions of tonnes of CO2 every year, speeding up global heating and intensifying the climate crisis.\n\nThat's not how this works.\n\nPlastics are most commonly made from oil.  Oil that *was* plants a very, very long time ago, but whose carbon hasn't been in the atmosphere since before protohumans were even protohumans.  So any carbon that makes it from the oil to the air at any point in that plastic-making process is \n\n>speeding up global heating and intensifying the climate crisis.\n\nBioplastics, like from corn starch or something, would be a different story - but do require more energy than paper production typically does.\n\nPaper, on the other hand, is made from trees.

The cost of the car was more than the plane ticket would have been, and reduced my time that I could be at the site by three days. He had to pay me travel expenses, gas and insurance. A flight might have cost $200, but the car cost $800. He was fine with this. \n\nWhat he wasn't fine with was me going to dollar tree and trying to expense a pair of nail clippers I bought while out of the state. Literally refused to sign my expense report until I itemized all $12 of the things I bought  and explained how they were all travel/work related.",
            "$35/day is ridiculous. Sometimes I spend more than that for a meal. And I get reimbursed.",
            "I worked a year in a different country with 2 colleagues. It was a gruesome project that was late when we started to work on it. The customer agreed to pay overtime, but there was a fixed amount for food (breakfast, lunch, dinner). After the first month, HR was being difficult about our expenses (but happy about all the overtime). We had a short meeting with HR, Sales and our manager. Look, we said, we can be simple and just work 9 hours per day and keep to the allowed expenses, or you let us work whatever we feel like (often 60 hours per week) and not bother expenses. The manager did a quick calculation, found that even if we got dinner in a 3 Michelin star restaurant every day he would still make a profit and gave his approval. HR mumbled something about precedences but gave up.\n\nThe weird thing is that you get tired of fancy restaurants really fast and just want homemade food. Fortunately there was a little mom & pop restaurant just around the corner that just provided that. We became good friends.",

            "I was very very fortunate to work for a Fortune 500 company, with a great system for travel expenses.   My AmEx card automatically populated into our expense report system, and we were told to use it for everything possible.\n\nI didn't need receipts for anything under $25 (I believe the amount is larger now.)   Rarely did I get asked for a receipt for anything except a hotel and car rental.   NOT ONCE did anyone ever question my flight scheduling, hotel arrangements, room service, food expenses, NOTHING.    \n\nNow I also didn't drink, party, or do anything overly expensive, maybe that was part of it.    But it made work travel much more bearable.",
            "I WFH and used to get reimbursed for phone and internet. Then it became only $50 reimbursement for each. Then $25. \n\nThen they made the system very hard to navigate and rejected requests without a line item receipt attached. But the system had a hard time accepting the attachments and wouldn\u2019t let you know when it had failed. Also the request had to be accepted within the week of submittal, so if you didn\u2019t know the attachment had failed, you were out of luck.\n\nYou\u2019d get one of those annoying emails saying click here to see what went wrong and the link would be broken. \n\nBut if the company is paying the same amount regardless of the charges, and if I obviously always have phone and internet, what\u2019s the need for line item receipts? I had so many requests rejected I stopped sending them in. Which is probably what they want. This is a giant multi-billion dollar corporation that you\u2019ve heard of.",
            "this is the dumbest shoot your self in the foot rule I have seen a company impose on its self in a while, like why doe sit matter what time you take your meals? this sounds like either a way to control an employee on a level that is just unnecessary or to provide a reasoning to decline meals arbitrarily.",

I rarely eat out because of this, but if I\u2019m required to travel I damn well better be able to expense my meals for more than $35!

I have always had to submit receipts at other companies I\u2019ve worked for, so I asked why it\u2019s this way. The answer was that everyone has to eat, and it doesn\u2019t make sense to pay someone to do all that work to maybe save a couple dollars here and there. \n\nI just submit that I travelled for work and do $50 times however many days I was travelling, and it gets approved. Sometimes I just bring a cooler with me, when I don\u2019t have to fly, and bring my own food. I\u2019m still allowed to claim the $50/day even when I bring my own food.",
            "That policy would be fun if you ever got to travel to Spain. Restaurants aren't even open for dinner before 19:30 - 20:00. In my neighborhood most kitchens open at 20:00 which means you can order around 20:30 and eat by 21:00.",

Anytime we went to training it was $100 a day.   This was for all employees.   No restrictions on when I could eat, or how many meals I could eat.  Just had to expense report everything.  Of course alcohol is not covered.",

            "I have a friend who was a travel contractor and lives in hotels weeks at a time. On one trip he was in the middle of nowhere and the only places near enough to eat were a shitty McDonald\u2019s and a pricey seafood restaurant and market. He asked if he could use his meal allowance to just get some groceries and cook for himself in the hotel but couldn\u2019t get it approved. So he started going to the seafood place and ordering the most expensive things (app, entree, extra sides, dessert, bottle of wine- full spread every time, every meal. After about 3 days and a couple grand they approved his groceries lol.",
            "I worked for a company and our contract stated that we were entitled to an overtime meal after 2 hours of overtime. My normal end of day was 1630. On this day I left the customer site and ordered a pizza for pick up on the way home. The receipt was time stamped at 1828,  my dick boss gave me shit about it. Thing is I still had 30 minutes of BS paper work to do that day so worked until 1900.\n\n3 months later I changed departments,  and found a different manager.",

            "People who make these policies are ridiculous. My company went from \"be reasonable with your meal purchases\" to you have $60 per day. $20 per meal. No exceptions. When I travel, I usually book a kitchenette and buy groceries. Two weeks away - $840 or $200 on groceries. The approving manager had a fit that I spent $200 at one time. No problem. Guess who decided to eat out every meal after that?",
            "I worked somewhere as a temp employee. We got the $69 per day. My agency just required receipts. The other agency that staffed this business would total up your amount and if you didn\u2019t spend the full $69, they would take money out of your paycheck up to the amount you didn\u2019t spend. So people were getting steak dinners, hibachi, going to five star restaurants to avoid getting their pay cut. It\u2019s a lot of money to spend in a day and I couldn\u2019t do it. I think my max was $50 one day and that\u2019s because I got food for the next day too.",
            "I've worked for a couple companies (both did lots of gov't contracts) that found it cheaper/easier to just pay the full government per diem when employees travelled. No need to keep/scan all your meal receipts and then have someone from finance review/approve them all. \n\nThe extra $50 it overpayment it might've cost per trip was easily made up by better morale and not wasting extra time fumbling thru receipts/approvals.",
            "When I took over the company, one of the first things I did was change the travel policy to a per diem model.  The old policy allowed $7 per meal at normal meal times designated by average restaurants (breakfast 6am-10:30am, lunch 10:30am-4pm, dinner 4pm-12am).  Hotel stays that had continental breakfasts did not count toward that meal, so a person could technically have two breakfasts and still be able to claim it.  Hotel allowance was only $80 at the time.  Now, we just go by federal allowances.",

        "selftext": "So this happened a number of years ago when I was in college  studying preschool education.\n\nA new daycare had recently opened in our town and it already had a bit of an unsavoury reputation. For some reason they had gotten my name from one of my professors as a potential supply teacher (whatever but ok! )\n\nCue a call from them at 6.30 am on the hottest day of summer. I kid you not it had to be 30c at 7 am and the temp was still rising!  The director was in a twist needing a supply for a few days and promised to pay me 10$ an hour if I came in to pinch hit.  What college student doesn't need money haha so I agreed and headed on over.\n\nI got there about 8 am and the place was disgusting!  Dirty floors, filthy walls, broken toys. It looked like the school from the movie Matilda! I barely had time to take in the nastyness around me when I heard a woman SCREAMING in the kitchen - EAT Damn you! - and the sound of a very young baby wailing.\n\nI scooted to the kitchen as was met with absolute..filth. dirty dishes piled on the counter. Crusted pots filled with ...something.....in the sink....and flies. Oh the flies!  Sadly that wasn't the worst of it because sitting in a battered highchair was a crying baby with an enraged adult (teacher i assume) trying to force a spoonful of oatmeal into his tiny mouth.\n\nMe - what are you doing!\n\nTeacher - little brat wont eat!  EAT DAMN YOU!\n\nI shoved her aside , got him calmed down, and gave him his cereal .\n\nCue ticked off teacher who was apparently offended that a stupid SUPPLY knew how to get a baby to eat! (gasp!)\n\nAs I was finishing up with Jr, the director came into the kitchen and announced my \\*koff\\* class for the day would be the school age kids. Upstairs.\n\nI made my way up the stairs and the heat met me about halfway to the top. It. was. a . sauna! Easily 45c up there!\n\nDirector- Oh ya the AC broke 3 weeks ago we haven't gotten it fixed yet.\n\nI looked around at the 3 almost bare rooms on the upper floor. In one was a tv with a video game console and 2 controllers.  In another was some old board games and the third had a shelf with some battered books on it. With this, I was expected to entertain 15 children for the next 8 hours.\n\nFast forward to early afternoon. I have opened every window and the door to the fire escape hoping to get some cross breeze going. The kids are hot and bored. Thank goodness they each brought their own lunch because no way was I going to feed them whatever came crawling out of that kitchen!\n\nI had asked the director if the kids and I might go down to the back yard where there was shade and was told firmly NO, we had to stay upstairs in the inferno the entire day! (cue malicious compliance . DUN DUN DUN!)\n\nI was sitting out on the fire escape with several of the kids, playing a game when a very smartly dressed woman walked out and introduced herself as Mrs (blah) from Social Services! Did I have a few moments to talk to her?\n\nOhh did I have a few moments? Come! Pull up a milk crate! Lets chat shall we!  I told. her . everything! The dirt, the flies, the teacher screaming at the baby, the broken AC and refusal of letting the kids go downstairs to try to prevent heat stroke! And the cream on the cake... I HAD NOT YET GOTTEN MY DEGREE in preschool teaching! I was an unlicensed, unsupervised college student in charge of 15 kids!\n\nApparently the staff had refused to talk to her at all so she and I had a lovely conversation for the next half hour and it didn't take the kids long to realize this was their chance for their own bit of revenge as they pipped up with their own stories and complaints!\n\nThe daycare was shut down the next day.\n\nI was never paid but honestly just getting them closed down was payment enough for me!\n\nEdit - THANK YOU for the gold and silver awards and OH MY GOSH and Platinums! THANK YOU!",

I feel like they should be investigated too, surely you can\u2019t be that blind? I\u2019m so confused",
            "This brings back memories. I have a family member with a degree in Early Childhood Developement who ran a licensed in-home daycare for almost 30 years. The children she cared for were literally raised alongside (and treated like) her own children. Even years later, as adults, her kids are still very close to the grown daycare kids and their parents, like extended family. Anyways, at one point another local daycare (that my family member was in no way associated with or had even heard of) got shut down by licensing. Suddenly parents were coming out of the woodwork, looking for new childcare for their kids. Because she had a couple spaces open, she started interviewing the families and the stories were horrifying. Those parents always dropped kids off and picked them up in a SPOTLESS front room of the daycare, filled with fun colorful toys that were so well-maintained they looked new... because the kids never touched them. After the investigation that shut that other daycare down, the parents were told the horrifying truth: that their kids were essentially kept in cages (cribs with lids) and left to scream all day alone in a dark filthy back room. Then they were changed, cleaned up and brought into that fancy front room again right before parent pickup time. The parents didn't know each other and never spoke, so nobody made the connection that ALL of their children were being checked for various developmental delays. It was rumored that their pediatrician made the possible connection (small town, so all had the same doctor) and called CPS. One of the children my family member accepted who had been a victim of that other daycare's abuse and neglect was a 3-year-old boy whose single parent worked two jobs so he even spent weekends at that horrible place. He was almost completely non-verbal and still crawled. Within months in a healthy environment, he was walking, running and learning to communicate (the kids all learned sign language with him because his verbal skills never fully developed). It was the first time his poor mom realized there hadn't ever been anything wrong with her child. Bad childcare environments can have devastating effects. Hopefully the kids from the one you got shut down are in much better places now and have a better chance at a healthy environment with real interaction.",

We were not allowed to let the children outside due to the risk of sunstroke on such a hot day, but the inside was *not air conditioned.*\n\nWe, too, had a lady in a suit show up near the end of the day to chat with us. Sadly, however, she was from management at the camp and came to yell at us because the 45 children were not all playing *together* (we had split them into groups to do some extremely inactive activities so they wouldn't overheat running around), and apparently this was a big deal for... reasons.\n\nFuck that camp.",
