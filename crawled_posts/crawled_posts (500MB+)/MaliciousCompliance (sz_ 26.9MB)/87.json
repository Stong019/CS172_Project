        "selftext": "Originally posted on r/IDontWorkHereLady  \nSomeone suggested you guys might enjoy it too :)\n\nHey everyone, got a short but sweet little story for you from the other day.\n\nSo I was shopping in my city and went into a \"small business\" store there, that I like to get my dice and tabletop games at. I frequent this store pretty often and have become aquainted with the owner. We chat during my visits and as I am one of those \"I put the items back on the shelve after I am done looking at them\" type of person, it is understandable that this lady might have confused me with an employee.\n\nQuick info, the owner only has one employee, who wasn't in that day, and the store isn't too big, easyly managable for one person alone, no uniform, just nametags.\n\nFollowing conversation ensues.\n\nLady: I am looking for \"game\" (don't remember exactly)\n\nMe: Don't think they have it here, but- (Lady cuts me off)\n\nLady: Then where can I get it?!\n\nMe: Sorry, I don't know but-\n\nLady: HOW CAN YOU NOT KNOW?! DO YOUR JOB AND TELL ME!\n\nOwner: (joins us due to the commotion) Sorry, is there a problem?\n\nLady: Are you the manager?! Your employee here refuses to tell me where I can find \"game\". You should fire them!\n\nOwner: (Looks at me, smirks, best customer care voice) OP, you are hired.\n\nLady: (confused)\n\nMe: (Catching on) Oh, cool thanks.\n\nOwner: You refused to help this lady?\n\nMe: Sure did.\n\nOwner: Your fired.\n\nMe: Ah, dang...\n\nOwner: (to the Lady) Now what did you need again?\n\nNever seen someone look that much like a fish and than huff and puff out of a store.Honestly one of the best encounters of my life.\n\nThanks for reading, hope you enjoyed :)",

So our new neighbour below us knocked on our door and screamed at us around midday, and told us to read the part of our contract about the \"quiet period.\" So I did, and Sundays aren't mentioned. 10pm to 7am every day of the week. Nowhere does it state that Sundays are any different. So we carried on.\n\nHe has called the police on us several times for just doing normal things such as rearranging furniture. Each time, he would lie to the police that he had come to speak to us about it first, which he had not. The reasons included things like \"dropping things too often\" to \"using the stairs at night.\" These reasons are of course ridiculous, but each time I have just shown them the contract which all residents sign. If he has signed the contract, he consents to me making noise during these periods.\n\nWe complained to the letting agency that he was harassing us for simply making the normal amount of noise people make from living in an apartment. However, nothing changed.\n\nI checked with our other neighbours to see if they had any complaints about our noise level, and they all said no.\n\nAfter he called the police several times, I decided to begin malicious compliance. I went down to the neighbour with a copy of the house rules, which we have all signed, and told him to please read them, specifically, the exact times which are the \"quiet period.\" Then for the next week or so, any hammering, drilling or other loud things I had to do, I saved for 9:50pm. Even if I didn't have anything I needed to do, I made sure to make noise right up until 10pm. After I did this for about a week, we stopped hearing from him, and haven't had any noise complaints since, and it's been several months now.\n\nNow, a couple of heavy metal fans have moved into the apartment next to him and I couldn't be happier.\n\nEDIT: To clear up confusion:\n\n1. The neighbor appeared to believe that the whole of Sunday was \"quiet time.\" I checked, and there is no extra provision in the house rules about Sundays. The quiet times just apply \"daily.\" I was unpacking on a Sunday and the neighbor apparently believed this was against the house rules. It is not.\n2. The big metal fans are big fans of metal music.

There was one day an ambulance was called for a neighbor in the building across the road. This lady went out and bitched they had woken the baby. Kids playing outside? Went out to yell at the kids. It was ridiculous. All we can figure is this lady was trying to keep the place dead silent 24/7 and was upset if any noise came into her completely silent home which is going to happen in apartments or even in a house. She was insane. At one point she came up and yelled at my disabled daughter who has PTSD on top of other disabilities. I called the apartment office and told them if she EVER said a word to my daughter again I was going to raise some serious hell. She stopped coming to our door after that and just complained to the apartment manager who also felt she was being ridiculous.",

            "Had a downstairs neighbor move in and (without the *required* 180 day notice) began doing all kinds of reno-work at odd hours. His excuse *every fucking time* we filed a formal complaint? \"i DiDn'T kNoW iT wAs ThAt LoUd.\"\n\nIt got so bad that at one point while he was literally hammering on his ceiling/my floor for a solid 4 hours, I got frustrated and stomped my feet a few times. I *immediately* got a doorbell ring and a bunch of questions about \"all the noise\", to which I responded that I could ask him the same damn thing. Our less than friendly back and forth continued for a bit until he tried to play the \"I work for management\" card, to which I informed him that I personally know the landlord, so what good did that do? Didn't seem to like that statement, so he threatened me with \"if the noise continues, we'll exchange more than words\".\n\nI immediately asked him what he meant by that and when he played dumb, I suggested that what he just did was insinuate a threat of physical violence. He turned rather pale and scurried off and I wrote a scathing formal complaint that very night. To my knowledge, management (of which I then knew were his employer) apparently ripped him a few new ones and informed us that not only would the reno-noise be kept to an absolute minimum, but that we would not have to talk with him at all going forward (got all of this in writing btw).\n\nThe *only* reason I didn't file a police report (if only to have it on record) was because the management handled it the next day and it seemed the issue had been resolved. Even now though, I do what I can to avoid him because he's about two more tooth gaps away from having (ex)methhead bingo.",

Also reminds me of a thing I did in college.\n\nLived in a party dorm (accidentally) and had jerks all around me who would do stuff like blast Sweet Caroline at 3am evening nights sheet getting back from the bars. They never listened to me when I asked them to stop and I didn't go to the RA because I'm not a jerk (plus, would have just made it worse).\n\nSo I became a metal fan. Figured it was the opposite of the type of music they liked. So I'd blast it middle of the day when they were trying to study. First time they asked me to turn it down I did so on the condition that they didn't play music at 3 am. They agreed and then promptly broke that promise the next weekend. \n\nSo I ramped up. Made sure to eat dinner and hang out with friends in other dorms every night from 5ish until after 10. Then used windows task scheduler to automate turning on music at 6pm and restart the computer at 9:58pm. Since quiet hours began at 10pm the RA couldn't open my room to turn it off because I wasn't breaking any rules.\n\nThey capitulated by the end of the first week but I kept going for a few more days because they'd broken their first agreement.",

The manager let us know that they were going to refloor the unit above us before bringing in a new tenant. What she didn't tell us is that the ownership decided to remove all of the carpet and replace it with unpadded faux hardwood throughout. \n\nThe new tenants are an older couple, in their 70s and retired. They don't sleep more than a couple hours. We haven't had a decent night's sleep in over a year. Every single little noise is amplified. Footsteps are thunder. Dropping a pen on their floor may as well be a bowling ball, and one or both of them is awake accounting for about 20 hours of the day.\n\nNeighbors who refuse to adhere to quiet hours suck.",

For a year and a half, we reported her to the office every time she bitched us, beat on the walls, screamed at the ceiling, left nasty notes on our door, etc.\n\nEventually we found that playing nice wasn't getting through to her, so my wife spent ten minutes jumping around, yelling, stomping to \"We Will Rock You,\" antagonizing the dog into barking, etc.\n\nNever heard from her again after that.

She made sure to give me her phone number so I could call her the second it was too annoying.\n\nI told her that the units were well-enough soundproofed that I didn't hear her very much, but when I did, I found it quite enjoyable. \n\nI eventually learned the acoustics were best in the bathroom, perhaps because there was no carpeting to absorb the sound. I have to say, it was quite nice being serenaded by classical music while sitting on the toilet.",

        "selftext": "So this takes place back in high school around 2001-2002ish. Not a huge satisfying scenario, but it sure felt like it back then.\n\nI was enrolled in a private high school back in the day. This means two things. Basically they can make up whatever rules they want since they aren\u2019t governed by the state, and it means that most of the kids didn\u2019t live in the neighborhood the school was located in.\n\nPersonally, I lived about 20-25 minutes away from school. Which coupled with the fact that I wasn\u2019t a very organized person, meant I had trouble making it to school by the time the first bell rang.\n\nWell our school really wanted to crack down on lates. They eventually adopted a system where if you were late 3 times, you were awarded a detention.\n\nAfter three detentions, you received an in-school suspension. The punishment definitely didn\u2019t fit the crime, at least in my opinion.\n\nAnother caveat to this scenario, is that I didn\u2019t have my drivers license yet, so when I got my first detention, my dad had to adjust his day by 60-90 minutes to accommodate picking me up later after school. Especially since I had a younger brother who was dismissed at normal time. So he had to pick him up, wait an hour or so, then come back for me.\n\nI eventually earned my second detention for being late, and my dad did not appreciate doing the whole extended pick-up again.\n\nSo cue a few weeks later and I\u2019ve already racked up another two lates. Then one morning I was rushing around trying to get ready and imploring my dad to get there on time, because if I didn\u2019t I would get a third detention *and* an in-school suspension.\n\nTo which he replied. \u201cOk, so what\u2019s the consequence for being absent?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cUhhhh........nothing? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\u201d\n\nDad: \u201cWell if we\u2019re going to be late, I\u2019ll just call in and tell them you\u2019ll be absent today instead\u201d\n\nSo from then on, if we were ever running late, my dad would call the school and inform them I wasn\u2019t going to be there. \n\nMy dad did things like this ALL the time. And he didn\u2019t care because, frankly, he didn\u2019t like most if their rules either, and I was a good student. So in turn I got a couple weeks worth of days off by the time the school year was over. And 16 year old me couldn\u2019t be happier.",

He turned very red. Everyone doing the late assembly was silent, then we were dismissed for class.\n\n\nI never had to do late assembly again. \n\nI also missed my graduation ceremony because I found a st Bernard stuck in the canal on my walk to school, and spent 25 minutes coaxing the dog down to the ramp to get out.

I used always be running late so usually I'd sneak in with a prefect or someone so I didn't get in trouble.\n\nI had a friend who figured out that if you came to school well after assembly had finished, say 11am, you could do a late signon as normal and noone would bat an eyelid... So that's what he did almost every Thursday and noone ever noticed.\n\nWe also found out that if you rocked up to the compulsory swim carnivals or track and field events (didn't have to participate) and had your name crossed off, if you snuck off straight after they wouldn't know because they don't check who *leaves* the venue at the end of the day :)",

            "This is what my teachers also told us to do. If we're missing 3 out of 6 subjects for that day due to whatever reasons, we should just call in for absence for the whole day since missing 1 day looks better than 3 no shows on the report card.",
            "My school used to put me down for \u201chalf day unexplained absence\u201d if i was late for school. So if i took more than two minutes making it to school from the bus stop that was a 10 minutes walk away, the school decided i was 3.5 hours late. I started going to kfc instead of rushing. Less pain, AND i wasn\u2019t rushing. By the time i got to school my mum had already called to tell them i was late, not absent, and I had a full belly after an hour on the bus. Mum never knew exactly HOW late i was, but given she knew what they were doing she knew i didnt actually have as many absences as they said i did. She didnt care how late i was though, every time she got the \u201cyour daughter is absent. Provide a medical certificate or she will be marked as truant\u201d text she called up, went off about how many times she had to do this, and explained if they wanted me there on time they should run a school bus to pick me up to have me there on time. Given i already got up at 6 to catch the first bus to be there at 8 instead of 7:50am, i didnt particularly give a flying rats ass how many absences they put down. Fuck public school.",
            "Yeah that's a baloney rule. I'd do the same thing if I was your parent.",
            "If something starts at 8am and you arrive at 8:01, you are late.  That's the definition of late.  And in most professional environments, being late is a bad thing.  School is there to teach us to be ready to be productive members of society.  Maybe you will be lucky to get into an industry where punctuality is not important.  But if not, and you can't wrap your head around what it means to be on time, you're gonna have a hard time and your employer ain't gonna like you for long.  How is it so damned hard for people to be on time for things?",
            "Easy to hate on the school but there does need to be some consequence for being late.  \n\nAlso I'm sure there was a policy for being absent to many days",
            "I mean you could also just show up on time. Being chronically late is a negative trait.",
            "Why couldn't you just be organized and get there on time?",
            "This is malicious compliance but more malicious to yourself really. The school wasn't hurt by you doing this at all, your own education was. And you were simultaneously awarded for having poor time management, which is a different take on parenting than my parents had. But meh, if you're doing fine in adulthood I guess no harm no foul.",
            ">Well our school really wanted to crack down on lates. They eventually adopted a system where if you were late 3 times, you were awarded a detention.\n\n>After three detentions, you received an in-school suspension. The punishment definitely didn\u2019t fit the crime, at least in my opinion.\n\nI mean late 9 times is ideally supposed to teach you time management, it seems like an appropriate punishment to me. But without a DL yourself (and I'm assuming a bus system) its hard to be in control of that.",
            "So let me get this right. You Dad wants you to go to a private school which he has to pay for. He is the reason you're late (or at least is not holding you responsible for being late / parenting ), but is mad when he has to deal with the consequences of being late. And just decides that you shouldn't go to school if he can't get you there on time?\n\nI'm not sure if this is r/entitledparents or r/entitledkids, so I'll just say r/EntitledPeople",
            "Stop being late for stuff. You said yourself it's only a 20 to 25 minute drive and that the problem is that you aren't organized. Try getting organized and stop being lazy.",
            "I had a bad habit of missing the bus, or over sleeping. So my sister would just drop me off on the way to work. So, I would get to middle school around 9am.\n\nI would walk into the office, and tell them the same 2 reasons, depending on why I was late, and they would always tell me I was going to fail because of all these tarties.\n\nWell, the first period I hated, I really didn't like the teacher, she was a real b*tch, and I didn't think I belonged in her class, and it wasn't a class I needed to pass, to pass my grade. So who cares if I miss it. \n\n2nd Period was English, I had to pass that one. For some reason, that teacher liked me, and would always wait for me to show up, before giving any tests. She even gave me a few minutes to study, before passing out the tests. I always aced them.\n\nSurprise, surprise, I didn't fail, and I must of came in during 2nd period 100 times. :)",

            "My public high school had a similar rule. People cut first period pretty often because of it. Their attendance system didn't really have a good way of counting absent first period and on time for second period as late.",
            "My mom used to do something similar for me. She moved out of state after my sophomore year of high school, and if I ever wanted to skip class, she'd call in or send me a text with \"permission\" to skip and the attendance/school nurse would accept it even though it was on record that she lived out of state, because they'd been friends.",
            "Same thing at my public school. My one friend senior year had a ton of lates, so one day he walked in the main office, noticed he would be late, and then turned around and went home instead of getting a detention.",

            "Similar situation happened to me. \n\nIf you were late 10 times or more in the year, they would take away your parking pass and you'd be required to take the bus or be dropped off by a parent. \n\nAs I didn't want my parking pass taken away, after I hit tardy #9 and was warned that it would be revoked, any time I was late after that point, I would just sleep in my car in the parking lot until period 2 started. Being absent held no penalty unless you hit like 20 absences in a semester, so it wasn't a problem as I didn't abuse this every day, but often would do it to ensure I didn't lose my parking pass if I were ever running late.",
            "I had a job like this, getting in serious trouble for being late.  One morning, was late  So i xalled out sick.  Well one day of sickness was the same as 3 days.  So i took the next 2 days off.",
            "I had same thing in high school. My mom got tired of the bs policies and if I was going to be late would just call me in as it affected me less than being 3 minutes late did despite than missing 8 hours of instruction instead of the cult recitation to the r/w/b flag and attendance being called.",
            "Back when I was in trade school you went for 10 weeks each year and if you were away over 3 days then you were kicked out. If you were late past the first break it counted as half of a day. \n\nI used to visit my fianc\u00e9e on weekends and would come back on the Monday morning instead of the Sunday night. It meant I was late every Monday that I did this. Obviously this meant I would be kicked out after 6 weeks *BUT* I would check the instructors attendance book because he wasn\u2019t that great at marking things like that down (may not have cared) so I ended up with only 1.5-2 of my 3 days used up.",
            "A bit late to the party, but eh.\n\nI graduated 2017. I think my Freshman/Sophomore year my school implemented a rather stupid policy to combat our attendance problem: they started charging the students. $1 for every tardy, $5 for every absence. And you were only allowed to have like 3 or 4 excused absences the whole year, whether parent or doctor's note excused, any more than that you'd get charged. \n\nThere was a lot of kids that just wracked up so many charges that they just. . .stopped showing up, some ended up not being able to graduate because of outstanding fines. I mean, when you wrack up $50+ in fees in the middle of \"welfare central\" (what the area was called by some people, due to the high population of low-income families in the area/going to that school), there's people who just no longer care. They can't pay for it, so why bother going at all?",
            "I loved in-school suspensions. \n\nI would get all my work at once, bang it out before lunch, read The Wheel of Time for the rest of the day, and play video games when I got home because I had zero homework.\n\nHowever, a day off would definitely be better haha.",

            "When I left the US, I enrolled myself in a college prep school. I was 19 at the time, living by myself. Every Monday through Thursday, we had English (as in a 2nd language class, what you guys would call a \"Spanish\" class). I spoke better English than the teacher, so I talked to her and told her itd be a waste of everyone's time for me to show up, so I just wouldn't. She told me I could either show up, or be automatically failed due assistance and be held back because of her class.\n\nSo I'd show up and sleep. She'd mark me absent. So I'd answer every question and worksheet out loud, without being called on. The first 6 weeks go by, and we get our first test. I start loudly reading every question and the answer. She tells me to shut up, or she'd fail me. We argued back and forth, and ended up in the principal's office.\n\nPrincipal starts lecturing me about respecting my teachers, learning from them, and putting my parents money to good use, since this was a private school. I laughed, and told him my parents weren't in the picture, so he should worry less about my learning, and more about keeping my business.\nThis greatly upset him, and he told me he'd call my guardian to have a chat, all 3 of us.\nSo I laugh some more, and told him to go ahead. He calls, and is looking very smug until my phone starts ringing. I answer, and he is just staring. \"hello? Hellllooooo?! Huh, wrong number I guess\". He stared at me, and I explained I had enrolled myself, and was working afternoons and nights, and paying for this myself. So before a student, I was a patron.\n\nWe ended up talking about what I wanted for the class, and he told me he'd have me take the final certification test, and whatever grade I got, would be my final grade for the year. I agreed, and told him that regardless of the grade, I would not show up to class. He agreed. The next day, I had the test, and 3 days later, my grade. 100%.\n\nTeacher was very mad that I had gotten what I wanted, and she had to give me a 100 on every report card, without having to show up for a fucking 7am class I didn't need.\nBetter yet, the rumor spread, and I was doing tutoring after class for some people, $5/h. Id also do homework for them, but that was only for a few pals, lol.",
            "I am normally a fairly punctual and dependable guy.  For years I had a supervisor who tried to make his opinions into official policy, which never worked out well.  At one point I had been tardy to work a few times and he called me in for a disciplinary interview.  During that interview he said that he himself has never been late to work.  Ever.  So he cannot accept any excuse for others being late.  He had no problems with calling in sick, but would give a written warning for being 10 minutes late. Okay, so like your dad, I decided that I would never be late again.  Wake up late?  Truck not want to start?  If it ever looked like I wouldn\u2019t make it in on time, I called in sick.  Luckily my boss now is much more relaxed than that.",
            "I used to do that for my kids as well, their school's tardy policies were total crap and they'd get nasty as shit to the kids and I if they were late so it was easier to just keep them home for the day. Dumb stuff.",

No punishment for the odd absence. High punishment for the odd lateness.",

Those teachers learned that they had better be able to clearly and logically articulate a justification for the detention, or they'd receive a comprehensive tongue lashing about their stupidity and incompetence, courtesy of my mother.\n\nShe'd happily accept the detention if I'd actually done something wrong, but if it was just a the teacher being a dick, or collective punishment, or entirely disproportionate, then they'd soon find out about their mistake.",

So when the bus left me, I literally had to go to school on my own - uphill both ways.) \n\nAfter I was late twice I was cautioned that I would be given detention if I was late again.

This guy was in charge of discipline and everyone was terrified of him. Except me. I don't think he knew what to do with a student who wasn't afraid. So he told me I would be doing detention for being late, and I replied \"my father told me to tell you we already have a lawyer,\" and turned around and walked out to go to class.

Private schools may not be as well regulated by the government, but they ARE regulated to some extent, if not by federal law, than by state law.  And even most private schools that somehow don't fall under truancy laws won't advance you to the next grade if you miss too much (because hey... that's an extra year of tuition in their pockets).",

I had more than enough credits to graduate early but they threatened to not let me graduate early for repeatedly being late to my first class which they would fail me for. It was my last required credit that I needed to graduate (Economy). I was never more than 5 mins or so late yet my friend never showed up and they weren't threatening to fail her for it. So if I was gonna be late, I just didn't show up for the class at all. I'd just show up for my second class and go from there. It worked and ended up graduating early as planned.",

            "Now a days if you're absent more then 10 days a year they call CPS! Happened to my sister. That was the 2nd time too. So the 1st time was in kindergarten. She dropped her off late and put the Drs note in her back pack stating she had just gotten shots that's why she was late and her legs would be sore since she got 3 shots. Well circle time comes and I guess she told the teacher I can't sit criss cross apple sauce becuase my legs hurt too much (that's what they call it. Its just sitting on your butt with your lower legs crossed) so what do they do instead of asking her mom why or maybe checking the back pack? They call cps and my sister has to cancel work a bunch to deal with cps. They even tried to force her to get a more \"thourough\" inspection since the school made a call saying she must be being molested since her legs hurt too much to sit down! (How that makes sense ill never fucking know) it shocked my sister and the whole family. Luckily my sister's pediatrician is great and ALWAYS checks the kids privates at each appointment and explains I'm a Dr so its ok if I look but only mommy, daddy, or me can look down here. Then she checks and thats it. Well the Dr called the cps people and told them NO I will not be doing the more invasive check I already checked her and shes fine! There were no signs what so ever if there had been I would have called! They luckily agreed and then obviously my sister passed everything a few weeks later as shes a great mom. That note she sent in never left her daughters back pack btw. For a week after she left it in there untill she got sick of it and handed it to the teacher. I guess the teacher made a shocked face that didn't make sense untill my sister got a house check by CPS a few days later (guessing teacher realized she was an idiot). Then the 2nd time was becuase she had missed over 10 days in 1st grade. She missed a week and a half at the start of school from somone sending their kid to school with hand foot mouth. So she kept her daughter home so no one else would get it. So there's 7 days. Then towards the end of the year she got strep throat. Missed 4 days becuase she wasn't suposed to go back till the fever was broke. The school tells you if there's a fever, diahrea, or vomiting, or any thing contiguous then stay home untill 24 hours of no symptoms. Yet they get shitty when you can't come in so most parents send their kids to school sick then everyone gets sick and misses school. Part that pisses me off the most if my son is immune compromised and I'm about to have a newborn yet these parents keep sending sick kids to school not caring if they risk peoples lives. Anyways she had to deal with cps again and it was stupid. This time was even more annoying as she had just ahd a baby and was juggling ger eldest,newborn, and working but now had to deal with constant cps meetings. All becuase she did what you should do and kept her sick kid home. the school system is a joke. We have talked to soooo many parents who have also has cps called on them. Apparently they enjoy calling all the time idk. What you just said in Your story is insane too. They should realize shit happens and you can't always be on time. They should have a 30 minute grace period if everyone is so far away from the school. Hell I was late on the bus as a teen alot becuase we lived in the country and our bus ride was an hour and 30 minutes. When it snowed or even rained it would add time. I still got tardies for it! Which ended up in detentions that my dad would have to call ans tell them I could spend 3 hours after school becuase he went to work at 2 pm and didn't get off till 2 am. Again the school system is a joke in every way possible. I can't stand it and after this year and were moved I'm home schooling through the same progran my spouse went through as a kid. Seems most school are all full of adults on power trips",

            "My son ran this Gambit during his junior year of high school. You know what happened to him his second round of detentions? HE GOT FUCKING GROUNDED. But, that was also in part because we wasn't hearing his alarm and fighting is waking him up because he was up into the middle of the night on his cell phone. So... Lol",
            "I don't think it's unreasonable to give an in school suspension for being late 9 times. And then you were late enough more times to miss a couple of weeks' worth of days? It sounds to me like you were the one who needed to change something, not the school. The school's not there to cater to you, especially since you guys are the ones paying to go there.",
            "As a senior in HS, I do this all the time lmaooo. No punishment for absences, lunch detention for enough lates... I just dont show up",
            "There\u2019s no malicious compliance here. Just a kid cheating themselves out of an education by not going to school. I don\u2019t know why you were so surprised that there were punishments for being late?\nIt\u2019s not a bad system either. They excuse 2 tardys because *it happens* but on the third it\u2019s a pattern and you need to learn to be on time.",
            "I think your school did it a lot better than mine. If you were late once it was okay. Twice and you'd have to be at school at 08:00 the next morning regardless of your schedule. Every further time you'd be late you'd have to show up at 08:00 more often. At the point where you would get an in-school suspension, my school would call a government official to have official talks with you and your parents about why you're late all the time and they could even fine your parents for not paying attention to you.",
            "At my school we had someone standing by the gate, so you miss form time and assembly if you're late (half an hour before first period). \n\nI was always late because we had one public bus per hour, and it was often late, so I was always in detention, until mum emailed the head teacher, and he started giving certain students a late pass. Not perfect, but it worked for me. \n\nRepeatedly arriving late yielded no additional consequences either.",
            "I've never understood the idea with that... the punishment for being late eventually ends up being... not coming into school at all.\n\n*blink*",

If memory serves me they did away with it after they got a new principal.",

            "A few years ago when I got a new job for a less than reputable company, I came down with a really contagious virus less than a fortnight after I started with them. Vomiting and severe lightheadedness to the point that I could barely walk 10 meters without being on the verge of passing out. \n\n\nI texted the rostering manager and explained the situation then said I'm calling in sick and offered to get a doctor's note. He said that unless I can organise a replacement I can't call in sick. \n\n\nUnable to do so, because I didn't know the phone numbers of the staff members and I didn't want to risk failing my probationary period, I toughed it out and went to work. \n\n\nI made it two hours before the site manager sent me home.  I got a taxi to the doctor's office and got a doctor's note saying I had a virus, as well as a blood test to prove I wasn't drunk as there were a few accusations after people saw me stumbling around and I vomited 3 times in 2 hours. \n\nBut before I left I spent 2 hours in a closed room with 7 other staff members, the next day pretty much every staff member called in sick and the rostering manager couldn't cover the staff members and the office was RIDICULOUSLY understaffed. We needed 10 staff to operate normally, and only 2 turned up. So karma struck the rostering manager. The company tried having a go at me for coming in sick when I should have stayed home, but I had proof that I tried calling in sick and the company refusing to let me and being told to cover it myself by rostering. Both turnout out to be illegal actions and the rostering manager lost his job. The company I worked for closed down 2 months later, which was unsurprising.\n\n\n\n\nThey were caught doing heaps of illegal, unethical and immoral stuff and I felt absolutely no sympathy for the management what so ever and it sucks to be them because it's entirely their fault.",

            "My retail job was shocking for this, and though some managers were okay about letting you call out sick (they'd whinge a bit but wouldn't really do anything to you), one department manager would abuse you and threaten you if you tried to call in sick, and if you actually didn't show up (ie. because you were too sick to even get to work let alone do your job), she'd retaliate by taking shifts (if you were casual) or just not giving you any extra shifts (if you were on a part-time contract; keep in mind even the contracted staff usually only got 15-20 hours a week at most).\n\nAs a result, from about May to October every year, everyone in the department constantly had the sniffles and a lot of people who really should have been at home resting would be shuffling around doing maybe half the work they would normally do in the same time. You'd recover from the flu and then a few weeks later catch it again because someone else came in sick. So, because this idiotic manager didn't want one person to be off sick for a day or two once or twice a month, she constantly had a workforce of 6-7 people who were only doing the work of about 3 people.\n\nAt first I tried to stay home when I was sick, but when I realised that a) it made no difference and b) was just going to make me lose shifts and money, I thought \"fuck it\" and just rolled up sick like everyone else. I was a dumb teen/20-something though so I'd obviously not do the same thing now.",

A couple of epidemiologists sat me down and gave me a lecture on how disease spreads. They also went over a cost benefit analysis of one person staying home a few days vs coming in and spreading it to multiple people that would then be out a few days each. Even if nobody stays home, work suffers because people can't do a good job when they feel terrible.\n\nNow I call in sick when I feel like I might be coming down with something. Aside from a bout with Covid, this has meant I need about half the sick days that I used to. Apparently staying home in bed when I feel something coming on gives my system a chance to fight it before it gets really bad.",

            "I\u2019ve also seen the other side of it though. We had paid sick time where I worked and it was not unusual for people to request a vacation day and not get approved because of minimum manning. Then call in sick. Even though I was the supervisor having to enter time and catching hell from the upper management for going below minimum manning, I didn\u2019t care what you did, it\u2019s your time use it.  I only requested two things. 1.  Don\u2019t post on social media about being out clubbing or whatever on the day you called in sick. If someone complained and you had provided the evidence on social media, I couldn\u2019t stop any negative consequences from the abuse of the sick time policy. \n2.  Like I said, person is guaranteed a set number of sick time hours in their contract. If they want to use it to go on vacation (we also had vacation time), I personally don\u2019t care. There was no expiration date on sick time, so any that wasn\u2019t used this year rolls over into next year. So that being the case, if you regularly  burn all your sick time and don\u2019t have any saved, don\u2019t expect a whole lot of sympathy for not getting a pay check if you legitimately get sick and miss work. There was no way for me to enter paid time if you didn\u2019t have any left.",

No one has signed anything agreeing to this change (attendance has a section on the contract). \n\nNow the manager has stated that the owner feels that people are out too often and wants doctor's notes from people who call out.

That's assuming I can even get in for a note, not much good asking for a doctor's note for this week when I'm sick if I can't get into the doctor for 2 more weeks, and the hospital stopped giving notes as too many people were crowing the urgent care waiting rooms just for a note as it seems to be a common policy around here.\n\nThen doctor's office began charging a $20 fee for a note to combat these issues and instead of dropping the policy my work place just reimburses the fee.",

The boss is not qualified to judge how many days you need and frankly neither is the doctor. Only you know how bad you feel, and unless you're caught taking advantage, employees should be given the benefit of the doubt. Furthermore, do managers really think this kind of culture at their workplace is conducive to employee retention and morale? \n\nI had a manager at a convenience store who literally had a zero call off policy. Flu? Fuck you you're fired. In the hospital? Fuck you you're fired. Car won't start? Fuck you you're fired. House burnt down? Fuck you you're fired. Mother died? Fuck you you're fired. Might seem illegal but he would just fire without cause on the termination paperwork. In return this manager justified it by coming in regardless of his condition. One time he had a 102 degree fever and a toothache from an exposed root and he dragged himself in anyway because \"If I have to do it, so do you.\" You'd think that loyalty would be recognized by the company even with his cruel intentions. Nope. Budget cuts came around due to a few bad inventories that were out of the managers control (long story) and they put him out on his ass after 15 years of perfect attendance. It was a seriously despicable move, but I cant say my heart was broken."

I had moved into the Maintenance split about 4-5 months in, which caused issues getting my reviews at 6 & 12 month (but that's another rant)... 1 of 3 Maintenance people for 5 locations.\n\nThe standard practice around there was that as supper rush was starting, we'd lose 4 people that went out back to smoke (including the shift manager) and leave 3 of us scrambling for 15min.  I complained and was told that \"there is a smoke break allowed every hour, nothing says it has to be a fixed time\".\n\nFirst off, I just went out with the smokers for 5min and was told by that same shift manager that it was ONLY for smokers and not just a general break.

            "In one workplace I had, the smokers would take smoke breaks just when things were getting busy, then saunter back and help take care of the tail end of things.\n\nI mentioned this to the supervisor and asked if they couldn't maybe take their smoke breaks earlier or later, when it wasn't busy.\n\n\"Oh yeah, but they said they need to have a smoke then.\"\n\nSo I said, \"Fine, I'll be taking a non-smoker break then, shall I? I mean, having an unhealthy addiction shouldn't automatically qualify them for a break that the rest of us don't get, should it?\"\n\nHe looked at me and the penny dropped.\n\nFrom then on, smoke breaks during the busy period were banned.",

            "Similar story here- never smoked a day in my life. Worked in an office where every hour the smokers would take 10 minute breaks to go outside the building and smoke- large corporate office- so took a few minutes to get outside- they could go whenever they wanted. Not a big deal- we all had our own responsibilities but felt this wasn\u2019t fair so I started every hour to just go outside and walk around the building one or twice before going back in. Within 2-3 days the boss asked why I was leaving so \u201c often\u201d- I stated that I was going outside for my smoke break and when I was asked if I ever smoke before because they had never seen me smoke I said no. So the boss asked why I would leave then and I simply stated everybody else in the office gets to do this why shouldn\u2019t I. I said if you want me to walk around with a cigarette in my mouth I will be happy to do so. I then asked if there was any written rule that says that non-smokers don\u2019t get breaks because we work 10 hour shifts so realistically they got about an hour and a half of smoke breaks give  or take a day besides lunch. After he replied that there was no written rule I asked who made the rule and he kind of chuckled and said that\u2019s the way it always is. So I said well not anymore because I\u2019m taking the same breaks as everyone else and if there\u2019s a problem I can call HR. Not a problem since he was a smoker at all lol and from that point on I was able to go outside every hour so for 10 minutes with no questions asked! \ud83d\ude00",

I'd just been let go from my previous place of employment due to be being compliant with directives I'd been given (although not maliciously, so that story wouldn't be appropriate here, sadly), and thus working myself out of a job.  I was a young college dropout from a technical college that hadn't been federally accredited yet, and thus all my student loans were from banks and loan companies instead of from Uncle Sam, and debts were due.  I was also making payments on my very first car, even though it was a beater that the prior owners had already nearly driven into the ground (4 years old and nearly 200k miles on it when I bought it), and of course, rent and utitlities.  The job I'd just been let go from already had me working paycheck to paycheck as they paid far under average rate, but I was still new professional so I couldn't be very choosy.  I was living in Los Angeles county, so the cost of living was so bad, I was having to choose which bills were going to be late on a monthly basis.  Specifically, I was living in a town called San Pedro, a small town tucked fairly out of the way.\n\nAfter blasting my resume to all the job boards, I get a call from a startup who seems interested in my resume and wants me to come in for a face-to-face interview (skipping the call-screen entirely).  In my desperation, I agree.  I'm given an address, which is all the way up in Woodland Hills.  I check the internet...  55 minute drive so long as there's no traffic.  With traffic it looks like the commute will be more like an hour and forty-five minutes... each way.  I'm desperate though, and literally nobody else has reached out to me about my resume or responded to my applications, so I go to the interview.  I arrive to an mostly empty office complex.  Maybe 6 or 7 other cars in a parking lot capable of holding at least 50.  I go into the building mentioned in the address, and call the phone number I was given to let them know I've arrived.  Enter Chad.  Chad comes to meet me, and seems excited that I've come!  He escorts me through the building to an office.  Mind you, as far as I can see, we're the only two humans in the building.  He gives me the pitch for the company, tells me he built the software being sold, but it's not scalable, and needs someone who can rewrite it.  After we go through the whole interview song and dance, he offers me the job on the spot.  The pay is marginally higher than the last gig, so I figure gas would be covered for the commute.  I agree, and we shake hands, as I'm going to be starting the next Monday.\n\nRed flags start appearing from the very first minute I arrive on monday.  First, I'm given a tour, which consists of the 14x14 foot office I'm going to be sharing with Chad, as well as another engineer who's going to be starting the following monday.  I'm not a fan of having someone able to look over my shoulder, it makes me nervous.  I ask why each engineer's desk has two computers.  \"Because the one you will be writing code on doesn't have internet access, for security purposes.\"  (Note:  this was pure paranoia.  There was nothing about this software that required such tight security, we weren't doing any gov't contracts or anything of the sort.)  Then, I'm escorted clear across the building, to meet with the CEO (Richard), the IT guy (Eddie), and the sales/support team.  I'm told that half of the team is supporting the existing version of the application, 2 people are selling the existing version to new clients (or trying to), and one person is explicitly tasked with selling the new version.  The one I haven't even started on yet.  I'm still young and dumb at this point, but even I know this means the salesperson is probably giving out a date when the customer should expect their purchase to be filled.  \"It's a good thing you started when we did, we've been telling customers it'll be ready in June.\"  Did I mention all this was happening in February?  Apparently I've agreed to rewrite, test, and package an entire application I've never seen before in approximately four months.  So, tour being done, I sit down and get to work.  After jumping through a bunch of hoops of getting the software I prefer downloaded onto the actual work machine, as well as the code, I set about reviewing code so horrific I've not seen its like since, and there isn't a single comment in the entire thing.  Before I can ask a single question of the CTO however, he tells me he's headed to downtown LA to scalp his tickets to the Lakers game, and that he'll see me tomorrow.  So... now I'm alone in the office with this abomination, a machine that's been hamstrung to heck and back, and the only thing I've got to console me is the fact that at least I'm employed again.\n\nFast-forward a week, I've documented the bulk of the code (because there wasn't any), and the boss and I do not get along.  He's mad because I've not written any substantial code, and I'm frustrated because I'm trying to understand a lot of what specific code is trying to do and he's routinely leaving around noon to go sell his tickets for Laker's games, or just not in the office because he's chatting with someone else.   When he is in the office, I show him my documentation, and try to get him to verify it or describe the purpose of code where all I can say is \"Wat?\"  By the end of the week, I've covered about 30% of the project in a wiki-like document, and I've taken to leaving after sunset so I can a) get more done, b) have a shorter commute, and c) drive when my car isn't an oven (the ac didn't work).  I've barely managed to convince the CTO that what I'm doing is necessary so the engineer starting the next monday doesn't have to do anywhere near the same crap I've got, which would make us a more efficient team.\n\nMonday arrives, and in comes Big Bro.  I call him this because he was a much more experienced engineer than I was.  We spend the first day with him getting set up, then us reviewing what I've documented.  He manages to answer some questions the CTO never did, just because he is that much better, and I start to feel more confident.   Over the next weeks, Big Bro took me under his wing as an engineer teaching me best practices, standards, and where my plans were good and where they could be better.  If it hadn't been for him, I'd have gone insane!  I end up joining him outside for smoke breaks even though I don't smoke, just so I can get a breath of non-office air.  He and I discuss the project, and we also make friends with Eddie, who makes us laugh by telling us horror stories about the CTO and CEO (apparently he was a school \\*friend\\* of theirs and basically worked with them because they paid him to do something he felt was super easy).\n\nApril rolls around.  I've got a special occasion I need the day off for, which happens to be a Wednesday that year.  I'd advised him when I first started and he'd been cool with it.  I remind him on April 2nd (since I had an irrational fear of policy decisions being made on April Fool's Day), and he loses it.  He goes off on a rant, and straight up informs me that he regrets hiring me, claiming I didn't have the skills I told him I did, and wasn't worth what I was being paid. We're definitely not half-way done (more like one third), and it's already been decided that June is a lost cause and that we're shooting for August now.  That habit I started before, of leaving after the sun went down?  Yeah, that never stopped.  I was arriving at 9am every day, and leaving around 10pm every night, trying my best.  Big bro was the same, and Eddie would stay late with us just because we liked hanging out together.  So, it should be understandable that I was very close to losing it right back at him.  In a strained, yet diplomatic voice, I told him that if he put in the same amount of work to help us as we put in to rewrite \\*his\\* code, we'd probably be a lot closer to done than we were, especially given the twelve hour days.  He was not a fan of that, and switched to straight up yelling, blaming us for the lost sales and refunds due to the delays, and that the only way he'd get off our backs was by getting the project done.  This entire time Big Bro is just sitting there, and says nothing to back me up.  Chad then left the office for a bit, and I just declared I was taking my lunch and would be back in an hour.  I felt frustrated by Chad and betrayed by Big Bro, who I felt (rightly or not) should have had my back since we were in the same boat.\n\nWhen we were both back in the office, he apologized for yelling and told me that since he agreed when I was hired I could have my day off.  Cool.  I apologized too, although not for anything specific.  I just didn't want to talk to him anymore and figured that was the fastest way to end the conversation.\n\nFast forward to June, and the opportunity for Malicious Compliance.  Over the last two months, Chad has been getting worse and worse.  He's yelling nearly every day (and still leaving early too).  Big Bro and Eddie are also feeling the pain, nobody is safe from his ego.  The smoke breaks and afternoon/evening portion of our day are when we're most productive, as nobody can focus until Chad leaves.  The first monday in June rolls around and Chad invites me to go on a walk outside for a 1-on-1 meeting.  I figured I'm being fired (at this point we've had to refactor the rewrite almost entirely due to missing a critical chunk of functionality, and we're still only 60% done. August release is looking less and less sure).  Chad informs me that he's hired a 3rd engineer, but in order to stay in the budget to pay him, he's cutting my salary in half.  I stop on the spot and just give him a blank look.\n\n\"Are you serious?\"  I ask.  \"I'm barely able to pay for my bills and the gas required to commute here as it is. If you cut my salary at all, I won't be able to afford to live.\"  At this point the idea of cutting my productivity to help ramp up a new engineer so he can help us meet the deadline doesn't even occur to me, although in hindsight that would have also been a pretty major issue.\n\nChad brushes me off.  \"That's not my problem.  The fact that you missed one deadline and look like you're gonna miss another is.  If you've got a problem with that, you're more than welcome to go find another job.  The new guy starts in two weeks.\"  And with that he walks inside.  I'd just been told that I had two weeks left of job at my current salary.  Cool.  So that day I do something I hadn't done since I first started.  I left while the sun was still up.  (Specifically, I left at 5pm).  I drive my oven-car (no working Air Conditioning in a car that had been left in the sun all day in Woodland Hills had me feeling like a baked potato) through traffic (hour and a half-commute home through LA heat), and updated my resume before reactivating my accounts on all the job sites.  I'm contacted the next day by a potential new employer, and I get an interview scheduled.  I decide to tell Big Bro about the new opportunity, and he hits me with news that lets me know just how small a world we live in.\n\nMe: \"Hey, Big Bro, just fyi I've started looking for a new job.  I've already got an interview lined up.\"\n\nBig Bro: \"Really?  Where?\"\n\nMe: \"Over at <company>\"\n\nBig Bro:  \"Wow!  That's where I worked before I came here!   That place is pretty awesome, and I left there on pretty good terms.  I know the CTO there, go ahead and use me as a reference!\"\n\nMe, skeptical: \"Really?  Okay....\"\n\nTurns out Big Bro was true to his word, and the CTO and I even talked about Big Bro during the interview.  Apparently they'd already talked about me, and Big Bro had been the ultimate hype man, confirming everything I said about why I was looking for a new job and everything.  All goes well, and I'm electronically signing an offer-letter that Friday afternoon (Chad had already left for the day, so there was nobody to look over my shoulder as I used the work computer that \\*had\\* internet access to get this done).  At the new Job, the commute is cut by more than half, and comes with a pretty significant raise.  I tell Big Bro and Eddie on the last smoke break (I still don't smoke) that I'm done, and I've found something new.  Oddly enough, they both smile and just wish me luck.  \"No hard feelings, hope we stay in touch!\"  Odd, but I'd stopped really caring about anything related to that job, so I paid it no mind.  I went back inside, packed up my stuff into my backpack, and walked to the CEO's office.\n\nMe: \"Hey Richard, got a minute?\"\n\nRichard: \"Hey OP, what's up?\"\n\nMe: \"Just wanted to let you know I found a new job, so I'm moving on.\"\n\nRichard: \"Really, why? We need you!\"\n\nMe: \"You guys decided it was cool to cut my salary to a point where I couldn't afford to live.  Chad said if I didn't like it, I should look for something new, so I did.\"\n\nRichard, looking defeated: \"Well, when's your last day?\"\n\nMe: \"Today.\"\n\nRichard, now pissed: \"We need you here to train the new guy who starts soon!\"\n\nMe: \"Hey, I had to train myself and to an extent, Big Bro when he first started.  The new guy should be able to as well.\"\n\nAnd with that, I left for greener pastures.\n\nThe unexpectedly \\*huge\\* fallout:\n\nFour months later, Big Bro texts me to ask me how things are going.  I tell him things  are great, and we schedule a lunchtime call because apparently things have gone sideways in a huge way.\n\nPart 1)  Apparently Chad came in on Monday almost violently angry, and demands Eddie re-image my work machine first thing in the morning, which erases everything I'd left on there.Big Bro comes in an hour later, and he and Chad discuss the new timeline for the project.  Somewhere in there apparently Big Bro asks Chad to log into the admin account on my old work machine so he can pull the documents I'd accumulated about the planned architecture, the existing code, meeting notes, etc.  Chad answers by apparently punching a hole in the wall, and leaving for the day (probably to go to the hospital to deal with his hand), at 10:30 in the morning.  Big Bro then spends the rest of that week ostensibly working on recreating the documentation from scratch.\n\nPart 2) When I asked how the new guy handled the new documentation, Big Bro laughed and told me there never was any documentation. Apparently he and Eddie had become really good friends in the months we worked there, to the point where they'd become roommates about a month before I left.  More than that though, they'd decided to start a freelance/consulting business together and only had to decide on when to make that their full time jobs.  Neither of them liked Chad much, and wanted to make their departure hurt as much as possible.  So, they decide to make Big Bro's last day the day before the new guy starts, and Eddie would quit shortly afterward, sticking around just long enough to watch the bomb go off.  Did I mention Big Bro never told Chad he was quitting?  Yeah.  He just didn't show up that Monday.  He had, however, emailed that 'documentation' he'd spent a week writing to Chad.  Turns out he wasn't documenting the code at all.  He'd spent a week writing a letter explaining in excruciating detail why Chad was such a bad boss, and he'd emailed it to everyone in the company.  I asked if he still had it so I could read it, and he sent it to me after the call.\n\nThankfully, like the big helper he was, Eddie had ensured that the new guy's email was set up and in the proper groups before the email was sent, so the guys first email in the company was a novella about the kind of person he' agreed to work for.  Apparently Chad thought it was appropriate to take his frustration out on the new guy, who'd already read a significant portion of the email before Chad shoved him away from his desk and deleted it.  Apparently new guy promptly decided (and rightfully so) that agreeing to work for Chad had been a mistake, packed up his things, and quit on the spot.\n\nPart 3) With the new guy quitting, the August deadline was now little more than a dream within a dream, which according to Eddie doesn't stop Chad and Richard from trying to find that miracle rock star engineer who can save them from their own situation (which, given what they were offering as pay, didn't exist).  So time advances in its unstoppable way, August arrives, and customers find that they've paid for something that hasn't been delivered yet, and pretty much unanimously demand refunds, with a few customers bringing legal action against them.  With the amount they have to refund, and the money they now need for legal fees (because of they way they'd incorporated, they were personally liable), they could no longer afford to pay anyone, and were forced to shutter the business.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nFinal Note:   For my fellow software engineers out there who were wondering just how bad this application was, this \"program\" was a single php file with over 40k lines of code, running inside a \\`while\\` loop.  Any and all logic consisted of if/else trees, which then led to either more if/else trees or more loops.  No function calls, no external libraries included, just....  spaghetti of the worst kind.  Given the nature of the application, most critical logic had to be implemented in no less than seven places, depending on where the execution was when the logic was needed.  At worst the tab-depth was something like nineteen or twenty tabs deep.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nPost upvote-splosion edit:\n\nI wanted to write out my thanks, and to answer some of your questions, but it turned into another long wall of text.

            "How did they keep in business when they can't answer the basic questions from their employees about the work?",
            "Oh... my... goodness!   I am humbled and amazed at the kind of feedback my story received (all of it, really).   For a few hours yesterday, I was trying to respond to comments as they came in...  but then I went to bed and woke up to all of these awards, and more comments, and I just wanna thank and hug you all!  I want to give something meaningful to everyone with kind words, comments, and questions, and noticed there's a lot of common trends in the comments section.  Or, put another way, I'm noticing a lot of frequently asked questions (and comments)!  So I'm gonna do my best to address those here:\n\n>Why did Big Bro leave <company> to work for the startup?\n\nDACA wasn't a thing yet, and while <company> was also technically a startup, it was further along in terms of getting investors, backers, and interest in people looking to acquire it.  When it got to a certain point, he was forced out due to bureaucracy so that the accounting books would look clean.  Apparently this was expected and they parted on amicable terms.  Similarly, Chad was willing to overlook certain issues related to Big Bro's current situation, and I'd speculate that it's because it let him save on paying certain taxes. It's also why I think him and Eddie starting a business together was probably the best possible end scenario for them.\n\n>What was the application designed to do?\n\nI replied to this explicitly in a comment, but I'm also gonna answer it here: It wasn't government work or otherwise super classified, but the industry was niche enough that if I described the software, it would definitely be enough information to identify everyone involved.  Since I don't wanna do that, I unfortunately have to be \"that guy\" and leave it vague.\n\n>Why did you stay as long as you did?  Why didn't you quit?\n\nFor about the first two months, I stayed out of fear of not being able to pay my bills.  I was spending lunch breaks on my cell phone fending off debt collectors and scheduling payment plans.  After that, my reason for staying was almost entirely so I could learn as much as I could from Big Bro.  He was a treasure trove of software engineering experience.\n\n>Why didn't you rewrite the code from scratch? Why not just get the requirements from the boss and build a whole new application?\n\nYes, this is two questions, but they're fairly well linked so I'm going to answer them together as best I can.  \n\nFirst, this story is from the very beginning of my software engineering career and at the time I was *very* inexperienced.  I wasn't a software architect yet, I was a college dropout who was still trying to learn how to be a professional programmer. \n\nSecond, while I was fully capable of writing code, the actual industry and problem space were something I'd never dealt with directly before, and so I was having to learn about that in detail pretty much on the fly. \n\nThird, Chad was VERY unhelpful.  If he was around so I could ask questions, his answers would range from \"Just ead the code,\" to \"How do you not know that, it's super basic!\"  (It wasn't).  Basically he'd written the thing in a language he didn't know, apparently teaching himself as he went along.  After that, he had his title of \"CTO\" which to him meant \"I don't write code anymore, that's why I have employees\".  So everything I needed to learn about the code and the problem space, I had to derive from the code itself. This is mostly why I call Big Bro, Big Bro. He knew how to do this better than I did (and in fact I credit the core of my current skills on this now to his original lessons).\n\nFinally, as far as rewriting the application from scratch, this is ultimately what Big Bro and I attempted to do. Pulling the 'core logic' out wasn't exactly easy, as it was spread out over pretty much the entire code base.  Certain features existed in multiple places with minor variation (due to the expected conditions of the application when execution hit that point in the loop) and having to understand the differences in each variation so as to understand the expected inputs and outputs made writing the new version a pain in the but.  Hence why, about halfway through, when we learned we'd missed a pretty critical chunk of logic that forced us to refactor nearly all of what we'd written to that point.\n\n>Could you post this over on /r/prorevenge ?\n\nI'm not sure this would qualify from my perspective.  Maybe if I took some pretty heavy poetic license, added some fiction, and rewrote it from Big Bro's point of view, I could make it fit there.  Without that though, the fact that the fallout from my compliance was so huge was largely a result of coincidental moves from Eddie and Big Bro in combination with my malicious compliance, and not something we coordinated.\n\n>Do you still have the letter?  I wanna see it!\n\nI don't, and even if I did I wouldn't be willing to post it here due to concerns about identity protection. It's easy to imagine what was in it, though!  Imagine you're writing a letter to Chad, start it off with an intro saying \"Hey, I think you're a bad boss, here's the list of reasons why\" and itemizing every crap thing I've described here with evidence of dates, times, and fully fleshed out reasons as to why it's bad, with detail so in-depth that it took most of a week to write and revise.",

I know how horrible this stuff is, and I know that I should not be doing it but I couldn't have delivered these contracts -- committed to despite my objections -- without writing terrible pseudo-code usually in the middle of the night when I'm not in meetings about how we can possibly deliver our impossible contracts.\n\nAfter getting delivery out of the way, I turn to getting the code properly written, documented, deployed, monitored and supported. The business's response? \"Why -- it's running and we don't have the budget to work on that\".\n\nThe point is -- unlike Chad in this story -- I know that what I wrote was complete shIIte and needed to be written properly. I'd have loved to have the opportunity to work with a couple of competent software engineers to get it done right. I might even have learned something myself about how to do it better next time. And I'd certainly have shown my appreciation for their work, not the complete contempt shown to the characters in this tale.",

        "selftext": "This was from my last job (global financial firm with Initials Ms). I was a contractor in the IT department there for over a year, had a lot of complaints against them (original manager forgot to file paper work costing me a free position, over worked, culture that tried to sell more work as being a sign of praise rather than pay you to do more work, etc)\n\nWell it was time for me to move on, I'd scored a great state job, better pay, great benefits, still work from home and even then the office was even closer....all around they wouldn't be able to compete. They were aware of this for about 2 months as they almost sank it by dragging their heels on some verifications like employment verification. I even flat out told my manager I'd be leaving at the end of the month. Finally had my official start date, gave a bit over 2 weeks notice to quit on a Friday so I could start my first day on Monday. Here is where the stupidity begins.\n\nThis place has a policy to run all software updates on Sunday so every Monday is hell. Everything is broken due to poor qa, all hands on deck , if you call off they are gonna fight you, etc....they like to bully people and everyone who left had some attempt to get them to stay longer....and it has sadly worked (people don't get how little power they actually have).\n\nSo my time came, manager calls me up goes on and on with bs, tells me it's not proper etiquette to give only 2 weeks notice (since when?!) , That I should know it takes a minimum of 3 weeks to complete training so I should know they can't replace me in time ( you had 1 to 2 months already) and how can I do this to my coworkers in selfish and a bad person....so this doesn't get the reaction or response management wants....\n\n\nNow they bring out \"policy\"....they tell me it's against company policy to quit on a Friday...I know this is bs but they don't really hand out policy books here, and hr is kinda....well for contractors it's not a thing, contractors are 2nd class workers with hardly any rights after all....still I'm leaving the company how does this affect me? I tell them something to the affect that I'm the one quitting I'm still going to leave on that Friday... seriously not sure how this was going in their mind, they doubled down that I had to work that next Monday for them....I think hoping to get their foot in the door, ruin my next job, etc...\n\nWell this isn't working for them now is it, they are really fuming now...so they give their ultimatum, if I won't work that Monday then I am to sign out and not clock back in until I have changed my mind....they are looking smug, they are effectively threatening to fire me early, making me lose out on money and stuff, they know we don't have PTO....well I also have no care at this point, my finances are fine, my new job I need a full suit for....I guess I earned myself an unpaid vacation.\n\nI log out, they keep looking smug leave me with another \"remember don't clock in until you've decided to be reasonable\"...the next day I don't log in....a few hours later I get a call screaming about how I'm late and I've caused so many problems....I cut them off saying I'm still not coming in Monday so per our meeting I'm not to clock in....silence...they ask if I'm serious....I ask if they were serious yesterday....they call me a pug headed fool and tell me to just come in on Monday like they asked (thought this was a demand?)...they then wait a moment and ask if I'm going to grow up and come back in... Well I'm bored at this point and ask if they are going to pay my new rate on Monday....I get a confused no?....and I tell them they have their answer\n\nThey called every day that last week bouncing between apologies, insults, brow beating, etc while still always standing on the you need to come in on Monday. This was a whole week of them sometimes multiple days begging me to come in even part of the day to dig them out of holes, but then doubling down that \"if you come in that does mean your coming back all the way thru Monday right?\". I'd already dropped off their equipment already since I didn't need any of it at this point even if I did finish my week....they even called on Monday to tell me I was fired for not showing up...\n\nI still think they thought I was joking or playing hard ball for a promo or raise....it's the only reason I have for all that....or they really thought I'd throw my new job for them. They had a big focus on company loyalty that alot of people seemed to buy into so maybe they just assumed I'd be loyal...I did hear my old manager had to fill in for me as they couldn't get anyone to do my shift and my jobs, and that now months later my manager and several others quit as everything is buckling, they promised more than they could deliver and drove off experienced emps like me.\n\n\n\nTLDR job tries everything to keep me from quiting and leaving the company on a Friday, gives an ultimatum...I call their bluff and get called all week to come back before being called and fired after my 2 weeks was up.",

What about the next Monday? Does me working this one make the next one better? Some people are freaking nut cases!\n\nI quit a job a few years ago, gave them proper notice. The manglement tried to bluff me every which way to not go to work for the other company. Even threatened to sue me because of a non compete clause in my contract? Contract? I never signed a contract when I started. Then the went on to tell me about the $3,000 I would loose in my profit sharing. \"Oh I suppose I should work here another five years at the measley pay to save my profit sharing instead of going to work for another company that is paying me two times as the old job. Naw, keep your profit sharing, the extra $20K a year the new company is paying me will cover it.\"\n\nThey even went wit  the ethics route, say it was unethical for me to go work for a competitor. \"Well, what about Mike the we just hired from a competitor?\" Last day on the job they told me that their attorney would be contacting me.

He made a big show about having to check with the 2nd owner of the company... And after weeks, he offered me 2 days early (+ vacation time) - I said nope... And went ahead and submitted my parental leave for the last 2 month and got out almost on my planned date.\n\nThe next colleague was also leaving and they pulled the same stunt on him... He wanted to quit early - they denied. Then they had no work for him and offered him to let him go early. His new company said \"Offer is gone, we planed the resources to onboard him for in 3 month now\" - So they had to keep paying him 3 more month (He was allowed to go home after 2 weeks) - I loved the 2nd part :D",

It's sad how people fail to realize they have power when the company tries to beat them down. \n\nNot my story, but a good friend of mine was working a job that paid him $4,000 per month.  Actually not even, like $3,800.  He got hired for a new job in the middle of January (last month) for a huge raise to $10,500 per month.  Tried to give his old company notice in mid-January for an end of January last day and they talked him into staying until yesterday, February 21st. That means he got no time off and forewent approximately $7,500 in exchange for $2,900 at his old job. And he needed the extra money.  They brow beat him with loyalty and the other BS you mention until he caved.",

The **S**trategic **L**ong-term **A**ction on **V**olatile **E**mployees Act will stop people like the OP with their nonsense soon enough.

I work in a lab and so can\u2019t usually work from home, and since our house is small, I never really set up a workspace for myself. And to be honest, I am not the most organised person, so usually my belongings are founds scattered all over the house. My husband once turned around the car when he realised that he forgot to make the bed, so my messiness is a challenge for him. \n\nAnyway, one day a few years ago while my husband was out, I had to sign something, couldn\u2019t find a pen in my bag, and so stole one from my husband\u2019s desk. A few hours later, the following conversation occurred. \n\nHusband: \u201cHey, did you take the blue pen off my desk?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cOh yeah, sorry.\u201d I rifle through the stack of crap on the kitchen table until I find it. \u201cHere you go!\u201d\n\nHusband, slightly irritated: \u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t take my stuff, you\u2019re always losing things.\u201d\n\nNow I\u2019m a little huffy, because while it\u2019s true that I lose things from time to time, we\u2019re talking about a \u00a31 Papermate, not a Mont Blanc. \u201cWell you\u2019re the only one with an office full of office supplies, I don\u2019t even have any place to keep my own stuff!\u201d\n\nHusband: \u201cWell why don\u2019t you just get a bunch of pens and put them all over the house with the rest of your stuff, then even you\u2019ll be able to find them!\u201d And then he stalked back off to his office.\n\nOkay fine, I think, lets do it your way. I hop on Amazon and, oh look, 10 pens for \u00a35? Let\u2019s get three sets in each colour. Plus a few pen holder cylinders and a pack of Sharpees for good measure, because you can never have enough Sharpees. Add to Cart and Confirm.\n\nThe next day, my malicious package fortuitously arrived while my husband was out of the house. When he returned home, he was greeted by a lovely bouquet of pens in the entry way. He was soon to discover a similar bouquet in the kitchen, on the mantle, table at the top of the staircase, bedroom dresser, and bathroom cabinet. This is a small two bedroom house, so pens had suddenly become the primary design motif. His only comment was an exasperated \u201c*Really?*\u201d to which I just grinned in reply. \n\nHe did move the one out of the bathroom but the others stayed where they were, and actually were pretty handy. I have not needed to borrow any of his pens since, so I like to think we both won.",

The first meeting went well. When we all got up to leave, one of my male group members (who I will call Tool) squeezed my arm...hard. \n\nI looked at him like he had crusty boogers all over his face, yanked my arm away, and asked, \"Do you need something?\" He scowled at me. \"I am running for class president and won't have time to do the presentation. You're going to do my part.\" I laughed. \"I most certainly am not.\" Tool put his face close to mine and whispered somewhat menacingly. \"You're a woman and will do as I say.\" I laughed again and said, \"I don't even know you, dude. You don't get to tell me what to do.\" \n\nTool whispered even more menacingly, \"You Are GOING to do my part of the presentation, and that's that.\" He then walked away quickly. I had no idea what to do. Do I tell the professor? Do I tell the campus police about him squeezing the shit out of my arm? Do I tell the other group members?\n\nObviously, I wasn't going to do this guy's presentation. I wanted to get back at him, however, because he put his hands on me and I was petty. Then, it came to me. Time for malicious compliance!\n\nThe day of our presentation and just before it was our turn to present, I handed Tool his project: A single piece of paper with only the words 'Tool's Presentation' typed on it.\n\nI grinned and asked, \"Isn't it great?\" Tool looked like he wanted to vomit. I then leaned in and whispered, \"You Are GOING to get a terrible grade, and that's that.\"\n\nHe stuttered some nonsense during his portion of the presentation, and while I do not know for certain what grade he received, it couldn't have been good. I got an A+.\n\nHe never came to class again and I never saw him on campus again. I don't know if he dropped out or what happened, but I do know he wasn't elected president.\n\nEdit: My degree is in Creative Writing, so I do indeed write with gusto whether telling a true story or a fictional one.

            "I HATED doing group projects in college. My worst experience:\n\nI had to do a group project in my online business 101 class in college. This was our final project worth about 40-50% of the grade. This was a semester long project involving interviewing local small businesses and a decent amount of legwork that can't be crammed in at the last minute. It wasn't *hard* work, just a bit time consuming. Google Drive was used as our central hub for us to work on and share progress, and the teacher made each group a folder for us to use. I was a returning student (female, 30s years old) and all the other students were fresh out of high school. One of our group members was this very, VERY pretty girl. I mean, she was GORGEOUS. She must have been at the top of everyone's \"crush list\" in high school. She joined our first video meeting, and was all sunshine and rainbows. As the meeting progressed and we were dividing up the workload, she kept dropping hints about how \"busy she was\" and how she was trying for a sorority and the college cheer squad and whatever else.\n\nNext meeting, our midpoint meeting, was just a check-in meeting. Anyone have any questions? Concerns? Any problems you're coming across? No one raised any issues. The girl once again says how busy she's been and thanks us all for \"doing so much\" and we're great teammates. Which I thought was weird, but figured whatever, kids these days. We scheduled our \"final wrap-up meeting\" for a day or two before the project was due.\n\nFinal meeting comes, and we're all consolidating our work and reviewing each other's stuff for grammar and mistakes. We're going down the project checklist and keep coming up with missing parts. All this girl's parts. So we start asking her to send these over to us so we can add them in, as she hasn't submitted them to the Google drive like the rest of us did. We assumed the parts were being saved to her local hard drive. She seems confused. Eventually we figure out that she hasn't done anything, as she assumed we were doing it \"for her\" because she said in the first meeting that she \"was so busy\". We never gave her this impression in any of our meetings, and she never outright stated she wasn't working on anything.\n\nThere's no way we can complete her part before the deadline. Full panic ensues. This is like half our final grade. One kid immediately emails the professor. The girl begins to realize that we're chucking her firmly under the bus she belongs under and *freaks out*. She starts screaming at us and saying we're going to ruin her, and it's our fault, and we should have done this or that. She leaves the meeting.\n\nShe begins to immediately send us all group emails about how mean we are, and how she's the victim here, and we're picking on her. The emails start out all woe-is-me but start to turn more and more hostile. She tries to *delete* our entire project out of Google drive, but we had backups and were able to restore it. So she then proceeded to wipe the contents of our documents (make them all blank) so we just left them alone and did the final touches of the project by emailing back and forth. Google docs has a history feature, so the teacher was able to see who did what to the documents. We left her parts of the project empty, marking them as <assigned to Girl>, and fully explained the situation to the teacher via email and submitted the project to him through email as well, since we weren't able to remove her from edit rights in our Google drive folder.\n\nWe got a great grade! I don't know what happened to Girl, but I hope she's sorted out her crap and is doing well. She added a lot of stress to our lives for those few days.",

I paused for a moment, thinking about fixing it up for him, when I realized that wouldn't be fair to the group members who'd done actual work. Or me, who'd have to meticulously remove all the superscript links and words I knew he didn't understand. Instead, I cheerfully just copy pasted all his plagiarism into a slide and let chaos ensue.",

(I'm still annoyed at that prof for making us do his job\\*; he gave us all the responsibility but we had no authority.) So, I was \"lazy\" about attendance. Fast forward to the end of the semester and people in my group started showing up again. They were mad that I hadn't given them perfect attendance. I just told them, \"He's not stupid. He can count. You haven't been here all semester and I only put you down for missing 3 classes.\" I refused to cave. They hated me for it, but I wasn't about to take the fall for them.\n\n\\* And it's college....where you get to pick the class, day, time, professor, etc. to a certain degree.

If the prof needs attendance rules before he can figure that out, HE should take attendance.

Especially when you stick it to stupid bosses!\n\nThis happened some time ago, but as I think it would fit here.\n\nActors (names changed obv.):\n\nBob - Boss at the time, old, can't keep up with technology but had been with the company for a long time and so got to be my boss.\n\nHans - Hero of this story, friend from school who works in the same company but in management but in a different Department. Helped me get this job 4 years prior.\n\nCaroline - Coworker who is not the smartest tool in the shed but makes up for it in work ethic.\n\nCarl - Normal coworker who has worked at company for \\~6 years and handles mostly the old clients accounts. Has a family, very busy.\n\nMe - Well, me. Guy in his late 20's, a little geeky, likes computers.\n\nThis was a small company and our team of 3 were best described as tech support for our clients but it went a bit further than that. I usually helped with setting up databases and also advised clients from time to time if they would benefit from upgrading their plan etc.\n\nAs normal with tech support, we got tickets from the clients and would work away at them one by one. I liked the challenging problems and usually tried to work hard at them, and it just so happened that Caroline liked the more standard problems and enjoy doing something she already knew over something new every day. Nothing wrong with that. As you might imagine, we to made a good team and had this kind of unwritten rules who took which tickets. Win-win-win-win. (Me, Caroline, company and client)\n\nUntil we got a new boss, Bob. He immediately noticed that I was working far fewer tickets than Caroline. I tried to explain to him how not every ticket is the same workload, but because he wasn't very tech-savvy and didn't understand half the stuff I was doing, he did not understand.\n\nAlso, around one month later, we got a huge new client and I spend a week on site and setting up all the databases and stuff they needed. This drew down my month-average ticket numbers even further, duhhh. If Bob would have only had half a brain cell he could have figured out why. Now came something I did not expect from Bob: He said we need more help on the team and he was approved to hire a forth member for our team. I was exited, we all were. We had this new huge client and things were not yet running smoothly and anyway our company was expanding fast so this actually made sense! And he specifically asked me to basically do the recruiting process and to work the new guy in (he might have figured out that he did not have a clue what we were doing I thought), which I was happy to do.\n\nThat same night Hans calls me which is weird because Hans is not a caller, he is a texter. He basically said: \"You should come over to my house tomorrow, I have some beers that need drinking.\"\n\nSo the next day I get to Hans' house and we are just talking about normal stuff, we see each other maybe once per month and have a big overlapping friend pool. But this time it was just me and him drinking beers, no other friends around.\n\nAfter some beers he mentioned that he had just updated his resume the day before and that everyone should always have an updated resume on hand. \"Do you have an up to date resume\" he asked. I felt this was a weird question and had an idea where this was going so I said no, but should I? Is there something you know about that you want to tell me?Well I am just saying that everyone should have a resume ready but I of course couldn't tell you if Bob thinks about letting you go but I also couldn't tell you if Bob is not thinking about letting you go.I thanked him very much for the beers and left shortly after that. So I know I am getting fired and I have the  suspicion  that Bob has just asked me to hire my own replacement and train him to do my job so he can take it.\n\nThis is finally where the sweet MC comes in, I fully comply with hiring a \"forth\" member of the team and also pick one best suited for what Bob wants: high ticket numbers. So I am thinking not so smart person with a sloppy attitude that does not care if the customer is happy. After all customer satisfaction was not important to Bob when he talked about my ticket numbers.\n\nI get right on it. Many people apply, some good ones, but I weed those out very quickly. Resumes with lots of spelling mistakes and little experience in the sector are the ones I invite for an interview.The interview stage is trickier because now Bob and someone from HR is sitting in with me, but I am still asking most of the questions and giving my opinions on the candidates.But because I weeded out the good ones when Bob makes a decision he just chose the best of the worst (in my opinion not even the best because one applicant was actually quite good but I asked him stupid questions that did not even make sense and when he could not answer them I made him look really bad, sorry John). I advise one candidate he ends up picking because he will work very fast and will get a lot of tickets done.\n\nAt this point I have another job lined up in 4 months time, but I wanted to get fired by Bob to get some sweet severance pay. After 2 months of training Mr.. New guy, I have just shown him how to do basic tickets (which he can do quite well and fast but makes a lot of mistakes with) and have let the hard ones slowly build up. Carl notices and as he would be the only one after my firing to be able to handle them I let him in on what I was doing. As chance will have it he had just gotten an offer from another company and since he also did not like Bob he already decided that he will take the offer but said he could sit on it a few weeks and time it with my firing for maximum destruction.\n\nThen I tell Bob I am done working in the new guy and a week later he tells me he sadly needs to let me go because my numbers had not gotten better (he actually used against me that I had not been doing that many tickets while I was training the new guy, how dumb can you even be, Bob?). He also wished me a lot of luck finding a new place to word at with my work ethic.This had been the day I was waiting for and I just thanked Bob and reminded him of the 4 months worth of severance I was owed now and also 2 month worth of vacation I had not taken and carried over and was now entitled to get paid out. As I am heading out I tell Carl what had just happened and he opens his drawer with the signed two weeks notice and walks into Bob's office.\n\nMy girlfriend had vacation time left and we decided to leave for a 4 week holiday to New Zealand the next week. I proposed to her there (as the saying goes: spend 1/4 of your severance on the engagement ring)\n\nI started my new job one month after returning from NZ and even got a nice pay bump and a good boss! I made sure to thank Hans again and he kept me in the loop on how my old department went down the drain very quick and Bob was let go some time later. When that happened they actually approached me for taking his job and I declined, but that would have been the ultimate fuck you to him...\n\nAbout 5 years later (last year) I started a company together with Hans doing much of the same thing but in a different city and so far it is going really well!\n\nTL;DR: who reads tldrs in this kind of subreddit?Boss does not understand what I do, gets me to hire my own replacement which is of course not a good fit and I get a fiance and better job out of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Spelling and formatting. You pointed out the irony of my spelling mistakes but please see my first sentence. I am sure there are still plenty of mistakes in the text. If you find them, keep them.

Except this one guy who put everything in the ticket system. Seriously anything that anyone asked him to do went into the ticket system. And he sucked out loud. He was the only one who put the number of tickets completed in his accomplishments that year. He did have the most of anyone - but he also was well-known to be the absolute worst of my analysts.

He and I went head to head so often that the HR person became the intermediary between us. One day I come in and \"Abe\" was in my office, supposedly as an \"assistant\", and I was told to show him the ropes.  After a day of him shadowing me, it's obvious that he's trying to figure out what I do in order to replace me. I had no qualms, and showed him everything. To be honest, I had zero worries when he asked \"what's ASP?\".  He lasted 2 months before the boss realized he would never be able to do what I do and fired him. It was another couple months later when we found the evidence of his embezzlement and he took his family and ran to Mexico.",
