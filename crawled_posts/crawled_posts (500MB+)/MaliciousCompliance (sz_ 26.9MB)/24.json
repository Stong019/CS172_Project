        "selftext": "This happened in a company I worked at over a decade ago.\n\nI was a technician working on large machines, we had numerous clients and were assigned to a given site. The site I worked on was across a border so I couldn't live near it, and had an hour commute each way every day. I got no expenses or mileage for this because it was my assigned site.\n\nAfter working for this company for a while I got promoted to stop doing routine maintenance and work on more complex projects. Most of these projects were on a site near where I lived so that suited me just fine. However, the company told me they didn't have any budget to increase my wage, which is where the malicious compliance came in:\n\nI combed through their rules and regs as well as my contract, and found that if you had to travel to a site that was not your assigned one, you got paid as if you had driven from your assigned site to whatever other one you were working on. My assigned site was classified as being 1.5 hours from the site that I was doing most of my work on, so I was allowed claim those 1.5 hours as hours worked on my timesheet. So every day I would put down 1.5 hours commute there, 1.5 hours commute home, and 8 hours regular work. \n\nAnything over 8 hours worked a day was paid at OT rates, so for those 3 hours \"commute\" I was getting paid 4.5 hours. Because my contract said my assigned site was site A, and I was mostly working at site B, there was nothing they could do about it and my country has pretty decent employee protections so I'd have had to agree to a contract change, which I obviously was not going to. They told me numerous times they were going to change my assigned site but until the day I quit they were never able to.\n\nThe length of my commute most days was 10-15 mins each way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - I used the company rules to get paid an extra 4.5hours each day for driving for about 25 minutes.",

            "\"We don't have the budget to officially increase your wage, but we apparently do have the budget to give you the equivalent of a 50% pay increase for weeks/months when it's classified as OT\"\n\nEither their accountants are really bad (or really stubborn) and couldn't/wouldn't shift funds around to ultimately save the company money in the long run by just giving you a raise, or the company had so much bureaucracy that getting anything done according to common sense was almost impossible so it was easier to just let you claim the OT. The latter seems more likely, since even though you were doing most of your work at Site B they still weren't able to make that your assigned site by the time you left weeks/months later.",

And, to further twist the knife, they make use of a lot of temp drivers that literally costs the company DOUBLE per hour to the temp agency what we as the permanent staff cost, so they can employ 2 drivers for the price of one temp driver. And the temp drivers only put out about 50% of the work we as permanent staff do cause they don\u2019t know the routes etc. So now all of us permanent guys are on a slow strike, only doing as much as the temp guys. We are patiently waiting for them to bring it up, cause the amount of failed deliveries are mounting at an astronomical rate\u2026",

Only allowed to do that when I needed to do something in the office.\n\nSo, it turns out I needed to do something In the office almost every day, either putting  in a mileage claim or to collect the claim (they paid cash).\n\nWe were living on the mileage allowance, didn't touch my salary, and of course the driving time was OT.\n\nThey had a rule that to claim mileage allowance you had to register a fairly new car.

            "I used to be on call 24x7 for an IT support company. The on call rate was good, but the remuneration for each call was low.  \nSince we didn't get many calls out of hours the company decided to change it round, thinking that we were being paid for doing nothing if we didn't get called - the on call rate was lowered significantly, but the payment each time we got called was increased by a lot.   \nSo you can guess what happened - suddenly the amount of calls we got out of hours increased by a large amount.  \nBecause we'd ignore the warning alerts we got during the day, which we used to address so that a critical wouldn't occur overnight.  \nSo now basically every alert went to critical out of hours.  \nThe company reversed the policy and the number of out of hours calls went down.",

This was no big deal for me, the other branch was about the same distance just in the opposite direction, so milage was about double what it took to get there. \n\nA couple of years in, me and my wife moved closer to our home town, making my drive to work a little longer, but again no big deal. \n\nMy manager covered Saturdays at a branch closer to my new house, and when she retired I immediately volunteered to take those Saturdays, really only thinking about decreasing my Saturday drive time. \n\nWell when I went to fill out my expenses I realized that I was about to claim a significant amount more on my milage. I tried to be honest and tell them it takes me about 2 minutes to get there, so I don't really need it, or just give me less.

About a year ago I was installing kitchen appliances for a high end electronics retailer. \n\nOne day we came across an order to uninstall a 10 year old dishwasher from this lady\u2019s kitchen and install her new one. Now the issue with older dishwashers is that occasionally, the homeowner will replace the floor in the kitchen with a thinker flooring and won\u2019t put it under the dishwasher. By doing this, they are essentially blocking in their existing machine. \n\nSo of course as we are disconnecting the old unit, the customer is being insanely pestering about her brand new floors and how \u201cif we break \u2018em, we buy \u2018em\u201d, so it\u2019s safe to say we weren\u2019t taking any risk (plastic floor mat, cotton globes, booties, walking to and from our truck for every tool so we don\u2019t leave any laying around). \n\nAs we are looking under the machine we see it, they raise the floor a good inch, meaning in order to remove the dishwasher, they would have to remove their flooring. \n\nYeah well she wasent having it, she went on a tirade about how we were paid to do a certain job and if we didn\u2019t do it she would have us fired yadda yadda. We insist we can\u2019t remove the machine with the floors there. So she decides to call her husband and have him come home from work, out company pays us to stay and wait for him to come and attempt to remove it so we can install the new one. Husband arrives 15 minutes later seething (match made in heaven) and blows straight into the kitchen, checks the latches, grabs the inside of the dishwasher, and YANKS the unit from the counter. Dittzlefritz didn\u2019t really think that one through, he tears up over a 6 square foot of beautiful wood flooring, leaving skid marks and blistered broken wood. \n\nIm not saying it felt good to watch, but I didn\u2019t loose money so I sure wasen\u2019t mad. \n",

She then had us grab a bunch of stuff out of a barn she had on her property, which wasn't part of the plan at all and added a significant amount of time to the whole process. She left before we were finished, telling us she didn't have any cash on her and would tip us upon delivery, which sucked because we knew we likely wouldn't be involved in that since we had several teams of guys and a lot of this stuff ended up in storage for a couple weeks before they actually moved into the new place. I talked to the guys that delivered it and she didn't tip them, either. This is a woman who lived in a *huge* house on a *huge* piece of land in Napa Valley, so it's not as if she was economically disadvantaged in any way.\n\nFunny thing is, I feel like it was the \"regular\" people we worked for (middle class types) who were more consistent (and generous) with their tips. Guess you don't get rich by \"wasting\" money on stuff like tipping the guys who just made your new life possible. \n\nOk, sorry /rant",

            "I deliver furniture, as well. I can attest for this post that it happens all-too-often. Customers feel that they need things to be 1000% perfect and don\u2019t want the delivery guys to do anything that might jeopardize or damage their furniture (even though 9/10, we know what we\u2019re doing far more than the customer). \n\nIn those [sometimes] rare instances where customers are being huge assholes and just tell you to leave it where it is (after the fact you\u2019ve made an attempt to warn them of the dangers of something getting scuffed or scratch), it\u2019s mind boggling when they turn around and complain that something went wrong. After working in this field for a while, you start to notice that there is a special breed of customers that act similar in this way. You try to do everything you can do ensure that the furniture is safe and perfect and the house is not damaged in any way. Regardless, they will find something wrong with it (even if in some cases, there is no problem). \n\nIn this case, I\u2019ve had something happen to me in the same affect. Not quite parallel to the post, but enough to understand exactly where he\u2019s coming from. At some point, the customer just has to like a self-righteous, entitled bitch. I understand that they pay thousands of dollars for their furniture and they want it to be in perfect condition, but you need to allow the delivery guys to do their jobs and trust that they will do it right. After you do something so many times, you know how things go. It\u2019s especially worse when they start insulting you. I\u2019ve been called many names as well. It\u2019s not an enjoyable feeling while you\u2019re hot and sweaty and the customer is already getting on your nerves. So at some point, if the customer wants their shit left where it is without regard for safety of their home and furniture, fine. Sign the ticket accepting the delivery and we\u2019ll be on our way. Just don\u2019t be surprised when you notice something is wrong. \n\nAll that said, I understand where you\u2019re coming from. It sucks, but there\u2019s nothing you can really do it about it. From that point on, the managers can decide how to handle it. At least they know that this lady is a massive bitch and you guys tried to do everything right.

            "I delivered furniture for years so I can share in this experience. One thing I would have done was had her sign for everything *before* we dropped it on the floor. \n\nMy favorite was delivering a king size mattress to a very old 3rd floor row home. Now, most houses won't take a king mattress cleanly save for some larger open concept homes. Some bending is usually required to get around corners or squeeze up a staircase. In most cases it is nothing the mattress can't handle. \n\nExcept in this ancient third floor row home. They ordered the largest heaviest pillow top they could find and after lugging the thing in the door my partner and I look at the stairs. The ceiling was low, I had to crouch and tilt my head to the side not to scrape it, and I'm only 6 foot. The stairs ended into a long hallway with only a few feet between the wall the stairs. Not only did the mattress not fit up the stairs, but we couldn't get the thing to angle around the corner at the top without mangling it. We'd then have to repeat the process for the next flight.   \n\nSo the guy I'm working with explains all this (and its freaking obvious to anyone with a modicum of spatial awareness) to the customer who gets heated and screams at us about being lazy and not doing our job. A whole line of profanity and insults follows. So my partner says look, we'll take it up, but you have to sign for it now. So, she finally signs realizing that yes, we will leave that shit on her first floor. \n\nNow the guy I worked with was a very large dude you just don't want to mess with. So he's like, hang on, we're not going to shove this thing up there and break our backs, I have an idea. He gets two tie downs from the truck and wraps the around the mattress and ratchets the damn thing in half. We then leisurely carry it up to the room. Once we get it there we pop the tie downs the damn mattress sits at a damn right angle. The woman was so angry I don't think she could get words out. We grabbed our things and left. \n\nShe complained to the store, but too bad for her she had signed on the dotted line which ready, all merchandise has been received in good condition. She threatened to sue but never did. I'm sure a lawyer told her she shouldn't have signed the paper. ",

The medical and law side of our course is quite extensive.\n\nSo our first week, we were informed that we would now only have \u00a35 for the whole year and our tutors weren't allowed to print off our booklets anymore. Anything over the \u00a35 we would have to pay and top up ourselves. \n\nNone of us had ever ran out of credit before, so really didn't know how much the course material cost to print. We all went to print our booklets (like 80 pages per subject) meaning our whole allowance was used after just 1 subject and we crashed all the printers on 3 different floors. \nAlso it took forever, meaning we lost a whole day of teaching. \n\nAll the class was complaining. We weren't expecting to be charged this much just for the essential coursework. \n\nI didn't even bother printing anything and went back to class. I said to the lecturers that I wasn't printing them. I said the higher ups were trying to encourage us to go paperless then so be it. I'll just download the booklets to my laptop and if anything needs filled in, I'll just be handwriting. \n\nAfter hearing about this, the rest of the class did the same. \n\nThe very next day, all of the rest of the coursework was already printed out and an apology was made lol. \n\nPoor planning.

            "Around 20 years ago, I worked with a guy named Thomas who always thought he was smarter than everyone else. He had taken an online IQ test and bragged to everyone at work about his score of 145. He tried getting all of us to take it and would ask about it every day. I finally broke down and took it just to shut him up and scored 149. Surprisingly, that did not bother him as much as I expected.\n\nThere was a girl named Kristy that also worked with us who he kept pestering to take the test. She confided to me that she had already taken it, but scored much lower than Thomas. She did not want him to know because she knew he would never let her forget. I told her to just tell him she finally took it and scored 155, because I knew that would drive him crazy.\n\nLater in the shift, Kristy tood me that she had told Thomas she had scored 155 on the test. He did not believe her. He knew, beyond a shadow of a doubt, there was no way she scored higher than him. He told her the only way he would believe her was if she sent him a screen shot of her score. I told her to let him know that she would email it to him.\n\nThat night, I went home and took the test again. I knew which questions I most likely got wrong, so it only took me a couple of tries to have the correct answers to all of the questions. I printed those out and took them to Kristy the next day. That day, she told Thomas that she forgot to email him her results but would do so the before work the next day.\n\nWhen I saw Kristy the following day, she was grinning from ear to ear. She said she had to take the test a few times to miss the right number of questions and finish in a time frame that gave her a 155 score. When she did, she emailed a screen shot to Thomas. He was very upset that she had scored higher than him.\n\nI made a point of rubbing it in when I saw Thomas that Kristy was smarter than him. He still couldn't believe it, but could not deny the \"proof\". The second time that I mentioned Kristy's higher score to him, he smugly said something like \"Well, she scored higher than you, too.\" I just looked him straight in the eye and said, \"The difference is, it doesn't bother me that Kristy is smarter than me. I know it just kills you, though.\" He went on for the rest of the day about how he couldn't believe Kristy was that smart.\n\nOnce in a while during the time I worked with Thomas, I would bring up the fact that Kristy was smarter than either one of us. He passed away a few years ago. I never did tell him what really happened.",

He refused, and made a point of announcing multiple times to \"don't feel bad when I pick this up quickly. I'm just good at this stuff.\" He insisted on running an advanced run. I told him I wasn't comfortable with my ankle the way it was but he begged and I surrendered. At the top I reevaluated and decided it was not a good idea, and took ride of shame down the lift. Needless to say, I enjoyed casually skiing up to him on my ginger lap at the bottom of the hill to help him untangle his limbs from an otherwise easily avoided crash had he taken my advice to seek lessons and start small.

To be clear, \"going around\" involves taking a lot of secondary county roads as well as a few field access roads (it's an extremely rural area), so you literally never know what kind of road conditions you're going to find along the way around. The roads may even be entirely unusable during the winter months where snow covers them.\n\nOne night, during my years on third shift, I was stopped at these tracks and decided to wait. Eventually the train moved on. I raced into the parking lot, used my key card to zip through the turnstiles, and ran to the punch clock. My clock in time was 10:30PM.\n\nThey have these biometric punch clocks that read your fingerprint to clock employees in and out. Sometimes these clocks just will not read your fingerprint. I got to the punch clock and it said \"10:30\". I'm golden. It doesn't track seconds. I entered my employee ID number and placed my finger on the sensor. Three beeps: failed read. Tried again. Three beeps. Tried once more. Three beeps. Nope, not trying again because by this time the clock was likely to tick over to 10:31 in the middle of reading my finger.\n\nWhen I got to my assigned work area, I told my team manager what happened. He said don't worry about it, he'd manually punch me in.\n\nI should have listened.  But I'm a worrier. \n\nIn the morning, when the front office people started showing back up, I went to the attendance office to confirm that my situation was all good. The office administrator decided to check my \"gate time\", and use that as the determining factor. I scanned my key card at 10:30:22 PM. That's a tardy, no-call. One full attendance point to be issued. I reiterated that it was a train stopped on the tracks, completely beyond my control. She advised me to either leave earlier (and just wait an extra half an hour for my shift to start on the majority of days) or else get a cellphone (I didn't have one at all back then) to call in with from the road next time.\n\nWell, what I did instead was start calling in absent \"just in case something comes up after I leave home but before I arrive at work\" in the evenings before leaving for work. The first few days the attendance office up front was just bemused. After weeks, they became annoyed. After months, they'd apparently complained enough and I finally got told to stop. During the course of this conversation they revealed that calling in too early before the start of your shift made it extra challenging to make sure the notice gets to the right members of management, because the message is no longer flagged as \"new\" by the time they're creating logs for the next shift.\n\nThis was great news for me. From then on, every morning before leaving the premises at the end of my shift, I used one of their phones to call in absent for my next shift that evening.\n\nThey tried to write me up for insubordination but the labor union slapped it down, pointing out that the collective bargaining agreement specifies the time we must call in by, but does not specify a time before which call-ins may not be made. Cue the huge grin across my face.\n\nI never forgot that my team manager tried to do me a solid though. If I was actually going to be late or absent for some reason, I would call that TM's desk line directly to let them know.\n\nEven long after I finally got a cell phone, I continued doing this; I'd just call-in on my way home, instead of sticking around to use their phones after my shift. Found out years and years later from some union reps that upper management never got over this. Drove them nuts that they got beat at their own game by something so simple. It didn't bring the walls crumbling down, but it was a persistent, enduring source of frustration and impotence for them. And really, knowing you can manage all of that with just a 22 second phone call a day... that's the kind of thing that gets you out of bed in the evening.\n\nTL;DR: I got full discipline for being 22 seconds late without calling in to give notice due to a stopped train blocking access to the workplace. So for the next 11 years, I called in absent from work every single day \"just in case\", then still showed up on time every time, creating a little bit of extra work for the person who decided to discipline me in the first place.\n\nEDIT: Probably the number one observation I'm seeing is that I should have just sucked it up and left for work earlier. I've commented this a couple times already, but so nobody has to dig for it: I usually left so early that I got to work before the 20 minutes prior to the start of our shifts that we were allowed to clock in. This stopped\ntrain event was a rare and unpredictable exception, but the crossing was regularly blocked for a few to several minutes by a moving train. Not to mention all the other random stuff that could come up on your way to work.",

So I asked him why are there employees who have been working here longer than a couple years, surely in that span of time it's not unusual to have at least 10 appointments (For the almighty Computer hath decreed: Woe is the man who hath more than but 10 marks, for he shall be banished from this land for all of eternity). If a point is a point why havent they been fired? \n\nSilence, frowny look, wrinkled forehead.\n\nA few months later we were very very busy for a week and they were handing out mandatory OT like a drug dealer with free samples. After my third 14 hour day in a row I fell asleep driving to work in the morning. Thank god nothing happened, but I turned around went home and called out, also saying I will not be able to work longer than my standard shift the remainder of the week. A day or 2 later the boss pulls me aside and gives me a stern, cringy, little talking to. \"Are you SURE you cant stay and sacrifice some personal time so your co-workers don't have to pick up your slack? You do a lot of good work here, but your attendence has 'raised some eyebrows' upstairs and I'd hate to be put in a decision to have to let you go.\" \n\nWell that did it. I shot back, \"Dude, we just had evaluations last week. You were in the room. There are 26 points to my name in the system, all for legitimate reasons. In fact I came prepared with a folder full of documentation and Dr notes to be prepared to fight for my job. But I didn't need it. Not only was the word attendence never uttered, but your boss said I got one of the best evaluations in the company. I got a RAISE! Call me selfish, but I intend on making it home to my family alive, with enough time left in the day to actually be a part of my family instead of feeling like I'm just a tenant in their home. We both know the point system is a useless metric intended as a tool to use as leverage over your employees who are busting their asses to make you money. My shift is over. I'm going home. If I still have a job tomorrow I'll be in, and we can have an intelligent discussion about a realistic amount of overtime I'd be able to sell you\"\n\nWork to live not vice versa. Your boss isnt gonna be at your deathbed offering comfort in your final moments. Your family will",

            "Former young worker (now middle aged worker) here:\n\nI used to aim to be there right on time. \u201cThey aren\u2019t paying me for those 15-20 minutes to be there early, so I refuse.\u201d \n\nEventually I realized the karmic penalty of that mindset. Stressed any time something unexpected happened. Flustered and breathless before I even sat down at my desk. Every morning, before my day even really got going, I was worried and anxious. \n\nOne day I just decided to aim for being there 20-30 minutes early. Waking up 20-30 minutes earlier had almost no effect on me \u2013 in other words, it was equally difficult to wake up at 6:00 than it was 6:30. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t clock in when I got to work. I\u2019d go make a big coffee. I\u2019d use the bathroom. I\u2019d tidy up a little. When start time came, I was relaxed, caffeinated, and much more zen. \n\nGetting to work early (sometimes ridiculously early) was for the benefit of me, not my employer. \n\nI own a business now, and when I\u2019m meeting a client, I arrive ridiculously early and hang out in my car listening to podcasts until it\u2019s a much more reasonable time to meet. When I fly, I get there sometimes 3+ hours early so I don\u2019t have to stress. \n\nYou have to get up and go to work anyway. Just a necessary PITA of life.

            "My old job used to have 5 minutes leeway, 6 minutes you were late. After 2 hours it was a full days absence. So if you got sick and left 2 hours and 1 minute before the end of your shift it was a full days absence., You obviously still got paid for the time you were there. But you got a point. Late was 1 point. Write up at 6 points, 3 day suspension at the 2nd time you got 9 points (although they almost never did that, it was usually just another write up to let you know you're about to hit 12) at 12 points you were fired. Every 30 days without an absence you dropped a point.\n\nSo you call in and get 1 point, you go home sick twice in the same month you now have 2 points. 30 days from the last point or half point you need to be there full shift to drop a point. It was easy to get up to 6 points even close to 12 if you got caught in traffic. It was also pretty easy to get points dropped just by showing up.\n\nI got as high as 10 points one time when I went through a rough period of sickness/depression/burnout.\n\nThe thing is, if you knew you were going to be late, say 15-30 minutes they'd just call in sick and stay home. Since you were turning a half point into a full point you could make that full point up in 30 days. If you had 6 1/2 points you'd have to wait 30 days to work off that 1.2 point anyway. Might as well sit home and watch TV. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen I left and went to Walmart. Same policy except it took 6 months of no lateness/absence to drop a point. Insane.

            "Every manufacturing company I have ever worked for eventually makes it to one of those stupid attendance point systems. The company I work for now used to let us pretty much make our own hours as long as we ensured that the work was done and we were present when support was needed. Everyone I supported had my phone number and I was almost always willing and able to help. Now we have a point system, I have been asked not to answer the phone or emails because they do not want to pay me the time to answer. Long story short, I clock in within a few minutes of time required, I clock out within a few minutes of time allowed. And I am perfectly happy with it. But I will say that productivity and morale suffer due to the inconsiderate approach the company takes towards attendance. \n\nSpecifics of the productivity; if we are in the middle of a repair and quitin' time rolls up, I bet you can guess what happens. We quit workin' talk to the next shift so they know whats going on and go home. Then the next shift repeats all the same work verifying what we said is true and then finishes the job. It takes nearly double the amount of time it would if they just let people stay on shift and get it done before they go home.

I'll try and keep it short but it is a little long.\n\nI used to be a service manager at one of the biggest locations of a popular Mexican grill. I won't say which but guac was $1.95 extra and we were required to ask everyone if they were okay paying that price.\nOne Sunday morning (our second busiest shift of the week) two of my line people called out so we were struggling to get all of our prep done before opening at 11.\n\nWe are just wrapping up when in comes Karen 10 minutes before opening through the side door marked EMPLOYEES ONLY with 15 preteen girls in tow. My cook recognizes her as she regularly comes in during the dinner shift and is extremely abusive and cruel to all the Latino workers. Karen tells me they can order whatever they want, THROWS her credit card at me and goes to sit down at a table and diddle on her phone. Now I can't ring up her order without her standing there because of the company rules and I am 30 weeks pregnant and just want to take my break. I prego waddled over to Karen's table to try and inform her of that when she literally flicks her hand at me to dismiss me. Not only have I been at the store since 7 and done two different people's jobs on top of my own, I have my son's head grinding against my pelvic bones and kicking me like crazy. I am in no mood. \n\nWhen I try to tell her again, she looks at me with what I can only describe as seething contempt and says \"What part of they can get whatever they want did you not understand? I don't care what you charge me as long as I get a receipt. Don't interrupt me again or I'll get your fat ass fired.\" Now I never cry but that almost got me. Motherhood is awesome but pregnancy suuucks. I finally manage to pick my jaw off the ground and stammer \"alright, ma'am, I'll ring up whatever they want and bring you a receipt.\" \n\nThe girls were really nice and most of them ordered double meat and they all got a bottled water and chips and guac. Every. Last. One. My cashier and I are just vibrating with glee as we ring them up and watch the bill climb to like $250. I brought the bill to Karen and was pretty excited when she didn't immediately check it. I made my own food and told the cook to come get me when the show starts. \n\nI'm halfway done eating when I see him waving to the camera, howling with laughter so I head up. Karen is foaming at the mouth SCREAMING for the manager and when she sees that that manager is me, she literally grinds her teeth and slaps her receipt on the table. She manages to choke out the word \"refund.\" The girls have all pretty much finished their food so I inform her that I won't be doing that because I would lose my job for giving away that much critical inventory (meat, guac, cheese) for free. Then I gently remind her that she told me twice that the could get anything as long as she got a receipt. She just keeps demanding a refund and calling me stupid and fat (again, pregnant). At this point, her screaming is holding up the very long line and customers are shouting at her to just leave. That's when she pushed me. F*cking hard.\n\nMy cashier caught me so I didn't fall down but two of our regulars, who are police, see it and immediately cuff her. In this state, any use of physical force against a pregnant woman is classified as aggravated battery or something like that. I felt bad for the kids and I was fine so I kept telling them I didn't want to press charges but they said that at that point it didn't matter because the woman had done it in front of on duty officers so she getting arrested. They had to call the kids parents to come get them because she was their CHURCH'S YOUTH LEADER and get statements. My GM came in and let me go home with a full day's pay. She tried to take the case to trial but they had video and like twenty witness statement so she ended up taking a couple years probation or something. All because I did exactly what she told me to.\n\nEdit: TLDR; Entitled Karen gets a bill she didn't want, gets arrested for pushing a pregnant woman.",

            ">  I didn't want to press charges but they said that at that point it didn't matter because the woman had done it in front of on duty officers so she getting arrested. \n\nTechnically victims don't actually get to make the decision to press charges. But in many cases, without the victim's co-operation (e.g. testimony) there's not enough evidence so if the victim doesn't want to proceed they let it drop. In this case, they had all the evidence they needed without you.",

            "Ah yes, that love for all mankind thing Jesus was talking about.\n\nFunny thing is, the worst customers I have ever dealt with, worked for churches. I used to do billing support for a cell company. I was in a management position and was reviewing a call of one of the agents. The caller was the most abusive person I have every heard on a call. The first 10 minutes of the call was this jerk berating and insulting the agent who was only trying to get the guy's phone number. This was in the mid-2000's and the computers wouldn't automatically bring up the account. We needed the phone number to get to the account.\n\nAfter the 10 minutes of pure abuse, jerk finally gives the number. I bring up the account and the name was \"For Christ Ministries\". The jerk, was the pastor. The poor agent struggled through another 15 minutes of abuse as he tried to help the jerk. After the call, I brought it to the attention of my boss. Her jaw dropped as she was listening to it. I then pulled a few other calls of the jerk's and found this happened every time. I went through the account and found pages upon pages of notes of agent reporting abusive behaviour.\n\nI made a report and we filed it with corporate. 2 days later my boss got a call. She came to me and told me to contact the jerk. Inform him that effective immediately, we are deactivating his account. Once I have inform him, deactivate the account. We fired him as a customer. I gladly called him and j teoduced myself as a manager in the company. I informed him that due to his repeated abusive behaviour, we are firing him. He started yelling at me and I cut him off. \"Sir, this is exactly why we are deactivating your account. Learn to behave like an adult. Our agents will be instructed to hang up on you immediately. Have a good day.\" and hung up. I then left a note that immediately opens when you bring up the account saying to hang up on the customer immediately.\n\nFor the rest of the day, random agents got a call from him. They hung up within 2 minutes of the call. It ended up being a morale booster for the floor. As for the agent who had 25 minutes of non stop abuse and took it like a champ. We bought him lunch for a week, ordered it in and everything. He was happy with that.",

One day, he and his company went to a company drinks. I don\u2019t think it was exactly a company party, but it was more than an after-work drink at the pub. \n\nAnyway, the bar was serving aperitifs, and my dad asked for his without ice, as he hates ice tainting his drink. The landlord, who was behind the bar, refused, and said the ice was mandatory. So he served my Dad\u2019s with ice. Dad accepted it, took the ice out, and laid it on the drain rack that goes under the beer draughts.\n\nThe landlord ordered him to leave.\n\nMy Dad was half expecting it, but asked him to repeat himself. The landlord once again told him to leave.\n\nMy Dad said \u201cOkay,\u201d and started to leave.\n\nAnd his company all started to file out after him.\n\nThe landlord protested \u201cNo no, you don\u2019t all have to leave. Only he has to leave.\u201d\n\nOne of the other staffers said something along the lines of \u201cSorry mate. He\u2019s the big boss. We all go where he goes.\u201d\n\nSo they all left and went to another bar. \n\nThey had made a reservation at the bar they were leaving, but they hadn\u2019t put down any deposit for it, and hadn\u2019t bought any drinks yet. The aperitifs had been complimentary, so the Landlord didn\u2019t even get paid for those.\n\nEdit: this is something that keeps getting flagged up, which is a valid point I didn\u2019t explain properly.

They're the Ariats and oil stained white shirt types.\n\nWe went to a decent italian place and when he tried to place a $1000 deposit they immediately told him to leave because they 'dont want our type ruining the reputation' of their restaurant before he could even finish talking.\n\nHe basically laughed, showed him the cash and said 'thats too bad, this could've been yours. Maybe o you don't like this type of clientele you shouldn't have opened a restaurant in West Texas.\"\n\nWe left, went to a steakhouse instead, and that was the first time I've ever had Surf and Turf, and he left a massive tip for the other place for not discriminating us.",
            "Similar-ish story.  When I was living in San Francisco there was this bar in the Mission let's call it Z which was well known for letting people smoke weed they brought themselves (this was during the medical cannabis years prior to full recreational legalization) because most of the bar was outdoor seating with rows of wooden picnic tables, port-o-potties, etc.  A real classy joint.  Well, they were also pretty well known for just randomly tossing people for smoking said weed or really for any transgression they deemed worthy at that moment.  Getting thrown out of Z at the time was almost a right of passage for a 20-something living in the city.  Well, one spring day my larger group of friends all decided to meet up at Z and we locked down an entire long set of picnic tables.  We hadn't even ordered our food yet and only maybe 2 of 15-20 people had ordered drinks when two of my friends who were seated at the end of the table got selectively tossed and rather rudely even for Z.  So the entire group was like fuck that and got up and left.  The last thing I saw as we walked out the door was the bar manager chewing out the bouncer who tossed us because he had just thrown out by far the biggest group in the place at the time right before all of us were about to order dinner, drinks, etc.  We laughed and took our business down the street.",

Apparently there is a campus wide rule of \"no shots\" to curtail binge drinking on campus.\n\nWe were having drinks at the hotel bar (a beer and a shot) and the shot had to be served in a rocks glass with ice and had to be drank slowly (like multiple sips).

So the leader says, 'either you give us those free drinks or we all leave' the manager or whoever she was talking to looks at her and her 5 others and says 'guess you better leave'. So tour leader yells through the door that we are leaving and the manager watches his club empty of a bunch of hard drinking alcoholic tourists. The best part? On the way next door the tour guide ran into a second tour group and told them the story, so there went another 40 ish customers.

I've never been late paying it, have occasionally made extra payments, never had any issues.\n\nBut this new company wants to charge me a $14.95 \"convenience\" fee to take a payment online.  This is absolutely stupid.  I can make a payment over the phone and pay another fee, or I can mail a check/money order for no fee.  Also, I can set up auto-pay, giving them access to my bank account, but that's a hard no from me.\n\nSo, I went online and my bank has a neat bill pay service where you can set it to repeat weekly, monthly, etc.\n\nTook the montly payment, rounded it up a bit, then set my bank to cut them a check every week for a bit over 1/4th the amount.  Doesn't cost me a dime - I don't even pay postage.  I'm sure the money comes out of the account a little earlier than the mortgage company actually gets it, losing me a tiny bit of interest or something, but man, it makes me feel better that for trying to charge me $15 for what is essentially an automated process for them, they now get to process 4-5 checks a month.  And, sure, I'm sure they have that whole process down to an art for minimal human interaction... but it's not zero.\n\nI really wanted to press my luck and send 1/30th of the payment every day, but I figured my bank might cut me off at that point.\n\n*edit* Wow.

Then he advised him to pay it monthly by check for about $0.54.  After about a year, the bean counters at the mortgage co. told the customer service person to call my friend and make him a slightly lower penalty offer to pay the rest(I\u2019m thinking it was about $200 plus the balance).  He declined, then strung them along for another year.  Same thing, they called to offer him only a $150 penalty, plus the balance.  He declined again, went about his business and was still paying them $0.54/month.  Midway through the third, they caved, he accepted their no penalty offer and wrote them the check for the balance.  He sent it via US Mail with signature of receipt returned to him.  He loves telling that story and in the end he didn\u2019t pay them a cent of their silly prepayment penalty.",

        "selftext": "Before we begin dear readers, a brief bit of backstory.\n\nI have found that every company has a Todd. You will know who your Todd is, because he is who you call when you don't know who to call. When the unthinkable happens and everything is on fire and there is no hope of salvation, Todd steps in to fix it. Todd spends his entire time just fixing the unfixable. He has been with the company since the dawn of time, knows the true names of several demons, and was in the room when the old magic was written. \n\nOur Todd has an elite team to be on call when stuff breaks. Each team member is the highest authority in the company for one specific thing or another. They are the elite. Their word is law and to question them is to question Todd.\n\nOur story begins shortly after I had accomplish greatest goal, and became the newest member of Todd's team. \n\nNow my company works with point of sale. We sell computers, software, printers, card readers, and pretty much anything you need to take money from someone else. \n\nAfter years working in the call center, I proved myself worthy of Todd's attention. I interviewed, tested, and became the specialist of Third Party Integration. My focus is the connection between our product, and whatever wierd stuff your company wants to use.\n\nExamples of this include getting smart lights to change on command from ordering kiosks, letting the staff control the new jukebox you bought with their employee ID cards, or getting the sales data for the day to report to your canadian counterparts in both French and English, but only if someone buys the poutine-saurus surprise that day. And other fun conundrums that only the client can fathom. \n\nIt is important to note that during my time in the call center, I was paid hourly. As a specialist, I would be made a salaried employee, and would be on call. After accepting the position,  I was told that I would have a trial period of one month to prove myself. I would remain hourly, but would have a pay increase to more closely match my expected rate as a salaried employee. I would have the title change and new responsibilities of my job, but I had this month to prove I was worth the extra denaro. \n\nThe first day of my new job. We get a call from one of our more needy clients. They lay out a series of demands\n\n1) all of their stores must be upgraded to Windows 10.\n2) as each store makes about $10k a day, taking them down for a remodel is not acceptable. \n3) All of these upgrades must be done overnight while the store is closed.\n4) if the upgrade fails, the store must be rolled back that night so thet can open hourly.\n5) the window of time to do one of these upgrades is eight hours\n6) the fastest they have been able to do one is ten hours.\n\nAll of this means one thing. They need a specialist to do the upgrades. One that knows their integration. I give Todd the \"Put me in Coach\" nod and a deal is struck. Todd is about to leave on vacation, which leaves me under the control of Steve, the director of The Support Center, who used to be my boss before i worked for Todd.\n\nI am now on overnights. Four nights a week I upgrade these stores. I supervise two to three technicians who are on site in seperate stores. I do all the software. They do the hardware. \n\nThis process is staggered based on timezones, so I generally am pulling twelve hour shifts. The OT is amazing, especially paired with the raise I got.\n\nFast forward a week or two. The initial batch does not go the best. I have a 40% failure rate. This is due to scripts provided to both the client and me by the various third party companies used by the stores, including their music, food delivery, and credit card processors. Everyone on their side knows who is the bad guy here. Talks are in place and we are moving forward. \n\nA meeting between the client and us is schedualed near the end of the week, right in the middle of my off time. As I said I am working twelve hours a day. I live a full hour from work, and for security reasons can't do these upgrades outside the office. I have ten hours to eat, sleep, get up, and eat again before work. Once I get to work, there are no breaks on the upgrade train. No lunch, no stopping. So i get home around 11 am each day. The meeting is set for 4 PM. I can't get any reasonable sleep, before the meeting or after. Steve demands that I be there to account for my failures. I already have another specialist designed as my proxy for these sort of meetings, because sleep is a thing. I also explain that I am still hourly, but he wont hear it. He insists that I need to be there to explain why the project is going so poorly, and that my explanation better not just be throwing other people under the bus. He tries to explain that i am salaried and therefore need to be there when the company needs me. Especially when I am the one who is screwing up. Again I try to remind him of my probationary period but he won't listen. \n\nAnd there my friends, begins the malicious compliance.\n\nI clock in at 10pm the day before the meeting. I do my upgrades, all three of which are successes, due to what I assume is a change in the third party back end. The scripts I am provided with work perfectly this time, and all goes well. The corporate contact I report to in the morning tells me the meeting is just to go over the new changes to procedure we went through that might, and I will get the cliffsnotes in my email. No need to attend the meeting. I thank them and sign out. Then I sit. For six hours I twiddle my thumbs, take a lunch break, (and a car nap) and wait for the meeting. When its time, I walk ipstairs to the top floor and the conference room, where everyone but Steve is shocked to see me. I calmly take my place and wait for the meeting to start, stating that I was asked to be here. \n\nThe meeting lasts 30 minutes, and consists of the new procedure, praise for my dillagence, and a quick overview of how the time table will change because of the past failures. It is noted that my performance has prevented a lot of the sites from failing when they would have otherwise, and the client is pleased with my work. Steve, who had previously blamed me for the failures, sheepishly agrees that I was a good fit for the project. Then the meeting ends with the best part. The person giving the talk states that she knows I am asleep right now, so she will go over the changes with me personally when I get in tonight. Meanwhile, the guy I asked to sit in on the meeting for me will work with them to set up the changes to be deployed, (about three hours of work) so that it's all ready when I get in at ten. The meeting ends. Steve makes a comment about the changes being done by someone with more experience and hints that it should be my responsibility. I cheerfully say that rather than waste my co-workers time, I will just do the changes myself. I have my third or fourth wind by now, and am ready to go. \n\nAt the end of day two, I have spent 36 hours at work. Caffeine is my only salvation, and we are almost done. Near the end, I am basically waiting for a technician at my last store to finish testing, so I tell him to call me, and shut my eyes for about half an hour, just to rest a bit. All is well. I get called, everything is green. The vigil is over. Two of my friends insist on driving me home, where I promptly pass out into the most heavenly sleep I have had in ages. \n\nI wake up to an email, asking me to head into work for a meeting with HR. It is my day off, so I am kind of perplexed. I head on in, and apologize for being fashionably late. The meeting is with the head of HR, who has a report that I was sleeping on the job. There is camera footage of my 30 minute power nap.\n\nI calmly explain that Steve had asked me to show up to the meeting, and then asked me to stay later to set up the changes, and by the time I took my nap (during what I called my paid 30 minute break) I had been in the building for 35 hours. I politely remind the HR head that I am on my trial period, and will be expecting overtime pay for that time. It came out to about 33 hours and change, due to my extended lunch break. \n\nTodd returned from his vacation and tore Steve a new definition of duties. From then on he would not be given control over Todd's team when he was away, and we would report directly to the CEO. The project completed without much incident. And I passed my probation with flying colors.\n\nEdit: a bit more info, since people are asking. Steve would later be fired several months later due to a similar situation where he threw someone so hard under the bus that everyone stopped and saw how uncool that was. He was replaced with new Steve, who is a superior Steve in every way.",

        "selftext": "The Background: This happened a few hours ago. I work at a large chain of pizza restaurants. Let's call it Pominos Dizza. Like most places, we get a few prank calls a week from pre teens. Usually it doesn't bother me and I'll go along with it because it gives me something to do when it's slow. But being a Friday night, we were busy and I wasn't having it. Me will be me, and K will be kid.\n\nThe events:\n\nMe: Hi thanks for calling Pominos Dizza, how can I help you tonight?\n\nK: *trying but not succeeding in holding in his laughter* Hey is Mr Wall there?\n\nMe: Um no sir there isn't one that work here.\n\nK: What about Mrs. Wall?\n\nMe: Nope none of those either\n\nK: Then how is your building standing up?!\n\nK: *laughter from him and background*\n\nThis went on a couple more times with classics such as \"can I place an order to your sisters house?\" And the CLASSIC \"is your refrigerator running? Then you better go get it!!!\"\n\nFinally I had had enough. I let the kids know I was done playing games.\n\nMe: alright look it says here that your dad's name is *dads name* (we keep names and addresses of past customers and their orders in the computer for future orders just to speed up the process) If you don't stop this I'll give him a call and let him know what's been going on.\n\nUsually this would stop the kids. I knew it did back in my earlier days of being a dumb kid. But some people just can't be bothered and have to push the envelope a bit too far.\n\nK: I know you won't. Go ahead and call him.\n\nOh boy he didn't have to ask me twice. I hang up the phone and get back to work for a little bit, knowing that the kid will be camped at the phone to answer it for the next 15 minutes or so.\n\nThe compliance: I get back to work, free of prank calls from the kid. I should of left it there, having solved the problem, but hey the customer is always right and at Pominos Dizza we always give the customer what they want.\n\nAfter the supper rush is done, around 45 minutes to an hour later I fulfill the request. I'm still me, D is dad.\n\nMe: Hello this is u/kushlord666 from pominos, how are you doing tonight.\n\nD: not too bad, what's the reason for the call?\n\nMe: unfortunately, we've been getting a number of calls from this number. We're really busy and its pushing customers away because of the wait times. Can you please have a talk with who I assume is your son and ask him to knock it off?\n\nD: Oh goodness I'm so sorry I'll have a chat with him and his buddies.\n\nMe: Thank you so much and thanks for choosing pominos!\n\nAt this point I think the story is done. Kid will get a talking to, won't do it again and that'll be the end of it. Boy was I mistaken.\n\nAround 30 minutes later a man and a chubby kid around 12 years old come into the store. I don't think much of it, thinking they're just getting a few slices for a snack. They come up to the counter and ask for u/kushlord666. \n\nMe: Yes I'm u/kushlord666\n\nD: I think my son has something to say to you.\n\nThe kid is visibly nervous. He keeps looking around the store, won't look me in the eye.\n\nK: I'm very sorry for calling you, I know you're busy and it won't happen again.\n\nThen to further the awkward suffering of the kid who I kind of feel bad for at this point, the dad places an order for carry out, and sits in our small eatery section where the kid has to try and avoid eye contact with me for the next 20 minutes. Left me a good tip too.\n\nAt pominos dizza, the customer always gets what they want.\n\nTl;Dr: Kid prank calls my store while I'm busy, dares me to call his parents. I give him what he wants. Gets forced by angry father to come in and apologize and brood in awkward suffering as I make them their pizza, while I got the last laugh and a 50% tip.\n \n",
