        "selftext": "This happened some months after I got my drivers license. I (at the time 19f) was driving through an 8 lane roundabout when a car struck me.\n\nThis is a horrible roundabout with lots of traffic, very fast and there are no lines on the ground to see who crossed who. \n\nAnyway, I get out to see the damage and the guy driving the other car comes out screaming at me, cursing and yelling that I am a \u201estupid girl\u201c. It\u2019s my first accident and I\u2018m scared and almost want to cry from the shock of the accident, but my little cousin is in the car and I don\u2019t want to scare her.\n\n\nAs I\u2018m walking around trying to take pictures of the car, the guy keeps yelling at me that it is my fault. He threatens to call the police and \u201ehave me arrested\u201c because I am a \u201edanger\u201c. He says how he will tell them that he was \u201egoing straight\u201c and I was turning!! He keeps repeating it until I realise what he is saying: driving straight\u2026 on a roundabout?\n\n\nCue malicious compliance: \nI tell him not to worry with the police, he is completely right, he was just going straight and it was me who was going around. Lets sign an accident statement!\n\nHe is inmediatly on board, writes it and signs!\n\nLater at the insurance office they told me they don\u2018t normally have such easy cases. My damages were paid in full and they even gave me a replacement car while mine was getting repaired! Such a stupid girl!\n\n\nEDIT: Hi guys! Thanks for the comments and awards! I thought I could explain a few things that keep coming up in the comments:\n\n-He didn\u2019t go straight through the middle on the roundabout, he sort of went tangent to the inner circle, if that makes sense, the shortest route crossing all lanes, which could have ended much worse (came in straight to the inner lane and then  tried to leave straight out) I know it\u2019s hard to imagine if you\u2019ve never seen a 6-8 lane roundabout.\n\n-No, I\u2019m not going to post the sketch. Sorry, guys, I think the comment section would turn into a traffic debate about who was at fault, etc. \n\n-It is not in Paris",

            "My wife was in an accident once. I wasn't there, but the way she described it she was turning left on a green arrow, and a car from the opposing direction was making a right turn on red (legal, if traffic is clear) onto the same street and direction my wife was turning onto. Apparently, neither saw the other, and boom.\n\nNow, my wife says the driver was probably in his early 20's. My wife had started taking photos of both cars when the other driver said he didn't have time to exchange information like drivers licenses or insurance, and that he was in a hurry to get to work, so he asked for her phone number, sent her a text, and said \"Ok, you have my phone number. We'll talk later.\" He got back into his car and took off. My wife came home and told me what happened. While we were talking, she got a call from the number the driver had given her. I heard some yelling on the other end so I asked my wife to hand the phone to me.\n\nFirst thing, my wife said this didn't sound like the same guy. I admit, this guy sounded more like he was in his mid 50's. He gave me a name and license number, but refused to give me his insurance info because he insisted it was my wife's fault. He then went on a tirade about how dangerous my wife was behind the wheel, and that she should have her license revoked for life, and even go to jail for causing this accident. I listened patiently, and then said \"You were making a right on red?\" He said yes. I said \"My wife was making a left on a green arrow. It's automatically your fault.\" He began to resume his tirade about my wife's \"dangerous driving\", but I interrupted him and said \"When this goes to court, is my wife going to identify you as the man who was driving the other car? Will the witnesses whom she collected information from also identify you?\" Now, my wife didn't actually have witnesses, but knowing the driver left immediately he would have no way of knowing whether people stepped forward after he left. The man paused for a moment and said \"Are you saying I'm lying?\" I said \"My wife says you sound much older than the person who was driving the car. I'm suspecting it was your son rather than you. I'm also suspecting he doesn't have a license, which is why he wouldn't exchange information at the scene. You're hoping to make us believe it was you rather than your son because you have a license and insurance.\" He shouted \"YOUR WIFE SHOULD BE IN JAIL!\", to which I responded \"AND YOU LEFT THE SCENE OF AN ACCIDENT! THAT'S CALLED HIT AND RUN!\"\n\nDead silence for about 10 seconds, and then he hung up.\n\nWe gave what information we had to our insurance company. They figured out who it was from the license plate number (fortunately, my wife got a photo of it), as well as the phone number she received. She had comprehensive insurance, which covered her repairs except for a deductible. That deductible was later refunded when we learned the other driver was not insured, and my wife's uninsured motorist coverage kicked in. The guy who called us was, indeed, the driver's father.",
            "When I was 17 I was driving on a state highway in my little two door POS.\n\nOn a county road that crosses the highway, not an intersection but rather where that road had stop signs, a big pickup truck heading to cross the highway pulled up to their stop sign as I was coming up toward that spot on the highway. They paused at the stop sign for not even a moment, then went to cross the highway without any hesitation. I stepped on the brakes and swerved to miss them, but I clipped the back corner of the truck. My tiny little car mostly went under the truck\u2019s rear end like a wedge, and my bumper didn\u2019t even hit anything. Their giant steel bumper stabbed into my hood and destroyed my engine while crumpling my windshield. My airbag didn\u2019t go off, but I was wearing my seatbelt and was fine.\n\nThe impact spun me around to where my car was pointed away from the truck. You couldn\u2019t see any damage to my car from the back, but it was totaled. The truck pulled on to the county road on the other side of the highway and stopped. I ran over to them to see if they were ok, and I found an old ass man looking at a small dent on the corner panel above the steel rear bumper of his 3500 farm truck. He immediately says to me \u201cSorry I didn\u2019t see you coming there, the damage doesn\u2019t look too bad, do you want to just forget about it and not worry about insurance?\u201d I told him \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d and called the police.\n\nA state trooper was there within a minute or two and talked to us separately, starting with the old man. The cop told me the old man said his wheels were spinning on gravel strewn across the road and he couldn\u2019t get across fast enough. I said \u201cyou think he had trouble with a little gravel in *that* vehicle?\u201d and the cop just laughed. So I told the cop what the old man said right after the accident, that he didn\u2019t see me coming and asked if I wanted to just forget about the accident because he hadn\u2019t seen the damage to my vehicle. Then I got to watch from across the road as the old man threw a fit to the officer, shouted some nonsense at me, and finally got in his truck and stormed off.\n\nThe cop gave me a ride home, the old man\u2019s insurance paid me $1,000 more for my car than I was expecting, and within a week I had a nicer car, a new video game, and a big bag of weed.",

He gets out raving \u201cI have a backup camera! I will sue!\u201d My insurance said he later filed for medical injury claims, despite the fact that neither of our bumpers were even dented. I told my insurance company that the guy said he had a camera, can we use that? They said \u201cwe can\u2019t get it unless he uses it\u201d. So he did. No points on my license, his insurance paid damages to my car.",

Officer arrives and the other driver goes right to the cop gesticulating and talking loudly about what happened and when he was done the cop said: \"SHE HAD THE RIGHT OF WAY\"\nHe even said it was irrelevant how fast I was going (which I knew I wasnt; the exit was only about 20 feet away and I was slowing down,as it was a regular exit point for me so i had a habit of coasting to it. In fact, when he hit me because I didn't have my foot on the gas pedal or brake I panicked and hit the gas then brake as I tried to process what had happened).\nI regret not suing him but I didn't have to pay for the repairs at least.",

While waiting for police, I give the person who was clearly NOT at fault my card and tell them I saw the whole thing.  As I leave I try to get a word with the person causing the accident say something to the effect of \"Don't try to lie about this and try to get out of your responsibility for this.  I saw the whole thing, and I'm reporting it to both of your insurance companies.\"  \n\nI've been wrecked before and hauled away in an ambulance before I could give my statement to anyone.  My car was totaled making a left turn on a 2 way road.  I was stopped and began my turn, and the guy hit me FROM THE REAR and left side of my car.  He wasn't paying attention and swerved left to avoid me as I started turning.  Clearly his fault, but my insurance didn't care, they just took the police report and ran with it.  The fucker who hit me lied and said I turned into him.  I tried and tried to get the police report to reflect what actually happened, and tried to get my insurance to listen, but no.  They suck.  My insurance had to pay for both cars.\n\nFor anyone wondering, Safeco.\n\nAfter that, I had a bit of hail damage, got some people out to get estimates and whatnot, and they Safeco had to pay $48,000 to replace my roof, siding, shed roof and siding as well, and some of the soffit and gutters.  Made my day.  \n\nThe car accident cost me about $5000 with my deductible, what the insurance gave me to replace the car, medical expenses (physical therapy) and the cost of another 5 year loan.

We used to provide the aquarium with rare fish and people used to drive from 2-3 states over if they were true \"fish people\" to come buy from us. \n\nI (at the time 17F) was an expert in tropical fish and koi. In fact, it was my job that summer to be the koi and outdoor pond point person, and my job was not only stocking the ponds, but managing all the plants, caring for them, and knowing every bit of information and all the prices of the various koi and goldfish we had. I knew diets, temperature ranges, places of origin, special breeds, I knew it all. They even would call me with questions on my days off. \n\nThat clearly did not matter to one customer though. He came inside the store and asked for some help with koi outside. I happily agreed as I was the only person not on my lunch break. \n\nNow this guy frankly seemed put off by me offering to help. So instead of buying anything, he decided to quiz me for 20 minutes about the koi, goldfish and pond plants to try to get me to admit I didn't know something. I answered every single one of his stupid questions (some really were stupid) and at the end of the 20 minutes he had the balls to say \"\"Can I talk to someone who KNOWS THINGS? Like a MAN?\" Full emphasis in tone on those words too. \n\n\"Sure you can,\" I say with a fake smile \"let me get 'John' for ya\" \n\nHere's the malicious compliance. \"John\", name changed, was 75, retired, annoying as hell and batshit crazy. My boss didn't even want him to be hired but he owed John a favor. Now John is an expert in goldfish, but he hates koi and outside ponds. John also like I said, is really annoying, and crazy but he had a soft spot for me so we always would chat. \n\nI went inside to find John, and explained to him that this customer wanted a man to talk to. John asked me why he wanted to speak to a man when I was the pond point person, and I told him that he clearly just didn't like that he was speaking to a girl.

        "selftext": "A number of years ago I worked for a small, fairly local outsourcing company. I was assigned to work with a particularly high-profile client of theirs. The client's office was just around the corner from my employer, but my employer insisted that I remain within their own offices to work, so the client provided me with a laptop to use that connected to their network remotely. It's important to note that whilst the client were decent, my employer had a totally fear-based management culture. The managers wanted eyes on the employees at all times because they assumed people would slack off given half the chance.\n\nAfter almost a year of working there, I got a call from the client notifying me that my client-given laptop needed some critical updates, and I would have to bring it in so IT could apply the updates locally. All sounded very reasonable to me. \n\nI brought this to the attention of my manager and advised I would be out of the office for a while so I could take my laptop to the client site around the corner for critical updates. No bueno. My manager ignored everything about the 'critical updates' part and focused instead on the 'out of our office for 2 hours' part. They insisted that they knew I had a remote connection to the client's office, so any updates could be applied without me needing to leave and take my laptop anywhere. I got the impression they thought I was lying to get some free time off. \n\nI decided that this had the potential to teach my employer / the managers a great lesson about not trusting their own employees, so like the model employee I was, I shrugged \"you know best boss\", and complied with their request, continuing working as usual. Until the following morning, when I switched on my laptop and nothing would work. The machine refused to connect to the client's remote network. The various software applications I used for my job also wouldn't run due to the lack of connection. Error messages flashed up on every file I tried to access, warning that my credentials had been blocked. I was left holding a very expensive brick.\n\nMy manager was livid when I explained I couldn't do any work. They clicked around on my laptop trying to fix it themselves, but there was no other solution to be had. They sent me around the corner to the client's office so I could hand in my laptop to IT. I took my time enjoying a coffee and breakfast in the client's onsite cafe whilst IT worked on my laptop, but when I went to check on it after an hour I believe the client IT manager's words were \"it's fucked.\" The critical update mentioned before was intended to repair something wrong with the way the remote connections worked. When my machine didn't get the update, it lost connection with the client's network and immediately locked me out of everything, effectively blacklisting my credentials. IT manager explained that they would have to build me an entirely new machine and set up new accounts, a process that would take about a week to ensure everything filtered through correctly and could be tested.\n\nThe client was fine and understanding about it, but when I returned empty-handed to my employer's office my manager got extremely snotty with me and insisted I still had to work somehow. I pointed out that I had no client laptop to work on, so instead of sending me home they forced another employee to share her computer with me. For the next week, me and my colleague shared her computer, one hour each at a time. As I had no access to any of my files, client data etc, all I could do was the barest minimum of work, sending a few emails from my colleague's account. \n\nAfter a week I got my new client laptop and things went back to normal, but the week of sharing meant my employer had lost around 40 hours of productivity from 2 employees. The shared pain of the experience with my colleague brought us closer together, and when my employer lost their contract with my client a few years later, she helped me get a new job with my employer's competitor. \n\nTL;DR: Manager doesn't want to let me out of the office for 2 hours to get critical updates applied to my client laptop. They lose 40 hours over the next week instead when my client laptop bricks itself.",

She ran the store and I worked under her running the shipments/stocking department. \n\nShe would create extra work to validate my staff was doing their job, but then not trust them to do the validating task itself. My staff had to read reports every 45-60 minutes then make decisions on those reports about putting out the right product. \n\nFor example, if we needed to put out 100 t-shirts today, if the report says we already put out 120 then stop, if it says we put out 80 - let\u2019s put a few more out. \n\nI wanted to create a laminated poster in the processing area that said the targets.

One of the beer taps went dry and the keg needed to be changed so I left the bar (there was another bar tender there working with me) to go down and change the keg.\n\nOf course one of the managers asked where I was going and i said that I needed to change the keg. She said no you don\u2019t leave the bar ever - first I hear of that rule. She said I am to ask her or the other manager to change it. I went back to the bar and waited. I said nothing.\n\nThe customer was waiting for his beer for a solid 15 minutes until my manager came into the bar and she completely forgot about the keg. I HAD to remind her and she just goes oh shit and runs down and changes it. Had to give the beer for free to the guy of course.

        "selftext": "This happened about 10 years ago now, and I have a good chuckle about it every time I pass the place in my car. I'm a pretty meek guy, so this is probably the only rebellious thing I did in my entire teenage life.\n\nMy Dad owns a farm, and, being his son, this meant that I had a job when I was a kid whether I liked it or not. \n\nMostly I understood this, but that didn't mean I had to like it. I resented having to spend entire days of summer vacation, dawn to dusk, in a tractor when it came time to harvest alfalfa, which we did ~4 times between spring and fall. Basically imagine a teenager with ADHD forced to sit in one place for 14 hours, and you'll understand how it felt. Honestly, if I wasn't a total introvert, I might have snapped sooner.\n\nSo anyway, it's the second day of harvest, and it\u2019s getting to be late in the afternoon. I've spent about 20 hours total in a haybine by this point over the past few days, and I ask my dad which fields to cut next, and I ask him when I'll be done, hoping (in vain) that I can leave and go play video games or whatever. \n\nThis is where the titular line comes in: \"I'll pick you up at dark.\" Little does he know that my little teenage heart is clenchijg with rightous anger for all this wasted (paid) time.\n\nSo several hours pass, and I'm understandably getting pretty irritable. It starts getting dark, and guess what? No sign of my dad. At the time, it was becoming a bit of a recurring joke in my family about how my dad was always late, so I knew I was in for the long haul.\n\nThen it occured to me, and the malicious compliance begins. My dad said he'd pick me up at dark, and he wasn't picking me up, so that must mean that it wasn't dark yet. And what *don't* you need if it's not dark outside? That's right. Headlights.\n\nSo I continue going back and forth on this wide, empty field, squinting as the light continues to fade after sunset and stubbornly refuse to turn on the headlights. I can easily see the edges of the field of course, but everything else is blending in pretty well. I start purposely amd accidentally leaving some sharkfins, which are what we call the mistakes that haybine operators leave between rows when the don't get any alfalfa. A few small sharkfins per field are fine, even expected, but these are on a whole new level.\n\nMy dad shows up after about 30 minutes of total darkness. I forget our exact conversation, but I do remember the result. After asking me why I didn't turn on the lights, and me telling him why, he laughed uproariously, and I still remember it fondly to this day.\n\nI mever did get any punishment. I'm not even sure he understood the extent of the missed alfalfa, it was dark after all and it was hard to see in the dim moonlight, but whatever, it was just a few rows. I, however, like to think he was a little proud of me, because I was the type of teenager who *never* got into mischief.\n\nI asked him about it recently, and unfortunately he has no memory of the incident. Oh well. I, however, will probably remember this little bit of malicious compliance fondly for the rest of my life. It might have been pretty insignificant, and motivated by laziness, but it was also the first time I really stood up for myself against am authority figure.",

            "Ironically, this is actually the *opposite* of traditional theology. In the Abrahamic religions, God technically *isn't* good or powerful or any other description like that, because God is beyond these terms, and they are not worthy of Him. God is ineffable, and these descriptions are only applied as an analogy.\n\nBy saying that these terms *do* define God, even if they find only God, they have actually *reduced* God and are committing blasphemy. Doubly so, considering literally the first thing God does in scripture is create stuff and declare it \"good.\"\n\nIn other words, this \"super religious family\" are technically heretics.\n\n---\n\nEdit: For a good example of this, here's a quote from Augustine, who basically defined all of modern Christian theology (e.g. trinity, original sin, the incarnation, etc):\n\n>>Have I spoken of God, or uttered His praise, in any worthy way? Nay, I feel that I have done nothing more than desire to speak; and if I have said anything, it is not what I desired to say. How do I know this, except from the fact that God is unspeakable? But what I have said, if it had been unspeakable, could not have been spoken. And so God is not even to be called unspeakable, because to say even this is to speak of Him. Thus there arises a curious contradiction of words, because if the unspeakable is what cannot be spoken of, it is not unspeakable if it can be called unspeakable. And this opposition of words is rather to be avoided by silence than to be explained away by speech. And yet God, although nothing worthy of His greatness can be said of Him, has condescended to accept the worship of men's mouths, and has desired us through the medium of our own words to rejoice in His praise. For on this principle it is that He is called Deus (God). For the sound of those two syllables in itself conveys no true knowledge of His nature; but yet all who know the Latin tongue are led, when that sound reaches their ears, to think of a nature supreme in excellence and eternal in existence. **(St. Augustine, [*On Christian Doctrine*](http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/12021.htm), Chapter 6)**\n\nYou likewise see this in Jewish theology, especially in the work of Maimonides, who championed \"negative theology.\" The idea is that God is entirely unified, since any kind of division in God would imply something superior to God to bind Him together. Consequently, terms like God's \"Oneness\" or \"Goodness\" are not really divine attributes, like the parts of God, but are rather just pointing out what God is *not* and is superior too.\n\n>>God's existence is absolute and it includes no composition and we comprehend only the fact that He exists, not His essence. Consequently it is a false assumption to hold that He has any positive attribute [...] still less has He accidents (\u05de\u05e7\u05e8\u05d4), which could be described by an attribute. Hence it is clear that He has no positive attribute however, the negative attributes are necessary to direct the mind to the truths which we must believe [...] When we say of this being, that it exists, we mean that its non-existence is impossible; it is living \u2014 it is not dead; [...] it is the first \u2014 its existence is not due to any cause; it has power, wisdom, and will \u2014 it is not feeble or ignorant; He is One \u2014 there are not more Gods than one [...] Every attribute predicated of God denotes either the quality of an action, or, when the attribute is intended to convey some idea of the Divine Being itself \u2014 and not of His actions \u2014 the negation of the opposite. **(Maimonides, [*The Guide for the Perplexed*](http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp068.htm), 1:58)**\n\nThis also seen in scripture, as God famously introduces Himself to Moses as the \"I Am Who Am.\" (Ex 3:14)",

Did you say...\" and he interrupted me and repeated \"Forty dollars.\" I said \"I don't think that's right.\"\n\nHe pulled out a price list, pointed at an item and said \"See? Its $40.\"\n\nSo I smiled and pointed out \"That's says 'six-inch sandwich knife'.\" and he nodded uncomprehendingly. I held up my knife and said \"This is an eight-inch chef's knife.\"...and I was about to help him find the correct price, but he held up his hand in a rude way to cut me off and said **\"Ma'am these knives are high end. If you're looking for something cheaper you should try that section over there.\"**\n\nI was so shocked I just stared at him. Then I said slowly: \"So... the price for this eight-inch chef's knife is forty dollars?\" and he confirmed it, so I said \"OK!\" and paid for it. And left.\n\nAfter that I vacillated between feeling bad for \"cheating\" the old man, and wishing that I had grabbed a whole armload of fancy chef's knives for $40 each. But I've certainly enjoyed using that knife ever since.\n\nEdit: It's a W\u00fcsthof",

            "There used to be a chain of stores in the states called Service Merchandise which would cram the space with a single sample of everything they carried in the warehouse upstairs. The sample had a pack of tickets next to it for the customer to tear off and take to the register for payment and immediate delivery on a conveyor belt beside the register. \n\nOne of their sales offered a 50 round box of .22LR ammunition for $.99 each which you could buy by the box of 50 or a 10 box brick of 500 for $9.90. We decided to purchase two bricks, so we each tore off a ticket from the display and headed to the register in the back. We hand the tickets to the teenager standing at the register, who then rings us up for 20 boxes (two bricks) of .22LR ammo and a box of 12 gauge shells for $25 and change. We pay and as he is handing me the receipt the conveyor belt behind him roars to life. My roommate and I watch as three boxes appear near the ceiling, travelling in line on the belt and stop in front of the teenager. He stacks the shotgun shells on top of one of the other boxes, lifts it, turns and sets it on the counter in front of us and immediately turns around for the second box. After placing the second box on the counter. he looks up, smiles and says \"You guys have a nice day\", then turns and walks back to the register. We look at each other, pick up the two boxes of 10 **bricks** of .22LR and box of shotgun shells and casually walk to the truck, load up and leave with our 10,000 rounds of .22LR ammunition. I still have some.\n\nWe figured the person upstairs in the warehouse misread the order and sent us two boxes instead of two bricks. Who were we to argue?",

We'd prefer anybody else as they are pretty slow, expensive, and have been jerks to us for years, apparently because we have the audacity to not use them exclusively.\n\nWe missed paying one bill for this vendor on a case, likely got misplaced in to the wrong stack. As soon as we noticed this the next day, we paid it. Even hand delivered the check to their office.\n\nIt was a few days later they call us, demanding that we need to also pay the court mandated late payment fine. These vendors are to be paid for their service within x days of date it was rendered or there is a fixed small fine paid to the vendor.\n\nBy this point we figured out that in our rush to pay them that other morning, we accidentally also mailed them a second check, paying them twice. We tell them this and to just consider that the fine payment. They did not care for this and that they were going to take this to court to have a judge make us also pay them the late fee.\n\nWe agree, because \"this is going to be funny\", and get a hearing date calendared.\n\nIt ended up being a 5 minute hearing. The judge agrees that we need to pay the fine since it was indeed paid late, but because we had accidentally paid them twice already, he orders them to pay us back the difference of $200 and some change. Judge then spent the next 4 minutes berated them for being petty.\n\nSo instead of getting paid double, they needed to be jerks and spend time and money for their lawyer to go to court for five minutes to then be ordered to pay us back most of an over payment.\n\nEdit for clarity since there were a lot of similar comments:\n\nLegal bills are separated by case, client, copy job, etc, and not one single bill for everything at the end of the month. This is because everything gets expended up the chain and the money will come from various accounts, because insurance. So for this vendor, we had paid x-1 of x bills, where x could be anywhere from a few to several hundred.\n\nThe actual amounts of money here are trivial compared to our billable hourly rates. This is what made the whole thing even more silly.\n\nThe check that got mailed was likely automatically generated from our billing system, which probably means that that specific bill came in late to us. We manually made the check that was hand delivered. This entire thing really didn't matter and wasn't worth any effort to figure out what exactly caused it happened as something like this happens maybe once every few years.\n\nAs I understand it, this particular fine here was a recent regularly change because some of them were not getting paid for years and the entire process of them trying to get paid was one many leaking holes in this system. One of the lawyers explained it to me in excessive detail, but I have mostly forgotten all of it, that was months ago and not something that even evolves me. lol\n\nThey did not sue us over this, it was something like a procedural hearing. I'm not a lawyer, I don't know the correct terminology here. It was still a laughable overstep by them as what they did is the sort of thing for when you haven't been paid for months/years, not 12 hours.\n\nWould be nice it there was similar regulations on our bills to clients. Its pretty much our industry's standard for the last several years where every bill is automatically cut 15-20% by 3rd parties handling \"bill review\". Often takes 2-6 months to get mostly fully paid. if you'd worked in medical billing before, you likely know this sort of thing well.",

Over 10 years later, tells me to help him with the same clients, but I forgot everything since then...\n\n\\--------\n\nMany years ago, I worked for a little company. CEO was a miser of the first order.\n\nWe needed image hosting for a large client account, and CEO was unwilling to pay for maybe $2-3k in annual, image-hosting fees at the time (even though the company made millions off of the deal).

CEO said no (all promotions and raises required CEO signoff).  I tried negotiating, but CEO said no, and to leave if I didn't like it.  So I left. CEO told me to \"forget everything related to the job\" here and he'd sue me if I did anything with the client accounts afterwards (i.e. sabotage or steal clients).

Apparently, Flickr changed their terms of service and the images were deleted. In over 10 years, nobody updated any documentation, or the image hosting...  nobody bothered checking the email account either (that was used to log into flickr account).\n\nI told him that I cannot help.

Per instructions they wanted a 2 number ID system, I warned her the way this worked that was a max of 10 years of files that could be retained and they had me putting in 3 years worth of history. I left and the boss got mad at me because all my notes and documents that I left were paper copy print outs of my office files because they wouldn't pay for my subscription to office (so I paid for my own). I had no contract with terms about info retention, I ran the entire department and I warned them about instituting non-competes and legal protections but I was ignored.\n\nI warned them that the client folders was all the docs there was all passwords and what not are there. They lost a bunch of stuff and tried to get into my office account. They went so far as to call Microsoft customer service and sit on hold for 4 hours asking to be given access to my PERSONAL account. Of course Microsoft told them to get bent that if they could show they paid for it AND got my ok they would escalate it. They then informed me they tried this and I called the company and told them if they continued to try and break into my personal accounts I would seek legal advice. They stopped. But then 7 years later the owner called me and begged me to tell them how to clear out old files so they could continue to use the software they paid \"so much money for and was worthless now\". Mind you I was making like 25k a year and I spent 6 months solid working 65-70 hours a week, managing clients and sites along with building this. So maybe there is 8k that they paid out, for software that they used for 7 years.\n\nAnyway after 7 years they wanted me to remember exactly what I programmed and how to reset the accounts. I told them I needed access to the code to do that. They said no. I said k bye. They came back 6 months later begging again, I said I can't work without the code.

Anyone in the health field knows you can NOT work with the elderly when you are sick because some elderly people can die from the common cold. \n\nWhen I was 17 I got really, really sick. I got sick on a Tuesday with a light cough and by Friday I was going into 10 minute coughing fit. The next Monday was Labor Day, my regular doctor was closed all weekend. My parents decided we couldnt wait until Tuesday and went to the ER. I had a bad case of Bacterial Pneumonia! \n\nFor those who dont know, regular pneumonia usually results from a bad case of the flu or another illness. But a perfectly healthy person can be in Walmart (for example) and walk by another person with BP who sneezes and breathes it in. Its extremely contagious. \nI was admitted to the hospital and hooked up to tubes, turns out I was also dehydrated from being so sick.\n\nAround midnight I realized I needed to call in since I wont be able to work the next 3 days. So I called the nurses desk and told the RN on duty that I have been diagnosed with Pneumonia and wont be able to work this weekend and most likely the weekend after due to the possibility I will still be contagious. \n\nShe told me \"If you wanted a 3 day weekend you shouldnt have volunteered to work. You cant fake a cough to get out of work in the real world sweetheart.\"\n\nThen hung. Up. \n\nI asked my dad what I should do. He took my phone and took a picture if me in the hospital bed, then we got a signed note from the doctor and took a picture of that. He then told me to email those to the Director of Nursing for the facility. I did that and also told her what the RN had told me. \n\nThing is at this facility any calls through the nurses station are recorded to protect the facility from lawsuits and/or protect the residents from negligent caretakers. \n\nShe was on record telling me what she did. \nWhen I returned 2 weeks later i learned she had been suspended for 8 weeks without pay for negligence.\n\nEdit: There are a lot of people asking how this was MC, during my CNA classes we are told to protect the residents no matter what, even if it costs our positions. I went over many heads, directly to the DON, which could have gotten me fired.",

I had 1/3 of a bottle of wine with dinner and then left, plus I was a university student so could hold my booze well!\n\nSo the big boss called me but I was on the toilet vomiting into the bath (great visual, I apologize) and I asked my mum to answer my phone. She did not appreciate the accusation and explained very politely that I wasn't that stupid/disrespectful and also that I was puking my guts out, also that I wouldn't throw away 21 hours worth of pay like that!

Told me she had been up all night vomiting and had a horrific headache.  I immediately took her to the emergency room.  She called her work to tell them that she wouldn't be there, got some attitude but they couldn't say much.   Turns out she had developed type 1 diabetes and was critically ill.  She was immediately admitted to the ICU for a week.  I called to update her work on what was happening.  They told me if she did not call in every morning that she would be fired.  I immediately sent a scathing email to the head office about the ethics and legality of forcing someone to call from the ICU every morning or lose their job.  I got a very apologetic phone call from head office agreeing that this was unacceptable, and that they did not expect to hear from her for at least two weeks and her job would be waiting for her.  Not sure what head office said to her location, but when she returned to work she was told that she could take what ever time she needed during the day for snacks and testing her blood sugar etc.  There was also a missing manager...",

            "She should have been fired. I'm going to correct one thing though, about how you described pneumonia. Almost all forms of pneumonia are highly contagious. There is no \"normal pneumonia,\" most pneumonias will fall into the classification of bacterial or viral. Pneumonia is an opportunistic infection that does seem like it likes to follow the flu, but that is just because it us easier to infect a person whose immune system just put up a fight against another illness. But make no mistake, that pneumonia is still highly contagious. The nurse should have known this, and should have known as a healthy person you would not have had fungal pneumonia (less contagious) or aspiration pneumonia (not contagious.) Any other pneumonia has the potential to make others sick, including \"walking pneumonia.\" So stay home until your doctor clears you! Because if you get pneumonia after the flu, you are still contagious! I only know this because I've had quite a few pneumonia hospitalizations from the past 2 years and they went into a deep explanation so I could explain to my boss why they were wrong about asking me to stay when my doctor called with the results of a CT scan showing I had pneumonia. Pneumonia is NASTY I don't care who you are, you can be the strongest person on earth, it can bring you to your knees. Now imagine a frail senior. Stupid nurse. Hopefully she learned her lesson. \n\nAnd to back you up on another comment, you can be a cna at 16 in my state. The local high schools have a program for it.",
            "What I hate about some of the nurses that work at nursing homes is they have never been a CNA.  They dont understand that we are their eyes, ears, and main caretakers of the elderly.  Those are the nurses that treat CNA's like crap.  In my opinion all nurses should have to work a year as a CNA so they can understand what we do and maybe appreciate the what the CNA's do.  \n\nI used to work with a nurse that wasnt a CNA and she was horrible to us.  One night we were short 2 people on a shift that's supposed to be 4 CNA'S.  She wouldnt help us, didnt even try to find someone else to come in.  We had to take care of 43 people by ourselves, thank goodness the other CNA was awesome to work with.  Evening shift is hard enough with 4 people, let alone just being 2.  The nurse ended up getting fired a couple weeks later for stealing meds.",

            "About 2 years ago I quit my job as a medication aide in a memory care home without notice because of the way I was treated while really sick. Like, I cannot control my bowels sick. I've never been that sick before. My supervisor acted really nasty to me over the phone about it because we were short staffed, which meant she would have to cover my shift. I felt terrible because she worked crazy hours, but I was literally shitting myself. Still wasn't the best way to handle the situation though in retrospect.",

We had 5 halls and 2of us were supposed to work one hall. Everyday I was there, I had to work 5 halls with no pay increase or anything. It was just do the job of 10 people or be fired. It was awful. It was a regular thing too. I tried talking to and dealing with the DON. But it was apparent very quickly that the staff didn't care at all. It was the worst job I ever had. And the nurses on duty didn't do shit. They sat at the front desk and chatted and malingered. They were zero help whatsoever.They were quick to blame the 2 out of 10 nurses aids working if Patient ran down the hall naked, even though 2 of us could not monitor every patient. They did not give two shits. They did not care that we were majorly short handed and had way more patients than we could care for. They just sat at the desk and chatted. Lazy bitches.

            "Worked as a CNA for a couple years in a nursing home. Then at a hospital for a few years. Loved it and was going to school for nursing. I then landed an office job and I make more now than I would have before, and less hours. Good luck out there!",
            "I'm still a CNA, and always make sure to have a few numbers on hand to call. I always call the scheduler first, if it's early enough. That's the person who will be able to find a replacement. If it's late and I contact them, they may ask me to call another number, so I relay that way.\n\nSorry you worked in a facility with such a shitty nurse. I know it's hard, they're always short of staff.\n\n[](/sp)\n\nOne time I thought it was a fart, but it was not, so I had to have my mom come pick me up. I was running a fever but it had happened during the shift. Luckily it was after dinner and I think all my patients were already in bed.",
            "> during my CNA classes we are told to protect the residents no matter what, even if it costs our positions. \n\nInteresting. I see a lot of examples of nurses acting courageously and putting their patients\u2019 wellbeing way above anything else, but I just assumed that was just the kind of people attracted to the job. That is so good to hear, and good the nursing home responded the way they did.",
            "When you call in sick to work, then you're sick. IMHO it doesn't matter what's wrong with you or how serious it is, you're sick. For the person on the other end to assume you're faking it is inconsiderate, rude, and in this case incompetent and negligent. Asking for a reason is basically irrelevant and, in some countries, illegal. If there's a suspicious pattern, then of course you can review, but as a manager or business owner, you should assume your staff are telling the truth.",

Mind you, it didn\u2019t inconvenience her at all, and getting my license meant I wouldn\u2019t have to walk an hour each way to and from work, so it was a pretty big deal for me to have it done ASAP.\n\nI\u2019ve never forgotten that in the real world, it isn\u2019t ok to schedule time off work but it is okay to berate responsible kids for daring to have any needs or personal time.",

Nursing homes are gossip infested so I'd consider the source.   2)  I was suspended once from a nursing job and it turned out to be a blessing because I used my free time to find a new job that had better hours and pay.

Which should not be the actions of a charge nurse and def she should get into trouble. But in no way is it grounds for an 8 week suspension. Also it's illegal for them to tell you why she was suspended and is def grounds for a lawsuit. So I doubt they told you why she got suspended.  \n  \nI agree with you that they shouldn't have done it. But this story doesn't add up at all.",
            "I mean it was a dick move on the nurses part that she definitely deserved to be punished for but I\u2019m not convinced that amounts to negligence warranting an 8 week suspension. I\u2019d be more inclined to believe the suspension was primarily because of other negligent actions and MAYBE this incident contributed but it surely could not have been the sole cause... I mean maybe if she forced you to come in and made you continue working after seeing you were sick and could infect the residents?

An allegation that extreme should have been taken more seriously. When my mum worked at the same hospital one of her colleagues got fired over a random drug test where she tested positive.
