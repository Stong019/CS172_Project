        "selftext": "Many years ago when I was still in school, I was having an issue in one of my classes. The boy who was sitting behind me kept trying to undo my bra. I got fed up and asked if I could move to another seat. The teacher refused to let me, even after I explained why. He said 'boys will be boys, so just ignore it.' Then he told me that if I didn't sit down and do my work I would have to go to the head teacher and explain exactly why I was being disruptive. \n\nI stayed standing and was sent out. I went to the head and explained everything, just like the teacher wanted me to. This head had only started at the school a few months before and had implemented a policy where interference with another's clothing was not tolerated. This was because of the many girls who had complained the the boys were messing with their bras and sometimes even their underwear.\n\nThe head was very unhappy, especially about the boys will be boys bit and she escorted me back to class and told me to sit wherever I wanted. She then asked the teacher and the boy to come out with her. The teacher came back in about fifteen minutes later and apologised to me. I think the head made him because he didn't seem happy about it and he studiously ignored me every class for about a fortnight. The boy hadn't come back into class and in the afternoon assembly everyone had found out that he was suspended for 3 days for what he did.\n\nIt was probably a little unseemly how satisfied I was with the end result. I never heard that teacher send anyone to the head again.",

            ">Boys will be boys\n\nThis is used to excuse behaviour that would not be tolerated from adults. Imagine if your coworker was trying to unhook your bra or flip your skirt up. We really need to get better at teaching boys that they do not have the right to touch anyone, no means no, and that harassing girls is not a healthy way to get their attention. \n\nGlad your headteacher responded the way they did.",
            "Good for you for standing up for yourself. \u201cBoys will be boys\u201c is BS, boys are perfectly capable of controlling themselves and behaving like civilized human beings. I know that for a fact because I have two teenage boys that would never sexually harass a female like that.",

            "\u201cBoys will be boys\u201d is the dumbest thing ever. It\u2019s meant to explain when they run into a fuckin wall on purpose, not sexual assault/harassment. Like when tf did that become the narrative. \n-Sincerely a boy",
            "Right on. I had to deal with a whole cadre of boys who were \u201cboys being boys\u201d who were sexually harassing me. It finally stopped when I put one on the fucking floor after I had enough. It\u2019s bullshit.",
            "I'm glad you had supportive staff at your school.  I did not, and was, in fact, told by my parents to let it be known if it continued to be an issue, I had their permission to retaliate with violence. \nI only got tested once, and my parents went to bat for me with the school, and that particular issue stopped after that.",

If I ever pulled that shit I'd have been in big trouble, but I never did because I was taught to have common human decency for other people. I didn't even have good parents, but at least I learned that.\n\n Yeah being a teenage boy floods your brain with hormones. That's the conversation a dad needs to have with his teenage son(mother could work too, but boys understand this from their dads more easily) to relate and explain what is happening, how it can make your judgement clouded, and why you need to control yourself.",
            "There was a boy who kept touching my legs in middle school.  The teacher said he didn't have any evidence and the boy acted all innocent when they asked him about it.  Finally one day I just shouted at him while he was doing it \"ANTOINE, STOP TOUCHING MY THIGHS!\" definitely disrupting the class, and everyone else was like a deer in headlights, even the perpetrator, who had frozen with this hand on my thigh and everyone saw.  It worked.  He was even transferred out of that class after that.",
            "Reminds me of a similar story I read on one of the Not Always Right websites.  A girl kept having her bra strap pulled by the boy behind her.  She told the teacher, who was a man, and he told her to just ignore him.  The boy does it so hard, it comes undone.  She turns around and punches him in the nose.  The mom, a nurse, gets called in and is met by her daughter, the boy, his parents, the teacher, the head of her year, and the dean.  The mom asks if they wondered if she was going to press charges for sexual harassment, which got everyone all worked up.  After her daughter explained what happened, the mom lit into the teachers and dean.  She had a word with the school's governors, and the daughter was moved to another teacher for the same class.\n\n[Found it.](https://notalwaysright.com/was-bra-ced-for-a-different-reaction/35572/)",
            "Yeah, boys will be boys. They'll jump in the mud and play with bugs and somehow manage to get filthy no matter where they are. They'll climb things and fall and get hurt. Sexual harassment is not a \"boys will be boys\" thing and my son will absolutely be taught better.",
            "Hurray for putting boys who don't know how keep their hands and the rest to themselves  in their place as well as anyone who lets them get away with it. \nWhen I was in high school  a boy in my math class decided to blow kisses at me.  I  barely knew him and certainly didn't want his kisses.  The math teacher was no help just like this teacher.  One day I told i didn't like him like that in the school store  and the teachers in charge heard decided to take it to the principal.  The boy gave a lame excuse about waving at me.  The principal just told him to knock it off and let him go and then complain about me complaining and sent me away.  At least I was able to attend math class in peace.  But I wish he gotten more of a punishment  considering that lame excuse.  This is high school  not kindergarten if you can't figure the difference between waving and kissing you don't belong in high school.",
            "The same thing happened to me. Some asstwat boy would constantly unbutton my bra, even when I got some that hook was in the front. I told my horrible 6th grade teacher,  refused to do anything, and used the same excuse of \"boys will be boys.\". Finally I got tired of it and just punched the shit out of him. The principal called my parents about me assaulting him. He planned on paddling me for it. Thank God my mom told the principal off, threatened to sue, and demanded the boy be punished. She threatened to pull my brother and I from the school. It was glorious. The boy was expelled, as he was treating other girls the same way, and was known to inappropriately touching them. I had no punishment, and was surprised when I did not get grounded.",
            "I read a story here about the same thing. Except the girl turned and knocked the fuck out of the boy. The princable called both sets of parents to come in. When the boys father wanted the girl to be suspended for punching his son her mother replied \"for what , defending her self from a sexual assult\". From that point on the mother had the upper hand and got it resolved in her daughters favor .\n\nThat story has stuck with me for years.",

            "In 1977 I began the 7th grade (when junior high/middle school began back in the olden times). This was in Queen borough of New York City. New York was rough enough. But, middle school is just bad because of the ages of the kids. I had the same issues with the boys being very handsy. I had my bra straps snapped. The back undone on the daily. We held our books across our chest in the hallways to prevent the boys from touching our breasts. Also they\u2019d run up behind us and undo our bras and run away. So the books would hide that fact until we could get to a bathroom to fix it. Hands found their way to your ass, too.  I asked my mom to get me a bra that buttoned in the front. I had some peace and quiet for a while until one smart boy realized how it buttoned (noticed I didn\u2019t have snaps in the back) jumped up from behind me and pushed the button holding it together. Pain in the ass!!!!  When things escalated to when the boys had their hands in every girl\u2019s butt crack we began literally screaming. The teachers became angry with the girls that fought back. Until one day my assistant principal saw a boys hand in action on my person. The teacher yelled at me. The asst. principal yelled at my teacher in front of all of us that he failed at his post to teach respect to the boys of his class. We stood stone cold silent. The boy that touched me was suspended for two weeks. He never touched me again.",

            "When I was in high school, our school had just moved to a different campus that had locker rooms and a gym. It was decided that for gym classes, the boys and girls would share one locker room by taking turns. I think the custodian we had didn't want to have to clean both, so she convinced the principal it was a good idea. Girls were to go in first, get time to change, and then boys would get their turn. One day as a couple friends and I were leaving the locker room, a group of boys started to head in. We told them that there were still girls in there and that they needed to stay out. Apparently the gym teacher told them that he didn't care if the girls weren't done, the boys needed to go in and change. We wouldn't let them until the last girls were done. Many of the girls told their parents (including me), and parents were NOT happy we were sharing. Pretty immediately, the other crappier and creepier locker room was opened up for the boys to use, and the custodian threw a fit because she had to clean both.",
            "\"Boys will be boys\" pisses me off as much as \"if he's mean to you it means he likes you.\"\n\nI once (sometime in middle school, in the 90's) told a teacher about being picked on and way told the \"he likes you\" line. I told the teacher that I thought it was stupid he was essentially telling me that it was okay to take abuse because someone liked you. That is why people end up killing their spouses. (There was recently a news story locally about a spousal murder in our town, I think I just said that is how things like that case happen.) Teacher looked at me strange, nodded, and told the boy to lay off.\n\nWhenever I hear boys will be boys I tell the person, \"you should be teaching them to be men.\"",

            "This is great.\n\nI'm a teacher (male) and I watch the kids VERY carefully because sadly some kids DO like to torment the others.

            "When I was 15, the boy who sat behind me in one of my classes kept harassing me by pulling my hair, and constantly whispering in my ear that my hair looked like pubes. My hair was naturally curly... and clearly 15 year old boys are very clever. Anyway, I asked the teacher if I could move and he refused me. So I sat back down and the kid behind me started back up again - so I asked again to be moved but the teacher refused. \n\nMy temper got the better of me and I walked straight out of class and to the principal. Within 10 minutes, the idiot boy was moved, and the teacher was mad at me for going above him to the principal. \n\nWhy should a student have to be harassed or touched during class and have to tolerate it? Just because the teacher is a dick and won\u2019t do anything about it? Screw that... I\u2019m glad your story ended up the way it did!",

When I told my manager, she made me sit in a room with him while he denied the accusations and sat there smug because they worked together for 15 years and were friends. I called hr sobbing on the way home- this guy would even go to my cubicle and mess with my wedding pictures! I gave myself a migraine and called in the next day using my FMLA leave. When I went in the following day I was written up. On the drive home I called the case manager and told her and she got pretty pissed. She was professional but was having none of it. She told me to stay home the next day and when I went back in the guy never bothered me again and the manager kept her distance until she apologized.",

            "Man, this hurts. In my FOUR YEAR LONG battle with the same abusive boy, the administrative genders were reversed, and there was quite a different result. This creep tried everything to literally get inside my pants from 2nd through 5th grade, and it wasn\u2019t until my female 5th grade teacher decided that she would be the first to believe me that I sorta got somewhere. My parents had tried to get the creep out of my class to no avail for three years, but we were in the same \u201ceducational level\u201d so he always stayed. When I, with tears, finally told my 5th grade teacher that the guy was still abusing me and that I couldn\u2019t take it anymore, I was sent to the principal\u2019s office apart from the creeper. He threatened to paddle me (it was the 80s) and made me assume the position because I had \u201cdisrupted class over this for the last time.\u201d He did not paddle me. He did, however, paddle the creep. The next year he was off to military school. I weep for those he abused there, because you know it happened.

            "I had a really great teacher in 10th grade. She was young, new to her job, and just generally pretty cool. She would generally let us get away with almost anything as long as we put some effort into her class. Basically an \"I don't give a fuck about *what* you do, as long as you work with me\" attitude. I loved her classes, they were fun and educational, she tolerated some fucking around, and even encouraged it if it was on topic.\n\nIn 11th grade, she was gone. Apparently she was taking a year long vacation in Australia to work and travel. Good for her!\n\nIn 12th grade, she came back. She seemed a bit rusty in her teaching, and she was happily telling us all about her time in Australia - not going into too many details, but definitely spreading excitement with all of us. Everyone was happy and listened to her stories, and chimed in now and then. Basically not even a lesson at this point.\n\nThis was a private school, and generally, you only went there if the public school system failed you. Pretty much everyone was a \"problem child\" and it was expected that you worked with that, as a teacher. Aside from bullying (hard no) and distracting others during lessons (soft no) you could kinda do whatever because you were a paying customer.\n\nBefore the lesson, I went to a fast food restaurant. There was one nearby, I had a car (I retried two years in public school so I was older than normal), so I went there often to get snacks during breaks. I had been finishing up my food while she told her stories, a few other students had some too because I piled as many people into my car as I could, they usually didn't mind us eating if we weren't disruptive about it. I mean, really, *why* would you tell teenagers not to eat while learning?\n\nAnyway, I was done with my food eventually. I piled all the fast food trash into the paper bag it came in, and balled it up. I checked where the wastebin was... it was near the door, which was behind the teacher, and I was sitting at just the right angle for her to be inbetween the bin and me. Without even getting up, I tossed the bag over her head. Noise of paper bag rustling into a plastic bag. Score! I was super proud that I perfectly hit that shot. A few other students cheered briefly, but quieted down again to listen to the teacher continuing her stories.\n\nExcept... she did not. She got up, glared at me, and was full on furious. Completely upset with me. She yelled at me to pick that up. I had expected her to be somewhere between impressed and indifferent that I tossed trash over her head and into the bin... but she was mysteriously furious. I asked her what I was supposed to pick up, since I clearly hit the bin. She just kept yelling at me to pick it up. So I got up, walked to the door, lifted up the trash can for everyone to see, reached inside, lifted the trash out, and put the trash can back on the floor. I looked at her. She kept glaring and told me to put it in the bin. Teenagers were laughing at this point, since I clearly just lifted trash out of the trash can to put it back into the trash can. I obliged and put it back where I picked it up from. She got even more furious and told me to go to the head and explain what I did. So I said alright, and went. And I explained everything.\n\nThe headlady was surprised to see me, I had been there for over two years now and I'd never been sent to her office by a teacher. I told her everything. How the teacher used to be the coolest and I assumed she remained that way, but I guess a year in Australia changed her a bit, and I had to get used to that. Headlady fully agreed with me and said she'd keep an eye out for that. She did make sure to tell me it was disrespectful to throw trash over a teacher's head, but acknowledged that her impression of that teacher before the vacation was also that she'd be okay with that sort of thing, especially considering I did not hit her, and I did hit the trash can as intended.\n\nThere was no actual fallout for this story. I just stayed in the headlady's office for 10-15 minutes and we chatted about our favorite fast food restaurants since we were on the topic, and she asked me not to return to class until the next lesson so I wouldn't encounter the teacher and have a heated moment. I did exactly that, and nobody got in trouble. I made sure to be more careful around that teacher from then on, and scope out just how cool she still was after that vacation, and how it evolved over the year. She ignored me a little more but did not treat me unfairly. And now all I have to say about it is that it was really an incredible throw, especially for someone with terrible aim like me. I did not expect that trash to land the way it did, though at least I was confident I wouldn't hit anybody.",

One group of 3 boys was known to walk up on a girl, grab and hold her arms, and one boy would stick a hand down the girl's pants or up her skirt. They actually tore the panties off of one girl who was in a skirt. They took them as a \"trophy\". The principal asked me what I wanted him to do when I went to the office to complain.\n\nHe said that the teachers can't watch the halls, so no adults were ever supervising the halls. And he said that unless there is video, there is no proof anything happened, so it is the boys' word against my daughter's word, and there are 3 boys at least, so her word would count for nothing. \n\nI couldn't send my daughter to school every day to be sexually molested and/or assaulted.

        "selftext": "This is a little long. Sorry.\n\nWhen I was in college, I worked for a mobile carrier in a mall. For a young person, it was great money. I was the assistant manager, which was a fancy way of saying I was in charge of most of the store paperwork.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[A few months before\\]\n\nOne morning, I opened by myself and a guy approached me asking for a specific phone and kept balking at the price, asking if I could \"cut him a deal though\". I was confident we were BY FAR the cheapest in the area, so I told him \"If you bring me a better deal, I'll beat it!\". The guy does another lap, talks to other stores, and comes back. \"Come on, there is nothing you can do? Can I just get a case?\". I smile and say, \"Sorry that's the best I can do today, but can I get your number in case we get a sale that brings the price down? (This sometimes actually did work). His entire demeanor changed and he handed me paperwork out of his bag and showed me his Id. He was from corporate LP (loss preventions). Apparently my store ranked top in the state for \"excessive discounts\" and \"excessive waste\". He then hands me a document showing all of my \"friends and family\" discounts. So I flip open my phone (YES IT STILL FLIPPED) and showed him all the names on the list are in my phone, thus ARE friends and family. He thanks me and says he'll stick around to talk to my boss and one other team member. \n\nSince smartphones aren't really a big thing at the time, the LP guy starts talking to me about my job, and I ask him a little more about what exactly flagged our store. Turns out the other two people he wanted to talk to had more than 30% of their transactions marked with that discount code and our store seemed to \"lose\" lots of inventory. Store practice was that if you open an accessory and it was damaged  in shipping, you just throw it away and grab another one. Turns out there is a process you need to follow. He showed me the form and said \"you really should be between x and x a month to be considered average. \n\nHe then interviews my boss and co-worker who couldn't prove that their discounts were accurate and they were let off with a stern warning. From then on, I took on the responsibility of tracking inventory and warning the team when we were getting close to the monthly limit. Like a miracle, cases stopped breaking for the rest of the month with these announcements.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Fast forward\\]\n\nI open by myself again one morning. An older gentleman approaches me and starts screaming at me about being a \"heartless bastard\" and asking \"how the hell can you do this to people?!\". I look at him puzzled. \"Sir, I have no idea who you are, so you can't possibly be mad at me specifically. Lets go sit over there and have a quick chat\". As soon as we sit down I look at him and he starts crying and shaking. \"I don't know what to do. I'm gonna lose my house\". He goes on to tell me his son had gotten 10 \"free\" phones from my store and the monthly bill was roughly $800 plus tax. \"sir, if your son started an account with us, there is nothing I can do without him coming to the store.\" The dad shows me a photo in his wallet and explains that his son lives in a home because he's too old to take care of him. He's visibly disabled. He was already barely getting by paying for his house plus his son to be taken care of. My heart dropped as I figured out what had happened. My co-worker had sold the phones to his son while they were on a \"mall outing\" with his group home. \n\nFurious, I go back to the store and void the entire order. I instruct the dad to bring me every phone he can find. Anything not in the store that day would be marked as stolen. I write up the inventory report and mark all of those phones stolen for the time being.\n\nCo-worker comes in and I say, \"don't bother clocking in. I saw your order from last night. Just know that it's voided. If you pull ANYTHING like that again i'll make sure you're fired. Take the rest of the weekend off\". He argues for a moment, but leaves.\n\n25 minutes later (and early for his shift) my boss shows up saying he heard what happened. I show him all of the paperwork and explain what I did to solve it. Irritated, he looks at me and says something like \"you know you can't do that right?\". He then argues with me that I had no right to void the order and \"the contract was the contract\". Confused and angry, I say \"look, I will not sit by and allow people to be taken advantage of like that\". To which he replies, \"If you don't like the way we do things here, you can leave.\" Shocked, I walk back into the store where he tells me HE is taking care of all of the paperwork to \"fix\" my mess. Quietly I rip up my inventory report with a smile and tell him i'm leaving for the day. \n\nI call a friend who said, \"why don't you just get an IT job (what I was going to school for). He then calls a recruiter and sets up an interview for the next morning. Boss's little push gave me the drive to just go for it. I nailed the interview and get the job. My now ex-boss texted me shortly after and said \"Hey OP, you're late.\" to which I replied, \"no, I don't like the way you do things there\". Silence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Fast forward a few months\\]\n\nBoth the boss and the co-worker were fired for theft. You see, with the unexplained \"missing\" phones and with no one watching inventory, LP quickly took interest in the store again. Turns out the \"broken\" cases were actually team members GIVING AWAY inventory to close sales. So when I was there \"balancing\" inventory and giving warnings, it was letting them know just how much they could steal and get away with it. Without me there they just did whatever the heck they wanted. From what I hear, they were escorted out by security and all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo in the end, I was pushed to start the career of my dreams. They have a record.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for sticking with me, sorry it was so long.",

            "Reminds me of my previous job, I worked in the complaints team for a mobile service provider, and I often dealt with customers who have been misled about the price of their phone plans. Sometimes the system allowed us to apply discounts to bring the price down to what was promised, but if that wasn't possible, I would offer a lump sum credit equivalent to the price difference x 24 months (length of contract). So if it's a $10 difference, I'd apply a $240 credit.\n\nNow, I always investigated the call records to confirm that the customer's complaint was valid before applying any discounts or credits. The parent company wasn't happy with the amount of credits that were being applied and responded by reducing the amount of credit that I could apply to $49, anything more than that required approval from my manager. The parent company also required us to provide them with a report of all the credits we applied for auditing, which meant more time spent on paperwork.

My store manager used to brag that when a customer was approved for 5 lines (the usual max) but only wanted one, he would open all 5 to get the commission (and stats for the store), then cancel the 4 unwanted lines before the deadline. Like. He openly bragged about this like he was proud.

            "I used to work with people with intellectual disabilities, and I say a big THANK YOU for what you did!  Just because someone is of a certain age and doesn't \"look\" disabled doesn't mean they should be preyed upon.\n\nI love the example of what you did - you took the man and listened to him first, instead of trying to just get rid of him.\n\nIn my experience, some parents of the people I worked with went through the process to become their disabled sons' and daughters' guardians.  That helped a lot when this kind of thing came up.  Some people don't think these people having a guardian is a good thing for the person's sense of autonomy, but I think if it is sparingly used it can be incredibly invaluable.\n\nNo, this is not the same thing as what Britney went through!  All I'm saying is that sometimes this can be a very good thing.  Like with so much in life, it depends upon who the guardian is and why they want to be that for someone.  For most people with intellectual disabilities it's not done to get money from them.",

            "Back in the eighties I worked at a electronics store who's owner was known as Cr\\*\\*y E\\*\\*ie.  The store had NO security or anybody watching the inventory. There were 2-3 guys who were moving more stuff out the back door than was moving out the front door if you know what I mean. VCR's, microwaves, stereos anything that will sell quickly.\n\nI only lasted there 2 weeks but it frustrated me that when a legit customer wanted to buy, let's say a VCR, we had none to sell. And since I was on commission I made no money. I managed to make in that time like $27\n\nSo I resigned and told my manager why, he flipped out and told me I saw no such thing which led me to believe he was in on it. I then walked out and they stiffed me on that paltry $27 they owed me. It put a smile on my face when the chain collapsed a few years later. I refused to work in some bullshit retail job ever again.",

In the early 2000s I was heading off to college and she tells me I can have her VCR because her new roommate has one that works better. I thank her and go to her closet to get the VCR. There were 3 large boxes with a high tech sound system (receiver, 6 disc cd changer, 5 surround sound speakers, and a subwoofer). I was livid and stormed off to the nurses station to find out who managed these outings. Turns out she had brought them with her a few years prior from a previous home. They had tried to track down any receipts or evidence of purchase so they could return it,  but couldn't find them. I kept those things for years and used them until they were completely obsolete.

I had to take the brunt of the backlash and apologize profusely without having anything else I do about it. I complained to the managers daily about what she was doing and how illegal it was.

If the general warehouse phone rings to many times it goes to the overhead ringer and eventually to the DC Manager / Operations office phone for a voicemail. Left my call off message and made a comment about hopefully this is early enough notice for the call off, since the hour notice is not enough to prevent getting a talking to.\n\nTuesday when I came in the DC manager caught eyes with me and flagged me down to his office and asked what was with that comment about enough time since an hour is not enough. Told him how our manager and a few others give a little backlash if you call in an hour before the shift and want more notice. From the attitude with how our manager reiterated you only need to give an hours notice for call offs at the next pre-shift meetings I'm guessing the DC Manager brought it up at their morning update supervisor meeting.\n\nGuy was a bag of shit that lasted way longer than he should have.

They hated me because I pointed out how shitty their policies were, and all of their training deficits.

They\u2019d roll their eyes, but fuck! That\u2019s a really demoralizing way to train. The worst was when I got told I was too slow and would be fired if I didn\u2019t pick up my time. I asked for tips on how I could pick it up, and it was then I learned the little computer we carried around to tell us what to shop could be paused between picking one item to the next! Seriously?!

I was dizzy and couldn't drive to get there, let alone drive home. I ended up having to get my parents to come and pick me up from wherever I was.\n\nSince I had such an over reaction for the first time I called in sick, the next time it happened, over 18 months later, I called in and cancelled the whole week. Then my doctor said I should take several weeks off with that I had (not covid!), and I happily called in and told the manager who had over reacted the first time. I produced all the correct documents for them, and then the government said those unvaccinated are not allowed to work. (Because of what I had, I was strongly advised not to get the covid vaccine yet, in case of side effects.) There goes another few weeks! The manager just about cried when I told her, as I have a reputation for extending any shift, and picking up lots of others, as well as working shifts no one else wanted in the first place.\n\nI ended up with about 9 weeks off, but my bank account took a massive hit as I'm a casual worker.

That doesn\u2019t sound like a very professional greeting to me. I work at a restaurant too and if I walked up to a table and asked \u2018What are you guys having?\u2019 my manager would definitely let me know that was inappropriate.\u201d\n\nThe other guys at the table look kind of uncomfortable at this exchange, and just silently sit there.

He looks angrily at me but orders his burger and a drink. I get everyone\u2019s order and hustle off.\n\nI return with drinks a little while later. I set everyone\u2019s drinks down and do the main guy last. \n\n\u201cHere you go, Boss.\u201d\n\nI leave before he can say anything.

His friends are loving it though. As time has gone on, the rest of them keep looking at me expectantly. What nickname next?\n\nFinally, they all get up to leave. Lunch rush has ended and I\u2019m chilling at this point. I casually walk up to them.\n\n\u201cThank you gentlemen for coming in.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the group is smiling.

I prepare a fancy Powerpoint presentation, and bring in my big, crazy cadaver dog and scent samples, including a human toe, blood, and bones.

The job has gotten frustrating because the people who still go into a retail store are often just people who can't figure out how to work a website and won't bother to read anything. This is true for my customer the other day.\n\nThis woman comes in and buys an Apple Watch and wants me to set it up for her. I'm more than happy to do so, but it really just boils down to her needing to configure it to her specifications. Things like deciding which wrist it'll be set for. The lady demands I just do all the set up for her while she gets coffee. I insist she stay because it's going to ask her things that I can't answer if she's not there. She blows me off and tells me to just do it and she'll be back. I set it up and just guess what she wants. When it comes to her height and weight I put 6'2'' 385lbs, and set it to notify her about her daily workout progress as much as possible. She's probably more like 5'5'' 130lbs. \n\n\nShe came in mad that her watch keeps calling her fat and telling her she needs to walk more.",

            "Man, I fuckin' hate that shit.\n\nBack in the 90's, I worked for a women's shoe store called Bakers.  One of the things we used to do was dye shoes.  Women would pick out a shoe style and size, then I would dye it the color of their choice.  99.9% of all customers would bring a piece of fabric to match or page out of a magazine (which sucked, because glossy paper).\n\nThat remaining 0.1%? About 99 percent of them would pick a color out of our color book, which would tell what dyes and chemicals to mix.  Easy peasy.\n\nNow, it needs to be said -- I enjoyed dyeing shoes.  It was fun and everyone said I was damn good at it.\n\nThen there was this woman... She came in, asked for a particular dyable in her size.  She tried it on, was happy with the fit, tossed the shoes back in the box and said, \"Dye them red.\"\n\nAight.\n\nMe: \"Do you have a sample of the color?\"  \nHer: \"No, just dye it red.\"\n\n  \nI got the color book out, turned it to the reds and placed it on the counter in front of her and said, \"If you'll just pick your color out of here...\"\n\nHer: \"Can't you just dye the damn thing red?\"\n\nNow, if you've played with MS Paint for more than five seconds or owned a box of the big pimpin' Crayola crayons, you know there ain't no such thing as just red.  I tried to explain that to her, but she wasn't having it and getting madder by the second.\n\nI was just a part-time salesman/stock clerk.  This shit had went well over my paygrade five minutes prior.  I told her to hang for a moment and I'd get someone who might have a better way to resolve this.\n\nNow, my manager was an ex-hippie (his word, not mine) from the legit 60's, a former drug addict during that period and at that point in his life, he had substituted Christ and Caffeine as his main drugs.  \"High strung\" doesn't even do him justice.  I went in back and said, \"Hey Tom... There's a lady out there that needs your help.  She wants her shoes dyed red.  She has no fabric to match, won't pick out of the book and says she just wants me to dye it 'red'.\"\n\nHe looked up at me and this facial tic he would get when he would hear something completely... Off... triggered.  He said, \"Okay.  I'll be right back.  I'll meet you at the dyeing table.\"\n\nThe next ten minutes were off the chain.  Tom tried to reason with her, she continued to escalate and finally the assistant manager decided enough was enough and called mall security to drag her out.",

It came to a head last Friday and owner A decided to pack it all in and leave effective immediately. \n\n\nAfter lunch owner B called the warehouse manager up to the office and pointed at owner A's office (situated just off the main open plan office) and said \"I'm too stressed to deal with this so I'm going home. Bin everything in that room. I don't want to see a shred of evidence that owner A worked here when I get back on monday morning.\"\n\n\nThe warehouse manager looked at the offending office and back to owner B. \"Are you sure you want to bin *everything* boss?\"\n\n\nOwner B looked ready to explode already and apparently this  extra bit of clarification sent him over the edge. \"Did I stutter. Get rid of everything in there or you can clear out your desk too.\"\n\n\nAnd so owner B stormed off and our warehouse manager took out his walkie talkie and summoned up two of his warehouse staff and relayed the instructions. The warehouse workers questioned it and got the same answer: yes, absolutely everything. \n\n\nAnd so they got to work, owner A's personal effects were put into a box and sealed up to be taken to him by one of the purchasing staff who lived nearby. Everything else was bagged up and put into the bins. The paperwork and stationary were boxed up to be shredded and destroyed. Next the monitor and printer were taken to the bins, followed by the desk and chair. When I left at 4pm, the warehouse workers were just starting to take down the wall mounted bookshelves.\n\n\nI would have expected them to stop there, but when I got in this morning there was nothing in the office. The curtains and blinds are gone, plug sockets and light fittings taken off the walls leaving exposed wires, the tiles removed from the ceiling showing the ductwork and wiring above, the carpet that owner A requested be put in was torn up leaving the underlay. Even the door with owner A's name plaque on it was taken off the hinges. It looks like a construction site in there. \n\n\nOwner B came in at 10 this morning, took one look at the bomb site and started screaming his head off and demanded to see the warehouse manager. He wanted whoever did to put this right and then get off site as they were fired. If no one owned up, then the whole warehouse shift was fired. \n\n\nOur warehouse manager, never one to give a shit, just peered into the office and said \"You said bin everything boss. Looks like they did.\" And walked off.\n\n\nOwner B looked like he was going to burst a vessel.",

        "selftext": "Mobile, crap formatting and no TLDR (Ok you broke me, TL;DR at the bottom)\n\n\nI work for a small company in the trades as head of the IT department (aka the only IT person). Truthfully the gig is pretty great. Good pay, benefits and I can come and go as I please within reason. The two people I have to answer to are the VP and CEO and as is par for the course they know dick-all about anything to do with technology and generally leave me be as I\u2019m good at my job and everything runs smoothly.\n\nBeing a small company a lot of us don\u2019t take vacations due to A) building the company and B) not having replacements for the time we\u2019re gone but after two years vacationless (we\u2019re in the US) my wife convinces me to use the time I\u2019m given to decompress and take a small, one week, get away. I talk to VP and he gives me the thumbs up to take the time barring I get everything in order and do some minor teaching to other staff incase  of an emergency. Cool, easy.\n\nEnter FOD (Field Operations Director) a man who is an attack dog for the VP for no reason as the VP is nothing but polite and reasonable. FOD loves giving everyone a hard time, adding steps to tasks to make himself look like he\u2019s part of the process, reminding everyone how much of a \u201cboss\u201d he is to the rest of us in management and calling me a nerd any chance he gets.\n\nFair to say - I dislike FOD immensely \n\nAfter making my rounds with other staff it\u2019s FODs time to do some scary computer related learning. FOD refuses to look weak under any circumstances and gets very aggressive when learning new things because \u201cI\u2019m the boss, I already know.\u201d In the midst of learning it dawns on him to ask why he has to learn this stuff anyway, I\u2019m the nerd and it\u2019s my job to do this. I clue him in on the week I\u2019m taking off and this stuff is just precautionary. This worries FOD as he\u2019ll have to retain information, answer questions and do some minor troubleshooting. \n\nThe conversation went something like this, and I wish I could tell you that this guy isn\u2019t this much of a jerk, but he is.\n\nFOD = \u201cboss\u201d \nMe = me\n\nFOD: Who approved your vacation?\n\nMe: VP did as long as I could get you guys comfortable with some small maintenance.\n\nFOD: I only approve vacation time, I\u2019m your boss.\n\n(Side note: he does THIS so much that VP actually wrote out the hierarchy in chart form and we all carry a digital copy with us to remind him who he\u2019s actually in charge of)\n\nMe: You\u2019re not. *shows chart*\n\nFOD: Well fine! But you\u2019re salary so you have to work during your vacation. You\u2019ll bring your laptop and work phone with you.\n\nMe: When YOU vacation you make it very clear you\u2019re unreachable and can\u2019t be bothered even if it\u2019s an emergency.\n\nFOD: That\u2019s because I go to places without service and unless you\u2019re going to the mountains you have to work! You\u2019re salary!\n\n*Malicious Compliance Initiated*\n\nMe: Just to be clear; if I go to a place without service I won\u2019t be expected to work, yeah?\n\nFOD: That\u2019s right, but you\u2019re a nerd you don\u2019t do anything outdoorsy.\n\nMe: Great, thanks for clearing that up.\n\n\nFast forward 3 weeks later and it\u2019s vacation time. All my ducks are in a row, people are comfortable with me being gone for the week and are all encouraging me to just disconnect. A close coworker of mine knows of the conversation FOD and I had and asks what I plan to do to about it so I shared my easy but effective plan.\n\n1) wife and I rented a cabin in the woods, 2 hours from the nearest town and it doesn\u2019t have service\n\n2) set up automatic email replies that have all IT questions and concerns forwarded to FOD since \u201che\u2019s the boss, he knows.\u201d\n\n3) leave work phone on the charger in my office with ringer on, door locked so he has to hear it and voicemail changed to have FOD become IT for the week.\n\nCoworker loves the idea of flooding FOD with questions he can\u2019t answer so much that he gets other coworkers in on it. \n\nMidway through the week I get a call from coworker with an update: FOD loses it. He can\u2019t keep up with any requests for help and didn\u2019t bother to memorize the simple tasks I showed him so he does what any good \u201cboss\u201d does and puts in a request to take a vacation until I get back. Retreat is always an option. Nothing screams *leader* more than retreat. It\u2019s not weakness and failure if he\u2019s not there! \n\nMy coworkers were able to manage and FOD got his 3 day vacation, unfortunately.\n\nAfter the week off I\u2019m called to VP\u2019s office to catch up and get things back on track. VP obviously heard of the hardships FOD faced in my absence and laughed at my MC surprisingly. VP struck a deal with me moving forward since it was made clear to him no one else knew how to do my job: I can go on vacation wherever I\u2019d like as long as I bring my laptop and phone and check it once a week. They\u2019ll refund my vacation time for that day even if I only work for 5 minutes. \n\nI took that but with the caveat of making FOD actually learn some of my duties just in case. VP agreed. Now I do an hour of teaching a week to a very surly FOD. After all, he\u2019s \u201cthe boss\u201d he\u2019s gotta know.\n\n\nEDIT: Oh hey my first ever silver. Is this what it reddit is supposed to feel like?!?! Also, I post almost never and this is by far the most attention any post has ever had of mine. Love hearing about how much better off our EU and AUS counterparts have it in terms of vacation. Drink a beer for me friends.\n\nEDIT 2: My first gold. Be still my beating heart. Thanks internet stranger!\n\nEDIT 3: My god the shiny coins keep rolling in! You guys are wicked nice. I don\u2019t know what platinum or gold does but man, the colors are real nice.\n\nTL;DR: Guy who thinks he's my boss gives me grief for using vacation time. Insists I work even when on vacation. I point out he doesn't do the same. His reasoning is because he goes to places where there is no cell service or internet. I use his logic and become unreachable leaving him with fielding all IT related issues for a week.",

            "That's great that the VP has your back and has realistic and fair expectations.   I've worked at so many places that didn't care at all.    \n\nThe worst was a medium sized / geographically spread out company.  This company fought having IT so hard.  They had different IT managers over the years and a few desktop support people and had tried out a few 3rd party helpdesk / desktop support companies.   I came in just as they were to transition to a new company.    Luckily this IT partner was good and not too hard to manage.   The upper brass figured that with a good IT partner they just needed one person it IT, a manager to manage that vendor and other it vendors.    That was my role.    \n\nIt sucked because I was the only one that understood what had to be done IT wise with the company.  The people who I reported to knew nothing.  There were a few business technology people in the company but they came from the IT manager role at different points and wanted nothing to do with it.   That made me the single point of contact for extreme emergencies, upper brass who didn't want to talk to the service desk, and the person to contact if you needed a new phone.\n\nAt one point I had to have surgery and there was a complication and what was supposed to be outpatient turned into a painful, morphine influenced, 4 days in the hospital.   I was bored and did open my laptop at one point.   There we tons of emails and voicemails.  \"I heard you had surgery.... but I need to get a new phone\".   One of them was from my boss saying he was getting pressure and to get them done when I could.    \n\nMonths later I was on vacation in Hawaii with my family.   One morning like 2-3 AM a VP at a site calls me, says she knows I'm on vacation in Hawaii and it must be in the middle of the night, but she really needed to order a phone.   I was pissed and at this point I really knew I needed to look for new job.   \n\nWhen I got back I tried to get them to get me someone as backup.   One new \"genius\" SVP came up with the idea of turning the the manager role into two junior roles.  I was given the choice to take a 50% pay cut and look like a tool to everyone that I worked with or find a new job.  I went with the latter.  I did hear all things went to crap for a few years until they decided they needed a manager.",
            "US paid time off sucks. PTO/Vacation, sick time, parental leave. Basically anything to benefit the employee is not given in the US. I have 14 days PTO and 10 sick days. I can get more but only at promotion as my company doesn\u2019t like people who are stagnant in their career. My company did just increase parental leave to 6 weeks full-paid but only as the primary caregiver. I will say though, when I\u2019ve needed something, they are good at letting me do it. As I work from home when not on client sites, it\u2019s easy to take an hour out of whatever I\u2019m doing to get personal stuff done. Example, I billed for time from the other side of the world. \n\nIn reference to your post, good on your VP. He sounds like a good guy with a general understanding that people need time to decompress and recharge. If you continue at this company, baring a massive offer in pay/benefits, he would be a great person to continue to report to. Your FOD sounds like someone I indirectly reported to. He was an ass who worked all the time. Interestingly enough, once you picked him apart, you knew why. If you haven\u2019t, I would suggest that you attempt to figure out why the FOD is like that. It might surprise you. I did and I was recommended for a big project as one of the SMEs. It was great and put me in the role I am in today.",

            "I had a friend in that same boat; he is salaried and specialized in a big company and had 3 weeks of PTO built up, decided to use it. On his vacation time, people kept calling him, asking him to check on emails, etc... and he was happy to. 1 week in was when HR got involved and told him that any time over 2 weeks was not allowed as PTO but was instead a leave of absence which required approval from HR, not his boss.\n\nSo he called his boss, they went through the employee handbook and that is when he realized that any time he answered a phone call on his day off or read an email, he was \"working\" and it was no longer PTO.\n\nHis boss revoked all of his PTO for his vacation and put it in as \"work\" time since my friend could document that he logged in via VPN or received a work call each day on his vacation.\n\nHe continues to take \"time off\" and work on them resulting in him having 3 months of PTO or so at this point since the employee handbook never specified a cap on PTO. If he leaves, PTO is paid out per the handbook.\n\ntl;dr: HR pisses in specialist's cheerios about PTO vs leave of absence, end result is specialist now has a 3 month severance package (and growing) whenever he decides to bail on them",

The quotes are because it was at least equally outside sales, I just didn't go outside except to smoke (I've since quit). They had about 50 branches across the country of various sizes. The smallest was literally one guy who processed local orders and used hot shots for delivery, the largest had about 50 employees. I made 6 for my branch. \n\nI was literally the first salesman with a background in anything resembling sales that my branch had ever hired (they'd always hired the least socially awkward industry professionals they could prior to me), and they'd had their CSR doing the selling for over a year until I came on, so expectations were high.\n\nWhen they hired me, we had somewhat heated negotiations over the comp plan. It was a $42k base salary + commission with a $56k OTE and $65k cap. I asked what I was meant to do after I hit the cap; to which they replied, \"Continue to do your job?\" as if I wasn't going to have a problem with generating new business for free. I said that I was gonna need a bonus structure beyond the cap if they wanted me to do any more hunting after that point. I made it clear that I'd service my accounts when they called, but I wanted to be clear that they were going to be disappointed if they expected me to make outbound calls looking for new business after I'd maxed my comp plan, and that I'd definitely enjoy the extra time at home with my family over the holidays. They said they understood, and we went through the onboarding. \n\nI worked almost exactly 40 hours for almost 2 months (early October- early December) before I had jury duty and missed a day. My check was about $150 light compared to what it had been, so I complained to payroll (benefits kicked in at 90 days). That's when I found out I was making $21/hr and was not, in fact, pulling a salary. Presumably, this was to force me into the office, as we didn't have remote access to the local network that logged our hours, just the ordering/inventory software.

Shut it down!\"",
            "I work for a city, and at one point the police department ended up working extra hours because one of the employees was out on extended sick leave. \n\nThe way their contract was written had something that basically said they would cover shifts for ill employees without extra pay as long as it was less than 2 hours per shift. So people would come on 2 hours early or stay two hours late. Always seemed fair to me since everyone did their part. \n\nAnyway police threw a fit about the contract they basically wrote and demanded that they get OT or didn\u2019t have to work extra. They were all salary employees so this wasn\u2019t usually an issue until now. City Council said that they didn\u2019t have to work more than 40 hours a week and they would just go without police coverage part of the day, usually in the middle of the night to early morning. If they did work more than 40 they would get double time. \n\nThing is, they modified the contract that covered all emergency personnel for the city that said we didn\u2019t have to work more than 40 hours a week. \n\nThose of us over at the fire/EMS department work 96 hours a week. 48 hours on, 48 hours off. Since the contract changed the council made it do over half our week was now double time. \n\nCouncil shit a brick once they realized they just gave us huge raises and said that the contract didn\u2019t include us in wage increases (which it absolutely did). They rewrote it in a way that said we didn\u2019t get the pay increase the police were getting but missed the part about not working more than 40 hours.\n\nHalf way through the first week after the change we asked them when they were going to hire a bunch of new medics to cover the rest of the week, since we had already all capped out our time. \n\nNow as an agency it would be illegal to not respond to emergency medical calls (failure to act). But since we were no longer allowed to work more than 40 hours, we were going to have to leave our first shift 8 hours early and it was on the city to make up for the lack of available employees. \n\nWe ended up negotiating a new contract that included some things we had been asking for for years and we continued to work our normal shifts, but it was fun watching them try to explain why it was okay to bend over backwards to do whatever the police wanted while trying to screw over the medics and firefighters. Local paper had a field day with that.",

He had secured the contract for a national chain of grocery store.  He had some other small contracts he managed as well but once he got that big fish he capped out his commission and decided to do the bare minimum. He attended meetings and would help when it was asked of him but basically he just checked email a few times a day and answered the phone when it rang.

But pushing them off, even for a short time, could mean we lost that potential customer. Unfortunately the management & owners never thought about that or maybe didn't care?

It was an industry I hadn\u2019t worked in before and I needed to be licensed. The company that hired me, we\u2019ll call them Smith Inc., paid for my licensing fees, study materials, classes, etc. for me to become licensed. The total cost was about $500. It was a sweet deal. They gave me approximately 90 days (paid) to study a textbook and pass an online course. I didn\u2019t have to do any work for the company, simply study and pass the licensing exam. It was pretty easy and I passed on my first try. \n\nMy boss, let\u2019s call her Mary, was super excited that I passed and I began training under an associate level coworker who had just been promoted from the position I was in. The coworker, Jen, was super great and helpful. She began training me on two simple tasks that I could do, the only rule was if the client had a question specifically about their contract, I would ask Jen or forward it to my team-lead. Well, I ended up getting an email from a client about their contract and I video called Jen to ask how to handle. She walked me through it as I shared my screen with her. I wrote the email back to the client exactly how she told me and she read the email before sending. \n\nA month goes by and everything is great. I\u2019m learning and getting more comfortable. Then I get a really nasty email from Mary. She CC\u2019s my whole team into the email going on and on about how I cannot answer contract questions and how she\u2019s gone over this with me before (she hadn\u2019t, Jen was the one who told me I can\u2019t answer contract questions). Both Jen and I try to explain what happened and that Jen was the one who wrote the email, I just typed what Jen said and sent it from my email since the client emailed me and not Jen. Mary then calls the team up in a video call and goes on about how I don\u2019t know anything and I just started and I really dont know how this industry works and that answering contract questions is out of my job description. It went on for about 5 minutes. I say \u201cOkay.\u201d and get off the call crying. \n\nThe next day out of pure pettiness I simply do the absolute bare minimum. I don\u2019t know anything, right, Mary? I still complete all my tasks and everything that\u2019s required of me. Anything more advanced that I would normally try to learn with Jen\u2019s help? Nope. I just forwarded it to our team lead and said \u201cSorry, Mary said I can\u2019t do anything outside of my job description!\u201d Work was much less stressful after I decided to listen to Mary (and what many others told me before) don\u2019t do anything outside of your job description!\n\nAlso: Mary later fired me for being a whistleblower when I reported the company to the health authority for violating COVID protocols.

            "I currently have a boss like this.  When I first started in my position, she told me that if I was emailing someone that is at a higher level than me, she wanted me to CC her.  This was understandable as I can appreciate wanting to be kept in the loop.  However, she would then message me afterwards and criticize how I worded my email, some information that I should have included / should not have included, the format of my email (\"you need to use bullet points when making a list, not a numbered list!\"), and various other minutiae.  And honestly, there really wasn't anything wrong with my emails -- she was just extremely insecure and a micro-manager.\n\nI finally got sick of being constantly criticized so I started sending her drafts of every email I was planning on sending, and asked her to approve the draft or to send back her comments so that I could edit it and then send it back to her for approval.  She got very angry when I started doing this, but I told her that I didn't see any other solution since I'd never managed to send an email that she didn't have a half-dozen issues with after the fact.  \n\nTo make matters worse, I'd do this when she was out of the office, so oftentimes she wouldn't see the email until a day or two after I'd sent it to her.  Some of these emails were time-sensitive, but I'd explain to the person asking for information that my manager needs to approve the contents of any emails that I'm sending, so it might be a day or two before they received a reply.\n\nShe eventually ordered me to stop sending her drafts of my emails and to just go back to CC'ing her.  She also stopped complaining about the contents of my emails, but when I mentioned to her one day that she hadn't complained about my emails for awhile, she claimed that it was because I had \"learned how to properly write emails\" so I no longer required her assistance.",

While your boss did not handle the situation very well, you lost out on learning experiences that could have helped you get a job for a better company. I'm not saying it is right, but when breaking into a new industry, especially one that requires 3rd party/government licensing, you may have to work for a shit employer for a period before you have enough experience to move companies.

            "I had a similar, although more positive, experience with my previous job. I came from a background in contract work where I would regularly work 60-80 hrs per week on stringent deadlines. At my new job, we were preparing for our annual convention and I was trying to offer helpful ideas on how to improve the process. I was used to being required to make an immediate impact.\n\nMy boss, having heard enough, told me to hold my ideas until I've been through a few. I was like, \"But this is an *annual* meeting. Are you saying you don't want to hear my ideas for several *years*?\" He said yes.\n\nI had never been afforded the time to learn something that well before taking over responsibility. It was quite refreshing. They paid me well enough to decide how best they wanted to use my time. By the time I took over the planning for that meeting, I knew every facet inside and out and was able to make meaningful improvements.\n\nI worked there for 12 years, and is still the only place I've ever worked that gave me all the resources I needed, and time to learn. It didn't always move as quickly as I wanted, but things generally went in the right direction.",

I made mistakes even with the supervisor babysitting me. My boss understandable was not pleased with those. However, even with being a lazy ass I still did my best to not repeat those mistakes. You made a mistake, your boss had a shit way of dealing with it but the fact that you just... did absolutely nothing to improve afterwards?
