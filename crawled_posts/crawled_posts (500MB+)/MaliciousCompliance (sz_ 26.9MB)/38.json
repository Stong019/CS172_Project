        "selftext": "Apologies if there are any formatting issues since I'm writing this on mobile.\n\nAnyway, this grudge has been simmering for almost a year now and has only just come to fruition. It began with my nextdoor neighbor leaving me a passive aggressive note for having trash outside my door while I was cleaning my apartment. Two important points here:\n\n1. I was deep cleaning because the landlord sent a note saying the adjoining apartment (my neighbor's) had roaches. I needed to clean so the exterminator could see if my apartment was infested as well.\n\n2. The trash was by my door for 30 minutes at most. I was trying to save a trip to the dumpster and doing a final sweep of the apartment before heading down.\n\nNow, prior to this incident, this neighbor had already pissed me off by constantly blaring their loud music to the point where my apartment walls vibrated. Fortunately for them, I prefer to avoid confrontation so I never called them out on it. After the passive aggressive note calling me a pig though, all bets were off. She wrote that I should \"read my lease\" since I left my \"nasty trash\" everywhere. Ok bitch, it's on.\n\nI read my lease like I was snorting coke off it. Every time they played their music loud, I filed a noise complaint. When I got a whiff of pot coming from their apartment, I filed another complaint. The lease says tenants must comply with the state's drug laws or risk eviction so, hey, another win for me. Finally, they brought a dog into the apartment despite the no pet policy's exception only being for service animals. This was obviously not a service dog since it howled day and night betraying no semblance of training. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who complained after that final stunt since my landlord said the noisy dog problem was being taken care of through litigation and my nextdoor neighbor's lease would not be renewed. Guess she should have read it. :)",

            "The very first day I moved in to my apartment the police showed up. I hadn't been there more than 2 hours. \n\nGet a knock on my door, figure it's someone saying hello to the new neighbor. Nope. 5 cops and some guy in a suit and tie. \n\nThey tell me they just got a call that there's a domestic disturbance going on. I let them peak their heads in my apartment which they could clearly see had nothing in it and I explained I was moving in, live by myself, and they couldn't possibly be here for domestic disturbance. \n\nThat was the start of a very bad relationship with my downstairs neighbor.

            "I once wondered aloud to a neighbor why my upstairs neighbor \u2014 a man I\u2019d see on the street, exchange friendly greetings with, etc. \u2014 would JUMP in his apartment. Everywhere. STOMP... STOMP... STOMP. Very deliberate. He walked normally on the street.

It\u2019s a mutual thing, like I smoke weed and my neighbor plays his music a little too loud sometimes. I don\u2019t report him and he doesn\u2019t report me, we\u2019ve kind of got a symbiosis thing going on. But WHY, if you are breaking SEVERAL rules in your lease, point out somebody else making a very minor violation of it? Couldn\u2019t that possibly lead to the landlord making sure ALL the tenants are following the lease? It\u2019s like, come on, you don\u2019t tell the teacher when she forgot to assign homework. Be a bro. Look out for your fellow rule breaker. ",
            "What an idiot. When I violate my lease I don't make a single complaint to my neighbors and pray to god I don't attract enough attention to give them a reason to contact my landlord. Its like rolling down your window and calling a cop a pig when your license is expired.",
            "I like to think of myself as a good neighbor, but my last neighbor in the unit beneath me went a bit too far.  \n\nA few things of note: I work a second job as a sexual assault response advocate, which means I get called at very random times like 2 am.  I also have a dog. \n\nShe complained constantly about noise.  Not loud music or TV. Walking.  I was walking too much after 9 pm.  Could I stop?\n\nThen she started taping notes to my door telling me that my dog was waking her up at night. Luckily, she always put the times she was awoken and it always coincided with a time I had to go to the ER.  Nothing to do with the dog, who passes out for about 12 hours each night.\n\nLuckily I too was aware of my lease and all complaints are to be through them.  They ended the \"ongoing harassment\" dang quick.\n\nNoises above you suck, and I tried to accommodate. But, at some point you need to realize and check your unrealistic expectations. ",
            "I had a neighbour two doors down the street who complained all the time that I \"didn't understand parking laws\" because I sometimes parked in front of the next door neighbour's yard. So one day I called traffic enforcement on their truck when it was parked in that spot. Traffic enforcement issues them a ticket for parking too far from the curb, and called the fire department because the truck was leaking oil. They were told to get it fixed or it would be impounded. So they moved it onto their yard and left it there for a month, at which point they got another ticket for having a derelict vehicle in their front yard. And then another ticket because their fire pit was too close to the house. And then the police came to visit because bylaw enforcement noticed crack pipes, and the owner was arrested for dealing. It was like a shit-avalanche for them. All because they felt they owned a spot on a public road.",

Getting ready in the morning and notice that the kitchen bin is full. Take it out, tie it up and leave it in the hallway out towards the stairs so that I could brush my teeth, grabs my coat and bag and take it down. Less than a five minute job, literally it seemed to happen between brushing my teeth and walking back to my room to grab my stuff. We received a warning on our corridor whiteboard about the bag being left there. I know it was just bad timing but that made me mad, especially considering the floor below us had built up a row of about 10+ bags along their corridor over several weeks and nothing was being done about that. If the person had just looked they would have seen me and could have asked me about it/seen that I had fully intended to take it down. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut good for you OP.

            "I had a moment like this when I lived in a triplex (duplex with a basement that was its own apartment).\n\nThere was a single mother living underneath me in the basement who decided one day to come upstairs and bitch me out *in front of her toddler daughter* for having the nerve to play some music on a Sunday afternoon. The speakers weren't even sitting on the floor, so I know she couldn't have been hearing that much, and it also wasn't that loud.\n\nNow, prior to this I had heard a fair amount of muffled yelling and crying coming from the basement. I had been concerned that perhaps she was abusing her daughter - at least verbally, if nothing else. During the course of our doorstep conversation about my music, I raised this point and openly considered whether I should call the police or CPS. She blew up, and yelled at me \"CALL THE FUCKING POLICE\" ; again this was with her daughter standing right there.\n\nSo, I did. I reported her to CPS. I don't know what happened, because of course they're not going to tell you, but I did see the results when they showed up and she didn't live there for much longer. In retrospect, I wish I had done that earlier. I hope I helped that little girl.",

            "In my old apartment there was a lady that moved in upstairs.  Day one she came down to complain that our tv was too loud. We looked at her and said our tv was off. She got pissy and argued about the sound saying it must be our tv and barged into the apartment to check. Saw it was off and we promptly kicked her out threatening to call the cops. She described the sound to us.\n\nIt was the ac unit outside.... she went on her way and we notified the office. \n\nMeanwhile over the course of the next few months we could constantly hear her screaming at her family, stomping around, leaving her dog locked on the porch so it could bark all day and pee through the wooden slats onto our porch. Then one day there was a noise that sounded like things being thrown and a loud thump with yelling. Called the cops because it sounded bad. \n\nShe yelled at me the next time she saw me for calling the cops as they only threw a few things. Apparently I needed to mind my own business. I told her that was hard to do when I can hear all the details about her failing marriage and incompetence through the floor. \n\nThis of course caused constant reporting of each other over the remainder of our lease.  The office told us they already informed her they weren't renewing her lease as we werent the only ones reporting issues. Might have picked up after her dog on the last day (she doesn't pick up after him) and tied the bag to her doorknob and left a few bags of trash on her doorstep. Might not have. Who knows. Fuck you Linda. ",
            "A few years ago, I was running a nightclub in my city.   The place had been around for about 50 years at the time.   There were apartments upstairs, and a new guy moved in.   EVERY Friday and EVERY Saturday, he would try to call in noise complaints because our DJ was playing too loud.   Yes, he knowingly moved in above a nightclub and then complained about loud music.\n\n\nEvery time the local beat cop would have to stop by, and every time he was greeted with, \"Hey, Chris\" because he was a friend of the bar.   He was required to stop by and talk to me, but he was not required to have us turn down the music, so we didn't.   \n\n\nDude moved out 6 months later.    For the record, one of my employees was in the apartment right next door, and she said that the music was barely noticeable up there.\n",

            "My neighbors below me filed a noise complaint that we vacuumed and did laundry too much. We were two guys that each did a load or two of laundry a week, and I'd say we vacuumed once a week tops. We also worked normal office hour jobs, so we were usually both asleep by 11pm. We were pretty dumbfounded because these were the same neighbors who-\n\n* On several occasions put a song on repeat for over two hours at a volume that shook our apartment. We would google the lyrics and figure out the song to keep ourselves sane.\n* On Saturday/Sunday mornings for a few hours we would hear Call of Duty being played really loud on their home theater system, accompanied by a guy yelling at the top of his lungs for people to \"get fucked\" or \"kill yourselves.\"\n* Would smoke pot on their balcony pretty often.  (Illegal in my state)\n* Had a very loud threesome one night that woke both me and my roommate up. We had heard fairly loud sexy time before, but this time two guys were in on the fun. We were writing down crazy shit they were saying, my favorite being \"That deserves a dick in the ass!\"\n* About nine months after the crazy threesome night a baby was added to the apartment. It screamed at basically all hours.\n\nMy roommate and I are pretty chill. We had never once filed a complaint about these neighbors. I'm convinced that one of the other neighbors filed a complaint and they assumed it was us. Hence the retaliation for doing laundry and vacuuming.",

            "we used to have this angry bitch that lived upstairs and would complain about EVERYTHING. for example, the people downstairs were all chatting one night, in their kitchen (3 people) and the bitch upstairs called the cops to report a loud party (no joke).

She (the bitch) yelled out her window \"shut the fuck up!\"  So I, opened my window more and laughed even LOUDER - to make sure she could really hear me.

            "I had something similar happen to me.  So my story begins with an apartment I moved into that had a policy that if you leave your trash outside your door on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings, they'd collect it.  When the policy was explained to me, the leasing agent explained that, unless the trash is causing sanitation issues (i.e. stinks, leaks liquids, etc.), leaving it out the night before is fine.  They expanded it because some people work different shifts.\n\nSo, I was in the process of moving out and was down to just getting a few things out and cleaning one Tuesday.  Eventually, I had a bag full of paper towels from cleaning, some old clothes, and sheets.  Since it obviously fit the bill of \"not gross,\" I left it that night when I left (about 8:00pm/20:00) and went over to my new apartment (with my brand new husband).  On the way out, there was already another bag on my floor, a couple on the floor below, and one of the bottom floor.\n\nThe next day, I returned to meet with a couple guys from a charity to pick up the furniture we decided not to keep and I found a note on my door.  This is a quote.  \"per Apt rules: Do Not put Trash out till M-W-F AM!!!\"  Considering I turned my key in within 30 minutes of getting this note, I just rolled my eyes and moved on.",

            "No one reads the lease, or at least not fully. \n\nOur last place before our house was built went under new management shortly before we moved.  Our contract was based on months. By that meaning, if we took no actions, they considered us still living there, and at the first of every month we need to pay for that new month. We had to give 30 days notice or lose our deposit. As in, we could move out like the 25th and have them inspect, and that would be it. So long as keys were turned in before the 1st, they wouldn\u2019t charge us the next month. They old company said that month and the month after, but that wasn\u2019t on contract, and assumed we broke contract. So, that might have been a battle to have with them since we hadn\u2019t renewed for this year. The contract didn\u2019t state that.\n\nAnyway, new company person is there. And we gave less than 30 days. I already read the lease, I know we lose our deposit, because that is what it states. She says since we didn\u2019t give 30 days, they\u2019d prorate it. I told her to read the contract. She pulls it out and stops at the first instance of 30 days and stops reading. We argue about it, but I give up and say whatever. We aren\u2019t paying. Between the deposit and prorate it was over $1000 we\u2019d lose. We have he keys turned in on the 25th and services stopped on the 31st. She had us living there until the 19 of the following month. By contract, we\u2019d pay the whole $985 rent if we were there past on the first. But she didn\u2019t read the contract through. We didn\u2019t pay and we didn\u2019t hear anything for a while. I expected a notice for payment and planned to fight it, even if that costs more. Turns out, she was replaced. New guy calls me and asks if I\u2019m still living there, and that the paperwork said we were out on the 19th. We told him when we stopped living there, when we turned in the keys, and when the services were terminated there. I also went over the above with him, even that all we\u2019d should have lost was the deposit. He just when \u201coh, ok. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d Didn\u2019t expect anything after that.

When bringing me that note, she told me of ANOTHER pet.

            "I remember when I lived in an apartment with my family our first upstairs neighbors were quiet as mice. You never heard the smallest peep and if we did it was always within daylight hours and wasn't ever loud enough to cause issues. When they moved out new people moved in and we hated them almost immediately. They kept making loud noises in the middle of the night sounds of hammering and stomping and running sounds. I'm not talking about midnight or anything I'm talking 2am-6am nonstop noise every night loud enough to wake all of us downstairs on top of them upsetting our dogs we had. They'd hear the loud noises get scared and bark so they'd wake us if the people didn't. They also \"watched\" a dog for their friends or so they claimed. They never put this dog on a leash when and if they brought it outside they'd keep it out on this tiny deck they had all day while they were at work and then kick off the dog poo down onto our deck and people would file complaints against us even though our dogs never went outside. They also loved to get drunk and stand out on that deck yelling and laughing all through the night after the moving in sounds stopped. During the day you barely heard anything out of them for some reason but during the night it was like the hippos from Fantasia to quote my mom. It was like they never seemed to ever sleep cause they were gone all day then kept us up all night so I'm wondering when the hell they slept? We were constantly calling the on duty cop that handles after hours issues but the number they gave us for him was the main office number and you dialed his extension. He'd almost never get those messages to our knowledge because nobody was there to get them when they showed up nor would they give us another way to contact him. We had to have left messages every night for months on end and he only ever came to make them shut it maybe 2-3 times over a span of months. So he was either ignoring the messages or never getting them. We spoke with other residents and they had the same issue. Naturally as soon as we could we got out of there into a house so no more upstairs neighbors for us anytime soon I hope. Also yeah I know they broke several laws but the apartment people said we weren't allowed to call the non emergency police line to file a complaint we had to file it with their cop they clocked in every night.

I nicely asked if they can maybe put the dog inside when they go to work because it just barks all day. I got a sort of nasty reply. So then I just went to the city and started filing complaints for noisy dogs, which I guess my city does. They got a bunch of threats for fines, I don't know if they actually got a fine, I just know that they can be pretty expensive. They now leave their dog inside when they go to work.",

        "selftext": "I was at the doctors office today and had to bring my 15 month old twins with me. These kiddos do not enjoy being cooped up in a stroller but letting them wander around isn't an option since they both will immediately bolt in opposite directions. They have clean nappies, they've been fed and hydrated, so at this point any fussing is just stroller related crankiness. In preparation for having to wait a while and wanting to be considerate of the others who were in waiting room purgatory with me I packed the diaperbag full of endless snacks and sippy cups. Sure enough 5 minutes in they lose their mind so I instantly start giving them snacks and also walking back and forth in the very very large waiting room. I am at the back area and not even close to being in anyones way and as long as I am pacing the beasties will quietly munch away on their cheerios.\n\nAt one point I stop pacing to hear the doctor mumble the next patients name in another barely audible whisper and this is where cranky old lady decides to weigh in on my parenting. I hear a huffing noise and look over at her and the second we make eye contact she says \"Oh my gawd you have got to stop walking up and down that back area. You're making me dizzy. Also you really shouldn't be feeding them that much, just SIT DOWN and they will relax too. Watching toddlers really shouldn't be that hard hun.\" Thanks. Firstly, while my girls are very healthy, they were preemies born at 3lb/1.5kg and are still very tiny so I will feed them all the damn cheerios I want. Secondly I am doing all this not for myself or the twins but for the benefit of all those around us. Finally I was waiting to find out if my scans showed cancer or not (hurray scans were clean) so I was all out of fucks to give at the moment.\n\nNow for the malicious compliance. I take her advice and sit down. Right next to her.\u00a0Tons of empty seats everywhere by the way. Instantly they start screaming their heads off and what do I do? I pull out my book and start reading. Anyone who has ever been seated next to a strangers baby having a meltdown, close your eyes, imagine that shitty moment and now double it to account for twins. Within 5 minutes she is looking like she is about to snap and suggests they might want a snack. To which I calmy respond \"Nah, I really shouldn't be feeding them that much\" and calmly turn the page of my book. Ten minutes later my name is finally called and this lady looks like she is ready to give up on life. I however have read my first chapter in ages. I guess watching toddlers really isnt that hard after all.",

            "As a related semi-story... my wife would sometimes be out with our kids. She's younger than most, but was still in her mid-20s when we had our first child, and we very much made the conscious choice to have children.\n\nShe's had old women at convenience stores look at her and make judgmental comments about her being so young and having children. They often assume she's a single mother (even if she was, so what?). It makes me wish I wasn't working so that I could be there with her to tell them off.\n\nSometimes old women are the most arrogant and judgmental pieces of shit on the planet.",

            "Mother of twin two-year-olds checking in! You handled that flawlessly. I know plenty of people love to chime in on someone's parenting, but it seems that with twins people feel *especially* entitled to tell you what you're doing wrong with them. \n\nI remember when our girls were about 8 weeks old. I was home by myself with them, and I reeeeaaaaaalllly needed to get groceries. Decide to make my first solo grocery run with them. I nursed them right before we left so they wouldn't be hungry (in theory), fresh diapers, appropriate clothing. We were living in New York so there was a little bit of a walk to get to the store, then the store was more crowded than expected for a weekday afternoon. Took a little longer to navigate the double stroller through the tightly packed store. Well, by the time we got to check out, they had started fussing. Turns out the cashier area is too narrow to fit the stroller, so I have to do self-checkout. At this point, they are screaming. It was awful to have these 2 two-month-olds screaming and crying, and I'm helpless to do anything. Plus I was suffering from PP depression, so everything was so emotionally amplified. Well by the time I'm through ringing and bagging up all my items up, I'm also in tears and desperate to get us all home quickly.\n\nSo. I get a tap on my shoulder and turn around. This little old lady says to me, rudely, \"I think your babies are hungry. Why aren't you taking care of them?\" I was devastated. Like I'm obviously trying to hurry up and deal with these groceries so I can get them situated, and I'm clearly overwhelmed and tired and doing my best. Ugh. I still get upset thinking about the audacity.\n\nHell, even yesterday I was having a similar challenge as yours! One girl didn't want to sit in the stroller (boy, that is so much fun), but she also didn't want to be held. We were trying to get from the train to the mall quickly since it was almost 100\u00b0, so her walking at a toddler's pace wasn't an option. When I tried to put her back in the stroller, she started crying. Some random lady goes, \"Oh, NO MA'AM! She cannot cry like that around me.\" It's like, she's 2. She's going to cry sometimes, and you're in a public place! You don't get to decide how everyone should behave in your presence. \n\nMan, I have so many stories like that. \"You shouldn't feed them that! They're too cold! They're too hot! They're too small for the swing! You shouldn't play that music, they don't need to nurse, they just need water, they need more sleep, why are they sleeping so often, they're going to get hurt, you need to let them get hurt sometimes, etc\" The judging is non-stop sometimes, but every once in a while there's somebody who stops us and says something like, \"You're doing a great job,\" and all of a sudden I feel a wave of relief. Somebody gets it. I try to hold on to those moments.\n\nSo one twin mom to another, let me tell you. You're doing a great job.",

            "I have 28.5 month old twin toddlers. I get lots of parenting advice from people that can't understand how whatever they did with their kids won't work with mine.\n\nThe crib sides are off so the boys are sleeping in their toddler beds now. Some nights I will read them a book or two and they lay right down and pass out. Most nights, they wait until I leave the room and mayhem ensues. I was talking to a group of other parents about this and the mob is explaining to me that I just need to sit next to my kid rubbing his back/cuddling/etc. until he falls asleep and then he'll be down for the night. I asked \"Which kid should I snuggle with and how should I handle the other one tearing the room apart while I do it?\n\nOr we talk about stopping at the grocery store and they don't understand that getting two kids out of the truck is way more than twice as hard as getting one out because you have to put kid #1 somewhere and keep him safe while you're freeing the second. Mine are just old enough to stand next to me while I unbuckle their sibling pretty reliably, but I'm not willing to bet their lives on that.\n\nIn my experience, twins spend more time making a scene in public because there are two of them so the odds are just higher that one will be having a moment and because you can't necessarily devote your entire attention to comforting that kid when they start to spiral. I don't like using the stroller either and I barely ever put them into it, but there are just times when they need to be contained. Either for their safety, to protect people's property, or to save my sanity.",

And twins toddlers are very, very difficult. At least ours were. Everybody dreams it must be easier with twins because they share everything but that hardly makes up for the fact that, when you're single, or just watching them both by yourself, you have two wild animals that trust no one, not even mom, as much as they trust each other, and they're conspiring against you. They're basically both as the same place developmentally so they just get into the same trouble over and over because while you teach one, the other's repeating the same dangerous experiment behind your back. It can truly be exhausting. And when they're both cranky it's really, really rough. \n\nHang in there. They won't be toddlers for long. Soon you'll have two very sweet five year olds that want to help do everything and show you everything they learned. Give em lots of hugs, and ignore old biddies that frankly have no idea! ",

        "selftext": "This happened years ago at what would turn out to be my last year at a Catholic school, for reasons that will become obvious. I don't have anything against people of faith, but it was not my thing, very early on.\n\nI was 12 years old and in 7th grade. I was becoming disenchanted with my Catholic upbringing. I had so many questions, and it might have saved my faith to have them answered reasonably. The adults didn't want to reason with a curious 12-year-old. They wanted to see a nice Catholic girl who didn't feel compelled make so much distasteful noise.\n\nSex ed was still a part of any Catholic curriculum, and as it turned out, my religion teacher, Mrs. M, was also my sex ed teacher. When she opened up our first sex ed class with, \"Now, I'm just as embarrassed to be here as you are,\" I didn't see it as an expression of empathy. I saw it as a grown woman, humiliated to be teaching basic biology. It made me sad.\u00a0\n\nJunior High sex ed wasn't just biology, though. It was an effort to shape our view of the world. Mrs. M taught us sexual health as per Catholic doctrine, and also peppered in some of her own weird, personal viewpoints--shaped by her own history, I guess. We had this box at the front of the class where we could discreetly write down and drop off the questions we were too nervous to ask out loud. Someone asked what orgasms feel like for women--we knew men ejaculate, but what do women do? Mrs. M did not explain, perhaps because she hadn't had one a day in her life. She said, \"The women's orgasm is not a necessary part of sex. It is not necessary for procreation, and sex is for the purposes of procreation.\"\n\nThat sounded very dodgy to me. I brought her statement home to my mother, who had always been very open with me about these things. I asked her if women really weren't supposed to enjoy sex all that much. She was horrified. She told me lots of men like to make women feel good, and sex should feel good for everyone. Then she said something that would be lastingly valuable, \"Ask questions in that class. Teachers are supposed to answer your questions, and if they can't, maybe they shouldn't\u00a0 be teachers.\"\n\nThe next class, Mrs. M taught us that homosexuality was a sin. This was too much for me--I had a gay uncle who had been a huge fixture in my life, I felt attractions to girls in my class, and I refused to believe God would think who you love is worthy of hellfire. She went on to say gay marriage was both impossible and wrong. I raised my hand and asked her plaintively, \"Why is gay marriage wrong?\" Her answer was, \"Because they cannot procreate, and procreation is the purpose of marriage.\" I sat silently. I didn't demonstrate agreement nor dissent. I went home and thought about that for awhile. I needed to come back to sex ed class with an inquiry that was going to properly fuck Mrs. M's shit up. It didn't seem like an easy task, but I came up with something I thought was worth trying out.\n\nThe next sex ed class rolled around. Mrs. M taught whatever stuffy, deplorable lesson she had in the plan, then she opened up the class to questions. I raised my hand, she called on me, and I said, \"If a woman is infertile, but she really loves the man she's with and wants to share the Sacrament of Marriage with him, does The Church approve the marriage?\" It was a no-brainer for her. Of course.\u00a0\n\nI followed up with, \"But she can't have children, and marriage is for procreation. Why can she get married, but two men or two women who can't procreate can't?\"\n\nAnyone who is seasoned in Christian apologetics can explain this one pretty easily. But I had hit Mrs. M somewhere deeply personal in front of 30 other children. Mrs. M was a married woman of around 50 or so, with no children of her own--very unusual for a Catholic woman who doesn't believe in birth control. Mrs. M was infertile, and to her, I was questioning the sanctity of her marriage, and its validity in the eyes of the God she'd dedicated her life to. It was a sucker punch, and she couldn't collect herself to punch back. She instead flew into a rage. Her face became a deep shade of red as she said, \"This is NOT a debate class,\" and sent me to the office.\u00a0\n\nFor context, I didn't know Mrs. M was infertile, it's something my mother told me post-office battle. An apology letter was determined to be insufficient by Mrs. M. \n\nMy mom came to collect me, and a battle ensued. Mrs. M wanted blood by way of suspension, and my mother was having none of it. Curious kids don't get suspended for questioning what they're taught. The only thing that worked in my favour was my history of being a nerdy, non-disruptive child with good grades. A compromise was struck. I wouldn't get suspended, but I could not participate in sex ed class, nor religion class. My grades in those classes would be determined solely by the written portions. These written portions were completed at a desk positioned outside the classroom, which Mrs. M smugly carried out for me every class.\n\nI didn't mind working outside of the classroom, because to me, it was a good example of the ease in which an adult can collapse under a child's questioning. I decided that religion and sex ed would become my specialty classes. I would master the curriculum, I would get the best grades I could, and Mrs. M would have to watch it happen. I worked very hard, harder than I had in any other classes. I studied at length and did additional research online. I finished out the semester with about 95% in sex ed, and 98% in religion.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe final exams for both classes were entirely multiple choice. I was permitted into the classroom to be supervised for the exams, and there was no room for her biases to creep into her grading. She passed me the scantron sheet back from my religion exam. 100%. I thanked her with a saccharine smile. She fixed me with a grim expression before moving on to the next classmate. A few days later, it was the scantron sheet for the sex ed exam. 100%. I said, \"Thank you\u00a0for all you've taught me,\" as I smiled up at her. She said something under her breath and moved on.\u00a0\n\nMrs. M hated me with a distinctly unchrist-like passion, and she found other ways to express it in the following semester. It warms my heart a little to think of her having to grade all my schoolwork, one correct answer after the other. The relentlessly curious, heretic nerd-girl was a pain in her side that wouldn't go away. Worst of all, she demonstrated that she understood what you were teaching. She just didn't believe in it.\n\nTL;DR: My Catholic sex ed teacher tried to punish me for questioning doctrine, a compromise punishment was struck, and I in turn resolved to ace all her classes. She hated me with a passion, had to grade all my assignments correctly, and watched me get honours.",

            "I got kicked out of Sunday School when I asked our  teacher (creationist, strict literal interpretation  of the bible) if Adam and Eve were the only people on earth until they had kids, who did Cain marry when he got exiled for killing Abel? You could have heard a pin drop. I was then asked to go outside and sit in a chair in the hallway until church. Never did get an answer. My mom, who was cooler at that time than she is now, told me it was a very good question but she didn't know either. And obviously neither did my teacher.",

So...I rewrote it, making sure to clear some changes with the head of the department.  \n\nI became THE teacher to have for this class.  No question was out of bounds, no subject was off limits.  I did use the anonymous question box but, as time went on, the kids realized that I wasn't fazed by any of the questions they were asking.  And they began to trust me to the point that their questions became more scientific rather than the \"shock and awe\" questions they had started out asking. \n\nSo much fun to teach sixth graders this subject.  And was not allowed to teach it after that first year.",
            "I had a student, in my middle school biology class, ask why if Eve was created from Adam's rib did she have 2 X chromosomes instead of XY. I told him I was not qualified to teach anything beyond biology and perhaps he should ask in his Sunday school class,  since he had mentioned going there.\n\nHe came in the following week very happy to tell me he had been thrown out of religion class for asking that question. He was the type of student I loved to teach, curious and not afraid to ask anything.\n\nI would have enjoyed having you in class,  also.",

An annulment can be had if a person enters into a marriage knowing they are infertile but not letting the other know before the marriage.\n\nAlso our class was taught by a brother, not actually all that much older than us. First day of class he started with this is the church's stand on birth control. Then he locked the door and said \"Now we are going to talk about reality.\" He pulled out a desk drawer full of condoms, told us it would always be kept full, and no one would ever see anyone in that drawer even if one of the brothers was sitting there. Only 2 girls got pregnant the 4 years I was there, both with boys from other schools.",

I just don\u2019t like some of the things they believe in/think is wrong and I also really dislike how they teach young children and I was recently having a conversation and someone said something along the lines of. We should be teaching them as young as cr\u00e8che (toddlers) which I personally don\u2019t think is right because it\u2019s manipulating a child because if you teach them things so young it\u2019s all they\u2019ll ever know.

That situation also means the child would only have either a male/female influence\u201d and her reply \u201cwell the child can get the other influence from somewhere else like an aunt/uncle or grandparent or even a teacher\u201d and could you guess what I said next? \u201cWell why can\u2019t a child adopted by a gay couple get the other influence from elsewhere?\u201d And she just couldn\u2019t come up with a very good reply. I would like to add that my mum isn\u2019t against gay people adopting children however she would much prefer a straight couple adopt.

Blew my mind. Anyhow, I had started trying different churches in my area, seeing if any of them could resolve my little crisis. \n\nI made the (now hilarious) mistake of going to a Church of Christ. It took about 3 services before the preacher noticed this new young man. After the formal introductions, I left. Came back for a couple more weeks, and had an acquaintance who also went there...I had confided in this person about my little \"crisis\", and he had in turn told the preacher about it. So he catches me before I leave one Sunday, and pulls me into a small group that included a preacher who occasionally filled in for the regular one. After roughly 20 minutes of them \"praying over\" me, and asking me basic questions, they asked me if I had any questions. \n\nOf course I did. I don't remember exactly what I asked, but I remember getting a LOT of weak apologetics in response...and I wasn't satisfied, and they started looking a little irritated. So I asked a question that apparently hit a sensitive nerve in the lead preacher, because his face turned several shades of red within 5 seconds. When I got no answer, I followed up with a statement along the lines of \"I'm having a hard time buying anything you're selling here\"...and the backup preacher BLEW UP on me. Told me I was making a mockery of God, that I needed to repent RIGHT NOW for daring to question God's word, yada yada. I remember stifling a laugh...and that was the last straw. This preacher actually hurled a few curse words at me...and not soft curses either. It ended with something along the lines of \"get the fuck out and don't come back.\" \n\nAt the time I was mortified...but looking back, this hazy memory always puts a smile on my face.",

This time, I knew I'd heard correctly. My hand shot up. I was ignored. I persisted. Finally, he relented and called on me. \"Back to what you said about God hating gays\", I began. He rolled his eyes \"yes?\" \"Does that mean I'm better than God because I don't?\"\n\nNow, I'm sure you know how well that went. At some point, we had a conference in the principal's office. It was me, the priest, the principal, and my mom. The priest at one point was going on about how I \"always wear black\" so there must be something wrong with me spiritually. \"Well, so do you\" my mom retorted.

            "This brought up memories. I went to a catholic school from kindergarten through 8th grade. According to the church I am a \"non-practicing\" Catholic, as I was Confirmed but no longer go to church. I generally consider myself to be Agnostic, and often half-jokingly refer to myself as a \"Recovering Catholic\"\n\nI was lucky in several senses. I had really good teachers. For the most part, the secular classes were phenomenal and when I went to public high school I was ahead and better taught in a lot of subjects. My seventh grade religion class focused on the history of the catholic church and didnt sugar coat it. Basically we were taught that bad shit had been done in the name of religion by the church, we needed to know about it before we decided if we wanted to be confirmed, and we should continue to work to improve the church within the confines of its doctrine.\n\nI am sure it was much more open minded than it could have otherwise been, but that doesn't mean I haven't had to work through some of the fucked up shit that was impressed upon me as a child. \n\nIf you have sex before marriage you are making yourself \"dirty\" and a disappointment to God. You are also going to get pregnant and fuck your life up. Oh and you are going to get all these nasty diseases. The only way to make sure none of this happens is to not have sex. Condoms? They exist but they aren't perfect you shouldn't rely on them to not fuck up your life, plus they are unnatural and against God's grand plan. \n\nOur health teacher had the girls for sex ed, and she had to talk to the principal before she could answer the question \"Can you have sex on your period\" because she was worried that answering it might be construed as her encouraging us to have sex. Was able to answer it as getting married does not automatically stop your period. She told us that it is physically possible and not damaging to do so, but that it is very likely we will not feel like it. A lot if it was worded to work within the confines of marriage, but I still love that she didnt just dismiss the question.\n\nThis same lady took all of us girls outside on a short \"unsanctioned field trip\" to show and explain tampons to us. I remember being on the sidewalk behind the school and her telling us that she couldn't talk about this on school property. She probably could have gotten into a lot of trouble. But she wanted us to know that tampons were safe and healthy if you used them correctly and convenient. She passed around the instructions and showed us how they work. I think she even told us that using them was not the same as having sex. \n\nOf course in health class we were taught that using any sort of drug in any way not told to by a doctor meant we were automatically going to become addicts and die horrible painful deaths, after stealing from our parents to feed our habit. We read a testimonial story about a boy who was \"lucky\" because his first trip was a nightmare where he hallucinated he had toes all over his body and went to the garage, got a hoe, and tried to scrape them off his skin. He ended up in the hospital bleeding never wanting to experience anything like that again. I guess it was effective though because to this day alcohol and caffeine are the only drugs I've done. Of course alcohol is okay \"in moderation if you are old enough\"\n\nI don't know if any one is going to take the time to read this long ass post, but it felt good to write.\n\nTl;dr Relevant to original post: catholic sex ed teacher took the girls out to the side walk to show us tampons because she wanted us to know about them but could have gotten into trouble for it.

I asked, \"What causes menstrual cramps?\" (I had the bad luck of inheriting insanely bad menses from both sides of my family and wanted to know why I was in near debilitating pain every month.)\n\nThe teachers flushed and one of them stammered out, \"Your stomach descends to nudge the uterus to let it know it's time to flush the blood.\" Which, if you know anything about female anatomy, is physiologically *impossible*. And I, who was a great deal more learned than my fellow classmates (my mom was in college at the time and I was reading her textbooks), knew they were full of crap.

I didn't want to be in these classes and found the whole situation ridiculous, so naturally I rebelled. I made it a habit to walk into class blasting Hell by Disturbed on my headphones, bring up unpleasant topics like the war of Armageddon, the Anti-Christ. I wasn't being clever, was just being a pest. One day the topic must have been sin or some such, and I asked what happens if you sin in heaven. The teacher was caught off guard and said you can't. I asked why not, since that would be interfering with free will. He didn't have a ready answer, so I think he said that you're so supremely happy in heaven that you would never think to sin. I told him that's still interfering with free will. Being put in a mental state that means you could never even consider certain actions, much less carry them out, is interfering with free will. Iirc, he said he could arrange a meeting with one of the priests some time so I could talk with them about it. I politely declined and let class continue.\n\nEventually my mom lost the schedule for the classes, and even though they were the same time, same day every week, she let that be an excuse to stop making me go.

I went through similar things in my catholic school as well, though I didnt start any shit like you unwittingly did.\n\nI'm now learning about Catholicism from scratch as an adult, and I'm finding it more and more welcoming. The best teacher for Catholicism is God himself (so, the Bible, Caticism of the Church, etc.) But 2nd best is 100% a priest. Many of them love adults who come to learn because it's usually a very rare and special thing for them to see. They want you to be informed about their religion as possible, and they dont want to force you to join because that's not the life that they are taught to live. \n\nCatholic schools, on the other hand, typically want you to follow not only the curriculum, but their school rules and teachers input as well. It's a breeding place for people to be turned away from faith, and it's not like the world needs any help with even the smallest amount of Priests committing pedophilia and the likes.",
            "My wife, the quintessential Asian math whiz was being taught math by a rather unqualified teacher at her high-school.  The 'teacher' was explaining the wrong way of doing things and my wife called her on it.  'Teacher' then doubles down with \"Ok, then you explain to the class how to do this\".  Wife does it perfectly and explains for classmates who actually understand what she was doing, and compliment her on it because they didn't have a clue learning from 'teacher'.\n\n'Teacher' starts marking wife's homework wrong when it's handed in, and refusing to return it so she can see what she did wrong (to hide the fact that she was retaliating) - which is total BS.  Unfortunately she accepted that rather than fight it (she hadn't met me obviously).\n\nThe next year she found out she was getting the same 'teacher' again for another class and made a point of going to the school management and formally requesting a schedule change to avoid that 'teacher'.  Fortunately she got her request and never had to suffer through another class, though apparently the teacher did confront her at one point to ask if she disliked the 'teacher'.  She took the high road.  Again, before meeting me.  I've helped her toughen up a bit more now (oops, my mistake?) :P",

If they had met me with kindness and support as good Christians, maybe I would have one day returned to the church. Instead, they solidified my conviction, increased my questioning of religion, and set me firmly on the path of life as a nonbeliever.

There are two classes I remember in particular, but I'll just share the one relevant to this discussion.\n\nOur male teacher passed out the hand-outs for his lesson on what the church considered to be violations of the commandment \"thou shall not commit adultery.\" The list was extensive. Highlights include: masturbating, oral and anal sex, and homosexuality.\n\nOur class had a *lot* to say about this list, and tried to debate our teacher. At one point, he said, \"no more questions. This isn't a discussion.\" But that just made us angry. Instead of raising hands, we raised our voices, shouting questions and opinions. He left the room to get our vice principal (he was the main disciplinarian, not the principal) and of course that shut it all down. But I was so proud of my classmates in that moment.\n\nWe were taught so much crap about sex, but I am grateful that we were still taught real science (creationism was *not* a part of our science classes) and I did overall get a great education at my school.

I was pouring some spirits (and for those who don't know, they come in standard sizes of 25ml for singles / 50ml for doubles etc) - I reached the end of the bottle as I was pouring the whiskey and there was a tiny drop left, so I just poured those few extra ml into the glass.

        "selftext": "Many years ago (more than 15), I worked as a programmer for an Oil and Gas automation company. This means we would design and build the computer systems for oil and gas plants, commission them, and support the operators during day to day operations. Because of this, my company ran a 24/7 support phone. Every week a member of my team would get the phone and be expected to be available to answer calls 24/7.  We had enough people on the team that it would roughly equate to getting the phone twice a year. Most of the employees of this company were salaried, and the 24/7 phone was written into their contract. For every phone call they took, they could charge a minimum of 1 hour in banked time. This was a good deal for them, and made the 24/7 phone easier to handle.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI was a little different than my coworkers in that I wasn\u2019t a salaried employee - I was an hourly contractor. My coworkers would bank their time but I was just paid out biweekly. My contract also stated that if I was being paid by the company, I had to be available exclusively to the company. This was added by their HR department because a few years before they caught an hourly contractor running side jobs for other businesses at his desk. This also meant that if they wanted me to be available exclusively to the company, they had to pay for my time. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor two years I knew the 24/7 phone existed but had never had to take it because according to my contract, if they wanted me to be available they had to pay my hourly rate after normal work hours to ensure that I was available to answer the phone when it rang.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThen, as in most corporate stories, my completely awesome manager left for greener pastures and was replaced with an absolute tool. After a month of being in the office, he decided it wasn\u2019t fair that everyone took turns on the phone except for me. He declared that I would be put in the rotation effective immediately.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI didn\u2019t want to cost the company a ton of money, so I tried to explain that if I\u2019m on the 24/7 phone that means they have to pay me 24 hours a day for 7 days. He scoffed and told me I obviously didn\u2019t understand how business worked. I told him he didn\u2019t understand how my contract was laid out and that I\u2019m an hourly contractor, not a salaried employee. He insisted that to be a team player I had better take the phone or look elsewhere for employment. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI didn\u2019t want to seem like I wasn\u2019t a team player, so I accepted the phone..and started my clock.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n7 days later I handed the phone off to the next guy, and submitted my biweekly invoice. It came out to just over $10000, with $8400 being just that one week of having the phone. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI waited about 15 minutes before I was pulled into the manager\u2019s office. When I arrived the manager, the head of HR, and the manager\u2019s boss - the head of the department - were there with my most recent invoice sitting on the desk. The department head just looked at me and asked what the hell I was thinking when I gave them that invoice. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI explained that the new manager insisted I take the 24/7 phone even though my contract clearly stipulates that if the company wants me available 24/7, they have to pay for every minute I have the phone.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe new manager became redder with every word. When I was finished, the department manager turned to him and asked him why he didn\u2019t know this, since it\u2019s common knowledge that no contractors are ever put in that kind of position. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs he was stuttering for an answer, the department head dismissed me and told me to expect my cheque at the usual time.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe best part?

He scoffed when he was told that yes you can do that, but the department has to pay triple time.\n\nThe department had to negotiate an agreement to pay off the debt in installments over several months.

Around this same time, our local internet provider was running a promotion for new customers offering 5x the internet speed for roughly half of what we were currently paying. \n\nA couple of weeks before our move I called the internet company to let them know that we were moving and to transfer our service.  I asked if it would be possible to receive the new customer discount with the move and was told in no uncertain terms that this was not possible. I insisted that I wanted the new customer rate and even threatened to cancel, but they called my bluff, knowing that they were a monopoly and that I had no other legitimate option. \n\nThinking quickly, I asked if it would be possible to get the new customer rate by simply remove my name from the account and adding my wife's name instead. The rep balked at the suggestion and even quoted from a paragraph from my customer agreement outlining how such a transfer from one family member to another is not allowed. \n\nThen it occurred to me. I asked the rep if he know my wife's name or the address to which we were moving. After a brief pause, he answered \"ummmm...no.\" I then happily let him know that I would like to cancel my service, effective in at the end of the month. He was adamant that any attempt to circumvent their transfer policy was a violation of my contract, but eventually agreed to the cancelation.  \n\nTwo weeks later, after our move and a half an hour phone call, my wife signed up for our new cheap, fast internet. They jacked our rates up a couple of years later, but it felt good to get just one over on the big bully.",

Dude, you ARE NOT a new customer, so what the hell made you think you were entitled to that exact promo? Businesses have to attract new business, so this is a very common tactic and completely up to the company on who they offer discounts to. My guess is that when you signed up, you initially got the first 2 years at whatever promo price they had back then and then went to normal rates. This is VERY common, and you just want them to give you the cheaper rate again? It doesn't really work like that man...\n\nBUT... what I would have done is ask for some deal based on the promo for new customers. Basically, I would have been like 'Hey you guys are offering this deal to new customers, so do have a deal for me, a LOYAL customer that has been with you for X years that if I upgrade my speed to the one in the promo, I can get a similar rate?'\n\nYou can't expect a company to always keep letting you get the deeply discounted price. Think of it like if a software provider just kept extending your one month free trial - they would never make money. \n\nFun tactic, but they are running a business and need to make money, the same way you need to at your job.

Part of my job is to track attendance and regularly upload a report to corporate. \n\nMy store manager just recently (in the last 2 years) got hired by our district manager who she has been friends with for years. They managed to push out the old store manager who had the store running like a ticking clock. Ever since then, it has become abundantly clear that she has no idea how to run the store, and we have all suffered for it. She constantly screws up the store schedule, bullies employees she doesn't like, and has hired incompeted friends to management positions. We all dislike her and think she should be fired, but it seems like everything she does in the store makes us look bad while making her look good, until recently. \n\nLike I said above, part of my job is tracking attendance. Yet for years, it has been common knowledge that those in my position are expected to fail to upload attendance records to corporate because the company's policies on attendance are extremely harsh and many employees fail to meet attendance due to factors out of their control. For instance, employees who come in before we open to process our freight often clock in late because the managers on duty take their sweet time opening the front doors for these employees. It is not their fault that they come in late. And on some occasions, certain employees have been left outside for upwards of 30 minutes after ringing our doorbell because the only person who could open the doors was busy or didn't hear the doorbell which is soft. Anyway, if I should upload the attendance record to corporate, many of these employees would probably be fired on the spot by our regional manager (through email because these things are automated and mandatory).\n\nAs a side note, the store manager is one of the managers who likes to take 10 or 15 minutes to open the door for freight employees. We all hate her for this because when it is winter we have to wait those 10 or 15 minutes outside the door in the freezing cold and she acts like it is no big deal. \n\nAnyway, her district manager friend recently moved to another district and we got a new DM who is looking to move up in corporate. To do this, she has to make all of our metrics look awesome, including attendance. She sent an email to our store manager demanding an attendance record. I told the store manager that this could get many employees fired, but instead of realizing the implications, she told me to run the report anyway. I tried to tell her that this could result in most of the employees who had availability before we open (who are very valuable and rare) getting fired and she completely blew me off. She literally went as far as saying that I was not thinking straight. I told her that she could adjust the attendance on her end as the DM \\*clearly\\* wanted her to do (this has been common procedure due to the reasons for poor attendance) and she told me that she was the store manager, she would figure it out, and I should just do my job as I was told. \n\nSo I ran the report, and immediately got a \\*furious\\* email from the new district manager saying that I should have run the report by my store manager (to adjust the records) before uploading it to corporate. The next day, corporate sent an automated email with the names of all the employees that should be fired, which is not an email that our manager can either respond to or contest. She had to fire all the employees on the email. And as it turned out, every single employee with availability before we open got fired. 15 people. And every other employee in the store is a student with no ability to work before like 10 am, so there is nobody to process our freight (which is a massive job).\n\nI got an email from a friend in corporate yesterday that said the regional manager was lining up a replacement for our store manager due to incompetence.

Either they are making people wait, causing them to be late, and not paying them, which is a violation of labor laws, or they were fixing the records so that people were being paid but not allowed to begin work. When you multiply the amount of people x the hours x the wages this means a lot of money was being basically stolen from the company through mismanagement. \n\nI think you should do anything in your power without being fired to make this clear to corporate. Where I worked they had an anonymous tip line which I suspect wasn't very anonymous, but without identifying yourself in any way, maybe writing from the point of view of someone who stood out in the cold, you should try to make this known.  \n\nThey fired the wrong people and it could all be solved by dismissing that manager.

            "Reminds me of when I got a temp job at a sporting goods store. I was asked to dust off the plexiglass trays on the wall where the shoes were displayed. So while I'm doing that, a family comes in and is looking at the shoes. One of the shoe salespeople, a non-white woman who was obviously not born in Belgium (she had a very heavy accent and sometimes formulated her sentences a bit weird, but hey, at least she was trying), went up to them and asked them if she could help them with anything. They told her no and she went back to straightening out the displays in another section of the shoe department. The father immediately after she left turns to me and asks me for a certain shoe in a certain size. Now, this was my first day in the store, I didn't know how the system to find shoes in the storage room worked and even if I did, I didn't have access to the storage room.  \nI also realized that this guy didn't want the saleswoman's help because she was foreign. So I just go: \"I'm sorry, sir, but I'm not a salesperson. I'm just here to clean. If you need help with shoes, you'll have to ask my co-worker over there.\" and I point to the saleswoman, who was at that moment the only salesperson on the floor, because it was the calmest time of day of the calmest day of the week. This family were literally the only people in the store next to us employees. The man didn't say anything and he and his family just stormed out of the store mumbling (I presume some very things.).  \nAgain, this was my first day and this store had given me a chance after being unemployed for nearly a year, so I felt very guilty that they had lost a sale because I couldn't help the customer, so when the manager of the store came to check up on me, I told him what happened. He just shrugged and said \"I prefer not to indulge people like that.\". This happened 8-9 years ago and I have worked there as a temp several times (mostly as a side job on the weekends) and the things I've seen that manager deal with ... let's just say if more store managers were like him, the world would be a better place.",

        "selftext": "About a decade ago when I was fresh out of high school, I got a summer job working at a lakeside boat rental/bait & tackle shop. My boss, Joe (not his real name) inherited the shop from his father and took a massive amount of pride in keeping the family business going. Still, he wasn't one to give into bullshit, and clearly took it personally when a customer complained about anything to do with the shop he loved so much.\n\nOur lake was a pretty popular trophy fishing destination due to how large the local mackinaw trout got. Bossman wanted to reward people who planned ahead by never charging \"summer pricing\" (approximately $150 more per day) on reservations. Naturally this resulted our boats getting booked out weeks in advance. The catch was we did require a completely refundable, $100 security deposit (we said in case of damages, but was mostly to guarantee they returned the boat). Of course, every year, many people took issue with this policy.\n\nIn three years I saw this happen dozens of times - Boss had his malicious compliance down to an exact science. When a customer would refuse to pay the security deposit, Joe would state the deposit is non-negotiable. Almost always, the customer would then declare they're canceling their reservation, they'll never do business here again, generally recite the whole Karen manifesto. Joe would cheerfully agree, feed their paperwork into the shredder, and send them off.\n\nYou see, dear reader, of the three marinas on the lake, we were the *only* ones that rented out boats - the other two only rented out space for boats to dock. They'd never ask about our competitors, so Joe never had any reason to inform them. Without fail, within the hour the customer would be back, having realized that they couldn't get a boat elsewhere.\n\nUsually at this point business would be picking up, meaning I'd be (loudly) answering questions about boat rentals for other guests, and the customer's fishing buddies or antsy kids would be pushing them to get the boat already. Grudgingly they'd ask for their boat.\n\nJoe would fake concern and tell them that unfortunately, all the boats have been reserved for weeks, so we're usually unable to accommodate walk-in rental requests. As luck would have it, we had a cancelation earlier today! Since they don't have a reservation, however, we have to charge the summer holiday pricing!  Oh, and, just FYI, we require a completely refundable, $100 security deposit for all rentals. I hope that's alright with you!\n\nEdit: Clarifying, because it keeps coming up in comments, customers were notified of the deposit requirement when they made the reservation, but they didn't need to pay anything until the day of rental. We didn't require the deposit in advance to secure the reservation, but we'd only honor the reservation until noon if no payment had been received (which we also told them about). Most folks chose to pay day of.",

People get pissed about the deposit (even though it's a reasonable and cautious policy), cancel their reservations, and leave the store, only to find that other places don't rent boats, only space for boats, come back and ask to rent a boat, only to be told that all the boats are booked and even if there's a cancellation that they still have to pay the deposit, and now they also have to pay the summer price.\n\nFuck, that's brilliant.",
