        "selftext": "So let me set the scene. I'm a software engineer, I used to work for a pretty big company that specialized in developing software solutions for their client. I was sent on-site to the client which was a big malaysian bank, to play the role of  front end developer( basically make their internet banking website).  They already had backend services setup for a mobile application which we were also to use for the website. There was only one problem you could only install the app in one phone and login to your account, this meant that if the customer logged into their app, they wouldn't be able to login through the website. As anyone can determine this is a big problem. I went to the back architect and tried to tell him as well as the project manager of this problem. They told me I don't know what I'm talking about and stop disturbing them and just do my job and nothing else. (I later found out that they hated the previous front end manager and would never listen to the front team.) So I sent a mail detailing the whole problem to both of them and their bosses as well. As expected nothing happened, but my butt was covered.\n\nFast forward 2 months, the client reviews the architecture for the website and finds that no changes have been made to the backend to accommodate the different behaviour of the website. They call a meeting and blast the 2 above guys and their boss. They claim they are backend people and don't know the difference in behaviour in a website and it was my job to let then know. So they bring me in to question me why I didn't let them know and because of me the project has been delayed 2 months and the company has incurred losses. I calmy tell them of my meeting with 2 idiots and show them the mail which they ignored. Then it was a glorious explosion.  After that they always consider my suggestions.\n\n\nEdit:  People have been asking about the glorious explosion. Well basically the architect was called incompetent and his 20 years of experience was called into question and the project manager blamed everything on the architect.\n\nAftermath: After 2 months the architect was transferred to another project and replaced and the Project manager quit IT  and last I heard he is trying to setup an organic farming business.\n\n\nEdit2: Thanks for the silver.\n\nEdit 3: thank you for the various awards and thank you for the gold.",

            "Similar thing happened to me not long ago that ended up costing me my job. Except not because of why you would think.\n\nI was working for an IT company in Operations and I was doing all of our finances. Projections, tracking, keeping an eye on revenues, making payments, yada yada.\n\nAfter a few months of being there I started noticing a pretty bad downwards trend on our financial statements. I warn the CEO and a couple of other founders about the issue, why it is happening and I tell them what they should do.\n\nThey ignore my warnings, disregard my ideas every single time and shrug me off during every meeting.\n\nWell fast forward a couple months, I get a request for a meeting. Unusual. But I\u2019m not surprised. I do some digging before my meeting and find out people are getting laid off. Yup. I saw it coming. I\u2019m getting laid off because they can\u2019t afford to pay me anymore. They are sending away one third of their employees because they are tight on money. I warned them several times, told them the changes they needed to make to prevent this from happening and then they never listened to me. And I ended up paying the price because of it. They hired me to do a specific job and then they didn\u2019t listen to me.",
            "Similar story here. I was a consultant on a project for a bank. There was a vendor platform involved along with some custom code. \n\nDuring project implementation we discover a bug in the vendor\u2019s code and open a ticket with the vendor. I\u2019m speaking with the vendor and they inform me it\u2019s a simple fix but they\u2019re official product release is not for another two months. The client says that unacceptable and they need a patch same day. Not sure why given that we\u2019re not even in production, but the client insists I get the vendor to give us a patch. \n\nI go back to vendor and we strike a deal. They\u2019ll give us an untested patch strictly for development use only, and before our prod go-live we upgrade to the official release. One very important thing to note this is an untested patch and does not come with warranty or support. I am explicit in telling this to the client is email. Client says that\u2019s great, thanks so much for getting patch and let\u2019s ensure we are careful with our testing. \n\nFast forward to the prod go-live, the client still hasn\u2019t upgraded to the official release. I tell the client that we\u2019re supposed to but management says the patch passed all their testing and should be good to go. \n\nObviously it wasn\u2019t. We go to production, encounter a few criticism issues and the client is telling me to open tickets with the vendor. I do so, and as expected the vendor tells me there is no support for this. The client\u2019s management is absolutely floored. On the call they\u2019re very passed off saying \u201cwhat kind of vendor does not offer support?!\u201d I tell them this is why we signed up for with the patch. \n\nImmediately all blame shifts to me that I got them some flaky build, that I should have warned them, etc. I forward the same email I sent to the team. Boss was still pissed off but he didn\u2019t have a word to say to me",
            "Reminds me of my time doing IT for a grad school office. There was a larger, university IT department, but it could take hours to days to get a small problem fixed. My job was quick and easy fixes and to be point for dealing with the university IT department. \n\nThey decide to roll out a new web application, which was great because the one it was replacing was horrible. We test it. I find little bugs here and there and they get fixed. There was one issue, not really a bug, but something we knew from dealing with grad school applicants that was going to be a problem. \n\nA month and several new versions later, this issue is still there. I wish I could remember what it was. Pretty sure it wouldn\u2019t have taken long to fix. We start getting pressure because we are holding up the web app. So, we agree to let it be put into production. \n\nThe issue was fixed within three days because they got flooded with emails from applicants about it. \n\nI think it might have had to do with differences between how undergrad and graduate applications are processed. Been too many years for me to remember.",

On surface fine but working in food and beverage was shit. You would work a full shift then when leaving you would be \"asked\" to stay over because they needed people to help with that nights convention. Mostly due to schedule being understaffed to make management look good. So you would work possibly a full 2nd shift. Then get penalized for being late and dead on your feet for your next days shift.",

The school rule was something like a write-up and a detention after 2 absences, and a 5 tardies counted for 1 absence.

            "I have a similar story. From 2005-09 I was working as a software engineer in B\u2019luru. The first company I worked for was an IT services firm, and our clients were US based, so we had the usual \u201cget in late and stay late\u201d hours since our daily catch-up calls used to happen at 7 PM or so, and we used to stay back until 9 or 10, as required.\n\nFor a short time, we got this new account manager who decided that everyone needed to stick to regular work hours, so everyone was around during the same hours, increasing inter-team communication and productivity. We tried to be compliant, but it couldn\u2019t work, and all of us worked for the same client anyway, and those times were just how things were. So people soon started coming in at whatever time they previously used to, despite a few small warnings. The new AM couldn\u2019t tolerate this, so big meeting, big words, names taken, check-in and check-out times read out (mind you, the access control didn\u2019t record times, she had done so manually, or asked her assistant to do it), and since it was around the end of year, threats of low ratings, lower pay rises and bonuses. When we tried to clarify that we have to stay back to talk to the on-site guys, the response was that we wouldn\u2019t need to stay late, if we came in at the right time and started work early.\n\nPeople were legitimately pissed. So they started sticking to the letter of regular work hours: 9-6. Problem being that it was usually a bit too late and inconvenient for the on-site guy and impossible to get the client side manager to stick around for a daily 10:30 PM call, or too early for a 7:30 AM call. This was before 24x7 internet and smartphones, with every work computer being a desktop. Once you leave office, your connectivity ends. And while we could be reached on our personal cellphones, (a) not everyone had everyone else\u2019s personal phone numbers & (b) nobody would again navigate B\u2019luru traffic to come back to office after reaching home.\n\nCommunication ground to an almost complete halt. Things took double the time to get done and many things had to be redone because they were not clearly communicated or understood the first time around.\n\nOne fine day, as everyone had expected, but much sooner than anyone had expected, the response SLA was missed on a production issue. Flags were raised, emails were sent. Team was first yelled at, then listened to. Then the resolution SLA was also missed. Client was pissed! Everything was delayed, targets were missed across the board. It got ugly for that project.\n\nIt went on for barely a week before such \u201crules\u201d were dialled down to being just guidelines, with teams expected to exercise discretion regarding working hours as required. There were a few more changes like getting the team manager a work phone, but they were just to make it look better. A month or so later, she was moved out to a corporate role with no client interaction and we got a new AM.\n\nEdits: spellings, grammar and punctuation.",

I know my body a little better than a doctor does in terms of recovery and if it is something I'm not sure of I will see a doctor.  But my place of work has this silly rule that if you are going to be out 3 days you have to have a doctors note.\n\nAnyway, I got food poisoning the other day. It was the middle of the night right before I was going to go in before it started to hit and I knew what was coming.  It was going to be 36 hours of running to the bathroom followed by 24 hours of being super tired from not having eaten for the last 2 days and not having had any sleep for the last 48 hours.  It's a full 3 day recovery for me.  The first 36 really are the worst though.  \n\nSo I called in sick on Tuesday, and Wednesday and was going to call in sick on Thursday too to get my much needed rest and be 100% for work on Friday.  I know this is what was going to happen.  But when I called in this morning I was told I have to get a doctor's note to miss this day.  It's stupid because what is a doctor going to tell me that I don't already know.  But my doctor also hates these types of rules so she had my back.  \n\nI went to her this morning and told her what my work said.  She asked if maybe I might have had chills during my time being sick.  So I said yes.  She said, she doesn't feel comfortable saying it was just food poisoning and is going to say it could have been a stomach flu.  She's writing me a note to be out until Monday now. \n\nSo now I have 2 days of just rest and relaxation followed by the weekend.  Thanks for forcing me to go into the doctor!",

You also had to have a doctors' note *specifically* releasing you back to work if you were out for three days.

            "Worked in a unionized company providing a product to the military. Our sick policy was we had 4 whole unpaid 'hits' and 3 half unpaid 'hits' per a rolling 90 day period. A 'hit' was an absence, half was a tardy or leave early occurrence. If we had a multiple day absence for illness, we could either take each day as a hit or we could get a doctor's note to tie them together for one.\n\nThat was on top of however many weeks of vacation earned and 4 days of pto per year. Also FMLA for long term or family illness or emergency. And even with all that, people *still* abused it. A few people always cause problems for the rest. \n\nI loved my job.

More than a few days UA and you\u2019re considered AWOL (Absent Without Leave) which is even worse. Going AWOL could lead to a court martial depending on how long you were missing. \n\nOne time I arrived on duty with a throat so sore I couldn\u2019t swallow, but sick call didn\u2019t start until after my shift started. Come to find out I had strep throat and exposed everyone at work because I couldn\u2019t call in before going to sick call.

Incidentally I only have 4 sick leave days a year, I took 5 days off with the flu last year and the extra day came out of my annual leave.\n\nMy coworkers have it worse though. It seems there's a cultural expectation to not use sick leave, even though they are entitled to it. One of my coworkers had surgery for cancer, needed 2 weeks off, all annual leave.",

Not requiring a doctor's note until day 3 of an absence is a reasonable middleground between \"we trust you to adult properly\" and \"just double-checking you're not taking the piss\". 3 days is a pretty long absence in my experience.",
            "Have you read your work law in your country? It might be in YOUR best interest to go to doctors not as much as companies. It is quite same in my country, but the reasoning to this is that companies (your workplace) is forced to pay (your wage) only for the first 2 days of your sickness. All the other days after that comes from government. \n\nExample, I got a terrible virus and was out for 2 weeks, so it is 10 working days. According to law, my workplace paid for day 1 and 2 i was absent, all the remaining days were paid by government. If i miss 3 days, day 1 and 2 is counted as absent due to health reasons, and day 3 is counted as just absent and won't be paid. Also these day 3's can have a negative effect when you want to leave, or you are fired.\n\nWe have \"free healthcare\" here where I live, so it might be quite different if you are in the US.",

            "The 25th of September I was supposed to get a tooth pulled but they discovered a cyst on the root, and it involved another tooth.  I had taken the 25th off, and they couldn\u2019t do it then, and rescheduled for the next day as I needed anesthesia. I called and my boss was irate because I couldn\u2019t come in the 26th.  When I came in to work the Sunday (my schedule is Sunday to Thursday), my filing cabinet was missing.  He had come in to move it.  So on Oct 7th, I started having dizzy spells, including one when I was driving.  I had a recheck on the teeth the next day and had dizzy spells most of the morning, so I went to the ER, which did all kinds of tests.  Then they kept me overnight.  He was LIVID.  I called my supervisor as soon as I knew I wouldn\u2019t be in the 8th (Tuesday), but when I called back to tell her I was being admitted, he demanded the phone and then demanded to know if I was coming in the next day.  I told him I had no idea when I was getting discharged, so it wasn\u2019t up to me. He literally forced me to say that I would be out the following day (Wednesday), and was cornering me about the next day (Thursday) when I had had enough.  I told him the doctor was there, and that I would EMAIL him if I wasn\u2019t coming in Thursday.  While I was in the hospital, he moved another person into my office space - our most likely to go postal co-worker,\n\nI got a doctor\u2019s note for the 2 days I was hospitalized, and am getting a note for the teeth too, even though notes are supposed to only be for 3+ days sick.

        "selftext": "Background: I work as a front office manager in a client facing position. My primary role is to register clients, do paperwork, and solve any issues related to this. My office is right at the front, so when clients walk in, I (used to) go greet them, direct them to their location for the day, and give them the rules, etcetera. \n\nI have a fellow manager, who also works directly with clients. But he\u2019s a lazy, useless employee, and though technically doing greetings and introductions is his job, I did it for him, because he often couldn\u2019t be bothered to walk a hundred yards to do his job properly. \n\nSo here we are. It\u2019s a busy day. I\u2019m running between welcoming clients, registering them, and sending them off, multiple different parties at a time. There\u2019s lots of people around, one of me, and I\u2019m still working with a ten minute maximum turnaround time, which for my role is very impressive. I\u2019ve got these people in and out as fast as possible, while also doing someone else\u2019s job for them. The other manager is nowhere to be seen until the very end of the day, when he marches into my office. \n\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing? Why are you greeting clients?\u201d And so on and so forth. For a solid ten minutes. He even goes so far as to imply that because I\u2019m a woman, my only role should be doing the paperwork while he does the real man\u2019s work.\n\nI\u2019m so unbelievably pissed at this. I basically ran our operation the whole day while he fucked off somewhere, god only knows where, and he now has the nerve to scream at me. He finishes with a \u201cdon\u2019t ever do that again.\u201d First, he doesn\u2019t have any authority over me. We\u2019re of equal rank, with different roles. There was one other manager in the office with me going over paperwork, and he was so shocked he couldn\u2019t even retaliate. I\u2019m two seconds away from taking this asshole\u2019s head off. \n\n\u201cOkay, I won\u2019t.\u201d \n\nI then march out, because things would have gone very poorly if I had stayed.\n\nCue the next day. Asshole manager comes up to me and tries to apologize, while also one hundred percent not really apologizing, at all. He repeats much of the same shit said the day before, and still seems to not recognize the fatal flaw in his plan of screaming at me for doing his job, which is that now he\u2019s gonna have to actually work. \n\nI nod, smile, and fuck right off to my office.\n\nWhich I proceed to not leave for the next eight hours.\n\nI do exactly what my job is. I register clients. I do paperwork. That is it. I can see clients walking into the building, confused, obviously needing help, or expecting a greeting. \n\nBut hey. That\u2019s not my job.\n\nAsshole manager, after his half assed apology, had disappeared again, so I call him down.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got clients waiting,\u201d I tell him.\n\nHe gets there, late, and has a horde of angry clients waiting for him to actually do his job. There\u2019s so many of them because he\u2019s late that it\u2019s now his turn to spend the next six hours running around like a chicken with his head cut off, while I have a great time leisurely doing my job exactly to the limits of the description, nothing more. By the end of the day, I\u2019m feeling great, the clients are happy with my work- but the complaints are rolling in for him. He comes in at the end of the day again, obviously ready to yell.\n\n\u201cI had a great day. So much easier to get everything done when I\u2019m not doing someone else\u2019s work for them,\u201d I tell him. \u201cBy the way, I had time to process the customer requests for the week since I wasn\u2019t busy greeting. Here\u2019s your complaints.\u201d\n\nAnd I proceed to hand him a very thick stack of complaints concerning turnaround time, confusing directions, lack of space, and so on. Everything relating to his role. \n\n\u201cHave a nice night.\u201d\n\nAnd I leave. Haven\u2019t done his job for him since, and he hasn\u2019t gotten any better at it. It only gets funnier every time. ",

        "selftext": "Backround: When I was 16 while working as a bagger in a grocery store we got a new manager. We will call her Elisa. Elisa had a very \"I'm right, you're wrong\" attitude. She didn't care if she was in the wrong but you better do what she told you until she changed her mind. If you spoke out against her,  you would end up on her shit list and she would do her best to get you fired. \n\nStory:\n\nGenerally the bagger is the lowest position in a store. We collect carts from the lot, put away items, stock, clean, bag and some how we are always at fault.\nCue Elisa. \nI had an early shift. Clocked in, started morning duties and I heard on the loud speaker \"OP please come up to aisle 6 (Frozen isle, seafood).\n\n(Edit: . This is an oval shaped, open air freezer at the end of the aisle. 6 compartments, about 20ft long in total. 1 compartment on each end, 2 in between on each side. About 2 ft deep under the aluminum panels with fans facing out from the center. Drainage in the bottom. Freezing air blows out vents onto the merchandise above. Drainage compartments eventually clog with ice overtime.)\n\n\nI came in and Elisa gives me a smile and asks me to grab a bucket and scrub brush. We (I) was going to pull up the bottom aluminum floor panels at the bottom of the freezer and melt the ice that accumulates around the fans. It should take no longer than 30 minutes she said. Make sure you use cold water since we dont want the temperature sensors to go off(Anything over 42F will set them off and corporate would call).\n\nI say, let me make sure I have this right. You would like me to fill the bucket with cold water and pour it on the ice in the freezer while the freezer is at 19 degrees F? \n(*Stares at me like I'm stupid*)\n\nI inform her it isnt going to work. The water will freeze and just create a mound of ice. I suggest using hot or practically boiling water while watching the temperature . Elisa gives me a firm No and the threat of writing me up if I disobey. \n\nThe start of MC begins. I've already figured that no matter what I do I'm likely to be in trouble. To get the water I had to fill it in the Meat dept sink. The Meat manager asked what I was up to and I told the story with all the details. Meat manager is scratching his head and he heads over to call Elisa. She confirms and I hear a bit of arguing. Meat manager comes back, gives me a smile and says to do as I was told. He'd back me up.\n\nSo for the next hour I must have put about 200 gallons of cold water onto the the freezer fan (I switched from a 2glln bucket to a 5 glln). I stopped and moved to the next fan each time the compartment was to the brim with ice. I got 4 compartments done before she came to check on me.\n\nInstant rage. Elisa went from white to red real quick. It was also the first time I've heard a manager cuss. \nWhat the duck is this? How the duck could you screw up something so simple?\"said Elisa.\nI said, I did exactly what you told me to. I took buckets of cold water and poured them on the ice around the fans. \nRight as she said she was going to write me up, the meat manager came over after hearing her cussing.\n\nThe meat manager saw the ice filled compartments and mentioned that i should have used *HOT* water..\nThis.. sent.. Elisa.. over the edge. UP TO MY OFFICE NOW! YOU'RE BEING WRITTEN UP!\nThe meat manager did what he said he'd do. He stuck up for me. Meat manager mentioned that he double checked with her what she wanted me to do and I was was complying with her instructions.   \nShe went silent for a moment and it was like her head was going to pop off. She just took a deep breath and muttered out, Fix it, and walked away.\n\nThe meat manager gave me an extended industrial hose hooked up to the hot water. The water in meat dept can get up to 140 degress F to kill bacteria. The ice was gone in 15 minutes and since apparently the freezer temperature measured as a whole it never went above 34 degrees F. \n\nElisa avoided me for over a week afterward. I knew I was on her shit list and for the next 8 months she tried to write me up for the most pitiful reasons.. I eventually was given a written warning for leaving 9 minutes early with approval from the front end manager that was friends with Elisa. At that point I knew I would get fired for crap eventually and I quit without my 2 weeks.",

You need to help\"\n\nSo I stand there and bag for one checker. As this happens another line piles up because all checkers are also bagging.anager sees the line and tells me \"do your job.

That'd be way too simple.\n\nSo what do they do instead?  Why 3.5 L of ice, 4 L of water.  Whisk until the water is cooled and the ice is gone.\n\nRegularly I spent half an hour to an hour whisking ice.  Just.   Using kinetic energy to melt ice cubes, really.\n\nDifference is that SBux is a cult, and this had come down from corporate.  So instead of getting angry, the managers would just be so happy about how nice it is to send somebody to whisk ice.\n\nSometimes their eyes betrayed them, and you could tell that they hated sending somebody to whisk ice, hated losing the labour on it.\n\nThey could never say that, though.\n\nStarbucks says jump, you don't even ask how high if you're a supervisor or a manager.

            "Just FYI, most hot liquids freeze faster than cold ones. Freezing isn't just dependent on temperature; the molecules of the liquid need to be in the right orientation in order to freeze, especially water. When molecules are \"hot,\" they spin fast; the hotter the matter, the faster the spin. When water freezes, [the molecules need to be in a specific pattern to lock in place](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/n4ycXpWyaRgqqOnXX2tcVdLu3ycnh3KUOXfIow4VSFM_m0vDDbuPJaZwrw23238jTL_fuRZaBMhMyQDqydkHMXW3kZ2E3KLp2HvCnPb-Bj1ZnaCoqw2Jr3hT3KxPHIgvlPDj); they can get into that pattern faster if the molecules are rotating faster. \n\nIt's also why you can use cold water to clear ice on your windshield in winter, but not hot water. The cold water molecules try to bond with the water molecules in the ice, but it stays the same temperature; the liquid molecules pull the ice molecules apart, and the ice will just slough off without damaging the glass. Hot water will make the glass expand; it expands too quickly, and the result is a crack as the glass molecules try to move and rotate with the increase in temperature. \n\nThe way this should've been done was to clean each fan step-by-step, then move on to the next fan. Your manager didn't tell you this, so it's mostly her fault, but for the future try this: pour cold saltwater on the fans, brush the ice off, and quickly dry them the best you can before new ice builds up; maybe even do this process for each individual blade to keep the ice off as much as possible. I haven't worked in a grocery store or with big freezers like this, but I'm a science teacher so I know the physical properties of water like the back of my hand.",

Let me comment.\n\nIt sounds like Elisa was more afraid of EVER going over 42 degrees than she was of taking a long long time to melt the ice. Her method is much more likely never to trip the alarm than your method. She takes this conservative approach to ENSURE no alarms.\n\nYou, on the other hand, make the assumption that you understand the sensors and the alarms and you assume that if you pour a lot of hot water in, you can somehow know FOR SURE that the alarm won't go off.\n\nBut if you pour, say 150 degree water onto the ice and you haven't noticed there's a temperature sensor one inch down in the ice at that spot, you might easily raise that sensor above 42 degrees even though almost the entire rest of the cooler is solid ice.\n\nSo... she makes assumptions, not knowing everything about what she's doing, but using a method that won't cause an emergency alarm. You make assumptions, not knowing everything about what you're doing, but being pretty damn sure everything will be all right. You'll probably be okay. She'll probably be okay.",

Not only that, but I own my truck and my business.   \n\n\nOne day while coming into Laredo Texas, I was in the turning lane for my exit and this car whips out in front of me. Not really having enough room to stop, I tuned onto the shoulder, threw on the air horn (which is extremely loud when you're next to the truck) and stopped right beside the guy.   \n\n\nHe proceeds to get out of his car with his phone and starts taking pictures of my truck and plate. By this time the light had turned green so I gave him a few short horn honks to basically tell him to get going. He then beats on my door, so I roll my window down and he starts screaming about his ears hurting and how I'm damaging his ability to hear. He then demands that I give him my bosses number and my Drivers License Number, so he can call it in and report me and \"Have my job for this.\" And he proceeded to move his car to the shoulder and backs so close to my bumper, I couldn't get around him.  \n\n\nI kind of smirked at him and told him he didn't want to speak to my boss because he's is a short tempered man and that he wouldn't like what my boss would have to say about this issue, but he insisted that he speak to my boss. I also told him if he wanted to call me in, all he'd need was the numbers on the side of my truck since it's assigned to me (considering I only own one truck, you can imagine what I would assign my truck number to be)   \n\n\nI gave him my cell phone number and watched as he laughed while speaking each number as he dialed. I see his number pop up on my phone mounted to the windshield (he couldn't see it from his angle) and tried to hold in my laughter. I let it right for a minute and he's getting impatient, the whole time traffic is going around us. I finally picked up the phone and answered it. \"\\*Insert Company Name Here\\* Transport. How can I help you?\" His face turns beat red.  \n\n\nHe proceed to yell at me some more and tells me it isn't over because now he has my number (yeah dude, so do about 100,000 other people. So what?)  \n\n\nA week later I get a phone call from a number I didn't have saved in my phone, I had forgotten about the incident but thought it might be a broker, or a customer. I answer the phone and this lady chirps up. Turns out it was his mother and she wanted monetary compensation for her sons troubles.   \n\n\nI asked if she knew what had even happened and she tells me some story about how his bumper was damaged by my truck and that he was scared to talk to me because me driving an 18 wheeler was intimidating to him. Being a smart owner, I have a camera in my truck, and I dump all my trucks footage onto my hard drive, so I asked her if she could receive videos over email. She said sure but wasn't sure what I was about to send her. I spend a minute or two looking through the hard drive on my laptop and find the video of the incident and send it to her. While still on the phone, I can hear the audio playing as she watched it. Her tone changed in an instant and I heard her put the phone down, and all hell broke loose in that house. There was Spanish screaming, things being thrown, and lord knows what else going on. It reminded me of that movie \"A Christmas Story\" when Ralphie's mom calls that lady about the curse word and hears the apocalypse on the phone. Yeah, it was kind of like that, but in Spanish.  \nShe then comes back to me and very kindly asks for 2 things. 1. She asks that I forget she called and act as if this never happened because she was embarrassed to no end. and 2. If I could delete the video of her sons idiocy. I told her that number 1 was fine, I could do that. But as far as number 2, I would not delete the footage, but the only way anyone other than me or her would see it is if it was needed for a court case. She bid me good day and hung up the phone.   \n\n\nTL;DR - Don't ask for an owner operators phone number. It could land you in serious trouble with your mother.\n\nEdit: THANK YOU ALL FOR THE GOLD AND SILVER. You all are awsome!",

He started leaving and after my client trying to call his company, which was only him, the client called me thinking I\u2019d set him straight and keep him there. I told them the bill for 4 hours detention and hung up. Sent the invoice shortly after. Can\u2019t screw with a drivers time like that. I\u2019d rather lose one client than a reliable driver. ",

Nevertheless she would occasionally have to deal with parents and their misbehaving children.\n\nOne day a parent came in for an appointment after school very upset his 'Darling' was failing. My mother opened her grade book and second book where she kept notes for herself to remind her why she gave a failing grade/disciplined a student (middle school, 120+ students for 40 min a day) and showed them to the parent while explaining in detail about what had been going on. He very quickly calmed down and basically said: \"Thank you teacher. i hope you have a good evening. I will have a good evening. 'Darling' will NOT have a good evening.\" \n\nNext morning a very remorseful 'Darling' came in, apologized and basically behaved the rest of the year. \n\n&#x200B;",

She had forgotten she had cut her wheel to make a turn and so in reverse she went right into me. She said it was my fault and called the police. We waited over an hour for them. When they arrived they talked to her first. Then the police came over to me saying it looked like I hit her and the lady claimed she was stopped the whole time.

Well, neither can I, because I have $0 in the bank right now\". (We would only get rent money MAYBE once per year).

He sees them pull up and runs out the other door still screaming profanities at me and slams my door. I then find out that his mother is one of my favorite clients (they had different last names, so I never put it together until a co-worker told me) so I literally did call his mother on him, because she was an amazingly sweet, SUPER Southern, black momma. She loved me and I loved her just as much, we even exchanged Christmas gifts every year. She was absolutely appalled to hear what all he said and how he acted. Next thing I know, he and his momma are at my office door, I go let them in and she is dragging him by the earlobe and throws his head towards one of my chairs for clients and starts tapping her foot. He gives me a dirty look. She slaps him - HARD across the face. Taps her foot again. He looks up sheepishly and apologizes and promises it will never happen again.

He asked year make and model. I told him it wasn\u2019t the original engine. Told him the engine I had. He said \u201cno ma\u2019am that\u2019s not how it works. I need year make and model\u201d I said I even have the part number, but he refused to use that. \n\nI said \u201cok, so even if I do an engine swap, it\u2019ll take the same dipstick tube?\u201d Knowing full well it wouldn\u2019t. He said yes. I was like alrighty then. But I\u2019m not buying it until we walk out there and see if it\u2019s the one I need. So I told him year make and model and that it was originally a diesel. \n\nHe pulled it from the back and tried to ring it up. I said no we are going to go out there and hold it next to the one I have. He didn\u2019t want to, but ended up doing it. We go out there and I pop the hood. He holds it next to the old one that\u2019s in there and it\u2019s WAY too long. Like my hood would\u2019ve smashed it when you tried to shut it. I told him this is what happens when the engine is different from what was originally in it. It takes different parts. He said that didn\u2019t make any sense (I\u2019ll never understand that). \n\nI asked him if he wanted to sell me the part that I actually wanted based on the part number. He said no and that this one should fit. We walk back inside and I tried again to explain to him that it\u2019s not the original motor so it would take different parts. He refused to believe this. I said ok so this motor, one that takes gasoline, would be in no way different from the original, one that takes diesel, simply because it\u2019s in the same vehicle? He confirmed. \n\nI told him that he should really just sell me the part that goes along with the number, but he said it wouldn\u2019t fit my truck so he would only sell me the one that matches my year make and model vehicle. I was beyond frustrated and at a loss for how to explain this to him. \n\nI said that all I wanted was to not wait a few days for the part in the mail, and that\u2019s why I came in. He said that I should just come back with my husband because I\u2019m clearly confused with how trucks work. \n\nYea, I was the one who didn\u2019t understand how trucks work lol",

        "selftext": "Originally posted this over on r/idontworkherelady and they suggested this sub would appreciate it! Hope you guys like it!\n\nHad quite an amusing encounter over this past winter break.\n\nTo set the stage, I was working as a holiday helper for a UPS delivery guy. As a holiday helper they had us wear cheap brown vests with a small company logo on them. You\u2019d think that would be enough, but apparently not.\n\nNow although we mainly drop packages off at peoples\u2019 houses, we also went through a shopping plaza to drop off stuff at different stores. We were dropping stuff off at Kroger when this happened. The way it worked was I would take a cart loaded with packages into Kroger along with a [DIAD] (https://www.browncafe.com/community/attachments/diad-v-jpg.5078/), which was basically a scanner we used to log in packages and mark off deliveries. I usually did this delivery alone because it was simple and my driver could use the time to organize other stuff.\n\nSo off I go into the store with a decent amount of packages stacked up on the trolley, where I roll them over to customer service. Usually there\u2019s someone behind the desk when I come in, but sometimes the employee is out on the floor helping someone find something like they were today.\n\nStandard practice for me is to unload all the boxes behind the counter and then just wait until an employee comes back to sign off on them. So I unload all the boxes, stack them behind the counter, and then lean up against it to wait for someone to come by. While I\u2019m waiting I casually take out my phone and begin browsing Reddit to pass the time.\n\nThen I heard the \u201cAhem.\u201d\n\nI looked up to see some fifty-something-year-old lady scowling at me, with a cart packed to the brim with food. She had greying blonde hair done in that [\u201cI want to speak to your manager\u201d] (https://goo.gl/images/8uVAwl) style and was wearing a bright pink Nike top, blue leggings, and about two metric fuck tons of attitude.\n\nWe stared at each other and her expression soured with each passing moment like the milk that was undoubtedly curdling in her cart. Finally she broke the awkward silence.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d\n\nI shrugged. \u201cWell what?\u201d\n\nShe shoved her cart forward, almost bumping me with it. \u201cAre you gonna keep ignoring me? Or are you gonna check me out?\u201d\n\nI looked at her then down at my uniform, which consisted of a grey hoodie, black sweatpants, and my trademark brown vest. Kroger employees wear black khakis, blue-collared shirts, and no brown vests. I looked back up at her, trying remain polite, and said, \u201cI don\u2019t work here, lady. I\u2019m just dropping off packages.\u201d\n\nThe sour woman scoffed and jabbed a finger at my DIAD. \u201cBullshit. You\u2019re just too lazy to help me. Start scanning these,\u201d she shoved the cart at me again, this time bumping my thigh, \u201cor I\u2019ll get your manager.\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure why she didn\u2019t go to the standard checkout line either, but I guess if things got really busy, Kroger allowed customers to go through the customer service desk too. (It wasn\u2019t very busy anway.)\n\nNow I could\u2019ve taken the easy way out, told her to politely fuck off, and left, but then she took her phone to make a call and snapped her fingers at me, mouthing, \u201cC\u2019mon. I have to be somewhere.\u201d\n\nSo I decided to help her out and began to unload her groceries, one by one, in the most tedious manner possible. I scanned each fruit, can, veggie, and box with the DIAD (which is normally used for recording people\u2019s addresses. Funnily enough, it didn\u2019t know where the kiwi or Rotisserie chicken live, but it does make a satisfying little bleep when it rejects an address which sounded quite similar to a product being scanned.)\n\nI kept doing this for about ten minutes, often \u201cmiss-scanning\u201d something or inspecting it much to the woman\u2019s annoyance. From time to time I\u2019d interrupt her phone call to ask her a ridiculous question, such as: \u201cWould you like to add another grape to this bunch? There\u2019s one in here with a brown spot.\u201d\n\nShe would usually answer with a huffy \u201cWhat?\u201d, stare into space as she slowly worked through the question, and then shake her head sharply as she went back to her conversation.\n\nShe reached her breaking point when I inquired as to whether or not she wanted her eggs bagged individually or all together. \u201cWhat? Why the fuck would you-? WHAT?\u201d she demanded shrilly.\n\nI stood there, DIAD in one hand, egg crate in the other, looking completely innocent while trying not to die laughing. I could swear I heard her mind briefly shutting down at the stupidity of my question, before rebooting. Calmly and with a polite smile, I repeated the question.\n\nHer face was almost as purple as the grapes I\u2019d offered to discount as she struggled to form words. \u201cWhat... kind of a dumbass question is that?\u201d she croaked, her manicured nails digging into trembling palms.\n\nI placed the eggs back in the bag while nodding sympathetically. \u201cThe kind I ask someone who\u2019s too stupid to not take the hint that I don\u2019t fucking work here.\u201d\n\nBy this point the Kroger employee working the customer service desk returned and the lady turned on them with the fury of God. \u201cHOW CAN YOU LET AN EMPLOYEE TREAT ME THIS WAY? I SHOP HERE ALL THE TIME! HOW DARE YOU TREAT A VALUED CUSTOMER LIKE SHIT!\u201d\n\nTo their credit, the customer service worker took the verbal assault pretty well, holding their hands up in a \u201cHoly shit\u201d gesture as they tried to calm the lady down. Then they looked from her to me and back to her and simply reiterated what I said. \u201cMa\u2019am\u2026 he doesn\u2019t work here\u2026\u201d\n\nI was fascinated to see the \u201cdoubling down when you\u2019re wrong\u201d mentality in action, but to my surprise all the wrath leached out of this harpy in two seconds flat. It was the look of someone who realized the only way they\u2019d save face in a situation like this was to simply drop it. She pursed her lips at the employee\u2019s words and looked at my brown vest, as if thinking I was somehow still defying her logic.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d she said coldly, \u201cyou just lost a customer.\u201d Then, quick as she\u2019d arrived, the bitch turned on her heel with a flip of her grey attitude-do and stormed off.\n\nI was tempted to say that was more of a win, but figured I\u2019d antagonized her enough. Holding out my DIAD for a signature, I asked if the employee had ever encountered her before. He said he had, but never that angry. She was usually just demanding and arrogant to anyone else when she shopped there.\nAfter getting his signature, I helped him repack everything and asked if he needed me to help him take it back, but he said \u201cno.\u201d It was worth it just getting another tumorous customer out of the store.\n\nOnce everything was settled, I returned to the delivery van. (This entire ordeal only lasted about 15 minutes.) My driver, Jeff, wasn\u2019t too angry. He\u2019d arranged the rest of our packages while I was delivering and just told me to be faster next time. Then we continued about our day.\n\nTL;DR - Worked as a holiday helper for a delivery company and was delivering packages to a grocery store, woman decided I worked there so I absolutely must check her groceries out. So I did\u2026 with a package scanner, and scanned every one of her items with extra care.",

It stated something along the lines of, \"Help is on the way.\" I knew this wasn't a big deal as a few days prior the same thing happened to me. An employee told me they were having issues with their system. True or not, it really isn't a big deal and I can politely wait.  \n  \nI glance over at the lady once my screen displayed the message and she glared at me, \"I don't have the patience for this. I just... Seriously?\" She looked over at the sole self-serve checkout employee trying to un-bag and put back a full basket worth of unpaid for groceries. The employee was quickly trying to open a checkout for the next customer. The lady continued, \"This is bullshit, I don't have time for this. What the fuck is taking her so long?\" Why she was getting pissy with me I don't know.  \n  \nAs the employee finished moving the items from the self-checkout, which took less than 60 seconds, she said she would be right with me. She had to put the items to the side. I told her the lady next to me was first. I'm not in a rush and the longer this lady waits the more angry she will likely be.  \n  \nSo the employee sets the items aside and walks back to the pissed off lady. The lady stands in front of the self-checkout screen with her full shopping cart, not hand basket, and doesn't move to let the employee clear the screen. Mumbling and cursing at the employee this lady just can't believe that her day is being held up this long. If she was in such a rush I don't understand why she had a full shopping cart AND went to self-checkout. Cashiers are usually much quicker than I'll ever be at serving myself. Plus if you need help why would you stand in front of the screen!?  \n  \nNo malicious compliance here, unfortunately. Thankfully OP delivered on it, good job!  \n  \nTL;DR - OP's lady (possibly) didn't abandon Kroger like she said, but rather returned in blue another day and tried to use the self-serve with a temper.",

        "selftext": "I'm still unsure if it's really compliance, but my ex-employer announced some news regarding our jobs. It was obviously false, but instead of calling the bullshit, I treated it exactly as I would've if it was true and it bounced back in their face.\n\nIt was a while ago, when I was working in a community-based organisation. We provided end-of-the-line shelter for people and did rights advocacy in a medium town (100k). The salary was low but okay, but most employees were there because they believed in what we did.\n\nThe main problem was the manager. She didn't act accordingly to the set of values the organisation was based on, she was grossly overpaid compared to employees, took everything personal, made sure we were cut off from the administrators and created an atmosphere where people feared retribution. We were unionized, but after a few months I realised no one was ever filling complaints (even for trivial matters) because they feared she was going to lash back at them. Turns out she had done it to a few people in the past. Once I figured I wasn't going to stay there much longer, I decided to sign all the complaints I could (according to union I could sign anything I witnessed even if I wasn't the target) and figured I would see them to the end and leave. That way administrators couldn't claim not knowing and there was a chance for my colleague to have a better work environment.\n\nSo, of course, the next few months were a living hell. She picked on me regularly. Still, most people sided with me (at least privately, most of them fearing she would do the same treatment to them if they declared it publicly). One morning, she calls a staff meeting and explains that a large amount of complaints have been filed in the last months (looks at me) and the cost to settle them or to pay the lawyers to fight them might bankrupt the organisation and everyone is thus at risk of loosing their job soon(insert ominous music). Panic ensues. My colleagues as crying, they're calling their SO, a lot of people are BEGGING me to take them back stating she got the lesson, some of them are genuinely pissed at me. IMO it was obviously bullshit made to turn them against me. I mean, the sole emergency housing of a 100k city (annually filled at 115% capacity) would be closing for a dozen complaints where I'm not even asking for money in any form, over legal fees which are usually budgeted in advance? Come on, it's basic fear-brewing schemes. \n\nNormally, I would have questioned it during the meeting or tried to reason with them afterwards. But that time, I decided to comply with the narrative and treat it as true. I left for my break and did what I would have done if we were really closing : appealing to the public outrage to help us fulfilling our mission. I called the news. Told them verbatim the morning announcement, the service hole it would create in the community, the job impact it would have in the city etc.\n\nThe local news picked it up. They called the manager and administrators about running the story, questioning how come there were enough complaints to threaten a 35 year-old pillar of the community services, asking what the complaints were about etc.\n\nBefore 4pm that same day, we had another meeting to explain that we must have misunderstood the first meeting, as the organisation was in no way shape or form in danger of closing. Sure, we must have misunderstood. \n\nMorale of the story : let those who brewed the piss drink it.",

I'm on a laptop so any formatting errors are because I'm dumb.\n\nI (56M in the UK) was working in Africa as an operations manager for a large global security company from 2009 to 2014.\n\nThe country I was working in had been through a long civil war and was very under-developed (Think no paved roads, people living a very traditional African lifestyle). At the time I'd been working there on a 10 weeks in country, 2 weeks at home rotation for about 4 years.\n\nI'd flown to and from work so often that I had the journey down to the bare minimum travel time, and it worked out the cheapest option for the company because travel days were paid from when I left home. The shorter my journey the cheaper it worked out for the company.\n\nSomeone in the head office had looked at cutting down on travel costs, probably to make themselves look good and get promoted. As a result i got an email after a week at home saying they had changed my normal flight which was 5pm on Sunday from my nearest UK airport, via Amsterdam, then on to Nairobi, connecting with a 9am flight to the war torn country on Monday morning. The change was from the from a 5pm departure to a 5am departure the same day, same route, and saving about \u00a380. \n\nTo clarify, the 9am flight from Nairobi was the first flight to war torn country because the destination airport was the only surfaced runway in the country. It had had no runway lights or radar so all flights had to be in daylight.\n\nAnyway, I agreed to the flight time change, but they had to move it to the Monday so I don't lose a day at home, (All will become clear) they agreed because still saved \u00a380 on the ticket, no skin off their nose.\n\nOnce I got the flight confirmation I contacted the travel desk asking for hotel and taxi bookings, when they asked why I need these I explained that to make a a 5am departure required a check in at 3am, so I needed a hotel at the airport on Sunday night because no trains were running to get me the 3 hours to the airport from home for that time of the morning.\n\n The flights they booked would get me into Nairobi for 7pm - after dark - so I'd need a Hotel there and a taxi each way to  and from the hotel to get me onto the 9am flight on Tuesday - the same flight I would have been on if I'd left at 5pm but a day later.\n\nA couple of days go by and I got a phone call from the company travel desk telling me the travel plan was confirmed. I was on the 5am flight with a hotel reservation at my UK airport the night before, a hotel in Nairobi after landing and the taxi would collect me in Nairobi and drop me at the airport for my final connection.\n\nI asked about the cost saving, they said \u00a380. I then asked about the hotels and taxis... They replied, oh, they don't come out of our budget, that's the operations budget so you're fine.\n\nI was happy, I was arriving back at work a day later, still paid the same amount with a night out in Nairobi to sweeten the deal. My Boss on the other hand went nuts! Nobody had told him of the changes. My deputy flew out on the plane I flew in on, meaning I didn't get a hand over of the work that was going on. On top of that the cost for hotels, taxis and extra day's pay had all come out of my Boss's operational budget. I think the total amount added was almost \u00a31000, but hey, they save \u00a380 on the flight cost!",

            "Kinda reminds me of a story my dad told me from his working days. He was in a telecom union (in the US) and had to travel with his manager to somewhere out of state. Originally planned to travel on Monday, but his manager wanted to leave on Sunday afternoon instead. So they get to the airport and plane is delayed. Hanging out and the manager made some comment about the wasted time, and my dad was like, \u201cwell, I don\u2019t mind - I\u2019m getting triple pay.\u201d Manager responded along the lines of, \u201cwhat are you taking about?!\u201d My dad said, \u201cwell, according to our contract: 1) travel time is paid time. 2) this puts me over my 40 hrs for the week, so now getting time-and-a-half. And 3) it\u2019s Sunday, which means time-and-a-half AGAIN. But you wanted us to head out today instead of on a Monday\u2026sooo\u2026\u201d\n\nEDIT: I chatted w/ my dad this morning, and a slight correction: he was getting time-and-a-half for being over 40 hrs, and then DOUBLE time (on top of 1.5 time) for it being a Sunday.",

            "Ive had similar to this conversation as well with couple of my previous employers.\n\nMy job involved travelling to clients, be is sales or project meeting and such, but sometimes clients are pretty far away and traveling there will take time, often more than your normal office hours allow. \n\nOur general contract dictates that \u201dtravelling time is not paid\u201d, or similar, but meaning that companies dont have to pay for the travelling hours outside office hours. Which is completely ok, as of it has been agreed on at some point and it has been put into contract. But in practice most of the companies understand that the clients can be pretty far away and pay all the hours anyway. For example sometimes to get to the client, you need to drive 2h, take a flight 4h, taxi 1h, project meeting 2h, and then travel back again - thats full 16h day. Those are pretty long days, and you should be at the desk by next morning.\n\nWell, not everyone are co-operative with this and they require you to follow the base contract, meaning that I wouldnt get paid for travel time\n\nFck - no thank you.\n\nWith these employers, I begun to do the travelling only on office hours. So, I use one day to travel to client location and book a hotel. Then if there is time, I will do the meeting on the same day or on next morning. Next day I use for that meeting on the morning and/or traveling back, and if it was that long trip, I use the remaining time for long lunch so I just head back home after that.\n\nI remember this one time when I had a discussion with my supervisor for this practise, as he was wondering where I had been one day as I was not at the office meeting. I explained the procedure to him, that I had been at the client, and as the client is so far away that I cant reach them in one working day I had to stay overnight and travel back next day.\n\nAt first he was dumbfounded but slowly when he begun to understand the situation, he begun to argue that I cannot do this. That I cant use two working days for one short meeting with the client, that I need to be at the office at next morning. I asked how he would like me to proceed with the client in the future? Along with this I offer the instructions which he personally has given me for travel times, where we get no pay for the travel times outside office hours? \n\nTeams and such were not a thing back then, and my job involves a lot of survey on site, which is not possible via Teams anyway. \n\nMy supervisor had his hands tied then. He knew that he could no back off from the given instructions which he himself had pushed on us earlier, nor he could not either deny my logic for using two or more days for the client work, even if it was short on site survey for the project. He cant ask me to travel on my own time either - because thats my own fking time and employers have no control over that. I had to meet those clients, and it was not possible to do the surveys, meetings, sales etc. behind the desk. I had to be there and do the job. And If they pay me for 8h, they only get 8h.\n\nMost of the time on that business people are self guided and do what is best for the company, often sacrificing their own time, family time, etc. for the company, using more than that 8h/day for example traveling around etc. But we want to be compensated for those hours we spend in plane, train etc. Its not worth the money really, but Im not going to do that for free either.\n\nBut yeah, some companies who enforce idiotic policy to their employees, will have it rough.\n\nI personally didnt mind spending two days for traveling for those meetings and such, I enjoy traveling and I have my ways to spend time no matter where I am.",
