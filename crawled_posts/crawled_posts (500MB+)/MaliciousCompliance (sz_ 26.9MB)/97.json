        "selftext": "Disclaimer: This story may qualify as Pro Revenge but I feel my hand in it was MC.\n\nMy first part-time job was in a cafe, starting when I was 16. As jobs go, it was pretty good. It was minimum wage of course but the owner was flexible with schedules, we got discounted food and my coworkers were generally lovely people. \n\nThe only issue I had occurred when I turned 18. In  my country (UK), minimum wage is set at one level for 16-17 years but then rises by around 30% for 18+. \n\nWe'd always been paid cash in hand weekly so I knew things were not exactly koshier but when my first pay envelope after my 18th birthday came, I was still surprised not to see my pay bump. \n\nThinking it was just an oversight, I informed the owner that I hadn't received my pay increase but they waved their hand and said \"Oh no, minimum wage is discretionary\" in a matter of fact way. I laughed at this and they acted like I was naive and said \"Trust me, it is. I can't pay you any more but you're free to try your luck elsewhere\". So that's exactly what I did. My colleague who had also just turned 18 and I had both found a new place paying more than double our current wage within a few weeks.\n\nThe only issue was that I was asked to start with only  a few days notice, on a weekend I was scheduled to work. I called the owner to let them know I had found a new role and could work my other shifts but not at the weekend and they told me my notice period was two weeks, to which I responded, \"Oh no, my notice period is discretionary.\" They didn't like that and told me not to bother coming back. \n\nThat was the last I had heard of them until a few months later when I received a letter informing me the government was investigating them on my behalf for unpaid wages. It turns out a colleague I had enlightened about minimum wage of course not being discretionary had also left and contacted HMRC. \n\nA couple of weeks after, I received my cheque from the owner in the post and I found out that within a few months the cafe had to close and let their staff go because of unpaid taxes. \n\nAll because they didn't want to pay us \u00a34 83 per hour. (Edit: I had said \u00a35.80, looked at the wrong figure).",

            "When I was 16 and working at a Togo's, my paycheck was short as I wasn't paid for my recent overtime. When I asked the owner about it, she explained that over time was either over 8 hours a day or over 40 hours a week. And she, as owner, got to pick which one. I gave her a very confused look, so she proceeded to explain that 30 years ago she worked at a job where they worked three shifts of 10 hours and didn't get paid for overtime, as the owner had chosen 40 hours a week. (She neglected to mention the job required them to sign a paper allowing the business to pay them as such.) She went on for a good five minutes, all of pure nonsense. Seeing I was still confused she asked condescendingly, \"how can you possibly still be confused?' I started to reply with \"because, according to California state law..\" when she cut me off with \"OH we're going by the law now are we?!?!\" I replied \"aren't we?!\" She rolled her eyes and said she would ask her lawyer.\nA few days later I asked what he had said, and she begrudgingly admitted I was right. \n\nI expected to see the money on my next check, but of course it wasn't there. As I wasn't yet as confident as I am now, it took me a few weeks to muster up enough courage to demand that overtime money. But before I could, she died. So I decided to just drop the subject, it was only like $12 anyway. \n\nThis is the same lady that told me workers comp didn't exist and was a myth, so I better not go to the ER when I sliced my hand open and blood was running down my arm.\nI told her I broke my nose at my last job, and, wouldn't ya know it, everything was paid for because, gasp, workers comp does exist! She said it was different.\n\nI really did hate her.",

Each time paying for parking in a garage for 2 or so hours then going to meander around the area. Finally, I go park close to the venue and paid for parking until the time it was free. Total I probably paid $40-50 for parking throughout the day. Enjoyed the concert, but come back to a parking ticket on my car. \n\nI think, \"this is odd,\" but I am tired and chalk it up to a mistake. But I decide to take photos of my parking spot (both spots on either side were taken) and all the signage and head home for the evening, figuring I would sort it in the morning. \n\nThe next morning, I review the ticket, the photo of my spot and my parking receipt. The ticket did not line up to the spot my car was located in and my receipt shows that I had valid parking at the time of the ticket. So I submit an appeal thinking this will be easy, its obvious that a mistake was made. \n\nThe appeal was denied. The ticket was for the spot that was not paid for, ergo it stood. I called the office, and the lady said they did not make a mistake as my receipt showed that I paid for spot X-1 and the ticket was for spot X. I ask about the photo proof that my car was in spot X-1. She said, \"well you could have moved the car\". Note that the parking receipt included my license plate number and everything (think park mobile like system). I noted that there were cars in spots on either side of me and that the entire street was full because of the concert. And honestly, I don't think they bothered to look at the photo. Even had that not been the case, I had proof that that license plate had a paid parking spot. No matter what, no dice. \n\nI am feeling petty over this $25 parking ticket at this point. So, I called Visa and asked if I could retract the amount I paid for the time that I had parked since it didn't count. I submitted all the evidence and documentation to Visa. Visa, in what was the greatest thing Visa has ever done IMO, they agreed that if my parking receipt and transaction number wasn't proof I had paid for parking, then clearly I had paid for a service I did not receive. And they extended my initial request of cancelling the one transaction to include all the parking spots I had paid for through the system that day, valued at more than the parking ticket. Then they filed a formal complaint on my behalf with a letter explaining why they were refunding me. \n\nI would not have been nearly as satisfying if I had not spent the entire day playing tourist in the city and wracking up a large parking bill all with the same vender.",

She then noticed that the signs were uncovered\n\nShe was going to pay it but I told her to just wait a bit and see if we can dispute it. Her boss overhead them talking about it and told them not to pay it\n\nHe works for the local council and had it in writing that the bus stops weren't active until the end of this month. They all disputed it and got it cancelled (and the signs are covered up again)",

Because if it's a private vendor, they have no actual ability to enforce their \"penalty.\" They certainly can't add points to your license.\n\nCan't go after you through collections either, since they'd have to get your information through DMV, which the DMV won't do. And most definitely without a contract between you and the parking people, they can't threaten your credit.\n\nThis has happened to me before and I've told the parking people to go pound sand, since I knew I was in the right.

I got tickets for the venue. To save on parking I went to park in my dads reserved space. As soon as I got out of the car a guy runs up and says parking is 5 bucks.\nI tell him no parking is free for me, I rent that space he argued back and forth that he is going to tow my car as soon as the police approve it.\n\nPolice show up, get pissy with me about not paying.

In the middle of the concert, someone erected \"No Parking\" signs on the lot and towed the entire lot. I had recently snowed and you could see metal shavings from where they had drilled to attach the signs.

Reason being is because the equipment used analog dials and old school switches.  Everything goes well for the most part, the new owners were all receptive and willing to learn.

Did you follow the pointers that he gave you?\n\r\nPC: of course I did.\n\r\nM: No, you didn't.  If you hadn't brushed me off so quickly I would have told you that the oven is imported and uses Celsius not Fahrenheit.

If anything it was seen as a detriment because of arrogant fucks like this. A cook whose sum total experience is a year in casual dining like Chili's and Olive Garden can be a godsend. Those people usually know how to work a line, do it quickly, and follow instructions. New culinary school graduates? HA! Arrogant douchebags sadly outweigh the capable.\n\nAnd the most arrogant ones are almost always the bakers. I have no clue why the hell that is, but anyone that bakes and goes to culinary school goes in a twat and comes out a bigger twat.

The difference between 375C and 375F is *huge* - as in, one is the very top end of the temp capabilities of most ovens, and the other is the middling temperature you bake cookies at.   It should have been obvious to him that something was not right the moment he turned the dial to set the temperature, let alone opened the preheated oven.\n\nThen not realising about double-panning the pastries is a second major rookie error.   You *watch* delicate stuff in a new oven for exactly that reason.   Sure the first batch might not have been perfect, but any baker who knows their stuff should have been able to work out that the pastry was being burnt from the bottom - and to buffer it with an empty tray.   It\u2019s basic oven-baking problem solving.   ",
            "The bakery where I worked had  new owners and a wonky rotary oven. A great big chain, similar to a chainsaw or bicycle chain ran a loop over a sprocket, with trays hanging off that would swivel about during the bake. The chain had to be hot greased every day or the trays would fall off as the chain shuddered over the old ,worn sprockets. Some trays that had fallen could not simply be hung again because they had become damaged in the fall. You also had to balance the trays or the whole works could jam, one tray would fall off and knock your whole nights work onto the bottom of the oven. Clean off five gallons of semi burnt muffin batter once and you will be sure to avoid doing it again.\n\nThe new owners were touring the bakery. On the floor in front of the oven were the swivel trays that were waiting for a trip to the repair shop, a trip they made regularly. I told the owner the what, the why and the how of all things oven and trays related. I reiterated the need for balanced load and undamaged trays. By this time over half of the trays were out of service, which slowed the bake a lot. I requested that they, as the new owners, get them repaired immediately for reasons. That was the night of my \"Friday\". I returned two nights later to find that the pile of twisted swivel trays was gone, and the oven now held the full complement. I thought that this was pretty fast service, and got on with the night. Half way through the night I start the bake. Every muffin tray was full and loaded. Then I heard a bang, followed by a series of bangs and thumps. The whole load just dumped! The new owners had ignored everything that I had told them, and simply loaded all the broken and twisted swivel trays.  Because a low caste baker must clearly be a moron and therefore is not worth paying attention to.\n\nThat morning as i left for good I explained again exactly why their mistakes left them with nothing to sell that day and why I refused to work for such idiots. They tried to make a lame threat about if someone called for a reference for me and I laughed in their face, knowing they would be unemployed before I was.",

        "selftext": "Recently our OG manager who was fantastic just left. One of the biggest things he did for our team was to keep the higher-ups from meddling in our day-to-day lives. As long as we hit our targets we could pretty much do as we please.\n\nWant to work from home 4 days a week, no stress. Want to go out on the road and meet clients face to face instead of meeting over zoom/phone, be his guest. Feel like closing all your deals at 2am every night and not logging on until 3pom the next day, why not? Basically, do whatever, let him know, and hit the targets, it was all cool by him. You get the drift. \n\nBecause of this, our team works our asses off and constantly hit targets. With myself and a few others doing so well we recently got promoted (personally I got the 2IC job to work with new manager, show him the ropes, train the new staff etc). \n\nHowever, OG manager leaves as he can't take the stress from the higher-ups breathing down his neck about his management style. Even though we constantly make/exceed targets, they are unhappy as he is not doing it through their formula. \n\nAbout a week or so after OG manager leaves, the new manager and pretty much another sales team are hired. New manager is essentially just a yes man for the higher-ups. Our super awesome work space goes downhill, we are required to be in the office 5 days a week 9-5, given a set seating plan, and spend our time cold calling, not relationship building. \n\nWe do this for a few weeks, the older reps who worked for OG manager aren't having the best time. As not only are we now dealing with this shocking environment. Plus we have to train new staff (and the new manager) on the systems, the product, meaning we really have no time to sell.\n\nThen we have a meeting. \n\nNew manager starts going on about the importance of the new system. as it will increase sales, which in turn will increase our commission. \n\nNow we get to the good part. \n\nThe head office lady came down for this meeting (she doesn't have much day-to-day in the sales stuff).\n\nShe is quiet until the end when she pipes up. Saying how this company has room for growth, is willing to promote internally, uses me, and points out me and some of the older sales reps as examples. She then goes on to ask for the resignation of anyone who doesn't believe her way will work by 5pm the next day. \n\nMe and the other sales reps who were there with OG manager simply comply with her request and hand our notice periods in at the end of the next day. \n\nLeaving the company with a sales team that consists of a manager that doesn't know anything about the product or role, and a totally fresh team of newbie starters who have no idea what they are doing who will not get anywhere near the target for a looooooong time.\n\nEdit:\n\nSo, I didn\u2019t expect this to get any traction I very rarely post on reddit. I was just posting to get it off my chest one last time so I wouldn\u2019t bother family/friends with all this nonsense. So there\u2019s stuff I should\u2019ve added. \n\n\n1. \n\nAfter I put in my notice, new manager called me and asked why I was leaving & that he was disappointed as he wanted to learn about the ins and outs of selling the product from me. \n\nMy response was along the lines of \u201cas was clearly stated in the meeting, I do not believe in this structure so as per your request I handed in my resignation\u201d. That felt really good. \n\nHe then asked me to reconsider & offered to allow me to have privileges like WFH, flexible hours, road trips, another pay rise. I think they realised how much of a clusterfuck it was going to be when no one knows what they\u2019re doing. \n\nI declined this offer as I don\u2019t wanna work in a place like this. \n\nI again said no, as I don\u2019t wanna be above anyone else in the team, working in teams with preferential treatment never does well. \n\n2. \n\nYes I know that this was most likely a plan by management to get some old staff to leave. But I\u2019m in my mid 20s, no dependents and had another job lined up. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a position I have to be in, it was one I was in because I enjoyed my team and the environment I was in. It\u2019s not a situation where I simply must be there. \n\nSo no point staying somewhere shit for the sake of it, plus the look on their faces was classic. \n\nAnd being able to answer the question of why I resigned with \u201cas per your request\u201d was awesome. \n\n3. \n\nDuring my notice period, new manager and head office lady were obviously very pissed. They asked me to transfer my leads (which I did), but didn\u2019t ask another thing or say anything to me for the reminder of my time. \n\nThis job is also salary + commission, so I very happily sat in the corner took my last few weeks of salary and watched video essays and did life admin for the entire time I was required to be there. \n\nOn my last day, no one said a single thing to me. So I handed my equipment to HR & just dipped on out without so much as a goodbye from either of them.",

Manager said no problem. \n\nMind you, this was in a shopping mall and it was Christmas season, so we were busy all the time, but my manager understood school came first\n\nBut then the owner found out and cornered me one night, yelling at me for leaving when they were busy.

At end of shift, I clocked out, bummed some paper, wrote out my immediate resignation and handed it to the manager on duty.

He confided in me that they were basically told not to hire any of us who lost our old positions, even if we were highly qualified.  He had 11 management positions he couldn't fill in his market, and I was well qualified and experienced to do 8 of them, and he couldn't touch me.  He said fuck it, and ended up retiring soon after.  He told me it was due to that and several other bullshit reorgs and changes the company made.  \n\nWithin six months, Three other highly experienced managers at my old location walked out, two with no notice.

            "This sounds like an OM from a company I previously worked for. I was out on disability at the time due to issues largely stemming from my own boss, but the project brought in this new OM who was the one brought in to fix struggling projects. Uh huh. My fianc\u00e9 was a TM at the time and she was on him about any and everything she could, so he stepped back down from being an awesome TM that most of the ATM\u2019s went to and a dedicated group of agents. By this point I no longer worked for them and just watched from the sidelines as our site\u2019s top project bombed out because of the way this woman wanted things run. Only a few months into being an agent, my fianc\u00e9 put in his resignation and when she asked he told her straight up it was because he felt like she was just looking for a way to get him fired. \n\nThen not even like 2 months after he quit, the BPO loses the project completely and everyone is shuffled over to another project. Of course with the same OM to make sure standards are met. Keep in mind this is like the 2nd or 3rd biggest client we had before the one everyone previously worked for got moved. Lots of unhappy people. And quality got tightened up on them to the point they had to keep their cameras on and couldn\u2019t be at the desk for lunch or breaks (this is wfh), if someone else was seen on screed like a child or someone walking across a room you failed that call. You also failed if anything could be heard from a bird screeching, a child crying or talking, anyone watching tv or talking in the background, and heaven forbid UPS knocks on your door! Latest word is that project is failing fast. Isn\u2019t she just a great OM \u201cproject fixer?\u201d \n\nOh and best part!! The project I worked on before moving to quality, and that my fianc\u00e9 worked on\u2026 this project and a couple related to it were also at other locations or work from home. We put such a bad taste in this HUGE company\u2019s mouth they opened up a few more corporate call centers around the country to not have to rely on BPO\u2019s anymore.

If its neutral they have to add their little, typically annoying and useless, change to make it \u201ctheirs.\u201d\n\nIve literally seen entire companies start to fail because corporate gets involved. It blows my fucking mind because people with business degrees are supposed to understand economics. And one thing economics is clear on is that you want eyes on the ground who actually understand.\n\nNo amount of corporate planning beats genuine input and insight from a local who knows what they are talking about and what others like then want. LITERALLY FUCKING NOTHING BEATS THAT. I KNOW WHAT I WANT CORPORATIONS DONT.\n\nIll give an example with the ultra \u201canti woke\u201d crowed. They want a company that doesn\u2019t make any political statements. They are a group that will pull their money. They will find alternatives. And they do this in all directions. There are companies that sell to this crowed and they get absolutely steam rolled when they make political statements. \n\nWhy do companies that have a large base in these people then make political statements and do things that throughly piss off this base of people? (There are a few industry\u2019s in particular that took like 15-40% hits over this in a month and never recovered)\n\nIts because people in corporate and in my experience advertising convince them that if they suddenly make their product \u201cfor everyone\u201d more people will use it.\n\nIt wont.\n\nThats just one example. But its always like that. Bank of America is named that way to get \u201cpatriot\u2019s\u201d Imagine them comming out and saying \u201cfuck America we are for the world.\u201d\n\nThats what your corporate just did to its clients.",

        "selftext": "So I work for a maintenance and renovation company in Finland. My work consist mainly of customer service, answering the phone and talking to customers in person in the rare case that they show up to our office. Maybe 70&#37; of all the calls we get come from the same few people, who are impossible to please and usually very rude.\n\nThe woman in this story was one of the worst people I have ever had the pleasure to deal with, she wasn't reasonable in any way whatsoever and usually just resorted to shouting at me or my coworkers. What made the matter worse is that she was the chairman of the board of her condominium, which is in no way impressive, since usually no one wants to do the job (it doesn't pay anything and the board consists just of the more active residents). For some unknown reason it still boosts the ego of some people so much that they think everyone is beneath them :D (go figure).\n\nThis brings us to the MC itself. The apartment building she lives in has a big garage, and it says in our contract that we must wash it once every year (its a big job that lasts for about 10 hours if 2 people are on it), still our company has washed it twice every year because the garages near this one need to be washed twice a year, and no one ever remembers that this garage is only once a year. About a month had passed since the last wash and then this phone call happened:\n\n>**Me**: Hey \\*company\\* customer service, this is u/JJnnYY how may I help?  \n>  \n>**Colossal Bitch**: What the HELL is going on here??!?!  \n>  \n>**Me**: Im not exactly sure what you are talking about m'am?  \n>  \n>**CB**: THE FUCKING GARAGE YOU IDIOT, ITS DIRTY AND MAKING MY CAR DIRTY  \n>  \n>**ME:** The contract says that we need to wash the garage once a year and...  \n>  \n>**CB:** I DON'T FUCKING CARE ABOUT YOUR BULLSHIT EXCUSES IT NEEDS TO BE WASHED TWICE A MONTH IF YOU IDIOTS CAN MANAGE IT (*this is absolutely Idiotic*)  \n>  \n>**Me**: But m'am its gonna cost a...  \n>  \n>**CB:** I dont fucking care JUST GET IT DONE \\*hangs up\\*\n\nSince she had the authority to make this kind of call I decided to take her request seriously. I know that it was absolutely ridiculous and would 100&#37; bite her in the ass at some point. I talked to my boss and he gave me the green light, I confirmed her request via email, because I wanted to cover my ass and have the order in writing. Now, washing a garage this size costs usually about a 1000-1500\u20ac when embedded in to a bigger contract. But since this was extra work it cost a lot more. So every month we billed them for about 5000\u20ac more than usual.\n\nI still don't know how, but it took them 3 months to notice that their costs had dramatically increased. Obviously many of the other residents of the building had asked us why are we washing the garage twice a month now (its a big inconvenience, since they need to move their cars). We just answered that it's a new policy of the chairman of the board.  When the board finally noticed, they contacted our CEO and me. We explained the situation and. CB tried to cause a big fuss calling us liars and such. I wish I could've seen her face when I sent her and the whole board a copy of the email in which she had with quite *colorful* wording demanded us to wash the garage twice a month writing: *\"I don't care about the costs try to fucking understand\".*\n\nShe was replaced in the board and no longer has any say about the buildings affairs. Most of the other people in the apartment building know she's a colossal cunt. Me and my coworkers absolutely love it :D we have a statement ready for every time she calls about something other than her own apartment:\n\n>*Sorry m'am we have been informed that you no longer have any say in regarding the business of the apartment building, if however you have a problem regarding your own apartment feel free to contact us again!*\n\nThis drives her absolutely insane. I'm pretty sure she's gonna murder one of us :D *But its so worth it.*\n\nTL;DR  Lady wanted me to have a big ass garage washed twice every month. I did as she wanted even though i knew it                         was idiotic and expensive. She got sacked because of it and we got our oh-so-sweet revenge.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI might have used a wrong word for the garage. Not sure what the correct word would be in this case but its basically a big parking garage with over 150 parking spots in it.\n\nAlso, during a year big garages like this one tend to collect a lot of road dust and gravel. This dust then rises in the air when cars drive around the garage, getting the other cars dirty and causing problems with the ventilation systems. Thats why they need to be washed at least once a year.\n\nAlso wanted to clear something up about the condominium stuff. ~~No, its not like a HOA from what I've read.~~ Basically in Finland every one of these big apartment complexes is their own \"company\" called \"asunto-osake yhti\u00f6\". The companies shareholders are the people who own aparments in the complex. They pay a certain fee, a \"maintenance charge\". Which is used by the board for renevations and maintenace. The laws around these \"companies\" are a lot looser,  and their goal is not to profit, but better the quality of the complex and the aparments in it. The board in these \"companies\" doesnt work normally :D\n\nEdit 2: Grammar\n\nEdit 3: Okay so apparently the HOA in the states is a broader term, and exactly the same thing as the Finnish As Oy (Asunto-osake yhti\u00f6). TIL :D. Also unfortunately the woman in this story did not have to pay for the extra costs. Its a really big apartment complex, so the extra amount wasn't that big of a deal and they didn't have the energy to start fighting with her, so they took the high road and just fired her from the position.",

Dozens of messages from the HOA president, culminating in a angry one full of name-calling and demands. Mr. HOA wanted the next appointment free, he didn't like how long the grass was even when it had been cut, the hedges were getting shaggy, etc. \n\nAnd then the kicker.. \"I expect you out here first thing in the morning to get everything back up to spec and I don't care if you have to have people every day of the week to keep it exactly that way.\"\n\nWhat'd he do? He popped the answering machine tape in a drawer and scheduled a crew to mow and trim every day. \n\nAt the end of the month the bill he sent ($1700 instead of $250) made the HOA treasurer flip out so hard she actually showed up at his office. \n\nSo he played her the tape.

I did, and the office looked like they'd been eating popsicles.\n\nI worked in a low key office with a great set of coworkers.  The managers were a mixed lot but had a great admin who was the heart of the place.  She was very outgoing and liked to joke with us.\n\nShe kept a glass jar of candy on her desk, and we helped ourselves as we chatted with her.  One day, I walked up and took the last piece of candy.  \"Hey\", she said in mock anger, \"What are you doing, taking all my candy!  You'd better be planning on replacing it!\"  I laughed. \"Sure will.  But we warned you if you kept food at your desk, it would attract pests!\"\n\nThat night, I had an errand and saw a candy store.  I went in, looking for something unusual.  I found it - some obscure gumballs for kids.  The gum was designed to *dye your mouth* as you chewed it!  There were warnings on the bag, but not on the individual pieces.  I bought enough to fill the jar.\n\nAfter the next few weeks, it was common to go into a meeting and see a normally staid engineer with a purple tongue or a green smile.  No one seems to have made the connection with the candy jar - or if they did, they didn't want to be the one who spoiled the joke.",

For example, during one of the Girl Scout cookie gluts, one of the guys hoarded stacks of various cookies at his desk, so the crew that worked til 6pm took a bite out of each cookie and left the rest at his desk.\n\nAnyhoo, providing candy in the dish gets tiring after a while, especially when one is the least paid in the group.  Also, whoever was emptying  the dish would do so when I wasn't at my desk so I couldn't tag them to refill the dish.  One day, I spotted some of those joke items, such as the \"disappearing ink\" etc. and there was some joke chocolates that looked very realistic but was made of rubber.

        "selftext": "This happened about 15 years ago or so. I was a team lead (this will be important later) at an IT help desk for a company that provided outsourced support to companies in a specific profession. Said profession is known for having employees that are very demanding and need everything Right Now.\n\nOne of the people I supervised was\u2026. let\u2019s say challenging. We\u2019ll call him George (See:  [https://www.chroniclesofgeorge.com/](https://www.chroniclesofgeorge.com/) for the joke). George was late 15 or so days a month, spoke in a mostly incomprehensible mumble, and had been caught by callers multiple times falling asleep and snoring while on a phone call. He\u2019s also not so great at troubleshooting, and worse at documenting his troubleshooting steps. At this point, I\u2019d been on a months long crusade to have him fired, because he was dragging down the team and giving me a constant headache because I had to follow up with his disgruntled users.\n\nOne morning, I got a phone call from a newer user, who was extremely agitated and already angry about his computer issues. I barely got off my standard greeting when this happened. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re really good at whatever it is you do here, but can I talk to one of the men? I need this done right now.\u201d I\u2019m never exactly sure why people think my lady parts make me incompetent with a computer, but hey, he did ask for a man, so I\u2019m happy to oblige.\n\nI check around the room, and it\u2019s early so no one else is on a call. Gee, who on earth should I send this ray of sunshine too? Obviously, I inform George that my caller wants a man, and is insisting, so I\u2019m transferring the call to him. George spends a good 30 minutes on this call, I hear him start snoring at some point, and he\u2019s getting nowhere with the issue. The guy he\u2019s working with is getting angrily loud enough that I can hear him over George\u2019s headset. Finally, the user demands to speak to George\u2019s manager.\n\nSo, George transfers him back to me, and I sweetly apologize for the delay in resolving his issue, and say I\u2019d be happy to help him with his problem, if he\u2019s okay with me working on it. For some mysterious reason, now he\u2019s fine with that. I know the exact fix because I helped the in-house IT people test it out. I have him fixed in two minutes flat. I have never heard such a meek thank you. Dude ended up asking for me a lot of the time after that, which, thanks, I guess? At least he was always polite to me.\n\nEDIT:  Since people are asking, George did FINALLY get fired a few months later, long after I'd ever given up hope.  ",

There's a few things I don't remember sometimes because we just don't do it often, but most of the time I'm most experienced with solving any given problem. \n\nI was once helping a man and trying to explain to him that his insurance doesn't cover the $15 extension charge (that he agreed to) because it was a fee for being late on refilling his medication and was designed to compensate us/our company for the extra paperwork we had to do in order to finish his meds asap, it had nothing to do with the cost of medication and wouldn't be covered no matter what. \n\nHe cut me off while I was apologizing for the misunderstanding and said \"I dont want to speak to you, I want to speak to HIM.\" And pointed at my male colleague. He just goes up and doesn't even repeat what I said, he just says \"she's correct. Yes, she told you. She also pointed out the sign when telling you the price.\" It was pretty great. \n\nEventually he storms out and his partner has to come in and meekly request his medication since the guy realized he couldn't go without it and would have to pay the $15 but didn't feel like having to look us in the eye when he confessed his mistake.\n\nI especially like when customers ask for my less experienced male coworker to help them instead of me, and since he doesn't know how to do certain things he ends up asking me and I end up having to walk him through it right in front of the customer just so the customer can have a MAN \"help\" them, which of course takes much longer than just letting me do it.",

Now, I knew the store inside and out as did the owner. There was a repairman in the back and he is who I got for the man as owner wasn't in. Repairman knows repairs but not all of the store. I knew what was coming and I couldn't wait for it! \n\nRepairman comes in and asks what the problem is.

One company sent their highest 2 people to speak to me about it, both of them men.  During our talk they said that they would love to speak to the decision maker once we were done.  I made it clear that I am the decision maker & they are speaking to the right person.  Yet moving forward they kept implying throughout that they would like to speak to the owner, who happens to be a man.  Well our conference room is glass-walled & right by the front door, so they saw when the owner walked in & popped his head in to say hi.  I introduced the owner to them & gave him a 10-second rundown of why they were here.  They fell all over themselves trying to get him to join us.  He could easily read the situation & just said \"makeupdumbass is in charge of the tech stuff\" and took his leave.  They resumed discussing the situation with me, looking quite dejected after that, and after a few minutes I cut the meeting short & thanked them for coming in.  Obviously I did not grant them the contract.  If they can't show me basic respect during an initial meeting I can't imagine how they would handle my concerns down the road.",

I'm telling you it is not on sale and I am using my coupon or I am reporting you!\"\n\n\"Yes ma'am. If you insist.\"\n\nI got visual confirmation from my supervisor in the way of a hand signal we used to mean, \"Go ahead.\" She was not too happy when I did exactly as she demanded... and her total came to $21.60\n\n\"You're stealing from me! I demand to speak to a manager! I'm never coming back here again\"\n\nMy shift supervisor had been on the next register over the whole time to combat the afternoon rush. That's how she managed to give the visual approval in the moment. She took great joy herself in telling Karen, \"You have the exact discounted price you demanded. You can pay it or leave. Oh you're never coming back? Do you promise?\" \n\nKaren paid her $21.60 with her head hung.\n\nShe was back next week.",

It was very clear that it didn\u2019t go there and that another customer likely just abandoned it there. When I explained it was on sale but not $4(!) they got b*tchy and told me that I should change the sale sign because it\u2019s confusing. I reiterated \u201cno, these items that go here are $4 so they sign is right, but THIS item doesn\u2019t go here\u2014it goes HERE,\u201d and showed them the next rack over.

            "I have a customer like this too. Always bitches and wants the lowest price possible (heavy duty parts sales, asking for discounts is normal). I used to genuinely do my best to give him the lowest price I could give without taking heat for it. Until he stopped accepting that I couldn't go any lower, and said he'd never be back. Only to be back within a few days, doing the same song and dance.\n\nSo now I give him list price, and knock about 20% off (if you don't know, list price is usually about double the actual price). He still bitches and says he'll never be back, but at least my sales numbers look great.",

            ">Oh you're never coming back? Do you promise?\n\nIt's a shame you can't enforce that somehow. Like the MC some time ago with a guy who complained to his bank that his excess interest charges on his credit card were not valid, and when they were shown to be valid, he said to remove them, or to close all of his accounts at the bank. The got him to repeat that very clearly on the recorded line; and since he had pulled this stunt half a dozen times already that year, they put him on hold and closed them all, and sent him a certified check for his $20,000 CD - minus 10% early withdrawal, the balance on his credit card account, and the excess interest charge, which amounted to about $30.",
