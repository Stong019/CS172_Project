She had taken credit for paying the bills and convinced bob and mary to kick him out because he's a \"shut-in loser\" because none of them understood his job.\n\nA bit of backstory on their parents, my friend tells me they're like those steryotypical teens in those cliche highschool movies, basically they look down on nerds and think people who study hard are 'uncool' that type of thing. Anyway they kept that mentality even after growing up and having kids, so they always looked down on jack for being nerdy and favortised tina because she was pretty and popular in highschool, but apparantly jack didn't really care because his personal life had friends he cared about and he connected more with his relatives.\n\nSo they all confront him and after badmouthing him about how he stays in his room mostly and how his sister, her husband & child need the space, told him he has till the end of the month to leave, this was done close to the first week; jack didn't say a word he just nodded and left by the end of that week and moved 3 cities away to a city closer to his other relatives.\n\n2 months go by and his sister calls him aaking why this month's bills weren't paid, as their lights and water had been shut off, he tells her that she should've paid them since she was \"allegedly\" paying them before. Abouut a week goes by and he gets a call from his parents explaing how his sister confessed to everything and how he can come back and have his old room back so long as he kept helping them pay the bills. He refused saying he's enjoying living by himself now and how he can focus on his work more because he's away from them; afterwards he blocked their numbers and now they have to pay for it themselves, he dooesn't know what happened after because they're no longer invited to family gatherings.",

Boycotting (refusing to purchase/us goods or services from a specific company or industry until it changes it's practices) is one form of protest, but not all protests are boycotts.",
            "Here's the text from the article without having to bother with all their ads and nonsense.\n \n\"After the organiser of the Miss Italy beauty pageant declared that trans women are excluded from the competition because contestants should be \u201cwomen from birth\u201d, over a hundred trans men decided to boycott by entering the contest.\n\nSpeaking to Radio Cusano earlier this month, Miss Italy\u2019s organiser Patrizia Mirigliani said that she is not going to update the beauty pageant\u2019s entry regulations, which currently exclude trans women. Mirigliani stated that Miss Italy contestants should be \u201cwomen from birth\u201d, adding that she had no intention of jumping on the \u201cglittery bandwagon of trans activism\u201d.\n \nHer remarks came after 22-year-old Rikkie Valerie Koll\u00e9 made history on July 8 when she became the first trans woman to be crowned Miss Netherlands. Commenting on the news, Mirigliani said: \u201cLately, beauty pageants have been trying to make headlines by also using strategies that I think are a bit absurd.\u201d\n\nAfter Mirigliani\u2019s comments emerged, trans men in Italy started a boycott of the beauty pageant and applied to enter the competition. Since the process to have one\u2019s preferred gender and name legally recognised in Italy is a lengthy one \u2013 and not based on self-declaration, as it is in Ireland \u2013 these men technically fit all the criteria to enter the competition: they are of Italian nationality or citizenship, over 18 years old, are still registered as \u201cfemale\u201d on their identity documents and were assigned female at birth.\n \nThe campaign was first launched by trans activist Federico Barbarossa, who spoke to Italian newspaper La Repubblica saying that the goal was \u201cto trigger, through a joke, a reflection on the absurdity of some logics out of time and out of the world.\n\n\u201cSomeone imagines us as three-headed monsters who could never aspire to win a beauty contest, because even the media representation often brings forward narratives that fetishize our bodies,\u201d Barbarossa added. \u201cWith this campaign, we are giving visibility to the truth of trans people\u201d.\n \nHis move was then followed by many other trans men in Italy, among whom is trans activist Elia Bonci who, in another interview with La Repubblica, said: \u201cI took courage, used my deadname and signed up for Miss Italy. Because fighting transphobia is intersectional and even though I\u2019m not a trans woman, I\u2019ve decided to fight for their rights.\u201d\n\nBonci continued by saying, \u201cMiss Italy is not just a beauty contest, but it is part of the country\u2019s cultural history. And excluding trans women automatically means excluding them from history. Pretend they don\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nThe post Over 100 trans men enter Miss Italy pageant after organiser says only \u201cwomen from birth\u201d allowed appeared first on GCN.\"",

        "selftext": "Years ago, I taught Sunday school on a voluntary basis at a megachurch in my town. There were so many children in this church that classrooms were made available to group children with Sunday school teachers for every year of their life until middle school and high school, at which point they attended a larger group with similarly aged peers in separate wings of the building. I taught two-year-olds, and loved every moment of it.\n\nMy classroom boasted a huge number of children, at about 20-25 per service. I was supposed to have an adult co-teacher, but all the other adult volunteers were sent to other classrooms with a \"higher need\". I had two high-school-aged volunteers, best friends, who often spent service time playing together, despite repeated approaches to asking them to play with the children (one of my volunteers was the director's son, who I couldn't replace because of his mother, and who clearly did not want to be volunteering).\n\nDespite this, and despite inheriting a huge classroom full of several special needs children, my children played calmly throughout service, and enjoyed a routine and simple rules I set to run the classroom efficiently. Children arrived, played calmly, sang songs, ate snack, and went home.\n\nEven in the face of this obvious evidence that my classroom was running efficiently, I was repeatedly asked by church leaders to adopt certain mannerisms around children I found inauthentic and frankly patronizing. I don't and won't speak in a high-pitched voice to anyone, child or adult. I don't and won't use words like \"upsie daisy\". These requests were persistent. It was the opinion of the church that I was not \"warm and welcoming\" enough. It was modeled again and again that the church would prefer I was overanimated in a HUGE SMILE HUG \"I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE\" kind of greeting. \n\nOne summer day we were all called (some 50+ room leaders and volunteers) into a mandatory meeting. You know those meetings where you instantly know they're talking about you? The policies on words like \"upsie daisy\" were now set in writing, and I was shortly asked to step down for not using these phrases. I was not allowed to prepare my children for the transition to a new Sunday teacher. I was immediately replaced (by a friend, actually) and was fairly crushed about the sudden break from little people I liked spending time with. And furthermore, it made me question my abilities to work with children, an endeavor I had already devoted my life to.\n\nUnbeknownst to my church, I had long been working at a career in early childhood intervention, teaching a classroom full of two-year-old child victims of trauma and abuse with a heavy case load of special needs children. My coworker called me over one Monday, as I was the twos teacher, asking what I made of this email she had just received concerning a church with an out-of-control twos room requesting that someone come consult with their new staff and help implement some new classroom techniques to \"manage difficult behaviors\".\n\nNaturally, I agreed to do the consult in person as soon as possible, and asked my coworker to let them know I would meet with them on a completely voluntary basis at their next Sunday service.\n\nIt was absolutely my pleasure to greet my church leaders and friend as their specialist consultant, to their confused surprise.\n\nI walked them through all sorts of interventions and strategies I had previously used to create a calm classroom environment and strongly advised against the use of overly excited greetings and phrases like \"upsie daisy\" in place of direct redirective requests (e.g. \"Please put your feet back on the floor.\") It was my strong written recommendation that the written policies on these strategies be amended and for staff to be immediately retrained in accordance with actual therapeutic practices.\n\nIt was my last time stepping foot in that church, and will forever remain my most deliciously cherished memories of vindication.",

We've never done that with our child even.\n\nI was always much more open and honest with adults that spoke normally to me, I always felt like I needed to hide something from adults that spoke to me like I was an infant because they were clearly \"lying\" and trying to manipulate me with their altered voice.",

            "I have attended mega churches. The children\u2019s programs are often a mess behind a facade. The volunteers and staff overworked and stressed out. Churches are built on pretenses. It is enticing to new guests to see this lovely children\u2019s program that is a slice of heaven every Sunday. In reality behind the scenes it is fucking chaos. \n\nOne church I attended where my wife volunteered the church had the same schedule every service. The pastor would get everyone to bow their heads about 7 minutes before the end of service so that he could ask for people that are newly receiving Jesus to raise their hands.\n\nHe would speak out \u201cI see you\u201d, \u201ctheres another one\u201d, I see the both of you\u201d, \u201cI see your hand in the back\u201d. This would go on until you think man there are dozens of people accepting Jesus today. What a victory!\n\nYeah nope....I am a rebel and don\u2019t bow my head instead I look around and watch. One hand would go up if any at all...it was lies all lies. This church had four services every Sunday with 3-4 thousand people at each service.\n\nAnyways....a monitor would come through the children\u2019s area shouting \u201cHEADS ARE DOWN\u201d. This was the signal to rush and get the kids ready. The kids were given treats to stop crying, dirty diapers were quickly changed, bottles were poured down the sink, faces were wiped to remove boogers and filth, and fun little quick games played to get the kids smiling and having a good time.\n\nThen came the herd of satisfied parents that picked up their angels from the perfect heavenly time at church.\n\nMegachurches are a show.",
            "My wife and I had a similar experience with Jr. High students at the church we attended at the time. We adopted several strategies like collecting their phones to keep them engaged with the group, some teaching strategies that were very different than had been tried before. We had great success and while we were initially told \"good luck getting them to talk\" essentially, we had them totally engaged, disappointed when our group time was over, and we had multiple parents who happened to see us at the grocery store or wherever come up and thank us for how well we were doing making them feel like they belonged and getting them to actually enjoy it and learn at the same time. \n\nWe did that for a year, and when the new school year came the church leaders gave us our new group of Jr. High students. Half of the students (it was a larger group than before so they split it), but they gave us all the tough kids, saying they trusted us to handle it. A kid with bi-polar disorder known to have violent outbursts, one with severe ADHD, one with fetal alcohol syndrome... \n\nBut the kicker was they told us that we could no longer use any of the strategies we'd adopted. No more gathering phones, no more hosting occasional groups at our home (with other volunteers present), no more trips out for fun activities like mini-golf, and most importantly no more using our own intuition and discernment to develop a curriculum amd teaching style. They forced us to teach a specific curriculum, cut our group time down, and cut the number of meetings in half. There was no way to teach the curriculum in the allotted time and half our students didnt even understand what was being talked about. \n\nThey literally congratulated us on doing what no one expected us to be able to do and then some, gave us the toughest kids they had saying it was because they trusted us, then took away every single tool and strategy we'd successfully adopted, cut our time with the students by half, and expected us to do it again.

            "People are constantly complimenting us on how our 3 year old speaks in full sentences using proper grammar and a near-adult vocabulary, yet they chafe when we ask them not to talk to him like a brain-damaged puppy. There's a correlation between the two, assholes.\n\nIt also grinds my gears when adults answer questions like, \"why is the sky blue\" or \"where do clouds come from\" with bullshit responses like \"Jesus\" or \"it just is.\" I work in a school and hear this from teachers all of the time. The kid asked a factual question, give a factual answer! Just this morning, my toddler asked, \"how much longer until the Earth rotates to face the sun? It's passed the equinox now so there's less sunlight.\" He has a basic understanding of gravity, the seasons, the water cycle, the economy, water treatment, engines, bouyancy, electricity, the criminal justice system, and multiculturalism because when he asks a question he gets a real fucking answer.

            "Wow, memories. Reminds me of the time I was stopped by a stranger in a grocery store parking lot about 2 seconds after I started walking again. Stranger thanked me for talking to my niece about the moon in a normal voice. Niece and I had just had a 12 second moment to look at the full moon despite the glaring parking lot lights.\n\nAlso remember and deeply miss interacting with the  18-36 month children in my parent's ward each Sunday. (was Mormon, so \"ward\" = \"parish\" I think...). Almost compelte autonomy. Just me, my wife, and 5 to 10 kids for 2 hours. It was about 40 minutes of toys, then pick up, then 40 minutes of tortilla shells and fruit leathers for snacks with a brief lesson, then cleanup, then 40 minutes self-led singing time with visual aids, then quiet play with a ball until parents picked them up.\n\nEventualy moved into another ward, their nursery was a mess, had restrictions on types of snacks because of \"budget\", which essentially meant cheap cheesy poofs. Messy as hell. Know what isn't messy? Tortilla and fruit leathers. Fruit can be sticky, but guess what?, we brought a small basin/tub so that we could pour a small amount of water on hands to be wiped off. NOPE, they can't have none of that, because why? Because the other teachers wouldn't do that if we weren't there. Oh, and I offered to handle singing time using materials and skills picked up all my life singing in community choirs; but no again.\n\nFucking hell I hated that ward.",

        "selftext": "# Updated: New Information and Clarifications\n\nThis Malicious Compliance belongs to my Beautiful Wife, but since it is from many decades ago, from a time before we knew each other, we will call her Classy Flight Attendant here.\n\nFirst the usual disclaimers: I am on a computer, so completely responsible for the formatting. English is both my 1st and 3rd language, and my mother was a school teacher, so I am also completely responsible for my use of grammar and spelling. Although I do not care to hear about it if the spelling tends to vacillate between British and American standards. Or the punctuation for that matter. Dialog is translated from the original language and is given as reported to me.\n\n**The Setup:**\n\nAt the time of this event, Classy Flight Attendant is one of the top tier flight attendants for her country's National Airline. Strictly speaking, any of their flights that do not involve ports in the USA or its territories, are not required to follow all FAA rules. However, whenever they fly to ports regulated by the FAA, they are expected to follow those rules to the tee. Of course, it doesn't always work out that way in practice.\n\nOn this occasion, Classy Flight Attendant has just landed from Europe at her home airport in South America, only to learn that she is being turned around for a roundtrip to New York City. She protests. By the time she lands in New York, she will be well outside FAA rest period rules with all the consequences that could follow. Her supervisors don't care. They need her on that flight RIGHT NOW. And away she goes.\n\nBut she knows the flight to New York isn't the real problem; it's the return trip that will be pure misery. Her compatriots flying home from New York tend to be extremely entitled. They are coming from New York. That makes them \"somebody\" now. They will refuse drink service when offered, and then when the flight attendant is three or four rows further along push the call button and order a drink. They will keep an attendant hoping back and forth the whole flight for stupid little things, many of them things they could actually do for themselves. Classy Flight Attendant is tired, and knows that dealing with this entitled crowd on the return trip is going to be the worst.\n\nAs they get into New York, she is told to go check out an in-flight movie for the return trip. The suggestion is made to make it interesting enough to keep the passengers too busy to order the flight crew around that much. Cue the Malicious Compliance.\n\n**The Malicious Compliance:**\n\nAs she looks over the options and finds the perfect film. It will keep the passengers riveted to their seats. Frankly, given the nature of the film, she isn't even sure why it exists in the cartridge format used on planes at this time. Perhaps because the format is also used on some yachts and cruise ships? She orders it.\n\nOnce on board she keeps it secret. She knows that once she pops it in and it starts to play, the systems in use at that time cannot be stopped. But any time before that, she could be thwarted. Mid-flight, as the plane is well out over the ocean on its way south, she pops it in: Airport '77. For those who don't know, this film is about an airplane crashing in the ocean and passengers and crew trying to escape with their lives from 100 feet under water.\n\nThe results are immediate and absolute. While there are many white knuckles, no one seems inclined to press their call buttons. And Classy Flight Attendant has a very quiet, uninterrupted rest for the remainder of the flight home.\n\n**The Aftermath:**\n\nAs she is deboarding, one old lady is heard to say that she will NEVER fly National Airline again. When called on the carpet for her movie choice, Classy Flight Attendant feigns ignorance, claiming to have thought it was the much more comical Airplane! and that the name was lost in translation. She is given a 3 day suspension - which is for her a much-needed rest. Oh, and she will never be allowed to pick the in-flight movie ever again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# UPDATES and CLARIFICATIONS:\n\n**Acknowledgments:**\n\nFirst, let me give a very warm thank you to this community for your interest in me (the least interesting part of this story really) and my Beautiful Wife. For your support and also for your heartfelt, honestly expressed concerns about possible collateral damage from her actions. Even for those who have outright doubted the possibility that this could ever happen - even though it is strictly speaking contrary to this subreddit's rules to pursue such inquiries, I personally don't mind them and find them useful. To all who gave awards, if I failed to thank you any of you personally - at some points things were moving so fast I fear I may have - please accept here and publicly my sincere regards for your absolutely unexpected generosity and appreciation. This community is filled with genuinely awesome humans and I thank you all from the bottom of my heart (and on behalf of my Beautiful Wife) for all that you do.\n\n**Clarifications:**\n\nThe least first, just to get it out of the way: My first language is American English and my third is British English. For those who argue they are the same language, have it your way. It was meant as a throw away line and a bit of humor. It did generate a lot more questions than I would have expected. My fifth language is also English, in a way, but many consider ASL (American Sign Language) to be a different language from English while still insisting that British English and American English are the same thing. This perplexes me somewhat, but again, not a hill I am prepared to die on.\n\nFor those who challenge my writing style by asking \"Who talks that way?\" Well, I do. Not your cup of tea? I understand. But thank you for visiting. For those who love it: Thank you. Sincerely.\n\nAnd for those handful of eagle eyes who caught me in a misspelling (which I won't correct here - the Original Post remains untouched): Well done you! I did mean \"hopping\" not \"hoping\".\n\nIn an attempt to keep the story brief and leave out unnecessary details, I left out a few very pertinent ones. Many have been confused as to how Airport '77 would even be an option available on the airplane in the first place. The answer is simple: It wasn't. At the time this event took place, there were services that provided cartridges of movies in a format that was used exclusively on planes and boats. The airlines or cruiselines would pay a handling and licensing fee and the cartridge itself, I'm lead to believe, would track the number of uses so that proper charges could be made. This is why the movie could not be stopped once started. So it was rather akin to a member of the flight crew going to a specialized Blockbusters and picking a movie from their selections. Since they also served boats, it would include options that were perhaps not intended for use on planes. Consistent with public exhibition rules of the day, these were specialized versions of the movies that excluded foul language and nudity.\n\nI also appear to have not made it clear enough in the Original Post that it was illegal for Classy Flight Attendant to fly into New York City without having been provided her mandatory rest period, and this not only risked the airline being penalized if they had been audited, it placed in jeopardy her FAA certifications, without which she would be unable to continue working in her profession. \n\n**Update:**\n\nFor this to make sense, a little context is needed. \n\nI first learned of this event from others who were around at the time it happened and not from Beautiful Wife herself. She is actually not particularly proud of this Malicious Compliance and doesn't like to talk about it much. However, for her coworkers on that flight and others in her company who heard about it, as well as her sisters; for them she is a legend for this as well as other events she doesn't like to talk about much. One involving an intended petty revenge that almost crash landed a 747 will likely be the topic of another post in another subreddit when I get the time to pin down the details and write it up. \n\nSo it is that while I have gotten Beautiful Wife to tell me her version of the event, as well as to read and approve the Original Post, there was additional information to uncover.\n\nWhile we were on a long drive to a family event a few towns away, I expressed some of the honest concerns from this community about collateral damage: the potential of traumatizing innocents and children, for example. In the past, she has expressed that her main immediate regret while the movie was playing was a legitimate concern she may actually cause a heart attack during the flight. Fortunately, there were no medical incidents forthcoming. \n\nMe: \"But what about the children?\"\n\nBeautiful Wife: \"Oh, there were no children on that flight. If there had been, I wouldn't have done it.\"\n\nMe: \"Wasn't it your usual 747? How is it possible there were no children?\"\n\nBeautiful Wife: \"No. It was only a 200 passenger Jet. It was a special. That's why they wanted me on it.\"\n\nThe context there being that Classy Flight Attendant was in fact very classy and normally requested for any flights involving dignitaries, famous singers or actors or other specials.\n\nIt turns out the flight from New York that day was a special with two opposing sports teams, their management staffs and many rich promoters and others from the entitled compatriots living in New York City who had enough money to go to the exhibition game they were involved in. In other words, they weren't just the entitled, they were the uber-rich uber-entitled. There was in fact much less potential for collateral damage than I had always believed existed.\n\nAlso, because of the nature of this flight, her Malicious Compliance directly impacted the airline that didn't honor her mandatory rest period requirements, as the group on that special decided to use an American airline to return back to New York and never contracted such a flight again with National Airline.\n\nIf it were not for the prominent position her father held in her country at that time, I do not doubt for a minute that she would have been fired outright. She still really enjoyed the rest provided by the three day suspension. And the money lost didn't matter. She didn't actually need to work at all.\n\nSo, I hope you all find that additional detail as interesting as I did. Thank you all for being awesome!",

            "I really do want to smack whomever spread the false idea that being made salary automatically exempts you from overtime and the company can work you whenever they want for however long they want. \n\nAt least here in the US the number of salaried jobs that are exempt from overtime are actually few and far between. Many of them are the sea level executives who control the direction and focus of the entire business like CEO CTO CFO etc etc  The rest are upper managers that have control over hiring and firing. You absolutely can be a manager that has no control of hiring a firing and that aspect in and of itself means that you're eligible for overtime pay according to labor law. \n\nI know this cuz my wife worked as an assistant manager for a craft store for quite some time working 60 plus hours a week. Her boss was a control freak and wouldn't let anyone else be involved in the hiring and firing process. Eventually we heard about a similar lawsuit where a manager sued for overtime under similar circumstances than one. Long story short it was actually correct and we won as well for lost overtime back pay because the manager never involved her in the hiring or firing process.\n\nI implore everyone who is salary or thinking of transitioning to a salary job to research the relevant labor law for overtime exempt policies. If you're a programmer that spends most of your time writing code then you can be exempt from overtime... But if you're a basic IT help desk monkey who dabbles in programming for the company you should be getting paid overtime. I run into multiple stories every month where people talk about being salary and working tons of overtime but the description of their job title job duties and responsibilities don't fit my understanding of what is and isn't overtime exempt.\n\nSo many people should be getting paid overtime but assume that salary doesn't get overtime...

If I knew I had a weekend event to shoot and it would take about 4 hours, I stopped at 36 hours Friday. I worked 12-14 hours Monday and Tuesday and a normal 8 on Wednesday. So Thursday and Friday I usually worked 9 to 1 cause we had DAILY all hands reporter staff meetings in the morning even though we were weekly.\n\nWell my boss, let's call her Rylee, took issue with the fact I was not working 9 to 5. Rylee was salaried, but I was hourly remember. So I told Rylee I would be HAPPY to quit my afternoon PT job and be there. All that was needed would for her to pre-approve me for 8 hours OT.... every week. I crunched the numbers and let her know this would amount to about $10,000 in a year and get back to me with her decision. Rylee said no dice, so I firmly told her I would not \"volunteer\" my time and she had no authority to tell me what I could do when I was off the clock. \n\nI left about 6 months later, and the rest of the staff left within 6 months of me. Rylee was gone about a year later, 2 of the 8 papers have closed shop and honestly a 3rd is a few years away.

        "selftext": "So I recently started posting to reddit, and I have a lot of stories. This one happened during my first career, when I worked as a scientist in a diagnostic lab. I had been working for about 2 years at this point and had just been promoted to senior scientist.\n\nI had two supervisors in my section, each assigned to oversee half of the tests being done in our small corner of the lab, Rory and Tanya. Tanya was the senior most supervisor of the two, and secondary to my department head she had the most authority over me on any given day. She also hated me. Never did figure out why, but she hated about 3/4 of the people working in the lab so I never took it personally. I just don't think she liked people (the lab tends to attract people like that, funnily enough. We always used to joke about being the rejects stuffed in a hole at the bottom of a hospital to be kept away from the general public). As for Rory, it's important to note that he had a very good reputation in the lab of never lying. He was never once caught in even a half truth, and he'd been working there for over 30 years. He was well liked and well trusted. This will be important later.\n\nOne day I was doing one of the more technically challenging tests that our department performs. It's long, fiddly, expensive, and easy to screw up. Only senior scientists are allowed to do it unsupervised, and this was maybe the second time I've done it alone. We are talking two days just to get it set up. It was a nightmare. While I was measuring out some gelatin powder into a beaker, I accidentally elbowed Tanya (our work stations were right on top of each other, this happened at least 4-5 times a day with everyone). I apologized and go back to what I was doing, but she flips out. Like full on rage screaming in my face kind of angry. After a couple of minutes of her tirade, she says \"Just fuck off TerrificMoose, no one wants you here!\" and then she storms off to her office to cool off.\n\nRory comes up to me, having seen and heard to whole thing and asks if I'm alright. I say I'm a little shaken, but nothing too bad and get ready to continue my work. But Rory had HEARD the whole thing, and he saw what test I was doing. He Whispers to me \"Your supervisor told you to go. Best you do what she says, and if she causes a fuss about it, I'll be sure to tell the boss EXACTLY what she said to you.\" Now, I knew Rory's reputation, so I knew I'd be safe. I also know that being told to leave early by a supervisor meant that I was still paid out for the rest of the day, provided I had worked at least 4 hours of my shift (The lab was actually pretty generous with time off, even if the pay and working conditions were shit).\n\nSo I did exactly what Tanya had said. I fucked off home.\n\nNow at the stage I was at with that particular test, I had spent about $4000 worth of reagents. Normally batches of 20 samples are run to try and keep the cost down, but it was still an expensive test when you include the nearly 3 days of work from a single scientist. This was one of Tanya's tests, and therefore Rory was not required to ensure it was done. No one in my section was very happy with Tanya, and she had gone off to her office and so couldn't see me leave, so no one went to tell her that the test was left unsupervised. Apparently she didn't come back for over an hour, and by then the test was ruined and had to be started over again. My boss was PISSED. Tanya of course tried to throw me under the bus, saying I had left without informing anyone and that it was all my fault, but good old trustworthy Rory told the boss exactly what Tanya had said. I love Rory. I couldn't be punished for doing exactly what my supervisor had told me to do, so I got away with it completely.\n\nUnfortunately nothing overly terrible happened to Tanya. She got formally reprimanded and had to take an anger management course that the hospital runs, but otherwise she got no real punishment. She never yelled at me again, and was always careful to word things just right around me after that though so that was something. As for what I did on my half day off, I went to the beach to enjoy the sunshine I almost never got to see working in the deep dark dungeon that is the average hospital lab. I made sure to bring in the pictures the next day.\n\nUPDATE: I was teaching a class with Rory today and showed him some of your replies. He's genuinely touched by it all. He does recommend not naming your children after him though, as his name was changed for the story.\n\nAlso to all of you saying that 4 grand is too much waste for a lab, in the grand scheme of things $4000 is nothing. Diagnostic labs will waste that daily just through simple errors. The boss was annoyed, but not disproportionately so. It's factored into the budget.",

Over the last 6 months I\u2019ve lost many an evening and weekend to unexpected work problems, with not even a thank you, let alone any financial compensation. As an example, being called at 21:30 and asked if you can log on, when you\u2019ve met friends for a drink.\n\nWhere a job needs to provide out of hours support, a supplement is meant to be paid for being on call, with additional payment if you\u2018re required to actually work. \n\nMy contract is based on annual salary, where additional work might be required for no extra pay/overtime if it\u2019s considered business as usual(BAU) or known in advance (this bit is important). However, the work I\u2019ve been asked to do on weekends/evenings is not BAU. BAU assumes processes work. If something goes wrong, someone needs to step in to fix it and it\u2019s no longer BAU. Hope that makes sense.\n\nA couple of months ago, I had the conversation with my manager about being paid for being on call. I was told the work I was covering actually fell under BAU, and as I was always given advance notice (I wasn\u2019t) I wouldn\u2019t be paid for being on call. Manager wouldn\u2019t budge on this, so I made it clear I would not be taking my laptop home/available unless I was given advance notice I might be required to log on, to which my manager agreed.\n\nOn this glorious day I received a call from my manager asking me to log on as some critical data was missing from a file, causing significant problems with several admin systems. Trying to sound as sincere as I could, I apologised and said as I was not made aware in advance, and I\u2019m not on call, my laptop was left at the office. \n\nThis was met by an \u201cAh\u201d.  To which I responded, \u201cGood luck, and I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d\n\nExpecting it to be a shit-show in the morning for muggins here to clean up, but it\u2019ll be worth it.\n\nEdit1: Wow, was cathartic to write this last night, did not expect this. Thank you for all for the upvotes and the silver and gold. I\u2019m on my way to work now and will look to update once the fan has been cleaned of shit.\n\nEdit2: So last night after the call to me, my manager rang around and finally got hold of a manager from P Team (Team I provide support to). Over several hours, between them they figured out that somehow a group in the system had not been run for the day (controls are in place so this shouldn\u2019t be possible). To fix it they had to run the missed group, validate the movements, and then rerun processes to send the data to the admin systems. \n\nAfter looking into it this morning, this is for Team P to look into how they\u2019ve managed to done goof on such a scale, a \u2018near miss\u2019 recorded with governance, who they\u2019ll need to explain it to. This caused several issues with admin systems and a lot of verifying everything is as it should be this morning.\n\nFollowing this, a group email has been sent around, to remind people that laptops should be taken home, as in the event of the building been unavailable/inaccessible, recovery plans are for people to use their laptops to work from home/alternate site. It seems the manager had trouble contacting someone with a laptop able to log on. \n\nI\u2019m positive they\u2019ll have no issues finding someone to drop everything at a moments notice going forward . . .\n\nI fear that should I receive a similar call in future, I\u2019ll not be in a position to access my laptop. Work\\life balance is important, and I\u2019m going to enforce those boundaries. The trouble is, it starts as a one off here and there, and you do it to be nice with the best of intentions, but give an inch and they\u2019ll take a mile if you\u2019re not careful. \n\nFor some of those asking, I\u2018m already looking at other jobs. Although there\u2019s definitely issues with the management in my current area, and employees being taken for granted (not just me), the company as a whole does have a good ethos.\n\nHope this provides at least a little amusement, and is only giving back a tiny amount of what you\u2019ve all given me. I\u2019m not planning on anymore updates, so this it from me. Thank you all, and don\u2019t let the bastards grind you down!",

            "There will be a shit show. A lot of people do not understand the concept of what exempt means. Companies will skirt around it etc... They will try to staff a 24/7 operation by covering 16 hours with on-call. It is only works as long as the employee \"voluntarily\" complies. This tactic quickly falls apart if the on-call employee is working 50 hours a week. documented controlled on-call and disciplinary actions occur if they timelines are not met.\n\nA few, \"don't have my laptop with me\" or \"I am not available this weekend\" forces the company to re-evaluate the on-call requirements. It gets even better when they realize that the escalation path does not include people who have the skills to address the issue. Even worse, they realize that they have jeopardized their standing with the employee who has the ability to address these issues on a 24/7 basis.\n\nI know several companies that pay extra for on-call rotations worked by the IT staff. Especially if it is a controlled on-call and has a response time requirement  (No alcohol and must respond in 15 minutes) etc. This usually softens the blow but it is nowhere near compensation of what would be considered overtime.\n\nAlso \"exempt\" is not based on the job title,  but based on things like tasks, authority to defer work. I believe a famous coffee company got in trouble a few years back when they tagged a large number of employees as exempt and stopped paying them overtime. The class action suit was swift and just.\n\nAnother issue is that \"Exempt\" employees are not required to work a full 40 hours to get their weekly salary. An employee can work 48 hours one week and only 32 hours the next. There are problems if a company tries to withhold wages for a salaried position.  If they dock your salary for hours not worked, it may justify an assessment of the exempt status of this position and possible all similar exempt positions in the organization. This means that if they say they can dock your salary based on your job title. They better be docking everyone with the same job title... blah blah blah\n\nAn acceptable bargain is that you get back hours that you work overtime. Each 4 hours overtime = 8 hours pto.

            "I'm in live entertainment. Regularly that means 80hr weeks followed by weeks with nothing at all. I was salary for 7 years for a non-profit. As a department head I was an on call resource any time the building was open. \n\nNew boss scheduled a meeting with me and HR to talk about paternity leave since my wife was due with number 2 and old boss had badly bungled the paternity leave convo when I was taking time for baby 1. HR was brand new to the company and the first legit trained HR head the company had employed. \n\nAt the end of the meeting my boss ambushed me with a \"I want to make some changes, when you get back from leave I want you in the office during the down weeks instead of working from home\". That meant 80+ he weeks with no weekend would count for nothing flexible. \n\nI calmly laid out the hours I'd been working for the company over the last 7 years mentioning that all we're well documented. Then explained how and when each part of my agreement to flex time and just be on call from home had been reached and with which previous boss etc. Current boss said that he wanted to start clean and not be bound by promises made by old bosses. I said \"great, here's a number that you can pay me for this level of service.\" \n\nHR, realizing how big the shit hole they were in and how actionable they had become over the years shut the meeting down. A week later I got a very well worded email from current boss that all my flexibility agreements would be honored and that we would work together to reduce hours both on site and on call moving forward.\n\nI took my 12 weeks paid paternity leave (banked sick leave) and then turned in my notice immediately upon my return. \n\nWhen asked why I was leaving after he'd agreed to all my conditions I said \"you shouldn't have made me look at what I'm worth on the open market. You'll never be able to afford me now\". \n\nYou can drive a nail, and pull it out, but it's still going to leave a hole.",

            "I can 100% agree with this title. I work as a nurse in a hospital and several times people call out and we get called in, but we are not obligated to come because we are \"not on call\". Speaking to a friend at one point, who is a nurse in the surgery unit, they are on call and actually paid for being on call. Thus they are legally and contractually obligated to come in and work. There were shortages on the critical care floor of the hospital and managers placed several nurses \"on call\" in case they needed help due to admissions and patient load. These nurses were not paid for being on call. For a few weeks it went on and tensions rose due to terrible work hours and lack of sleep. Eventually, all on call ciritcal care nurses simply turned off their phones when they were off to avoid being called in. Somehow they learned that they were not legally obligated to be on call if they were not paid accordingly. The situation has since resolved but I did hear that several lawsuits were placed and the hospital finally dropped everything cause they were gonna lose severly if it went to court.",

They then switched things up and we found that we weren't salary exempt, but non-exempt, meaning we were due over-time. Previously they had been giving those On-call like $50 a day for the on-call \"bonus\". On-call actually means you're working 24/7 because you could be expected to receive a call at any time and you'd have to be ready. After the switch, they found that they would have to pay all this overtime for those on-call. They changed gears again and said on-call would only be for a few hours during the week and only 6 hours each day on the weekend. They also deemed that since they were paying you for the whole time, they actually want you to do work the whole time by creating KB articles or doing some kind of work. Really shitty of them to think that in the past they were taking advantage of us, but now that they have to pay, they want work out of it. I quit shortly after this final change.

I called to have his name removed. I was told that I was just a user and he was the owner. I asked to have the card in my name. She told me I was just a user and couldn\u2019t own the card. This isn\u2019t true, any credit card will let you assume ownership and be responsible for the bill in the US. So, not one to argue, I just let it go. I never got a bill, letter, anything. So, that\u2019s how my late husband paid for his own funeral.\nEdit: I tried to take ownership. The bank wouldn\u2019t let me. The attorney told me not to pay it. The bank could have sued the estate. But they would\u2019ve had to establish an estate and then sue it. \nAlso, this is a huge multi-national bank. They have never bothered to collect any of the money.",

            "Hi OP, I work in banking.\n\nWe will not allow a joint signer, let alone an authorized user, to take ownership of a line of credit. That's not out of the ordinary, it's standard practice. Typically you'd have to re-apply because they'd need to make sure that you're creditworthy on your own.\n\nI'd also call them back and ask to be removed as an authorized user. While you are not legally liable for the card, it does still show on your credit report.\n\nEdit: Also, as others have pointed out, there is potential for the credit card company to call fraud on this. They'll likely request a death certificate to cease contact, and will be able to see activity after his date of death. If you are an authorized user on a card, that authorization is revoked when the person who granted it passes away. I don't know if it'd be easy to prove or worth their time, but they could theoretically take you to court for fraud. Either way, expect that you're burning a bridge with this company so if you also bank with them or if you want to have a card in the future that's something to think about.",

            "I hate to break it to you, but that's not really how it works. Your dead husband has an estate with both assets and liabilities. Any money in joint accounts, any property in his name, are all assets. Any debt in his name, including that credit card, are chargeable against his estate. To close the account you'll almost certainly have to provide a death certificate to the issuer of the card, and they are going to come after his estate for the debt. It's certainly possible that you can just ignore it long enough that the issuer misses the chance to collect from the estate, but I wouldn't count on that.",

            "Hi. Worked for a bank & credit card company in the US. You cannot assume ownership of an account unless you\u2019re a co-owner on the account when the primary passes. Being an authorized user is completely different, however, authorized users can still be held responsible for payments. Your best course of action is to take yourself off the account completely so they can\u2019t come after you. They\u2019ll eventually close the account and write off the loss.",
            "This may or may not be good MC, it\u2019s an unsecured debt not always worth the effort of securing payment from the estate (or is something that they have a different process for).\n\nI\u2019m not sure where you got the idea that anyone can assume ownership of an account, I think you\u2019ve mixed that up with assuming ownership of a debt. The account can and will be closed with the primary borrower deceased. The credit was extended to them only and will not be transferred over to another user. Accounts who had two co-borrowers can have one removed though.\n\nThe thing to remember with credit cards is that it\u2019s the opposite of a checking account - they own the money, you\u2019re borrowing it charge by charge. Of course they will let anyone assume the debt in the instance the primary account holder is deceased, this is not the same as them granting you their credit.\n\nEdit: to clarify, it might not be good MC as the estate may still find the bank asking to pay the debt. So don\u2019t write it off just yet. On the human side, if you talked to a department set up for estates, don\u2019t worry about how they\u2019ll take your complaints, they\u2019ve heard worse. Whatever misunderstanding happens, you sound like you\u2019re still approaching it from a logical perspective and just missing pieces of how it works. That\u2019s expected in this situation and hopefully with time this resolves with a lot less frustration.",

            ">any credit card will let you assume ownership and be responsible for the bill in the US.\n\nVery not true. Spouses can request ownership be transferred, but there is no obligation in the U.S to allow it. It's purely the bank's descretion, especially because authorized users don't need to sign any paperwork assuming financial responsibility to be added as a user. \nJoint account holders are financially responsible, but there is a difference between the two types of users.\n\nSource: 8+ years credit card authorization/fraud work",

The owner would have to initiate the request and there would be a similar process to the application of the original card to assess eligibility.\n\nI'm not familiar with that process for most card companies and fully acknowledge that it may vary to appear easier or not accessible to the applicants. But I'm not surprised that it wouldn't be a quick or ready phone conversation. One reason a company would not want to do something like this is a person with good credit gets a card, adds someone with bad credit who would never qualify, and then removes themself from the card. That person with bad credit could wrack up s debt and tell the company to kick rocks and then repeat the process again.\n\nI'd hazard the phone rep, had they been guided verbally couldn't gotten you to the right team assuming the company allows the transfer of credit cards...

        "selftext": "As part of my job working in complaints I write letters to customers. We don\u2019t use templates and each letter is tailored to the individual. Sometimes customers raise multiple complaint points and each point is carefully addressed in the letter we send. We outline everything the customer is unhappy with, our full investigation and what we are doing to put this right. Or alternatively explaining carefully why their complaint is not justified.\n\nA new manager \u201cSteve\u201d was hired a few months ago and he decided that we were wasting too much time writing letters and he was going to come up with a template for us to use as we were obviously too \u201csimple\u201d to understand how letters are meant to work.\n\nSo he goes off and drafts a template and proudly shares it with us all. It was shit, to put it bluntly. It was full of typos and grammatical errors. But it also did not contain details of what the complaint was about or how we had resolved it. \nOf course this was pointed out to him in full why this was not appropriate and why it would lead to more complaints and it\u2019s basically terrible customer service. \nHe lost his temper screamed and yelled until 3 separate people cried and 2 logged out of the virtual meeting. \n\nAfterwards he sent an email saying he wants his letter used EXACTLY as he has attached it.\nWho am I to argue? I sent the letters exactly as he had written them. Copied and pasted to ensure nothing was changed EXACTLY as he asked. Right down to his signature and contact details at the bottom of the letter. \n\nI told the rest of the team and they all are sending letters with Steve\u2019s details too. Within the first week he had 40 customers call him and email complaining about the letter we had sent.\nThe week after 50 irate customers.\n\nSteve hasn\u2019t looked into the complaint so he doesn\u2019t know how to address any of the customers or understand their issues. \nSo I get phone calls day in and day out \u201cthis man is livid what was his complaint about\u201d\nEach time I reply \u201coh it should all be explained in the letter I sent. You know the one detailing all complaint points, my investigation and resolution in full. I would just check that. Bye\u201d \n\nThe whole department is now under investigation as customer satisfaction has tanked. Best bit is each and every dissatisfaction is scored against Steve. Every other member of staff has 100% satisfaction as nothing is logged against us- our name isn\u2019t on the letter. \nSteve is on zero%. It\u2019s a terrible shame\n\n\nEdit: goodness me this blew up. Thank you. \nHopefully Steve will get fired soon. We work in complaints we\u2019re pretty thick skinned. To make 3 staff actually cry takes some serious work. He\u2019s vile.\nI will provide an update if management ever get their act together enough to listen to our concerns.\n\nI do feel bad for the customers involved though. \nThe customers that are complaining about the letter don\u2019t know that their complaint is upheld and that I\u2019ve sent them compensation or flowers. They would normally get a letter apologizing deeply explaining what went wrong and how we will resolve it going forward. Those customers are normally absolute dreams the only time they come back to us is to thank us. I have never in all my days sent someone a cheque and a nice letter and had them phoning to yell at me.

We were fully able to run the day shift but had never really broken down the equipment and closed up for the evening. One particular night, a few of the night shift had called in sick, we were asked to pull a double and close the restaurant, which we did. Essentially worked from 10a.m. until after  midnight. Myself and my three friends and a manager. We were really tired but felt that we had done the right thing and helped out the company. \n\nThe next day the four of us come into work another day shift. The day manager pulls us into her office, one by one, and informs us that she would need to write us up because we hadn't properly cleaned and filtered the fry grease. Regardless of our leaning in for a double, having never closed or been trained on closing procedures,  and having been given permission by the night manager to leave (meaning all closing work had been completed). After a quick chat with my friends, it was aligned that I was going to push back on the write up, and if the day manager insisted on writing up us, we would quit. I informed the manager that we were collectively not going to sign the write up slips. Her alternative, threat, was that we would be fired, to which I informed her that if she insisted on writing us up for helping out, pulling a double, not being trained,  and having been released by the night manager....then we would quit. Collectively.  Immediately. She responded with \"If you don't sign the write up, then you will be  fired.\"  A staring contest follows, I eventually break in with an, \" Ok. I guess we are fired then.\" We turned in our hats, quit symbolically and left. It was really really amazing,  my friend quit mid-burger prep,  my other friend simply walked off the cash register in the middle of taking an order. We clocked out and walked out the back, leaving only the day manager in the restaurant. Customers in line, customers at the drive thru.\n\nLater that same day, we decided return to our place of prior employment. To have dinner. The night shift must have still been sick as the entire restaurant was staffed with managers from nearby restaurants (same chain), including our day manager, who was now pulling her own double, and the night manager that had released us the prior evening. There was nothing better than eating our burgers and watching the management staff fail at every station and knowing that their pride, lack of rational flexibility, and threats had resulted in one of the most righteous meals we ever ate together. \n\nNeedless to say we were all employed at the next chain restaurant down the street in a matter of days. It's been nearly thirty years and I remember that stand off, her ultimatum, and our walk out like it was last week.",

After months of complaints of the other staff hiding in the back, taking an hour to do a 5 minute task, or straight up disappearing at times going ignored, we decided to no-call-no-show together and FORCE the other employees to work.\n\nApparently it turned into a complete shit show. While they had to write us up for the no-show, they apologized to us for realizing that the other workers are awful at their job. I'd like to say that things improved but they didn't and the three of us found better jobs shortly after. I never worked in the food industry again.",

I was up front on the register, one friend was on the fry station, and the final friend was on the line, making burgers. Things got slow, so the manager assigned us all some basic maintenance tasks (clean the drains out, sweep/mop the coolers, and rotate ALL the inventory, IIRC). A bus came in, creating a large rush. With the manager on the register, and the maintenance guy (her SO) on the grill and line, they were very quickly getting overwhelmed, so I suggested that my friends and I stop doing maintenance and help out. Well...I got told that \"she knows best, and if we had a problem with it, we could quit\", so we quit. grabbed our bags from the break room, changed out of the uniform shirts in the bathroom, walked up to her at the counter, threw the uniforms in her face and walked out.

We were slammed and had a single towel for the entire restaurant! I had gone to another busser to get the towel to clean off my section and the manager slammed his hands on the table, got in my face and screamed \u201cQUIT FUCKING FLIRTING AND GET BACK TO FUCKING WORK!\u201d - all in full view and hearing of the packed restaurant. \n\nI went in the back, grabbed my stuff, called my dad for a ride, and left. The other busser and the dishwasher told me at school the next day that they and all the kitchen staff walked out shortly after I did leaving only the manager and a handful of servers to run the whole restaurant.

One night there were some severe storms that were to hit the area at the time of the waterpark's closing (the main park closed two hours later).\n\nThose of us closing the water park restrooms decided to collectively cut some corners because we wanted to be in shelter before it got too bad. We made sure to get the trash, mop, and clean any obvious messes, but otherwise we didn't do the full closing procedures.\n\nGuess what, they didn't get mad. Could we have done the full list? Yes. Would it have endangered our lives, yes. Safety is a huge priority at an amusement park. I was a hard worker who had very high standards.

I worked at a grocery store and started working shifts in price control after I had been working as a cashier at the front end. I was scheduled alone on Sunday morning (the first day of the new pricing week) without having been completely trained. I did my normal rounds, changing signs over on end caps and tables and scanning product. I returned to the office to print labels & signs for the product scanned. While they were printing, the bakery manager came into the office. She was at a 10 immediately and yelled at me that her signs were wrong. The people who worked price control on Saturday were responsible for making the big signs for all the departments. I hung tags on Saturday night and had never been trained to make the big signs. I was all alone for another few hours. She told me that's unacceptable and called me stupid for not being trained. She told the manager on duty and I explained to him that I hadn't been trained. I returned to my rounds, very upset. My co-worker came in a few hours later and made the signs. She defended me to the manager on duty. The next day I got written up by my own department manager. She told me I should have known how to fix the signs, even though she trained me and never trained me to use the computer that made big signs. I refused to sign the write-up and put in my 2 weeks. It didn't feel as righteous or triumphant. It felt miserable bc I was alone in taking my stand and everyone but my co-worker was against me. My co-worker quit shortly thereafter.",
