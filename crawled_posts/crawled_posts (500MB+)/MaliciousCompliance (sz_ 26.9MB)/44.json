        "selftext": "This happened before I graduated college. I was working a part time housekeeping job for a doctor\u2019s office after closing. The most annoying thing was the blatant disregard from the people who worked there. In particular, the women at the front portions of the office would throw trash *everywhere* and not put it in the can. Under their desk, the floor would be covered in trash (right around the trash can!) and most of the time I wouldn\u2019t even have to change the garbage bag, just dump the very few pieces that managed to get in the can and then literally crawl around under the desk on my hands and knees, picking up all their shit. I\u2019m talking paper thrown everywhere, old folders they\u2019d clean out from closets, candy wrappers, tuna cans (you\u2019re eating TUNA in an OFFICE?) and thousands of peanut shells. To name a few. They just didn\u2019t care. The amount of lazy you have to be to throw garbage right beside the can and not in it astounds me. I never complained to anyone about it because even though it pissed me off, I figured it was less effort to just pick it up. \n\nThat is, until I got a note. A very passive aggressive note from a particular messy woman, letting me know I threw her calendar away and *why* would I ever do such a thing?\n\nPic: https://i.imgur.com/eWaOZel.jpg\n\n1: the calendar was propped up against her garbage can. That\u2019s usually the universal sign of \u201chey, this needs to be thrown away\u201d and they threw stuff like that away all the time, why put it there if it isn\u2019t trash?\n2: there\u2019s so much garbage all under your desk every single night, how am I supposed to know when something isn\u2019t trash?\n3: it isn\u2019t my job to determine what is and what isn\u2019t to be thrown away. \n\nIt *was* my bad that I threw the calendar away because I didn\u2019t pay attention to the dates or anything on it (like I said, there\u2019s always shit everywhere) but when I got this note, I was *pissed*. The NERVE, after I spend so much unnecessary time cleaning up garbage that YOU can\u2019t be bothered to actually put in your trash cans because you\u2019re too lazy? *Fine*. \u201cIf its not in my can, don\u2019t touch it!!\u201d You got it! I won\u2019t touch anything that isn\u2019t *in* your garbage can. I left everything that was on the floor exactly where it was and just changed the bags. \n\nNeedless to say, she didn\u2019t like that, and complained to my supervisor. My response was, \u201cbut I was just doing exactly what she told me to do *shrug*\u201d \n\nMy petty ass was pleased\n\nEdited to say: My supervisor told the office manager that if they wanted their trash taken out, then they were to put it in the trash can. Otherwise, nothing would be thrown away, with the exception of boxes labeled \u201ctrash\u201d that were too big for cans",

One evening one of our guys called in sick and I was asked to clean the library.  Just as my shift started the boss handed me a sheet and told me to keep track of what I did and how long it took.  (Some management thing).\n\nSo, I swept the library floors and did a few other things.  Then went behind the counter to dump the trash and sweep.  I just remembered I was suppose to be writing stuff down and of course didn't have a pen.\n\nAt that time of night there was only one one person working.    \nWell, guess I was rude when looking for a pen I opened up a desk drawer a few inches and took out a pen, closed the drawer and started my paper work.    \nI looked up to see the Librarian staring at me with eyes just staring at me.  \n\nI emptied the trash and swept and went to write my time down using some sort of counter.  While doing so I noticed a cartoon under plastic covering.\n\nI read the cartoon and noticed several others and I read them.  There were a few books on the counter and I picked them up, read the cartoons and put the books back right where they came from.\n\nLooking up the Librarian was still glaring at me.  I didn't care and being done I left.\n\nNext day I go to work and boss calls me to the office and asked what I did in the Library the night before.  Told him swept and emptied the trash.\n\nSeems the Li brain reported that I was going through desk drawers and was moving stacks of books around.  Told him all I did was open a desk drawer enough to get a pen and even put it back and that I had moved books but, put them right back where they came from.\n\nHe said \"yeah, watch yourself over there.  We have had other wild claims from her of our guys doing stuff and they all pretty much say what you kind of said.

        "selftext": "This chain of events started almost twenty years ago, and involves myself and a notoriously snooty national Real Estate agency.\n\nThere is a bit of background leading to the MC incident so please bear with me. This all occurred  in QLD, Australia.\n\r\nI once rented a property through an agency from 2004-2006. Due to my ex partner\u2019s explosive (and violent) temper, we had been handed an eviction notice.There was damage to the property that was unfixed at the time we were evicted. Damage that was in the form of fist and hammer sized holes in walls etc.\n\r\nWe obviously did not receive any of the bond deposit back as the repair costs more than absorbed the amount. There was also an added sum of about $1,700 extra to cover the rest of the costs incurred repairing the damage. This amount was forwarded to a debt collections agency. This collection amount was in both of our names as we had jointly been on the lease agreement.\n\r\nI was not upset at the agency, they were just doing their job by being a good advocate for the owner of the property at this stage. Taking the bond and charging us for the repair was standard and not nasty, vindictive or overkill in the slightest. My anger came later.\n\nAlthough I must admit I was a bit miffed to be dually held financially responsible for the damage caused by my ex, but due to the nature of the joint lease not much could be legally done. I was just grateful we had parted ways not long after...\n\r\nA few years post eviction I wanted to get my life more organised in many areas and tie up any loose ends that would impede me moving forward. A clean slate so to speak. So the debt issue came first.\n\nAfter many phone calls,  and some paperwork exchange (plus an escalation or two) the debt collection agency finally agreed to split the $1,700 damages bill between the ex and myself. Now I could pay off half and not be held accountable for his portion any longer.\n\nThis had to be done without his consent as he refused. I\u2019m unsure as to why, possibly hoping I would pay the whole lot to rebuild my credit rating, or most likely just to be annoying.\n\r\nOnce I had paid off \u2018my portion\u2019 of the collectors debt I thought I was done with the whole business and the black mark against my name.\n\nNot so unfortunately. It turned out that the State I lived in had a blacklist that Real Estate agencies and lessors could add tenants names to. It\u2019s called the TICA list. All they needed was proof that the tenant had behaved in a bad enough manner regarding renting of a property to warrant being listed. Due to the fact we had been evicted, the damage, and also owed arrears to a debt agency for repairs we unfortunately qualified.\n\nBeing on this list made it almost impossible to rent, especially via a Real Estate agency.\n\r\nAfter speaking extensively with the RTA - which is a government agency - I found I was definitely eligible to have my name removed from the list so I started taking action for this to happen. I was able to demonstrate good faith by having paid for half of the damages. It also went in my favour that my partner was abusive and there was legal evidence of this fact.\n\r\nHowever I was told the only way to have my name removed was by the Real Estate agency. So I approached them and asked for them to do so. \n\nThey were very helpful initially, if I was able to show them proof that the debt was settled they were happy to remove my name. At least seven years had elapsed by this point so it was considered punishment enough.\n\r\nAt the time after five years your name is usually removed from the TICA list, however this company apparently kept tabs on who they had added to the list and when the person\u2019s five years expired they just added them again. \n\nDirty tactics indeed, obviously I had been re-added.\n\r\nSo I provided relevant documents to the agency and was assured my name would be removed as soon as they located my file.\n\nThis apparently had been stored away in archives as much time had passed since I rented with them. I was told this would take a week maximum. All good.\n\r\nSo I called a week later, and was told to wait another week, still in a kind, helpful and cordial tone. I called again after that time and was told to wait \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 another week, and this time I detected a tone of frost in the reply.\n\nSo I called back more than a week later just to show patience, and  now was spoken to in a very haughty manner. I was informed that my request was bothersome! Being so because what I asked was not important and finding my file was a waste of their staff time. They would call me when they got around to it...\n\r\nI expressed how important it was personally, and then heard the magic words (almost verbatim) \u201cIf you want us to do this so badly, we will only be forcedd to help you if ordered, perhaps you should take us to court if you can\u2019t be patient. Goodbye.\u201d String me along? \n\nOk, Game on...\n\r\nI had a feeling this was all done to avoid removing my name as they had found my file. Also that they were stalling, and wanted me to stay blacklisted. But I wasn\u2019t backing down without a fight, and so I took their advice.\r\n\nI filed against them to have the matter seen in a Small Claims Court. It cost me $35 which would be reimbursed by the agency if I won. I didn\u2019t have anything to lose and I wanted them to know that not all people will hold indefinitely, or continue to be unjustly punished for longer than fair. It was listed to appear in about four days from filing.\r\n\nAs soon as they received the court date paperwork I was suddenly bombarded with phone calls! How dare I take the agency to court when they were working their hardest to find my file and help me?!\n\nDoing my best to sound apologetic for taking their advice, I thanked them for the suggestion, as it seemed there would now be a timeframe at least for the matter to be dealt with.\r\n\nOn the day of court I had three sheets of paper as my sole evidence. A statement showing that  repair bill had been paid and there was no finances outstanding. A statement from the RTA that I was eligible to have my name taken off the TICA list. And lastly a document stating it was at the behest of the Real Estate agency to remove my name and that they had no good reason not to.\r\n\nNot one but two agents for the company showed up to Court. When it came before the judge both parties had to give evidence if relevant. I handed in my three pages. Seeing them pass the judge a thick folder of paperwork (including photo\u2019s of the property damage) was rather amusing considering they supposedly couldn\u2019t find my file when last requested.\n\r\nThe judge asked them for a statement. They went on for a few minutes about why I didn\u2019t deserve to be removed, and justified their stance with the photos and prior rental history with them.\n\nAll I had to reply was that I had paid for my share of the damage, that the damage was due to my abusive ex, and that I had made restitution as much as I could regarding the matter. With no money owing.\n\r\nThe judge then asked why I had brought it to court? I explained that the company was dragging their feet removing my name when it was a simple matter, and it wasn\u2019t necessarily fair to do so. That I had called  them repeatedly and waited while they found my (so hard to locate) paperwork that had somehow miraculously appeared when convenient. That being on the TICA list was harmful to my future chances at renting and also that my name had been re-submitted after dropping off the list.\n\r\nThe judge queried them why they had added my name again.

            "Good for you! I had a nightmare experience about 8 years ago- also in Qld. I lived alone and was moving out as the flat I was in was an absolute dump.\n\nThe real estate sent me an entry notice for an open house that was to be held on a weekend I wasn't going to be home. I wasn't thrilled about it, but called and was told I had no choice. I said to make sure they pulled the wood door closed until it clicked AND locked the screen as I didn't trust the wood door.\n\nI went away for the weekend and came home to a wide open front door. I was furious, upset but thankful nothing had been stolen. I called the real estate agency, just wanting an apology, and they doubled down, denied everything and then followed up with letters detailing how they could not possibly left the door open.\n\nFast forward to move out time... My lease ended at midnight on Thursday, and I asked if I could please drop the keys in at 8am Friday (when their office opened) so I had that night to clean. This is usually fine with agents. I was told yes, this was fine. Until a few days later I got an angry email and a demand to pay a day's worth of rent, around $35,  for \"neglecting\" to return the keys on time.\n\nGame on.\n\nI made a complaint with the RTA, focusing on the open door, as silly me thought that was a breach. Months later, I got a call from them that they wanted a stat dec from me. They asked me to come to their office but I couldn't so two people from the RTA came out to my workplace to take it. They hated this agent and were determined to get him for something as they said they'd never had someone that so many tenants complained about. During that stat dec, I learnt the offence they could prosecute was not the open door, but the fact that I'd never agreed in writing to the open house (which is Qld law). Months more went by and i got an email from the RTA letting me know they'd taken the real estate agent to court over that, and he was fined about $6000.\n\nHad he said sorry about the open door and not charged me $35 for something he'd agreed to, I'd never have made the complaint and he'd have saved himself a lot of money!",

        "selftext": "This happened a few months ago but the problem had been going on for years. \n\n\nEvery other month, I would get a text message from someone asking for a doctor or to make an appointment. I started off immediately informing them they\u2019ve got the wrong number. Hey, it happens.\n\n\nWhen it started happening more frequently, I dealt with the minor annoyance by trying to have some fun. \n\n\n\u2018Is Dr. Lee available?\u2019\n\n\nMe: \u2018There\u2019s no Dr. Lee here. Only Dr. Wong. Dr. Wong Num Ber.\u2019\n\n\nIt was funny until the volume of messages started increasing and I got annoyed. \n\n\nA quick Google search led me to the clinic\u2019s page. Their number was indeed easily mistakable for mine. Theirs ends with \u2018-013\u2019 and mine with \u2018-073\u2019. And the font used certainly made it worse. \n\n\nI called the clinic to inform them of this problem and that they needed to do something about it. Change the font, spell the numbers out, or even change their number. I just wanted the messages to stop. The lady just brushed me off and said there was nothing she could do. I asked to speak to someone in charge but was denied. She told me to change my number or just \u2018deal with it\u2019.\n\n\nSo here comes the part where I dealt with it. \n\n\nAfter an odd month of peace, I received several messages over a week asking to make an appointment. \n\n\n\u2018Hi, I would like to make an appointment please.\u2019\n\n\nMe: \u2018Sure. The next available slot is next Friday at 10. Would that work for you?\u2019\n\n\nI made very sure never to claim that I represented the clinic. If anyone asked for a specific doctor, I would say there is no such person here, and if they did ask for the clinic I\u2019d inform them they got the wrong number. \n\n\nBasically, I had myself covered and I tried to have everyone\u2019s appointment at the same time.\n\n\nWhen Friday came around, I received several angry replies from those people and a call from the clinic. \n\n\n(messages went generally like this)\n\n\u2018You\u2019re a terrible person! Why would you do this to waste my time? Why did you pretend to be the clinic?\u2019\n\n\nMe: \u2018I\u2019m sorry ma\u2019am but I run a PC repair service.(except I don\u2019t take appoinments via sms nor is my personal number listed) I was expecting you at 10 but you didn\u2019t show. If you looked at your message you never asked if I was the clinic and I never claimed to be.\u2019 \n\n\n(And the call went like this. CL: clinic lady)\n\n\nCL: Hi, who is this? Why did you pretend to be us and arranged for all these appointments?\n\n\nMe: I called you months ago letting you know about this but you told me to deal with it. So I set appointments up for them to see me. It\u2019s not my fault they showed up at your door. Maybe you should change your phone number. *i hang up*\n\n\n\nSure I felt a little bad I made those people travel to the clinic but I\u2018ve since stopped receiving messages from random people and after checking on the clinic\u2019s site, they now have an online appointment making system. \n\n\nEdit: Thanks for popping my gold cherry!

Occasionally when the ink ran low on the register it looked like my phone number and we'd get calls from people pissed about incorrect orders. One guy called three times and wouldn't listen to my roommate when they tried to point out the wrong number (we all had it memorized.) The final time he called my roommate answered \"McDonald's, how can I help you?\" and gave the *worst* customer service you can imagine. The caller was livid, asking for a name and manager.

He was very kind about it and assuming he did change it because the pictures stopped.\n\nI have since decided that if I ever need petty revenge or just to really fuck with someone I'm putting an ad on CL with their number and weird requests.

Friend of mine worked HR there but he also held the title as head of security, so he offered me a job and I accepted.\n\nOne of the biggest rules were ID checks. Apparently a few years prior a couple of people had gotten in with photo copied ID\u2019s. So after that we had to physically check the the ID was plastic. We did this by touching it.\n\nNow, do access control enough and you start to memorize people. We didn\u2019t check those ID\u2019s by touching them because we knew them and if they had been fired we would have gotten a notice.   \n\n\nWell that angered the head of HR so she set some new rules (she wasn\u2019t the head of security, but security fell under HR so she kind of was) All ID\u2019s must be check, no exceptions. No non-employee is allowed through the gate without a noticed signed by her or the head of security, and has to be submitted 12 hours prior to their entry (like for people scheduled for interviews). visitor badges assigned without prior approval can only be done for normal delivers (like the post office or fedex). Anyone who violates it will be reported by security to HR for a security violation.\n\nThat was fine and dandy, we really didn\u2019t care. Everything went smooth for about a month until that one day. Here she comes to the gate, but she isn\u2019t driving, he husband is. It is raining and I mean flood level raining. i asked her husband for his ID and he says he didn\u2019t have one. She seen where this was going and tried to stop me. He was only there to take her in because it was raining and she didn\u2019t want to walk from her car to the building and ruin her outfit.\n\nThats when I threw the rules back to her. I didnt have a security notice for him so I couldnt assign a badge and couldn\u2019t let him in. She tried the \u201cbut it\u2019s only 100 yards\u201d which again I reminded her of the rule SHE set down.   \n\n\nShe actually said \u201cWell I\u2019m your boss (technically she wasn\u2019t) we are going in anyways\u201d which I replied again her rule that any breaches of policy must be reported as a security violation. So there she is, dressed to the 9\u2019s forced to walk, without a jacket, to the building, 100 yards, in the rain to get to her office. Why didnt we lend her a security rain jacket you ask? Because she said there wasn\u2019t enough money in the security budget to buy them.\n\nLater that day she modified the rules that on drop offs that security has full discretion to allow someone entry for that purpose. We also got our rain jackets 2 weeks later and she never bothered security again.",

This one gentleman and one of our busier client sites says that he's tired of being told his emails never arrived to him. We look it up and yes, a couple of legit emails got tangled up in the spam filter. No big deal, we whitelist the sender and release the message.\n\nNo, not good enough for this guy. He calls back *screaming*. \"I ORDER YOU TO LET ANY EMAIL ADDRESSED TO ME COME TO MY INBOX\". I advise him that I'm going to have to transfer him to IT security and he's going to have to, on a recorded line, say he understands and accepts responsibility for yadda yadda yadda.\n\nSee, I did that because these guys get thousands of spam emails a day. A while back, several folks (this guy included) decided to give their email address and password to some unsavory website. Then did it again. And again. And again. So now they get easily 15-20+ messages an hour to the entire organization.\n\nSo he accepts, saying he just wants all his emails to go to him. We allow all messages to him to bypass the spam filter. \n\nThree hours later, he has over 100 new emails. And they keep coming in.\n\nHe calls back, furious, asking why his spam filter isn't working.\n\n\"Sir, you asked that all emails addressed to you arrive at your inbox.\"\n\nUPDATE: So right around 4:45pm today, he's calling our office and the call gets routed to me since I own the ticket. He's *livid*. Shouting so loud my co-workers on the opposite side of the room can hear him. \"WHATEVER YOU DID TO MY EMAIL I WANT IT PUT BACK TO THE WAY IT WAS! YOU F*CKED UP MY EMAIL AND NOW I CAN'T GET ANY WORK DONE BECAUSE MY STUPID NOTIFICATIONS ARE GOING OFF EVERY SECOND!\"\n\nI calmly reply \"Absolutely. I'll go ahead and turn your spam filtering back on and all these emails will stop.\"\n\n\"GOOD! ITS WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE IN THE FIRST PLACE!\"\n\nAt the end of it all, nothing changed, and he's happy. God I love IT work.\n\nEDIT: To the few of you who have (and the many more that will, seeing as how this picked up a little more steam than I was expecting) commented saying I should be fired... Chill. I'm lucky enough to be at a place that values their employees enough to know that we do not deserve the kind of verbal abuse this guy slings out. A lot of jobs I've been at would have handed me my walking papers the moment I didn't immediately suck this dude off to climax before finding out what his name was. Between me and the security team, we told him at least four times that this exact thing would happen, and he said (on a recorded line) \"I don't care\". I take care of my customers and my bosses enable me to do a damn good job. I believe that's why our company is experiencing very good growth right now. Relax.\n\nFINAL EDIT: I had to. I logged into our system this morning from home and listened to the recording. It's glorious. Here's the highlights:\n\nSecurity: So [OP] tells me you're looking to turn off the spam filter?\n\nClient: I don't even get spam. I'm paying you people for something I don't need.\n\nSecurity: It's not an added cost, but you're not getting spam because you have a spam filter. If you turn that off, you're going to get flooded with spam emails.\n\nClient: I don't care. I've given you guys an order, and I expect it to be done.\n\nSecurity: I just need you to be aware that without the spam filter, you're open to getting every spam email that comes to you, some of which may be malicious and could open you up to viruses, malware, and all sorts of software that could compromise your entire network. By going against our suggestions, you understand that [Our Company] cannot be held liable for any malicious software that makes it on to your network, infects any of your systems, or causes any system downtime and that you are claiming sole responsibility for that. Do you understand this?\n\nClient: Yeah, whatever. Just get it done so I can get off this call.\n\nSecurity: Sir, I really need to reiterate how much we cannot recommend this action, you're going to get--\n\nClient: I DON'T CARE, DO WHAT I TELL YOU.\n\nSecurity: Ok, I'll have [OP] remove you from the default spam rule, and you'll start receiving any email sent to you. Again, it's going to be a lot. The spam filter actually does catch a lot of spam.\n\nClient: I. DON'T. CARE. JUST DO IT.\n\nSecurity: Ok then. Thank you. Have a good day.\n\n*Click*\n\nEDIT: The things I get gilded for on Reddit. Thank you for the gold, kind stranger!\n\nFOR REALS LAST EDIT: I talked with Security this morning. This guy *has a history* with us. Apparently he's been told numerous times that if he \"calls our employees 'delinquent fucks' or any other form of verbal abuse\" then the company will be offboarded immediately. Oh, these previous tickets with him are juicy.\n\nEDIT AGAIN: Holy shit, PLATINUM? Goddamn, anonymous Redditor! Thanks! My first one!\n\nEDIT AGAIN BECAUSE PROMISES ARE A POINTLESSLY EASY SOCIAL CONTRACT TO BREAK: WE'RE OFFBOARDING THE COMPANY! Apparently when he called back to talk to security about the whole thing, he called the tech a very inflammatory racial slur. Immediate offboarding. By the end of the day, they will not have an IT company. Holy fucking shit this is huge!\n\nTHE ACTUAL FINAL EDIT: Well, it's been a crazy day, folks. We offboarded the company despite the CEO (not the CFO, which was who this douche was) calling and asking us to reconsider. The CEO of my company told their CEO that these kinds of things are covered in our service agreement which the CFO had violated on numerous occasions and our complaints had gone unaddressed. We are providing EXTREMELY limited service to them for a total of thirty days while they find a new IT company, after which we will send over all our notes and configs and wish them the best of luck. I'm glad we all could share in this little adventure, and I hope we can all do it again sometime. In the meantime, thanks for the rewards, the karma, and the comments that had me laughing.

About five minutes in the rider asked me what was on my rear view mirror.  I told him it was my interior cam.  He got mad and told me to turn it off because he didn't like such surveillance.  I reminded him that the Uber app would have said there was video recording.  There are also signs on the door.  He could have declined booking the trip if there was a problem.  It escalated when he yelled, \"You better turn that damn thing off or else\"!  \"Or else?\", I asked.  \"Yes\",  was the reply. \"Turn it off or stop this trip\"!!\n\nI verified with him his request and he said, \"Yes, turn the damn thing off or end this trip.\" to which I said, \"Fine.  Have it your way.  I will comply.\"  At that, I exited the highway and pulled into a convenience store.  He acted a bit stunned before shouting \"What the hell are you doing?\"  I calmly stated, \"You said either I stop recording or I end the trip.  As I have no intention of stopping the recording I am letting you out here\".  That did not go well for him as he started screaming and hurling vituperative abuse beginning with \"f\", questioning my parentage, and although correctly guessing my sexual orientation was rather rude about it.  I calmly ended the trip as per his request.  That was the compliance.  Here's the maliciousness \\[which although I'm very capable of I rarely do\\].\n\nWhen ending the trip on the app, I gave him a one star rating as we can't give a zero.  As he really was getting on my last nerve I added feeling unsafe and abusive rider.  As he continued to rant, I pointed to a police car that just pulled in and told him, \"If you don't leave my car immediately then perhaps you might want to explain why not to that nice officer.\"  After getting a few more cutting jabs and getting out, he tossed his open protein drink at my head hitting the headrest and spilling all over the floorboard.  It was that time I got a text message from Uber support asking if I was alright.  I said I was.  They told me his account was suspended and asked if I could send the video clip to him.  I said I would and also mentioned the mess.  Uber support told me to just send them a picture and he would be charged a $75 cleaning fee \\[which I got within an hour\\].\n\nSo I did exactly what the rider wanted but due to his petulant behavior he got a cancelled Uber account and it cost him $75.  If he would have just left, I wouldn't have done a thing but play stupid games.  Win stupid prizes!!",

She briefly pulled the phone away from her head long enough to mouth \u201ccaramel macchiato\u201d at me. I started my spiel about how we serve a traditional macchiato, which is quite small, did she want that or one like the other place makes. She cut me off three words in and dramatically said \u201cI know what it is! Just make it!\u201d So I rang her up and made it. \n\nI made her a tiny drink with espresso, caramel syrup and milk foam. When I gave it to her she finally got off her phone call and told me I clearly made it wrong. I explained I made what she ordered as she told me she knew what she was ordering. \n\nShe now said she wanted one like she would get at national chain, which I happily made and charged her for.

I mentioned that these are heavy and a hazard on tilted ground and wondered if they would pay for my kids' medical bills when the bin tipped over on them.  I put it on the other side of the house where the ground tilts. I took pictures of our neighbors whose bins are on the side of the house and clearly visible.  I included many bad words.

        "selftext": "When I was younger I worked as a engineer for a small company. The owner who I'll call Jake, let me know before I started that I would be doing about 10 hour days, 6 days a week for about 6 months, but that I would have to be flexible. Some days they wouldn't have work for me and other days I'd be expected to stay a few hours late. This didn't bother me too much as I wasn't too tight for money and I didn't mind staying behind a few extra hours occasionally.  \n\nI got to work and was told to follow instructions from the owners brother, Steve. He was an arrogant character, who always thought he knew how to do everyone's else's job better than them. We butted heads a few times but nothing major. \n\nA few months in, I found a new job starting in a week that paid better. Later on that day I had another disagreement with Steve. The situation was petty but it's his response that really confused me. It ended with him screaming in my face \"if you don't do as I say, then you can fucking leave!\". \n\nSo I packed my stuff and left. Steve was a little confused, thinking I'd just fall in line. He was too arrogant to apologise, and I had a job lined up. \n\n(Side note for people not in the UK, I was working a zero hour contract. This means I get an hourly wage but I'm not afforded some labor rights like a set salery, minimum work hours or notice for dismissal. This works both ways though so I can leave the job whenever I want with no notice.) \n\nI decided to call up Jake since he'd always been chill and told him what happened. He told me he needed me and I should just return to work. I told him unless he controls steve and made him apologise, there was no way I was coming back. He refused so I told him I'll send in my final time sheet.\n\nTwo weeks later and I've started my new job. I still haven't been paid for my final week, so I call Jake. He told me that \"since you didn't give notice for leaving, you owe me for lost product of work.\" He said if I didn't like it, I should sue him and \"recommended\" I should just take the loss and move on. This was complete bs.\n\nA couple months go by until I finally find time to file for small claims court. Few days after sending him notice, Jake paid my money including court fees and extra. He actually called me up apologizing for the \"confusion\". He wanted to know when I could return to work. I'd heard from one of my ex co-workers that because of the infrequent hours, people would leave as soon as they were told they wouldn't have work the next day. Others would leave when they realised how much of a jerk Steve was. They'd gone through about 7 different workers in the time I was gone and struggled to keep anyone for more than a week. I told him I'd think about it. I managed to string him along for a few weeks before he stopped calling me.\n\nThe moral of the story is that if you think you're being treated unfairly, you shouldn't just put up with it. Your self respect isn't worth compromising. Don't settle for being treated like shit, especially when you're willing to go above and beyond for them.",

I quit a job after I got passed over for a promotion.  Let me explain here, that was pretty much the last straw for me.  A lot of bullshit happened before this that I'm not gonna get into.  I asked why I didn't get the promotion.  I was told the person that got it had fewer attendance points and knew more jobs.  After some investigation, I found out that we had the same amount of attendance points.  He knew 4 jobs and I knew 12.  That was the breaking point for me.  I realized I was nothing to them and I'm not exactly sure why.  It could have been the fact I was an older fat woman that had FMLA for a chronic pain condition.

That project is useful to inform your real work.\"\n\nIt was like a lightbulb went off -- what I care about doing isn't my job! That's fixable!

            "That reminds me of my English professor in university college.\n\nI had taken another course before I started my Office Management, Translation and Interpretation course, so I got 1.5 years (out of 3) exemption for English. Second year, second semester rolls around, and I show up for my very first class of English with this teacher. I immediately get lip for being \"new\" and \"how it was the first time I showed up for class\" (yes, because I didn't have to, remember?)\n\nThis is ESL, so the professor doesn't have English for her mother tongue, and I've been told by my friends who did take her classes, that she makes a lot of mistakes. One of the first things she said, was \"let's make some exercises\". So cringy. My English has always been pretty good, I used to teach English (ESL as well) myself before I took this course, so safe to say I wasn't going to learn much here but just attended because I made it a point to not skip classes.\n\nWe get an assignment, something like, *you went on a holiday and something went horribly wrong, and now you're writing to the organisation to ask for compensation.* She was adamant about *being creative*, so my friend and I might have taken it a bit too far and we were laughing our asses off (quietly enough, it wasn't like we were disrupting the whole class). We were genuinely doing the assignment, using all the right words, we just happened to actually enjoy doing it, and I guess this prof isn't used to people enjoying her classes.\n\nFirst, she never mentioned we had to hand in our preparation, only that we'd have to read it aloud. But she changed her mind, we had to swap papers with the person behind us and we'd \"grade each other's prep\" in groups of 2. First of all, what the fuck. Secondly, the prof then went to look at my and my friend's work. Mine, nothing much to say about it, which seemed to personally offend her. My friend's? Also nothing to say about content-wise, but his handwriting was *horrible.* The prof and the dude \"grading\" his work were giggling amongst themselves about \"how badly they could read it\" and \"he writes like a toddler\". I was getting really angry because how fucking unprofessional are you, but decided to not let that ruin my day and had some more fun grading the two papers we were handed.\n\nApparently she's had it by now, and she goes off on us. She says a lot of things, one of which is \"if you're just here to have fun instead of learn English, you can leave.\" Well, it wasn't like I was going to learn much anyway and attendance wasn't obligatory for this class, so I walked out. The next time this teacher saw me, was at the end of the year for our oral examination.",

            "A couple months go by until I finally find time to file for small claims court. Few days after sending him notice, Jake paid my money including court fees and extra. He actually called me up apologizing for the \"confusion\". He wanted to know when I could return to work. I'd heard from one of my ex co-workers that because of the infrequent hours, people would leave as soon as they were told they wouldn't have work the next day. Others would leave when they realised how much of a jerk Steve was. They'd gone through about 7 different workers in the time I was gone and struggled to keep anyone for more than a week. I told him I'd think about it. I managed to string him along for a few weeks before he stopped calling me.\n\nThe moral of the story is that if you think you're being treated unfairly, you shouldn't just put up with it. Your self respect isn't worth compromising. Don't settle for being treated like shit, especially when you're willing to go above and beyond for them. \n\nWow! How fucking convenient that their old boss just bent over a barrel and did whatever this guy wanted.",

            "And in some places you have to go to a vocational College do ex about an hour's to get your certificate and you have to pay for it and why should they if they've already been trained for it at their old job once they complete a task like that they should get their certificate from their current position as a forklift operator",
            "Truth is most people wouldnt bother or just let it be, because courts are indifferent everywhere. Hoiwever you can quit whenever its hostile for you waste of time., you should its not nice having some side effects including, health issues and depression from work nothing worth that you were just lucky one though. In Europe it would gone south pretty much.",

            "It\u2019s easy to know bad management when it\u2019s literally yelling at you in the face. It\u2019s harder when it\u2019s more subtle and when they just don\u2019t know any better.

These places can\u2019t get enough workers but they are unwilling to change tactics. It makes entire communities worse but we see no change comping anytime soon.",
