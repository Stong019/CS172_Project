I got tired of being talked down to like i was a child anytime the slightest little mistake was made. When my boss learned I was no longer going to work in another market 3 days a week like I originally planned and he had no one else (because no one wanted to deal with the jerks in that market), he spent an hour lecturing me on \"taking a long hard look at myself\". He said that he was concerned about my reliability after refusing to spend 3 hours a day commuting to the other market on top of my work day. \"If I can't rely on you to work in the other market then I just don't know if you have much of a future with this company. I think you need to take a long hard look at yourself and gain some perspective\". You know what, you are absolutely right. 2 weeks later, I found a new job and gave my notice. He BEGGED me to stay, offered me more money, etc. This went on for days. I said \"no thanks, I finally found that perspective you wanted me to find. Boy am I glad I did! A new job with a raise and benefits, and no stress. The only advise you've ever given me of value! Good luck to you!\". He let me go a week into my notice. Started the new job, love my new boss and my coworkers. Its been over a year later, the former boss hired 6 different people to fill my spot, each lasted 1-2 months before they left.  Hmmm, wonder why that is. Maybe he needs to gain some perspective on how to run a company and treat people?",

            "Excellent job! Good for you!\n\nI once worked for a company that was bringing everyone into the 20th century by taking out all the dumb terminals and putting a PC on everyone's desk. Also, we were setting up LANs and WANs and moving to the Microsoft Suite of office products. It was a HUGE undertaking, but really needed. Owners told our sole Network Admin to do all this himself. He argued. They refused to believe he couldn't do it himself. He argued some more. They refused to budge. So, he quit. Moved to Texas to be closer to his daughter and new grandbaby.\n\nThe company had already started the process. They hired a consulting firm (HUGE $$$$) who sent a team of people. 2 guys who spent all their time in the server room. 1 supervisor for the whole project. I got two techs assigned to me (help desk manager) and then had a third guy who just did hardware and software setups. Things went pretty smoothly.\n\nThe old guy came back (I think to sell his house) after about six months and visited the office. He was greeted with smiles and hugs. The supervisor of the consulting firm told him (I was there) that they had to bring in three people to replace him, and that he had nothing to be worried about or ashamed of. He had made the right choice. I thought that was very classy of her to say that to his face. He was super happy to be by his daughter and grandbaby, the entire company got updated and upgraded, and I stayed there 11 years.",

He left 3 months later and I was watching the zoom call when he told his boss. The color literally drained from his face\n\nEdit: it was not 83% all at once. He found out a new hire was being offered significantly more and asked what his incentive to stay was. They gave him and another on his team 30% more to equal national average and what they offered the new hire. He got a promotional raise and the yearly raise\u2026 and maybe another one I cant remember. It equaled 83% at the end of the year. This still didnt give him much over national average and just barely a cost of living balance.\n\nHe actually took 8K less a year for the new job. It is much more progressive and better benefits. They also offer an educational allotment",

I basically told him \"hey, I got one foot out the door, what are you going to do about it?\" \n\nHe gave me a small raise, but thats it, told me how I need to bring my skills to the next level if I want anything more, and maybe after 10 years I could get more vacation time, but would have to think on that.

I'll be making 11k more, hybrid schedule, a 10-15min commute,  8 more vacation days per year, no more having to work unpaid overtime, and amazing healthcare plan the company pays for 100%.\n\nI can't wait to see his face when I hand it in, as I also run all the networking and technical side of our office in addition to my normal duties, and this place is fucked.

The boss threatened to write me up and void my perfect attendance for leaving early, which would result in me losing my 500 dollar bonus. I said good luck with that and left on time anyway. Came in the next day and got called into HR. They made him apologize and assured me that I will still be getting my attendance bonus. They've tried to pull this multiple times.

            "I work in software and have been with the same company for 11 years. Two years ago, I was offered a \u201cpromotion\u201d on a different team. I wasn\u2019t crazy about the manager to put it lightly but decided the job title would look good on my resume regardless. In the 18 months I worked for him, he chewed through 30 people on a 20-person team. That\u2019s Walmart magnitude turnover on a team where the lowest paid junior developers are paid over 50K. When my old boss offered me my old job back, I jumped at it to say the least. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen half that many people leave my old team in the last 11 years.",
            "Maybe I spend too much time on r/antiwork but the thing that stood out most to me is that he fired you without cause.",
            "This reminds me of the time I spent as Technical Support Manager for a regional ISP. I started when Windows 95 was brand new, and 56k modems were still in the future. Cut to 5 years along, and we've been sold to a larger company that has ISPs in multiple markets in multiple states.\r  \n\r  \nThe new owners were all from the cable TV industry and used to bullying people with impunity. Basically, \"If you want to work in this industry, in this zip code, or any zip code that touches this zip code, you better toe the line! We will fire you immediately if you don't take enough shit fast enough!\"\r  \n\r  \nThe problem they had with us was that we lived in a smaller market, and there wasn't a single person in our crew who couldn't double or triple their income by moving to a slightly larger market. So our fear factor was non-existent. Nonetheless, they persisted in making sweeping, draconian dictates that we would push back on pretty hard. They usually refused to listen to our input, and we would comply with their wishes - to the letter - and wait for the fallout. In several cases, the fallout was such that they were forced to come back to us and reverse their orders.\r  \n\r  \nThe most egregious example was when they instructed us to stop accepting payments at our office and make the customers pay directly to them at corporate HQ. The problem with that is that we were in Southern Oregon, and HQ was in California. This may come as a surprise, but there is a certain amount of animosity towards Californians in our area, mostly because they move to our beautiful area and push the property prices through the roof and then spend all their time bitching about how much better it was in California. While we never made a secret that our new corporate overlords were Californians, this \"shoving it in their faces\" was going to go poorly. We tried to explain it to them - we were going to lose customers - but they insisted, so we complied. \r  \n\r  \nWe put a sign at the front desk with the name and mailing address of the HQ and stopped taking cash payments from walk-ins (about a third of our customers dropped their payments off in person while they were in town), and those that paid by credit card had to call HQ to make their payments.\r  \nWe lost nearly a third of our customers in two weeks! They reversed their dictate, we regained 80% of those that had left within the following two weeks, and the corporate officers started asking our opinion about customer-facing issues.\r  \n\r  \nThey sucked every second they were there.  They finally went bust and sold us off to a local group. I got laid off as a \u201csalary cap casualty\u201d (my salary was more attractive as a part of theirs).  C\u2019est la vie!",

        "selftext": "I (24M) hosted a friend from college (also 24M) that I haven't seen since before the pandemic. Shortly after he arrives we head to a local bar and grill in our neighborhood. We decided to do the 15-20 minute walk instead of drive so we didn't have to worry about leaving the car. I was joined by my roommate (25M and also a good friend) and his new(ish) girlfriend (22F), who I don't know that well but I have always had friendly encounters with when we have hung out.\n\nAt the bar drinks flowed freely and my friend seemed to really hit it off with our crew. We stayed longer than expected and it was fully dark and we were well buzzed by the time we decided to walk home. It was still hot outside when we got to the apartment complex so my roommate suggested that we hit the community pool. The pool and hot tub were technically closed for the night but it isn't too close to any of the units and generally no one cares if you are responsible and don't break glass bottles or anything like that. After debating whether to head back to our place to change first my roommate insisted that \"we're all friends here\" and that we could all just go in the pool in our underwear. Everyone agreed on this although my roommate's girlfriend announced \"you guys have fun with that\" and proceeded to lounge next to the pool on one of the deck chairs and scroll Instagram.\n\nWe strip down and hop in the pool and are having a pretty good time just messing around. After some time had passed my roommate was chatting with his girlfriend and then quietly approached me afterwards. Apparently his girlfriend was very uncomfortable with me wearing just briefs in the pool (both my roommate and my friend were wearing boxer briefs) and she wanted me to go all the way back to the apartment and change into a swimsuit. I initially protested and said it was his idea in the first place and how everyone was in their underwear (and none of us cared) and what's the difference, it's not like my underwear was white/see through or anything like that. My roommate asked me to go change for him as a favor so that it didn't \"turn into an issue\" between him and her. I was pissed but decided to let it go for the time being.\n\nWhen I got back to the apartment an idea popped into my head when it occurred to me that I still had a swimsuit from when I used to swim on the club team in college, so I put on my speedo and head back out armed with another 6 pack for the boys in only a t-shirt, towel wrapped around my waste, and flip flops. I get back to the pool, announced I had changed into my swimsuit (as requested!), drop the towel and ditch the T, and launch into a wicked cannonball into the pool. I can see a wry smile on my roommate's face but nothing else was said about my choice of attire. We go on in the pool and a few minutes later she announces that she's tired and is going to bed. We stay out late including more beers and laughs in the hot tub while the girlfriend was asleep at our place.",

Some random dude comes in, towel around his waist. 40ish, clean cut, waves and says hello. Me and the kids wave awkwardly, but politely, as Canadians are supposed to.  Next thing, he drops the towel and heads straight for the hot tub with us.  Wearing nothing but a pair of Superman briefs, blue and yellow with a big S on the front. (I didn\u2019t have to stare - the image burned directly into my brain.) Nobody waited to be told to move. My kids noped outta there like there was candy and video games waiting for them upstairs.  _This_ is an example of wearing the wrong underwear into a pool.\n\nEDIT to add: His underwear were briefs, quite worn, and somewhat see thru - I guess he had showered on the way in. \n\nIt just felt awkward at the time.

Naturally, the people that come into the store tend to be on the crazier side. \n\nThe store had a line of maybe 7 people. Now, at this point, i had the \u201cregister closed\u201d sign up and i was stocking the vaporizers and accessories on the shelves behind the counter. \n\nMy coworker was handling the customers in line. I turn when i hear the door opening. Another lady walks in without a mask on. I politely ask, \u201cExcuse me, miss, do you have a mask that you could put on?\u201d She scoffed at me and rolled her eyes as she dug in her purse for a minute or two. Finally she pulls out a ratty little mask with only one functional strap and holds it to her face while she\u2019s waiting in the line. \n\nWell, apparently she couldn\u2019t do that for very long. She comes to the front of the line ranting and raving about how the line is too long and that we shouldn\u2019t be keeping a valued regular customer waiting. (I\u2019ve been working here for 4 months and i\u2019ve never seen her, i\u2019m fairly confident i know all the regulars) I tell her that there are other things that my manager left for me to do before the end of closing and that i have to get them done. \n\nShe didn\u2019t seem to like that all. \u201cI DEMAND that you open your register RIGHT NOW\u201d Okay, you got it, lady. I moved the sign and then i turned back to her. \u201cDo me a favor and stand a little bit to your right\u201d Surprisingly, she complied, albeit with her arms crossed and what i can only assume was an angry gaze firing through her mask.\n\nCue the malicious compliance.\n\n\u201cNext customer\u201d i yell out into the store. It dawns on her what i\u2019m doing but the next customer shoots up in front of the counter before she can even fully process it. I go about this transaction as normal, despite the fact that this lady is yelling at me at the top of her lungs (no longer holding the mask to her face, mind you). \n\nI finish up with the other customer and I turn to her. She tries to yell over me so i raise my voice a bit and try to be as stern as possible. I tell her \u201cJust because my register is open now, doesn\u2019t entitle you to skip all the other people in this line who also have lives, and jobs and other responsibilities. Get to the back of the line, and be respectful or i have no choice but to have you removed from the store. (We don\u2019t have security but we\u2019re 2 blocks away from a police station and one of the cool ass officers who comes into the store gave me their personal number to use just in case we have any issues.)\n\nThe lady harrumphs loudly and walks dejectedly to the spot in the line she had before she left. In the amount of time it took for the rest of the story to occur, more people had gotten in the line. \u201cI said the back of the line\u201d i told her pointedly. She dropped her shoulders and walked to the back like a toddler. \n\nPeople, man.",

            "I was working a crappy job for about 3 months between school (college) ending and my date of departure for boot camp (March).\n\nAt first it was a great job, I was hired specifically for the holiday to do overnight restock, while the store was closed.\n\nNow, this was a big name toy store at the time and it's Christmas time.  I bust my ass from 2200 to 0700 for a couple of weeks, as I don't want to be the reason some kid didn't get his special present from Santa.\n\nApparently, my attitude and hard work was noticed and the overnight manager asked me to stay one morning to talk to the store manager. \n\nOkay, sure, no problem.  Tired and sweaty, I meet the the guy and he asks if I'd be willing to work for a few extra hours after store opening,  kind of like a tour guide,  as I know where everything is, as I just put it out.  He wanted to help the customers get in and out and on with the rest of their days.  \n\nSo I say, sure why not, pitch in, help out, everybody wins, Christmas spirit and all that.  Works great for 2 days.\n\nThen, for some reason, there is a slew of \"I quit\", about 3 days before the big day.  The video game cage, think of all video games and consoles being in a big fancy looking open faced shipping container.  Guess me talking about how I used to work at a video game store during the summers and holidays while in school was a resource they could not pass up, as most of the \"I quit\" crowd came from there.\n\nAgain, sure why not.  Took 1 hour and only 1 hour to figure out the reason.  Whatever the game system of the time was sold out and there were no more coming in.  PERIOD!  NO MORE!\n\nNow, there were signs on the front doors, all the registers and about 5 or 6 more on the \"Cage\", clearly stating this in big bold letters.  With the obligatory \"so sorry, inconvenience,  etc\".  The signs on the Cage had the addendum, that the boxes you see are marketing displays and are empty.\n\nThe screaming tantrums, demands to see the manager, \"don't lie to me, I see one right there\",  were outright insane.  I pointed out the signs, explained as best I could, (hey I've been here for less than a month and not privy to the inner machinations of the stores retail and supply process). \n\nBest I can tell them is, as part of the company's marketing agreement,  we were obligated to keep the displays up.  Again, I pointed out the signs that were all over the Cage saying these were empty display boxes.\n\nI stuck it out for 4 hours before going to the Manager and telling him, in no uncertain terms,  this is not what I signed on to do.  Keep in mind, I'm still doing the whole overnight restocking gig as well.\n\nHe loses his mind and just goes off.\n\nNow, I want to be perfectly clear here, none of this is directed at me.  I am just the seasonal hire who he felt he could express his frustrations too, as i' d be gone in another week or two, tops.  Looking back, I can see the reasoning,  not wanting to pass this kind of attitude and frustration onto the regular employees and have them start acting the way he REALLY WANTED TO, to everyone of the, \"I demand to see your manager\" scenarios. \n\nSo, I'm a nice guy, and try to be helpful and a team player, get the mission done, etc.  But, I can be a right evil and vicious bastard if it is needed. \n\nI ask him, if i could give these proto-Karens (This is the 1994/95 holiday season and there was no official naming convention for raging entitled bitches (REB) at this time), a way to see these folks put in there place and enjoy the hell out of it vicariously, would he put me back on overnight restocking only?  He could even yell at me and chew me out in front of the customers  and tell me i'd never work \"here\" again, making the them \"happy\", and not damage his customer base.  \n\nOf course he wanted to know what I was going to do on Christmas eve morning, but I told him it was my present to him and to trust me it was in no way illegal or dangerous.  After hemming and hawing,  he said okay. \n\nSo, I go home and get what I needed for the next day.  \n\nI come in, work the night restock,  the jump in the Cage when the doors open.  Only difference is, that today, I have a large stack of homemade business cards next to one of the out of stock signs that is next to the \"window\" of the Cage.\n\n30 seconds after the door opens, I hand out my first business card without saying a word.  The lady is speechless.  Before she can demand to see the manager,  another REB cuts in front of her and starts off on her spiel.  Another business card.  Another shocked silence.  \n\nThe manger sees a group of about 7 REBs standing in front of the Cage, and comes over.  He is clearly surprised that no one is howling for my blood to him yet.\n\nHis,  \"Excuse me, I'm the manager here, is there anything I can help anyone with?\"  He may as well have thrown are meat into a tank of piranhas.   The explosion of voices was a sight to behold and a sound to deaffen. \n\nAfter about 5 minutes of scratching REBs waving business cards in his face, someone actually let him have one.\n\nI think he actually hurt himself by not trying to laugh.  I don't think there was a power in the verse that could keep the smile off his face though.\n\n\"The National School for Adult Illiteracy\".\n\n\"We understand how embarrassing it can be to be unable to read in today's world.  We are here to help\".\n\n\"Call 1-800-INOREAD\".\n\nBelow that, in fine print\n\n\"If this card offends you, then you clearly know how to read.  SO READ THE SIGN DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF YOU, BE QUITE OR BE GONE!  HAVE A MERRY CHRISTMAS.\"\n\nDon't know about the REBs, but I had a great Christmas, and so did my manager.  Went back a few years later.  He had one of the cards in a small frame on his desk.",

The queue wasn't long but there were some customers being silly in the self checkout (card versus cash, forgot something, etc etc etc) which made the wait longer than expected. I was waved over to a cashier checkout that they were opening but some women got there before me so I waited patiently. After five minutes or so, my back absolutely killing me at this stage as it was busy so didn't want to put my bags down, it became apparent that these women were huge pains in the arse. The dude who had initially waved me over to the cashier checkout came up and apologised, I told him it was fine and wasn't his fault, he then made sure the next self check out that came up was held for me and brought my basket over for me. I was frazzled at this stage so while I did thank him and try and express how much I appreciated him keeping an eye out for me and helping a fraught checkout process I feel like I could have thanked him more and so I guess my point is that I want to just publicly say how awesome that attendant was and how much I appreciated him and hope that he has a lovely day and there weren't any more twits or at least he didn't get the rough end of any twits.

        "selftext": "I worked for his small company for 6 weeks at the end of 2020 (it was landscape architecture). He sacked me with no real explanation when I was off sick with covid. I have undiagnosed (highly suspected) ADHD so I wasn't massively suprised (it affects my performance). But I was suprised by the timing and the fact it was via email. I asked for more clarity. I was never rude to him. I just told him I wish he'd called me so I could get some feedback.\n\nHe got really mad and proceeded to write a long list of my (over-exaggerated and some false) shortcomings e.g. too slow, distracted (stuff he never mentioned at the time). He then said 'if you want to take legal action against me, let me know'. I didn't. I left it and moved on.\n\nFast forward to today. He just called my mobile from a private number asking how I was. I was taken aback as we have had no communication since. He said 'someone has put in a report I'm using unlicensed software, was it you? Because I know we left on bad terms'. I said I've no idea what you're talking about. He made it seem I was devastated he sacked me (lol) and would have good reason to report him. No matter what I said he was convinced it was me. He even accused my dad who works in IT.\n\nI didn't even know he was using unlicensed software. I said 'I feel like you're unfairly accusing me here' he raised his voice and shouted 'WHY DO YOU ALWAYS PLAY THE VICTIM, STOP PLAYING THE VICTIM! (probably in reference to the fact I questioned the way he sacked me). It sounded so rehearsed I honestly had to hold back laughter. Then he  said 'I'm not *accusing* you, but did you do it?' (Lmao).\n\n\nLooking back I believe it was unlicensed. We only ever used the student version of autodesk (which is illegal when you're running a business). This combined with his accusation tells me he is infact breaking the law..\n\nI was so pissed off by his accusation I reported him to both autodesk and the BSA. He'll have to run an audit and likely face a huge fine. He thinks I did it either way so what harm can one more report do? ;)\n\nEDIT: for all you sad trolls, I didn't complain *because* he sacked me. I just questioned the *way* he did it. A simple phone call would have been better than an email. When you're fired you have a right to ask why and that's easier to do in conversation (best in person). I literally didn't have a problem when he sent a list of my shortcomings. I just accepted it and moved on. I also take full accountability for it, the ADHD played a part but I'm still to blame for losing the job. Not the ADHD.\n\nAt no point did I ever say I shouldn't have been sacked. If you actually bothered to read the whole story you wouldn't be making that assumption. I was just pissed he pointed the finger at me for the report. Also I love this mentality that because I'm a graduate I'm a little bitch and bosses can never be in the wrong. You've clearly never had a job to not know that. Now fuck off.\n\nAlso, my dad does not work there. Like I already said he is a software engineer, not a landscape architect. So stop telling me I'm 'happy to put him out of work'.\n\nIn regards to the ADHD, I didn't know I had it until recently. But it makes sense in hindsight. Especially considering the reasons he fired me are all ADHD symptoms. Although I haven't been officially diagnosed (awaiting) my doctor highly suspects I have it.

So I go through the normal application process and get accepted (yay!), but as I didn't have my bachelor degree at that point, I had to produce a certified copy of my degree as soon as I could. Yes, I had to give a certified copy of my bachelors degree to the university who issued that degree in the first place. And no, these were not different deparments. It was all done by one (!) lady in the examination office!\n\nBut whatever, weird bureaucracy is weird. And BOY was it annoying at that university. Because all students of my faculty had to got through one lady. And I think she just hated to do anything. Like, seriously, she was so annoyed when you showed up at her office to just do anything. When I turned in my bachelor thesis, she straight up said that she is so fucking annoyed that all the students turn their thesis in at her office. Well, we don't have another choice?? There is seriously not other way to turn your thesis in. And don't ever think about asking her anything...\n\nSo, I am already looking forward to picking up my bachelors degree (no we don't have a fancy celebration). Normally you would get an e-mail when your degree is ready, but as she fucking hates our guts, you just have to guess when it is ready. We don't get an e-mail. Two weeks after your last grade is put in the system, it is probably ready. So, I did just that. I show up at her office and horay my degreen is ready.\n\nLady: \"Here.\" (without even looking at me)\n\nMe: \"Thank you, I need a certified copy of that.\"\n\nLady: (really annoyed): \"Excuse me, WHAT?\"\n\nMe: \"I need a certified copy. Could you please copy it and certify that it is a copy of the original?\"\n\nLady: \"I know what a certified copy is! You can get that at the town hall.\"\n\nMe: \"I know, but I can also get it here. I know for a fact that you have to give me one if I request it.\"\n\n(5-second staring contest ensues)\n\nLady: \"\\*sigh\\* FINE!\"\n\nShe takes my degree back, turns around, copies it and signs that it is a certified copy.\n\nLady: (hands me the degree and copy) \"HERE!\"\n\nMe: \"Thank you. Now I would like to give you a certified copy of my bachelor degree for my application for the masters degree. (I hand her back the certified copy).\"\n\nLady: \"ARE YOU SERIOUS?\"\n\nMe: \"Yes, I thought if I am already here, I could turn that in as well. So I don't have to come back again.\"\n\n(Another 5-second staring contest)\n\nLady just takes the copy out of my hand and turns around. And with that, I lef with the biggest grin on my face.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat did she expect? That I got to the town hall (15 Minute ride), wait there for probably 1-2 hours, get a certified copy that would cost me 13 Euros (at uni one was for free) and then come  back another day? HELL NO! Especially because she had the weirdest office hours ever. It was something like 2 days a week for 1,5 hours in the morning and one day for 1,5 hours in the afternonn. So I probably would have waited days to turn that in.\n\nBut her face when I asked for a certified copy was just glorious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Ok, this blew up way more than I thought. I am glad to hear that I am not the only one experiencing it. And yes, this happened in Germany. But I can't tell the university without maybe getting in trouble.

One day, he decided that he should finish that degree. One of the benefits of his job is that he can study for free if the field of study relates to his job. So he had to get the description of the remaining class he was taking, and have his boss sign off on it. As it happens, the professor teaching the class was also my friend's boss.

The problem was, the community college had moved since then, and getting the records from them at this point was a huge problem. \n\nSo I had to try and argue with the person in this office that they already had the information. I'd given it to them 3 years previously. \n\nAnd they said, yeah, but that was when I applied for my bachelors. This was for my masters application. \n\nIs that a different office?\n\nNo, it's this same office.\n\nSo you already have the information, in this same office, but I have to get it for you again and bring it here? \n\nRight.\n\nEventually I figured out (with no help from the people actually working there) that if I filled out one of the dozens of forms over on the wall, they would give me a full official listing of my credits that went toward my bachelors, including their acceptance of the transfer credits from the community college.

If you transferred credits, they counted as general credits, but if you needed them to be a specific equivalent, you had to jump through a bunch of hoops.\n\nYou had to have:\n\n * A copy of the syllabus, certified by the department who taught the class you were trying to get credit for.\n * A copy of your transcript, also certified by the department to make sure your grade was high enough to be counted\n * A letter from the department saying they accepted it as equivalent, and which *exact* classes it was equivalent to.\n * Some paperwork through the Dean of that colleges office, certifying that the other people knew what they were talking about.\n\nThen you had to take all that to the Dean of *your* college, and they'd give you credit.\n\nI knew what they'd do. They'd go down that list, and tell you you needed the first thing you didn't have, but not all the other things you also needed. So you'd go and get the thing they said you needed, and you'd get it and come back, and then they'd tell you the *next* thing. I'd have had to go to the department in charge of the class like three times, with three different sets of paperwork.\n\nBut I was wise to their tricks by then, and I looked up what I needed, and got it all done before I went to my Dean for the first time. I walked in, and I said, \"I need these courses to count toward this degree requirement.\"\n\nAnd the secretary did *exactly* what I thought she would, with just the sort of dismissive sneer that would have been completely enraging if I hadn't planned ahead.\n\nBut I had, and I pulled out each document just as soon as she asked for it, and got all the way to the end without missing a single one, and then got to watch while she had to fulfill my request *right then*, without being able to run me around at all.

        "selftext": "\\[Edits at the bottom.\\]\n\nThis happened to me, circa 2004. Warning: This story is NOT funny. Malicious Compliance of a different color. Changed my life for the better. Still gives me chills.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nWorking McDonalds Drive\\-Thru. No speaker. Two order windows and a third pickup window. Charles is working Window 1. I'm working Window 2. Charles is black, ripped, tall, huge, has prison tats all down his arms, somewhere between half an ounce or two of fat on his body. Picture Terry Crews with darker skin and black tats to the wrists. Charles is equal parts charming, soft\\-spoken, humble, and ambitious. He knew where he had been and was determined to change his life. Probably one of the best men I'll have ever met.\n\nEnter Green Minivan...\n\nWe had both taken orders at the same time and mine was long gone. Charles' order was taking FOREVER. Probably 4 minutes just taking the order before payment. I come over to check on Charles. Before I get close I notice he's blocking the frame of the window so I can't hear anything. It's an awkward position for him and blatantly obvious. He moves his hand out to me out of sight of the van and gives me the stop sign. \"Back off.\" Got it. Time passes. Manager on duty comes out to check the issue. He waves her off. She protests, I tell her to wait and see. Something is deeply wrong.\n\nSuddenly, Charles points the van down to the other window and LEAPS into action. Slams the window, shoves past us without a word, and races to the third window. Manager and I look at each other, check for other cars \\(none\\), then follow at a distance. Manager had been running the order but Charles took over and personally handled every part of the order with the speed of a madman and quality of a 5\\-star restaurant. He grabs a new batch of fries. He has the cook triple check each burger. He breaks a cardinal rule of the store and shows the van all the kids' meal toys we have for personal preference. Drinks and condiments are handed out and Charles gives them a genuine smile and enthusiastically thanks them for being customers. \"Have a great night. We'll see you soon.\"\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nCharles waits until they are out of sight before returning from the window and visibly shaken, walks back to his register. Manager starts to fuss about an explanation she's owed but Charles just says he can't yet. His legendary zen calm is severely damaged. After a few minutes to get a drink, wipe the sweat off his face and compose himself he opens up. Van had rolled up. Charles had greeted them with the usual: \"Welcome to McDonalds, what can I get for you this evening?\" and his winning smile. White father driving waits for Charles to finish and with a loud sneer had turned to the wife and for all to hear said: \"You order, Hun. I don't talk to N\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*s!\"\n\nWife turns to the two young kids, probably 8 and 10. Impressionable. Learning. Watching. They had locked eyes on Charles. They'd seen his tats. They'd listened to the hateful otherizing of 'those people' from birth. Charles decided that he had it within him to reach for something better. Father be damned, he's long gone. Charles decided that he had a message for those boys. The wife patiently and sheepishly took the excrutiatingly and needlessly complicated order from the father and then had to speak past him to Charles. Same for the kids. Light mustard. Three pickles. Etc. Perfectionism.\n\nCharles reached down inside himself for something that neither I nor the manager possessed and he gave the wife a genuine smile as he whipped out the order. The father knew he had been served a dish he thought impossible to serve. It was served with kindness and compassion and a compliance that defied everything he'd told them about 'those people.'\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nThe kids both waved to Charles from the back of the van as the father pulled away. They liked their new friend.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\n\\[Edit: \\-Wow. I'm deeply honored at the responses this got. I was thinking a few hundred might see it and say it was neat.\n\n\\-Thank you for the gold. I'm honored to be a witness to what Charles did and to honor his story.\n\n\\-It really happened sometime between 2002 and 2004 in Arlington, Texas. The dates are fuzzy because I was a dorky college kid \\(17\\-18ish\\) and was dealing with lots of other issues at the time.\n\n\\-Here's a Google StreetView from 2008 that shows the store as it was. The layout was weird. Window 1, Charles' register for ordering, was facing West. Window 2, dorky college me's register, further down the curve of the building facing SouthWest. Window 3, pickup food and drinks facing South. [https://goo.gl/maps/pA4aGK8oW272](https://goo.gl/maps/pA4aGK8oW272)\n\n\\-For those that have asked what makes this MaliciousCompliance, I've had \\~15 years to think through it all:\n\n1. The stated intent was for Charles to be forced to serve them in a degrading and humiliating manner. The spirit of the order was goading and baiting Charles with an impossible task. Racist, Asshole Father \\(RAF\\) wanted Charles to slam the window in his face. Simply DOING HIS JOB was a slap in the face of the request. Ergo, Malicious Compliance.\n2. RAF had thought he was clever by making his reprehensible statement, but what he'd also done was write a check that his wife was forced to cash. RAF wouldn't dare sully himself by deigning to speak with one of Them, but he'd ordered his wife to do his dirty work. By taking the order, Charles was humiliating RAF and allowing RAF's demand to debase his own wife in front of him. By dragging the order out 'to make sure we get it right' he made the wife add insult to injury by repeating things from RAF to her to Charles and then back again.\n3. In my mind's eye, I can picture Charles staring very intently at a sweaty, greasy RAF as Charles holds his hands out waiting for payment. I can imagine Charles gently holding her hand mere inches from RAF's face and then placing the change back in hers. You won't talk to me, therefore you'll have to watch as I touch your wife with my hands, right in front of your children.\n4. The last part of the order was also the most crucial. If any part of it had been less than perfect, the magic would've been lost. Charles made sure that nobody else handled anything for them. He was responsible for EVERYTHING being perfect. That's why he hustled. The order was made excellent by Charles doing all the work. You hate black people, yet every bite of this meal is going to be the best meal you've ever had here because I MADE IT BETTER.\n5. The RAF drove off with his tail so tucked it must've hurt. His wife had been dragged through the mud by his own demands, some black guy had made friends of his own children, and the coals from Charles' fire had been heaped onto his head, again, all in front of his own family because of his idea of being snarky or funny and racist.\n\n\\-I wish I knew where Charles was or what happened to him. I love the idea of seeing where those boys went and what impact he had on their terrible childhoods. This is Reddit though. Arlington, Texas, 2002\\-2004, Charles from McDonalds on Matlock and Sublett.\\]\n\n\\[Edit 2: I mentioned Charles explaining to the Manager, Payal, what had actually happened in a comment and included it here for closure. \\-I left out the manager's reaction afterwards. She freaked out on him and demanded to know why he did that when she was supposed to slam the window in the dad's face. He was still cooling off with a drink but stood up to his full height and stared her down. He's like 6'3, she was 4'11 and suddenly felt her size. That's when he explained that what he did wasn't for Charles, her, me, the dad, or even 'that poor woman he's got speaking for him.\" It was for the boys in the back and ending ignorance with him. \"If I had responded with anger, I'd have proved him right and he could turn to them and say 'see? They're nothing but angry N\\*\\*\\*\\*s.' I gave them a message. I might be the first black man to ever show them something better.\" \\(Severely paraphrased from 14\\-15 years ago but that whole thing is seared into me.\\)\\]",

            "Charles is by far a better person than I am.\n\nYears ago when I worked for McDonald's, I was back in the drive\\-thru booth. The crew member next to me \\(who's name I sadly forgot\\) was taking orders for the 2 lanes our store had, and I was at the window handling the money for each order. At some point, a car pulls around and a lady is driving it. She pulls up to my window, looks at me, looks into the store and sees my co\\-worker, and loudly exclaims \"Well had I known a \\[n\\-word\\] was taking my order I wouldn't have come here!!\"\n\nI don't know if my co\\-worker heard that, but I was PISSED. He was a refugee from Somalia, and working at McDonald's because he thought it was the American Dream and wanted a better life for himself and for his family. I narrowed my eyes at the lady and through gritted teeth, asked her to repeat herself because I wasn't sure I heard that right. She did. I had heard her right the first time. \"Us whites have to stick together, right?\" she added.\n\n\"No. We don't. Since you clearly don't have a shred of decency within you, you can just go somewhere else.\" I replied and closed the window, then locked it. She hadn't paid for her order yet, so I zero'd it out and informed the managers on duty what she had said and what I had done. She stood there yelling at the window for a bit, and even tried to bang on it, but I didn't budge. I didn't even look at her. Eventually, a manager opened the window and told the lady to GTFO and not come back.",

            "I grew up with blatant racism and bigotry. Rather than turning into a racist/bigot myself, what actually happened was the furthest opposite you could get. Each hateful word made me more empathetic toward the marginalized. Each off color joke made me more defensive of their character. As I got older, early to mid teens, I\u2019d push back more and more, challenging their \u2018beliefs\u2019 to the point I got into a somewhat physical altercation with my stepdad over it. Imagine a 36 yr old man in a shoving match with his stepdaughter over his racism. I\u2019m glad to say neither of my parents have a racist bone in their body today. I did my part. I re-raised them in so many ways, but this one is my proudest \u2018mama\u2019 moment. There is only a slight prejudice toward LGBT groups left that  I\u2019m working. The problem there is just a lack of education and understanding at this point, but we\u2019re almost there. What they don\u2019t know, though, is that their beloved grandchild is gay. Boy are they gonna be surprised when it\u2019s finally time for them to find out. ",

She said that I don't even sound British and that she is dating a British guy and \"knows how they act.\"\n\nSo, rather than be a mature adult, I do the very British thing of *Malicious Compliance*\n\nI need an intern to bring me some tea? \"Would you mind climbing the apple and pears and pouring me a cup of Rosy Lee?\" \n\nI started wearing 3 piece suits, a pocket-watch and a monocle I found at a thrift shop. I went **Super-Saiyan 3 British**\n\nObviously about 3 hours into the first day, my boss wants to know what is up, I tell her and she finds it so hilarious that she assigns that intern to me for *the rest of the day* I kept using odd British rhyming phrases and sayings and she would have to keep asking me to \"speak normal\" \n\nI would reply, \"But I thought you know how us British people act.\" \n\nShe quickly realized her error and we've been cordial ever since.\n\nNowadays, I keep my old red passport in my desk drawer just in case someone pulls that stunt again.\n\n**And for the record, I'm not British, I'm ENGLISH, and a Scouser at that!**",

And he very clearly had a moderate accent normally, but went full off the rails when excited or angry. He always marked the African American box. He is American by citizenship, since 1995. Welsh by heritage, as his folks were Welsh. And African by birth, specifically South African. But, alas, no box to tick for South African.  Folks would give him grief, and he always came back with asking them to explain how he is wrong. Is it wrong for someone born there, to claim being born there? \n\nCuriously enough, the only coworkers that took issue \u2026 were the white ones! Imagine that.",

Most of the other people were Australian, British, or spoke British English. \n\nThree weeks in, a couple of lads, English, showed up at the hostel. After chatting for a while, they said, \"You're from <Specific part of England>, are you?\" \n\nThey refused to believe I was American until I pulled out my passport.\n\nAfter I went home and got back to work, a new coworker asked me how long I'd been there. Turned out that she meant in the States, not at that job.\n\nI checked with some friends after that and they confirmed that I was \"talking funny\". Apparently, I had unknowingly and unintentionally developed a rather convincing regional English accent during the trip that took a week or so to go away.",
