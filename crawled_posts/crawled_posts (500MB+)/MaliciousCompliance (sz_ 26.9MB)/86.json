If we were rostered on Monday - Friday, 0600-1800, we were at one position and weekends, night shifts (1800-0600), public holidays we were at the other. We received weekly rosters to show where we were working, and the company faced heavy fines if a position was unmanned.\n\nI knew a public holiday was coming up but the roster had me on the regular Mon-Fri position. I approached my manager and explained, who said she would check it out. \n\nFurther info - I was told by our head office that I would be the manager when the old manager quit and while I was on holiday, they hired this girl (who had zero experience as a manager or on the site, where I had been on the site for 8 years and had been assistant manager), so I was not inclined to put myself out to cover her or the company. \n\nWhen I came in for my next shift, I found a note from her to 'just follow the roster', even though it was wrong. Sure thing....\n\nI spent 12 hours watching movies and doing absolutely nothing at 2.5x pay (PH rates). I literally took my shoes off and spent the day with my feet up on the desk!\n\nThe company got a minimum $10k fine for not having the other position manned and the manager got blasted for not using common sense.",

        "selftext": "Was shooting the shit with my grandma when this old story came up. Pretty mild but still brings a smile to my face. \n\nTo preface, I'm allergic (or at the very least wildly intolerant) to beans. When I was a tot, my mom tried to feed me beans a few times and within five minutes I would projectile vomit right across the kitchen floor. She put two and two together and after that, no more beans for larniebarney.\n\nSo jump forward a few years, I was around 6 - 8 yrs old visiting my grandparents for winter break. I loved hanging out with my grandfather; he'd always bring me neat things like books and logic puzzles for us to play through together. That day in particular, he had bought me new crushed velvet pajamas covered in stars and comets. I was super excited to wear them to bed and was already wearing them at the table when everything went down. \n\nDinner time rolls around and my grandfather reveals that he made slow roasted beans for us. I immediately tell him and my grandmother that I don't eat beans because they make me sick. My grandfather rolled his eyes and told me to sit and eat my dinner. \n\nNow, to be fair, I was a little bit of a picky eater, but I never would claim that the food I disliked would make me sick. I'd just say I didn't like [insert food]. Beans were the only thing I'd explicitly say made me sick. \n\nI repeat again that I don't eat beans, that my mom never makes me eat them, and that they make me sick. Grandfather starts getting mad and tells me that either I sit at the table until I finish all the beans I had been served or I can go straight to bed and expect to be put on restriction for the next few days. My grandmother tells him that he should just leave me be, but he isn't having it. \n\nThis was the only time I ever felt anything other than pure wholesome love for my grandpa. He and my grandmother finished their dinner and started to clean up while I thought about what I should do. On one hand, I could just go to bed and accept that I'd probably have no cartoon time for the next few days, but I was so mad that he didn't believe me that I refused to accept being punished for telling to truth. \n\nSo I sat there and ate the entire fucking bowl of beans. I'm 24 now and that singular bowl of beans probably represents at least 80% of the beans I have ever consumed in my life. I hated the texture, the smell, absolutely everything about what I was eating, but he said to eat them all so that's exactly what I was going to do. \n\nAbout halfway through I start feeling strange but push through it, swallowing the beans whole and washing it down with as much milk and cornbread as possible. All in all it probably took me 15 or so minutes to finish, but it felt like hours. \n\nI finish up, put my bowl in the sink, and softly announce that I'm done with all my food. I remember he patted me on the back and said \"see? it wasn't that bad was it?\" as we walked down the hall towards the bedrooms. At the very end of the hall was the doorway to his + my grandmother's bedroom, with a bathroom directly across the hall; he told me to brush my teeth while he changed into his pajamas, and that he would come to my room afterwards to tuck me in. \n\nI open my mouth to say ok and all of a sudden all my larniebarney alarms go off; I about face so that I'm facing the bathroom, try to take the few steps to at least make it to the sink, fail, and proceed to projectile vomit all over the floor, the vanity, the mirror and myself. \n\nChunks of beans and cornbread collected at my feet as I coughed up everything I had swallowed whole. The milk mixed with the beans in the most horrific way possible, making the vomit thicker and stickier. My new pajamas were absolutely ruined and the smell only made me vomit even more. I started to cry as I stood in a pool of the vilest mixture of fluids I had ever seen come out of my body. \n\nIt was so sudden and violent that my grandparents couldn't even react right away. My grandmother (who had been lying in bed but could still see everything go down) scooped me up and started consoling me. I peeped at my grandfather, who was still standing there horrified at what he had just seen, and stammered \"*I told you beans made me sick*\" in the most defeated voice I could muster. \n\nMy grandmother gave him a death glare and told him curtly that since he had pushed me to eat the beans, he could clean up the beans. She helped me shower in their bathroom and calm down, until I asked her about my pajamas. The stomach bile basically ruined them and she told me that we should just throw them away. I cried even harder. When she finally got me to lay down and go to sleep an hour later, my grandfather was still purging the bathroom. \n\nThe next morning he apologized to me profusely and promised he'd never do anything like that again. As far as I know, not only did he never again force me to eat anything I said I didn't want, he extended the same policy to the rest of his grandkids. Years later, he'd say he could still remember the stench of the bathroom that night and the disgusting sensation of scooping semi solid beans from every imaginable surface. \n\n\nTLDR: Grandfather doesn't believe that I'm allergic to beans and tells me to finish my bowl of beans or be grounded. I eat all the beans then projectile vomit all over the bathroom, leaving him to clean it up.\n\nEDIT: because quite a few people have pm'ed or commented asking why my mom didn't tell them about my bean intolerance:\n\n\"*I'm pretty sure she did when I was younger and they may have just forgotten because they never make beans like that in the first place, even as a side dish. For context, before this happened I had lived with them for six months straight at one point and we never had beans during that period.*\n\n*I definitely remember mom yelling at my grandfather over the phone the next morning saying she had 100% told them before.*\"",

Mom and dad knew it, so they don\u2019t force him to eat them. They even told the baby sitter, he has a very picky stomach and will/can only eat a selection of foods. He will let you know what he would like for lunch/dinner.\n\nWell, she cooked whatever she wanted for dinner and included green beans. He said he couldn\u2019t eat them and after some back and forth she got really angry and yelled at him to eat them or he was grounded from electronics and could go to bed (it was only 6pm).\n\nWell, he MC\u2019d with the best of them and choked them down. After he finished the last bite, he got up to put the plate in the sink, stopped and turned towards her, and projectile vomited on her from the waist down. That did not make her happy and sent him to bed.\n\nMy sister and brother in law got home at about 8:30 and asked where he was, so she explained the whole story (of course twisted to make her look the victim). My sister calls him down and asks his side of the story and he tells the truth. Well, green bean vomit is in the trash can.\n\nSome LOUD words were exchanged and they fired her on the spot.\n\nHe waved bye with a smile on his face.",

My parents thinking I was being picky (which is ironic considering I was never picky about anything) made me sit at the dinner table until bed time because I would start gagging whenever I tried to eat the brussel sprouts. Then I was told if I didn't eat them for dinner, I would be eating then for breakfast. So I kept trying to take the smallest bites possible, didn't help very much. \n\nEventually I ate maybe half but my gagging only got worse. Then I jumped up, an ran to the bathroom with my father telling me to get back to the table. I then released my whole dinner into the toilet. Too this day, I still cannot look at brussel sprouts the same. \n\nWeirdly if they are a part of a dish and like shaved into it, it's not that bad but cannot eat them roasted, steamed, grilled or any way in which they are the main flavor.",

            "I had a similar situation as a kid. I was NEVER a picky eater. There were a few things I didn't like, but I had no problem eating most foods.  \n\n\nMy parents went on a vacation, and we were staying with a family friend. That morning, I was told they were ordering Chinese food for dinner. Heck yeah! Chinese food is GREAT! My favorite! She asked what I'd like, I told her, all was well.  \n\n\nUntil I came home from school with a bad stomach ache. I got to the table for dinner still feeling like I was dying, and I sat at the table and tried to explain to Sally that my stomach hurt and I couldn't eat. Her husband started bullying me about it, how Chinese food is expensive and I'm wasteful. I told him that I let Sally know my stomach hurt earlier that afternoon, but we had no way of knowing it would still hurt by dinner time. (In hindsight, I now know that my frequent stomach aches, headaches, and vomiting as a child were all from anxiety due to being bullied so badly. I didn't get better at their house because I didn't feel comfortable there.) I said I'd still be happy to eat it for breakfast. Apparently that wasn't the right answer.  \n\n\nMy brother speaks up for me. \"Mamaleh LOVES Chinese food. If she's saying she hurts too much to eat, there's a problem. She'll definitely eat it for breakfast, though, she eats her cold leftovers all the time, the little weirdo.\"  \n\n\nSally's husband says, \"Eat it NOW or I'll take away your books.\"  \n\n\nNot my books!  \n\n\nCrying, I start to eat. I eat as much as I can, while crying. They WATCH me choke down every last bite. Everyone else had finished long ago, but they were... I don't know, trying to prove I wasn't in pain?  \n\n\nAnd then they watch me vomit all over the dining room table. All over their pretty table cloth, the centerpiece, splashing across the table onto the kid across from me... It was just a nightmare.  \n\n\nMy brother chirps, \"Maybe she should have just had it for breakfast.\"  \n\n\nSally, finally, has something to say to her husband.  \n\n\n\"Making Mamaleh puke it all up didn't waste a penny, right?\"",

I never liked the stuffing she made because she put too much sage in it for my taste so it was one of the few Thanksgiving offerings I wouldn't eat.\n\nI don't know if she was insulted because I didn't like her stuffing or if she just had a bug up her butt about it in general, but she decided I was going to eat a serving of it before I'd be allowed to have turkey, mashed potatoes and all the other traditional holiday fare.  Keep in mind that she did this in front of our relatives too (aunts/uncles/cousins).\n\nSo I valiantly try to eat the pile of stuffing in front of me, gagging with every bite, which resulted in my mom scolding me and telling me to stop being such a baby. I was too busy trying to get the stuffing down so I didn't notice that my two aunts were getting upset with my mom.  Made it to less than 10 bites before gagging so hard I puked up what I had already ate all over my plate, the tablecloth and my clothes, which in turn resulted in my mom screaming at me to go to my room and don't come out until she told me I could.\n\nI headed to my room, still covered with vomit and crying out of embarrassment and being humiliated in front of my relatives. After  I get to my room I realize that my aunts are yelling at my mom for what she did to me and that they're going home because she ruined Thanksgiving for everyone at the table.\n\nI full expected to get a whipping, or at least more scolding, but instead my mom came into my bedroom with a paper bag and told me to put my vomit covered clothes in them and then take a bath. When I got done and was dressed she brought me a plate of all my favorite Thanksgiving foods and set it on my bed.\n\nShe never apologized (She was of the school of thought that parents didn't apologize to their kids), but she also never forced either me or my sister to eat something we disliked from that day forward. If she made split pea soup, which mom & I loved, but my sister hated, she made my sister some scrambled eggs. Same thing for me when she made tuna noodle casserole, which I despise (still do).",

Anyway, he commanded me to eat the fat, and threatened some kind of punishment if I refused. At this point we had been sitting at the table for a while, and all I had left was this fat and a glass of room temperature milk. I started choking down this fat and washing it down with the milk. I may have been crying, I don\u2019t remember. I just remember how incredibly grossed out I was by it... and then I felt myself gagging, and I immediately projectile vomited all over the dining room table.\n\nI just remember feeling incredibly vindicated by the whole thing.

            "I have a kinda similar story.\n\nI was at my grandparents' house, and the way their dining room table was set up, if my dad didn't get up, I couldn't get up. I was probably 6 or so.\n\nSo we were eating dinner. I had just tried a new vegetable (broccoli I think, but it might have been asparagus). I start feeling sick to my stomach, so I tell my dad and ask to go to the bathroom. Well, he makes a snarky comment about not eating vegetables, but doesn't let me go, which is odd, since I was never the picky eater. That was my brother's shtick.\n\nAnyways, I just sit there for a little while. Then I   barfed it all back up, luckily into my salad bowl for the most part.\n\nMy dad was pissed. He hit the back of my head and went on a rant about how wasteful and disrespectful I was. My mom and my grandpa didn't say anything. My grandma said my dad's name disapprovingly. My dad didn't like that and started asking \"what?\" like he was surprised and outraged that she was calling him out for it.\n\nThey stared at each other for a little while. Then he got up to let me go to the bathroom. I didn't really feel the need to go anymore, but I wasn't going to disobey my dad, so I just waited there for a bit. There was some yelling. Eventually, I came back. They had cleaned up the mess, and we went home shortly after that.",
            "To be honest, I would have reacted the same way as the grandpa in the story. I would have just assumed the child was being a picky eater.",

Their kids grew up with all that normalized, and it only warped the way they passed it along to *their* kids.  Rather than notice just how extreme they are, Boomers are blaming the next couple generations for not being as broken.",

He wore a green jacket, matching overalls, and work boots.\n The one time I saw him in a different outfit I didn't recognized him.\n The other Grandparents was Nana and Grandpa C.

The year-rounders are mostly retired and people generally get along fine.\n\nA couple years ago, neighbors on one side built a new garage and driveway - moving their cars much closer to my existing forsythia hedge.  I love the forsythia in the spring and basically let it grow however it likes so I can have the bright yellow flowers.\n\nAlmost immediately they started complaining that the hedge blocked their view as they backed out of their driveway.  In my state, neighbors have no right to a \"view\" extending over someone else's property, and our supreme court has repeatedly ruled that as long as trees and bushes do not actually impinge onto the roadway, property owners have no obligation to trim for visibility.  I keep a 5 foot strip mowed between my hedge and the road - perfectly reasonable to my way of thinking. . .\n\nSince they have no recourse RE: Hedges, they instead complain to county code enforcement about anything else they can think of.\n\nMy brother parked his (licensed and insured) project truck on my property a while back because he was in the process of moving and needed a spot for it while he was figuring things out.  In the meantime, he was in a bad accident in another vehicle and the truck has been sitting for over a year now.  The licence plate recently expired - and I got a letter from the county with threats of fines if it wasn't removed.\n\nCue the malicious compliance:  My brother decided to sell the truck for scrap and had it towed away this morning.  This gave my neighbors their temporary victory as they observed from their deck - and nearly 6 inches of improved view from their driveway.\n\nAt least until I moved my second vehicle - a 1960 Lincoln (which is about 2 feet longer than the truck - with current plates and insurance) into that place this afternoon. . .  As a single person with more than one vehicle, I may get around to driving that old car at least once more before winter. . .",

            "A guy I work with had a old truck with a dump bed for his side jobs of tree removal. It was pretty beat up looking but it had current tags and he used it every weekend. His neighbors constantly complained about it being an eyesore and they wanted him to park it somewhere they couldn\u2019t see it. They live in the mountains, no HOA and no rules about where you can park on your own property so he just kept it where he wanted it. One day his neighbor came over and got nasty with him about it, so he painted a giant middle finger on the dump bed and raised it up so it was pointed right at their house. Maybe next time they will mind their own business.",
            "My brother lived along a stretch of highway outside of a small town where we grew up. In his yard was a old volkswagon bug, one of the old ones. He'd had it for years and had hoped to fix it up some day. He was sentimental that way since it was his first car. \n\nFor three years his neighbors along that stretch of highway complained about the old car and badgered him to move it. They complained to the county over and over again, but the county couldn't do anything. Then one year, the town annexed a part of the county and spread its city limits to include the stretch of highway my brother lived on.\n\nAfter that, they started complaining to the city about his car. The city after three months of badgering by his neighbors finally served him with a notice telling him he had thirty days to remove the car or he'd be fined $50 a day till it was removed.\n\nMy brother who doesn't like being outmaneuvered combed through the city bylaws and ordinances and learned that why he couldn't have an old junk car in his yard, he could display lawn sculptures, art, decorative masonry, etc.\n\nSo, my brother gave his kids paint and brushes, sent them out to paint the car while he raised it up so the tires didn't touch the ground and left it sitting on trailer house adjusters he'd cemented in the ground under each axle. He finished it off by having a brass plaque made memorializing the death of his first car. This he fastened to the trunk.\n\nHis kids had painted flowers and dinosaurs all over it and something that looked like a carnivorous big bird. When the thirty days was up code enforcement showed up after a call from his neighbor. They hee-hawed over it, but in the end, art is subjective. With a plaque and children's paint he'd transformed a junk car into art and because the tires weren't touching the ground and the jack stands were permanently anchored in cement and not temporary, the city had no choice but to agree that it was art and tell my brother's neighbors they were SOL.\n\nMy brother loves telling this story and describing the I-just-bit-a-sour-lemon face  his neighbors made when they found out there was nothing they could do about it.",

Rules of HOA are no vehicles with logos to be parked after 9pm or some crap.  It was like a 2 year old gorgeous truck that wouldn't fit in his garage.  So he bought a POS 85 truck rusted to shit and back, no bed, don't think it even had side windows.  His business was only like a mile from his house so he would drive there, get his nice truck out of the biz garage, and then drive the POS back home at the end of the day.

            "I have a 1967 Mustang in my driveway, but it currently doesn\u2019t run. Hasn\u2019t run for a little over 10 years actually. It was my moms, she never got around to fixing it, then just shifted that burden on to me. I never plan to get rid of it because it\u2019s way too cool, I just haven\u2019t been able to get the funds together to fix it.\n\nAnyways, a handful of people would constantly badger me about wanting to buy it, and I always refused. I never intend to sell that car basically. Well, one of the people I repeatedly turned away turned me in to the city compliance, and I got a letter in the mail saying I had 30 days to comply or they\u2019d tow it. My options were basically get rid of it, or show it could actually move (the issue is that it had been sitting for like 5 years without ever moving). Well, I read through the entire city ordinance about cars, and found that because it\u2019s a classic car all I actually had to do was block it from view somehow. Options included putting it behind a fence or gate, putting it in a garage, or, as I verified with code compliance, putting a tarp over it. I don\u2019t have a garage, and I don\u2019t really want to block my driveway with a fence and gate, so I bought a 20 dollar tarp and now nobody can do anything about it. And I\u2019m sure the view of a crappy looking tarp is way more appealing than a beautiful classic car. Side benefit is I get fewer people knocking on my door asking about it!",

But he complained to the county about all he could, including visibility from his property being made unsafe to pull onto the road. There wasn\u2019t a road/path/trail there. He wasted so much time of everybody, it was infuriating. \n\nHe decided to start having trees cut down, so I called the county because our area requires a fair number of really easy hoops to jump through to remove trees.

Legit, you fill out forms, the county makes sure it\u2019s not a specific type of tree and you are good. \n\nHe passed late 2019 and his kids were very easy to deal with and we were able to buy that little bit of land from the estate at a reasonable cost.",

        "selftext": "This little gem came not from me, but from an older guy I worked with over last winter break. We\u2019ll call him Jeff for simplicity\u2019s sake. Jeff was a delivery guy for a certain XYZ delivery company, and my job was as a holiday helper. (Basically I assisted in delivering the influx of holiday packages.)\n\nA couple days into my temporary job, we stop at a house with a pretty long, steep driveway. I do my thing and step out of the truck, arms out for the package, but Jeff tells me not to worry about taking it to the door. Instead we leave it at the foot of the driveway, near the mailbox. \n\nNot one to question it, I comply and leave it there. All the while Jeff has this huge shit-eating grin on his face as he blasts the truck\u2019s horn and waits a couple moments. Then there\u2019s movement from the house\u2019s front door (hard to see, but I can make out this tubby, balding, 40-somethings guy with a sour look on his face step out.) \n\nWe watch the guy, who we\u2019ll call Gabe, begin the long, arduous descent down his driveway, shuffling along at a slow pace. Jeff stays the entire time, grinning like an idiot while Gabe picks up his package, barely acknowledges us, and begins climbing back up his driveway. \n\nJeff calls out to him, \u201cThank you again for choosing XYZ deliveries, sir! We\u2019re proud to ensure your packages arrive safely.\u201d \n\nI can tell it bothers the fuck out of the guy, but he only flicks us off as he leaves. Jeff laughs, cranks up the truck, and we shove off.\n\nCompletely bewildered, I turn to him and say, \u201cWhat the fuck was that about.\u201d \n\nJeff only laughs again at this, in incredibly high spirits and launches into his explanation. \n\nApparently, the guy we just delivered to has had a history of fucking over the people he hires to do work for his home. (He\u2019d scammed a landscaping company with claims that the grass they\u2019d replaced half of his yard with didn\u2019t perfectly match the shade of the other half.)\n\nAt the time Jeff got fucked over, he\u2019d already been delivering to Gabe for years, and the guy had never been home (or had been home, but never answered the door.) Additionally, the guy\u2019s garage was always closed, which is important because when it rains it\u2019s company policy to leave a package just inside the garage door for safe keeping.\n\nSo one day, it\u2019s drizzling outside and Jeff delivers a package to Gabe\u2019s house. For whatever reason, the garage door is open this time around, so Jeff leans in and plops the package a couple feet from the cruddy weather. Then he goes about his day as normal. \n\nAbout an hour later, Jeff gets a call from his supervisor who\u2019s in a massive frenzy. \u201cJEFF! WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO?! DID YOU SERIOUSLY MESS UP SOME GUY\u2019S GARAGE! HOW IN THE HELL DO YOU EVEN DO THAT!\u201d\n\nJeff, taken aback, does his best to get to the bottom of things with his supervisor. Apparently, Gabe had seen Jeff deliver the package to his home, seen him lean in to place the package inside, and then claimed that he\u2019d broken the garage door. (In reality, Jeff told me Gabe\u2019s door had most likely broken and the \u201ccheap fuck was looking for some poor bastard to pin it on.\u201d)\n\nFortunately, Jeff was able to escape any personal liabilities for lack of proof. However XYZ Deliveries itself couldn\u2019t completely throw out the claim without engaging in a costly little court battle as they had indeed had a deliveryman on the premises and no proof of when the thing broke. They weighed the costs and decided on a $600 payout instead of the potential thousands it would cost in legal fees. \n\nGabe, the smug asshole, got his garage repaired for free. Luckily for Jeff, however, a small loophole in the delivery company\u2019s policy allowed him to exact revenge. \n\nThe loophole was basically this: \u201cIn the case of delivering to locations where the delivery person feels he is at risk or in danger, he does not have to risk his personal well-being by setting foot on said location\u2019s property. Instead said individual is allowed to drop the package off at the safest and most convenient location nearest to the individual\u2019s property (i.e. the mailbox or foot of the driveway.)\n\nLearning this, Jeff takes full advantage. The next package Gabe orders happens to be an expensive piece of electronics and it was marked \u201cUrgent.\u201d Even better, it\u2019s raining the day of delivery. Absolute downpours. \n\nJeff pulls up to your friendly, neighborhood asshole\u2019s place and does the same thing he did with me: Blasts the horn several times and waits. Then he places the package just in front of the mailbox, under a plastic tarp (another policy in the case of rain.) \n\nApparently Gabe really needed the package, as Jeff\u2019s horn draws him from his home and on a slow, slogging descent down his driveway. He\u2019s fuming by the time he reaches the bottom, with Jeff smiling like a professional. \n\n\u201cWHY THE FUCK DIDN\u2019T YOU BRING IT UP TO MY MOTHERFUCKING HOUSE?\u201d Gabe inquired politely as he grabbed the soggy-bottomed package.\n\n\u201cCompany policy, sir!\u201d Jeff replied. \u201cCan\u2019t set foot on a customer\u2019s property and risk further damages!\u201d \n\nGabe\u2019s mouth opened and closed like a fish as he tried to sort this out. He\u2019s completely soaked now and shivering, so he just said, \u201cGo to hell.\u201d \n\n\u201cCertainly, sir! What kind of shipment would you like for that?\u201d \n\nAt a loss for words Gabe just begins slogging back up his driveway, with Jeff giving him a couple friendly honks to send him on his way. Then he continues on with his deliveries. \n\nThe entire incident took place a couple years or so before I began helping Jeff out, but to this day, he loves exacting company policy on the jackass. I felt a newfound respect for the man after that, and the rest of my time working as a delivery aid was filled with more awesome stories from Jeff, the good-humored delivery man.\n\nEdit: A couple of you wanted to hear the other stories Jeff had to tell. Well here's one of them: [Enjoy!] (https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/6q0e10/she_wanted_me_to_make_sure_all_our_leaves_stayed/)\n\nAnd here's [another] (https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/6q11cw/when_you_order_weed_illegally_via_public_shipping/)\n\nAnd the [Final Part] (https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/6q3ib3/i_dont_mind_what_people_stick_in_their_assholes/)",

            "I had a customer like that when I still delivered mail. Lady Doctor got certified mail sent to her house fairly often, at least 1 a month or so. She almost never answered her door so I left notices for her to sign and leave in the box and I'd return with the letter the next day. Left a notice one time and she received a second certified piece the next day. I figured I'd save her the trip (she lived 2 miles from the post office at most.) and bring the letter with me from the day before. Seems the good doctor showed up to pick up the letter before I arrived at her house and wasn't very happy that I had taken it with me to deliver to her later in the day. She claimed that she had cancelled a lunch to pick this letter up and I should be properly reprimanded for a terrible decision. I took my talking to in stride and made a decision to strictly follow policy from then on. The doctor lived in a house with a windy driveway in the woods that had enough space at the end in front of a two car garage to turn a vehicle around doing a 3 point turn. Problem is, you're not supposed to back up in a postal vehicle unless it is safe to do so. Lady doctor never left room in her parking are for me to turn around so for the next 8 years any time she got anything that was too large to fit in her tiny mailbox, I left a notice and continued on my way. If she signed it I'd return the next day and leave her another notice, since it wasn't safe to turn around in her driveway. I like Jeff. ",

Please let me know if this isn't allowed and I'll delete it. \n\nThe cinema I worked at had a no outside food and drinks allowed in the theater rule. This was to boost sales of the food and drinks sold in the cinema. We (the workers) would usually let people in anyway if they brought snacks or whatnot as the snacks and drinks inside were ridiculously priced and the manager was cool as well. \n\nThe only time this rule was actually strictly enforced was when the general manager (GM) made his rounds fortnightly. In this case there was a store room where we would keep the customers stuff and give it back when they left. \n\nThis one time a guy around late teens comes in with his kid brother with a 2L bottle of coke in his hand. The GM was unfortunately there that day and was staring right at me so I had to ask the guys to leave it behind. They said ok. \n\nCue malicious compliance, the rules stated that outside food and drinks couldn't be taken into the theater where the movie played, not the facility itself. Dude comes out with his brother in 15 minutes and asks for the drink, I take it out, they each take a sip, give it back, and go back inside. They did this every 10 - 15 minutes and disturbed the other patrons and interrupted my work (I was happy to comply) and after they did this about 4 - 5 times the GM told me to just give em the bottle when they came out next and I DID!\n\nHonestly one of my favourite moments of working there.",

The sweet popcorn from the store is way too sticky and big for our vacuum cleaners.And with only popcorn, crisps, M&M's and Skittles you won't get a huge mess like macaroons smeared out all over the carpet and chairs, or tapas, or a 2 litre cola bottle.

Maybe some other licences. AND THAN the cinema needs to pay it's workers.\n\nJust think about that the next time you visit a cinema or a small local bussiness.\n\nI always say: I know it sucks, and I am very sorry.

We eventually persuaded her it wasn't worth her while to call security on a middle aged couple.)\n\nHe agreed that the prices were outrageous, but explained theatre finances. When the studios released a new movie, the theatre showing it would only get 10% of the profits the first week. Second week was 20%, third week was 30%, up to 50% for a long-running movie. With multiplexes, the number of movies which run for more than a few weeks is pretty small, so the theatre is making very little of the box office profit.

            "Long ago, in the before times, I was a hapless high schooler. \n\nAnd, for some class or another, we had to write to a local official about something in our town. Naturally, I wrote about the biggest deal back then; the movie theater that had just been opened, after a year or so of construction, back when I was in middle school. \n\nThe mayor wrote back, and included two free tickets to the theater. Which, as a brainless high schooler, meant I thought my letter had been so awesome that it made him send his secretary out to get them for me (and wasn\u2019t until many moons later that I realized he likely had a giant stack of the things that he put in everyone\u2019s reply letters). \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until after I\u2019d used up those tickets that I realized he\u2019d included even more valuable knowledge inside the reply letter itself. \n\nWhen getting the theater built in our town, he\u2019d included a rider which stated that, for the first ten years of operation, outside food and drinks were allowed (as long as they weren\u2019t sold by the theater). \n\n\nAnd so, blatantly armed with this letter\u2019s information and the brashness of teenagerhood, I bought a foot long subway sandwich, and marched through the doors with it. \n\nNo one stopped me. No one stared. No one said \u2018boo\u2019. \n\nMwa-ha-ha-hah! Ultimate power was mine!\n\nSo that became my routine. Buy a huge subway sandwich... or some Taco Bell... or in-n-out double-double...

Nowadays I\u2019m totally *not* encouraging you crazy kids to theater hop and see three or four movies in a row, once restrictions have been lifted in your area, *wink wink*)\n\nLife was good. Life was sweet. All throughout high school, and early college, I enjoyed my outings to the movies. Being a bit of a jerk, whenever my friends were amazed at how I got away with *blatantly* marching my subs past the line, while they got stopped for trying to smuggle in a coke can in their cargo pants pockets, I\u2019d just smirk at tell them it was because of how awesome I was. (It was my secret knowledge, dagnabbit!)\n\nBut, alas, all good things must come to an end. Nearing the end of my college daze, I came down on a random weekend, and... *SHOCK! GASP! SURPRISE!* ...I was stopped at the door by the pimply-faced teen, declaring \u2018no outside food, sir\u2019. \n\nI attempted to assert my dominance, pulling on my inner Karen, demanding to know just when, exactly, this so-called rule was put in place. He called over his manager, and she told me it had always been the rule, and pointed to a (suspiciously new-looking) decal on the front door. \n\nDefeated (there was a sign, people! A *SIGN*!), marched back to my car to dispose of the illegal food... nah, just kidding. I broke it down into two six-inch subs, and hid each one in the lower-calf pockets of my cargo pants (as was the style at the time). \n\nBut, later, raging at the injustice of them changing their policy, driving away a loyal customer of these past ten year... Wait...\n\nI suddenly realized... it had been ten years since that theater had opened. And the mayor had only negotiated the policy to last for... right, ten years. Have a cookie. \n\nThere was likely some manager there, with a countdown calendar, just waiting for the day she could slap that little decal on the door, and dash out hopes and dreams to shreds. Well, that, or it popped up on some corporate lawyer\u2019s To-Do list, and a letter got sent out, and nobody really cared but me. But still... the Injustice!",

        "selftext": "My brother and I aren't on the best of terms. I envy people with good relations to their siblings, because being around my brother is just draining. He seems to follow two very strict rules. The first is that he's always right, even when evidence is presented against him. I swear the guy has developed immunity towards logic and reason. The second rule he follows is that I'm always wrong. Whatever I say, he has to argue against. It's obnoxious. Luckily we no longer live in the same contry, so we see eachother at most two times a year which is barely tollerable.  \n\nThis story takes place in december last year. I had traveled to my parents to celebrate christmas, and so had my brother, his wife and his two kids, 2 and 4 (maybe 5) years old. All of us are staying in my parents house. As you can immagine, its rather crowded and the noise level far exceeds that of which I'm used too.  \n\nOne morning, I wake up around 8am. My brother and his kids are already awake and eating breakfast from what I can hear. I decide to browse reddit on my phone an hour, just to avoid more interaction than I have to.  \n\nWhen I finally decide to leave bed and have breakfast, the my brother and his family has moved on into the TV-room. The TV is on and they're watching cartoons on YouTube.  \n\nI make myself two sandwiches and join them. My brother hands me the remote and says; \"Just put on whatever 4yold is pointing at. I need to go to the bathroom.\" Alright, I can do that. Unlike his father, the little guy is actually pretty cool to be around.  \n\nWe browse child friendly Youtube videos eventually settling on Barney the Purple dinosaur. My brother has by this point returned. Eventually the video ends and related videos pops up. 4yold is pointing at a video called \"Scientifically accurate: Barney the Purple dinosaur\". I've been browsing enough internet to know that that is not a child friendly video.  \n\nThe conversation goes as follows:  \n\n4yold: \"Uncle, please put that one on\".  \n\nMe: \"I dont think that's a good idea. How about another one?\"  \n\n4yold: \"But I wanna see that one!\".  \n\nMe: \"I...\"  \n\nMy brother interrupts me.  \n\nBrother: \"Put that one on, he wants to see it.\"  \n\nMe: \"I really don't...\"  \n\nBrother: \"Put it on.\"  \n\nMe: \"Trust me, it's...\"  \n\nBrother: \"For gods sake, just put it on.\"  \n\nMe: \"Alright, but this one's on you\".  \n\nI mentally prepare myself for the total shitshow that is about to go down as I place the remote on the table.  \n\nNo more than 15 seconds into the video, the first images of cartoon gore is displayed. The 2yold starts crying. The maternal instincts of my brothers wife kicks in and she starts yelling at my brother to turn it of. By this point, the video has reached the point where kids are starting to get killed. Brother finally manages to turn the video off. The 4yold, having seen forbidden content, is now throwing a tantrum over not getting to see the entire video. Brothers Wife does her best to comfort the 2yold, but she's crying her eyes out. Meanwhile, my brother is trying to end the tantrum of the 4yold. \n\nDespite the mayhem, all I can feel is total inner peace. Never has utter chaos been so satisfying.  \n\nFinally my brother turns to me; \"Why would you put on that sht?!\".  \n\nIn a calm voice i simply reply; \"Because you told me too.\"  \n\nBrother: \"But you knew what it was?!\"  \n\nMe: \"And you didn't litsen when I tried to warn you.\"  \n\nBrother: \"You never tried to warn me!\"  \n\nI sigh. At this point I just leave. There is no winning this arguement. Afterall, he's always right, even when the evidence is screaming otherwise.",

        "selftext": "In 1969, my dad graduated from Rice University with a 5-year master's in chemical engineering. (Edit, since so many commenters seem to think he was some kind of rich kid: his parents both taught public school, and he went to college on a full academic scholarship.) The Vietnam War was raging, and although he and his classmates had all received deferments during their studies, their deferments were over and it was time for them to go before the draft board. Most of his classmates weren't worried, because they were slated to see the Houston draft board, which had a reputation for handing out continued deferments like Halloween candy. However, my dad is from Oklahoma, which meant that he had to be evaluated by the Tulsa draft board, which was much, much stricter.\n\nDad had applied to the chemical engineering PhD program at Stanford, and had been accepted with a full stipend. He was excited to go, but first he had to get past the draft board. The Stanford faculty wrote a letter to the Tulsa draft board, explaining that Mr. Hammer would be embarking on a research program that would greatly benefit the war effort and asking for another deferment. The Tulsa draft board wrote back in short order: Mr. Hammer had already benefited from the only deferment he was going to get, and thus he was to present himself to the Army physical examination center post-haste.\n\nDad was sad to lose his shot at a PhD, but not too sad, because now he could marry my mom. He'd also had several job offers already, so he accepted an offer from Exxon and he and my mom got married. His superiors at Exxon wrote another letter to the Tulsa draft board, explaining that Mr. Hammer was now gainfully employed in the oil and gas industry, where he would be conducting engineering research that would greatly benefit the war effort, and asking for another deferment. Just as quickly, the Tulsa draft board wrote back, reiterating that Mr. Hammer was not going to receive another deferment, and that if he didn't hurry up and get his Army physical, they might have to get the law involved.\n\nDisappointed, my dad went to his Army physical as scheduled. He's always been a healthy guy, and he performed just fine on most of the examinations, up until the very end, when they measured his heart rate. It was over 100 beats per minute. \"Well, we can't pass you with that,\" said the Army doctors. \"But you're probably just nervous. Come back in two weeks and we'll give you another physical.\"\n\n\"Nervous?\" said my dad to himself. \"I can work with that.\"\n\nFor the next two weeks, my dad spent every spare moment basically teaching himself the opposite of meditation. He'd close his eyes and think of the most horrifying mental images he could, trying to drive his heart rate as high as possible. Finally, the day of the physical arrived, and things went much as before. He passed nearly everything with flying colors, but when the time came to measure his heart rate, once again it was well over 100.\n\nThe Army doctors promptly diagnosed him with tachycardia, scored his physical 4-F, and sent him home. He's in his 70s now, and apart from his mysteriously high heart rate (which I inherited), he's always been in great cardiac health and still is.",

            "My dad was super skinny. He got the letter and reported for the exam. Of course, he was underweight. They told him \u201cI tell you what, if you sign this paper we can get you into a special program and put the weight on so you\u2019ll be in top fighting shape\u201d. \n\nHe said, \u201cYou mean if I don\u2019t sign this, I don\u2019t get to go to the special program and don\u2019t have to go to Vietnam?\u201d\n\n\nHe was on a pretty strict diet to maintain his svelte figure until conscription ended.",
            "My dad found himself in a similar situation (school deferments ended) and got a bad draft #.   During his physical, the doctor asked him when he'd broken his neck.  My father said that he hadn't - but in describing to the doc a motorcycle accident he'd had a few years prior, it seemed that the crack medical team overlooked a fractured vertebrae.  So no malicious compliance, but a big fucking surprise and no Vietnam.",
            "My grandfather had a similar experience with the draft board- except he survived polio, and two weeks before had surgery on his lower body. So when he showed up \u2018before the law was involved\u2019 he was in a cast, arm crutches and my 5\u2019 grandmother toting two children behind him to help open doors. \n\nLol",

The guy handling was 20 something, buff, appeared to be in the picture of health. It was odd he was here and not in Viet Nam. \n\nCurious, I asked him why and he giggled. \"Look at my feet.\" I did; he had to be six feet, and I was a 5'2\" woman ... and his feet were the same size as mine. Then he explained he passed the draft physical easily until the doctor saw his feet. 4F. It didn't hinder him in his diving career whatsoever. He was a NAUI instructor.",

There were a lot of guys having trouble with jungle rot in Vietnam (basically your feet get wet, never dry out and, yeah, not pretty). They had found those with flat feet had it way worse.",
            "My dad had a similar experience in Chicago. His blood pressure was so high they assumed he was taking something to fail the physical. He was  simply nervous and had an immediate jump in BP. They locked him up for fours days and checked his BP each day. After day 4 they let him go and he started taking meds to control his BP better. \n\nI have the same issue. No problems with my BP but in suddenly intense situations it jumps quickly. A standard response but ours is just exaggerated",
            "I knew a Vet who told me that he spent his time training for this, and then that, followed by something else, etc.  He'd figured out that he wouldn't be sent to combat if he was going through a training program, so he made sure he was signed up for specialized classes for his entire four years.  Apparently, he'd implied that he was going to make it a career, so the leadership happily kept him out of the combat (for the time being).  He noped out asap.",
            "My dad said they heard a wheeze in his chest and said come back in 6 months so for all that time he smoked 4 packs of unfiltered Pall Malls a day. \n\nWhen he came back the wheeze was worse and he got 4F.",
            "Glad for your dad. I was in high school when the VNWar began. When friends returned from their tours each one said the same thing to me: If you can stay outof this war Fucking do everything in your power to do so. I went for my physical and sat and watched as the 3 or 4 docs examined each guy. One doctor was especially painstaking while the others where one,two, three. When that one doc was open I jumped my place to him. The doc said it's ok to the Seargeant  standing there who wanted me to sit down. Even though I had played college football  a week or 2 later I received my 4F. The war was so unpoular that a few years later my brother got a 4F without going to a physical!",

            "My grandfather actually passed the physical and was told he had a week before he was going to be shipped out. He was living in Oakland with his parents at the time. 3 days before he was supposed to leave he was sitting on his porch taking in the view and didn't see these 2 guys across the street trying to break into a car. Well one of the guys thought he had seen them because  my grandfather was looking in their direction.  So they shot him. He got 1 bullet in the leg and never got shipped out. And everyone in the family is glad he didn't go because his cousin came back in a bodybag a month later.",
            "My dad did something like this. Showed up after a four day lsd binge. No idea why he didn't pass the psych evaluation.\n\nEdit: I am going to add to this a bit due to it creating a discussion.  My father had graduated Berkeley and was accepted to grad school for psychology. He had received one deferment. His father had fled Germany to avoid being drafted in WWII. So my family was anti war and anti draft. They concocted the plan. Four days of coffee, whiskey, weed and LSD. My father showed up and was unable to fill out the paperwork. So he took up the unfilled out forms and said he was a  conscientious objector. They interviewed him and the interviewer was smoking. So my dad just coughed.  The guy then blew smoke at him and he coughed more. My dad was actually quite fucked up and didn't really have to act like he was. So they tell him he can't be drafted and was unfit. My father refused to leave though. He threatened to jump out the window. MPs were summoned who dragged him out the building. He sat out front till they called a cab with instructions to take him to the County lunny bin. Once in the cab the driver just took him home. So ends my father's draft experience.",
            "I used to work with a guy who had a pretty amazing get out of the draft free card. He had a low lottery number, meaning he was pretty much the next up, when someone set fire to his draft board office. His records were among those burned, so no trip to Vietnam for him!",
            "My uncle went to Vietnam. His actual unit was out somewhere, so he got stuck in a camp for a while.\n\nThe smell was so atrocious that he, being the son of a general contractor, decided to put in a septic system, to kill some of his voluminous spare time. (and while he was working, he didn't get put on details!)\n\nA week or so later, some general officer came through the camp, and was there for a while, and while walking through the center of the area, he stopped dead: \"that's it! It doesn't reek like shit! That's what's wrong!\"\n\nSo the commander explained about my uncle, and the general told him, \"bring me that soldier.\"\n\nAnd that's how my uncle spent his entire tour in Vietnam building all kinds of shit for a general, rather than fighting in the jungle.",

            "A guy I worked with told me the story of how he got out of the draft; He and his bestie had to go to MEPPs the same day. He brushed his very long hair over his face and sat picking at his nails and glancing furtively back and forth, mumbling to himself. He got out on a Psych waiver. His bestie took a different approach; he dosed himself with LSD and started tripping in the processing center. Unfortunately he did NOT get a waiver and left immediately for camp Pendelton, which means he was still tripping when he reported for Marine Basic Training, talk about a bad trip!",
            "My dad got drafted, and somehow wound up in a whole unit of wise asses. This was in 1968, so when they finished their basic training and they were asked where they wished to be stationed, they all knew damn well they were headed to Vietnam. But because they were all wise asses, without consulting with each other in advance, they all put places like Lichtenstein and Lithuania as their answers.  It was a BS question and they all knew it.  \n\nOne unit was sent to Korea instead. Guess which one it was.",
            "My brother-in-law was a serious bullshitter and also an air force brat. He knew all the Military Brat Mind Tricks.

            "LOL reminds me of the urban legend from my area. A week or two before the army phisycal exam, these two guys decide they wanna be exempted from the army service. So a week or so before the physical, they embark on a diet of coca cola, as in 5 liters per day. The only food they had was the occasional McD or similar junk. \n\nOn the day of the physical you're supposed to show up super early without having eaten anything. Of course they down the largest cola bottle each right around the corner from the recruitment centre. \n\nAs the legend goes, they did well on the fitness levels, but when the results of the urine and/or blood test came out, they were deemed as unfit and got referred to a doctor to check for diabetes. \n\nNot a doctor myself, so not sure how true this is, but the story is 30+ years old \ud83d\ude01",
            "My dad had very flat feet as a kid. His parents took him to an orthopedist who recommended physical therapy. So for a couple of years while he watched tv he picked up marbles with his toes and transferred them between buckets that way. It worked and he had pretty healthy feet. \n\nWhen he dropped out of college he knew his number could get called any moment. He went to the the public pool and every day got on the low diving board and jumped down onto the concrete repeatedly to flatten his feet. It worked. And the war ended before his number got called. \n\nHe wore cowboy boots almost constantly and swore that kept his feet from hurting. As a result of the childhood PT he had crazy strong toes that he could pinch hard with. One of my cousins wouldn\u2019t walk into a room he was in if he was barefoot.",
            "My dad got lucky. \n\nHe'd done most of the first few things- deferment for college, and even went to basic training, but he knew he'd die there, so to get an exemption he had done a bunch of research about how they choose and figured out that it was down to *one person's* judgment in some office to sign off on his not going. He didn't know if he would be able to convince that person or not but it was down to that. \n\nWhen he walked into that office that very person was his first-grade teacher, who obviously didn't want him to die either. When he graduated basic, he said they were reading out the assignments: \"Republic Of South Vietnam, Republic Of South Vietnam, Republic Of South Vietnam, Clearwater, Florida, Republic Of South Vietnam, Republic Of South Vietnam...\"",
            "My dad got out of it too. He has the phenotype of long lanky string bean. Minimum weight for army 6ft tall was 132. My dad did not know about that before hand and weighed in at 129.",
            "He's lucky, that's around the peak of Project 100,000. It was a push to get more people drafted by lowering the mental standards of who could get drafted, so mentally challenged people with the intelligence of 3 year olds that had no idea what the concept of war even was got sent to battle. \n \nThink the Vietnam part of Forrest Gump mixed with Full Metal Jacket. Needless to say a lot of people were sent to their death and the other soldiers who were tasked to baby sit them were put at significant risk. A lot of them were deemed to dangerous for themselves and the other people around them to carry weapons. There is examples of them accidentally killing people in friendly fire too of course....\n \nIf you thought the Vietnam war was shitty before....",

So the army didn't want him.  It took about nine months of him working at it diligently but it did finally pass off and by the time I can remember, my dad had a fully functional right hand.",

            "I was a grad student working at Oak Ridge National lab in the early 80s. One of the stories someone a few years older than me told was of another grad student (from Vietnam era) who looked like he was going to lose his deferral. One day his research advisor took him on a \u201cshortcut\u201d at the Y12 facility and made sure he saw nuclear warheads being assembled\u2014and knew what he saw. It wasn\u2019t in an area they\u2019d ever been before. When he got to his draft board hearing and they asked about what he\u2019d seen at the lab they decided he was better off staying home for some reason \ud83d\ude09. My friend said they later found out that this particular advisor took \u201cquite a few\u201d grad students on the same detour.

He didn't have prospects for a PhD or industry job, and given that he was certain to be drafted* he enlisted with the language corps (they suggested maybe he could learn French - lol). Of course he was slated to learn Vietnamese (despite being a bit tone deaf) but surely there's no way the war would still go on long enough for that and then get deployed.\n\nIt was, of course, but at least he got to listen to radio transmissions in a fire base rather than getting sent to the front lines. Never had to fire a gun, but hearing their evacuation plan for when things started to fall apart was \"march to the sea and hope you can flag down a ship\" was a little unnerving, as was Nixon's assertion that there were no American troops north of Da Nang. \n\n*It turns out, he may have been able to get a 4F. Dad didn't know it at the time, but he was colorblind and had flat feet. It wasn't certain, but with a sympathetic doctor he may have been able to get out of it. It ultimately worked out as he avoided death, dismemberment, and trauma, and the GI Bill got him started in a law career, but he still very much would rather not have gone.",

He ended up being a door gunner on a helicopter in Vietnam. Came back alive somehow. Got shot at least once.\n\nHe is a crazy, eclectic individual.",

Two days later, the CMO disqualified another guy for \"overdevelopment.\" The CMO described the guy as dragging his \"stuff\" behind him like a tail, when the applicants had to demonstrate the ability to duck-walk. Based on this disqualification, he also proposed a rule requiring all male applicants to wear briefs instead of boxers. His proposal was denied. This issue became a lengthy conversation with my commander, as the CMO never disclosed any medical specifications regarding over or under developmental disqualification.

So she was pissy about me getting to be at work AND take it easy. Always loved pissing her off.",

Basically told them it\u2019s not my job to write them a personalized letter each time when my priority is to help their employee be pain free and if they want a personalized letter each time instead of them making a sign in sheet or is giving them a copy of his check in sheet they can pay me directly. \n\nEmployers need to not waste people\u2019s time.

I texted my boss back and was like \"I can't get an appointment for 5 days - so I'll see you in 6 days with my note.\"\n\nShe never even asked for my note. \n\nI'm a manager now and I tell me employees not to even say why they're calling in.

I dragged myself to the clinic. The doctor said she wanted me out for a few days and asked how long I could take off reasonably. I said 2 would be fine.

I wasn't going to get an appointment that same day with a doctor on such short notice, especially for just a cold, so I mailed back that I would get an appointment for the next day, so I wouldn't be at work that day either.

I was away for two days, and on my return found that I had an email (to my work email!!) on my first day of leave requesting a certificate. \n\nNo problem I said, and immediately booked in with my doctor (on work time now too). I was still feeling crap, but I\u2019d made it in anyway. \n\nWent to doctor, they gave me rest of week off too. So work now lost me for five days instead of just the two I was absent originally. Plus, and this was my favourite part, I then got to make an expense claim for the full cost of my doctor visit etc. See, legally they can request a med certificate anytime, but prior to 3 days absence it is at the employers cost.

I called, supervisor bitched me out etc. As I was hanging up the phone I heard her make a snide comment to another worker about me. Really? Doc suddenly \"discovered\" a reason to give me the rest of the week off. Naturally I would not be available for the presentation and the team had done zero work. Supervisor called demanding my passwords.... I told her hold on, secretly conferenced in the HR director .... after her demands I interrupted and told the HR director I would be happy to send him copies of the entire presentation . Yes.

She said it was too late because she thought she heard me say P5, which is pho. I was puzzled.  \n\nShe came back a few minutes later with a bowl of pho. I said that wasn't what I ordered. I'm not a jerk though so I considered just eating it anyway but when I found out it had \"soft tendon\" in it I said no. (That's standard Vietnamese food and I'm sure it's fine but I'm not that adventurous.) I didn't want it. I asked her to bring me what I ordered and she refused. She said she could pick the soft tendon out of it but I was like, nah. I just want what I ordered. \n\nShe would not bring it to me.   \n\nI said, \"Okay. That's ridiculous but fine. I'm just going to go to Chipotle next door,\" and I started to walk out.  That was when the owner yelled across the restaurant that I could not leave without paying. I told him I was not paying for food I did not order and did not eat. A big scene ensued. I told him he could call the police if he wanted but that I was not paying.   \n\nThere was a bunch of commotion and the male owner went in the back with the waitress to supposedly \"review the video\" of me ordering. I heard him screaming -- absolutely screaming -- at her and felt really terrible for her.  Meanwhile the female owner came again to tell me I had to pay and I said I would not.  \n\nThe owners' teenage daughter came over to talk to me and she completely understood my point. She said the waitress is new and obviously screwed up the order because she had written down that I wanted extra fish sauce, and that definitely does not go with pho so it made no sense. Anyway, the daughter understood that even if it actually had been my mistake that's not the way to treat a customer.   The daughter tried to do the right thing but her parents would not let her. Her father ended up yelling at her too. She seemed used to it and it didn't seem to bother her. Poor girl. She even tried to make the problem go away by saying she would pay for the soup with her own money and tell her parents I had paid for it, but I wouldn't let her do that. She is a sensible, reasonable girl who really tried to smooth things over. (Five stars for her!)   \n\nSo two cops showed up. They interviewed everybody -- with straight faces, which was really amazing. They called a supervisor to find out what to do and then explained to the owners that I did nothing wrong and did not need to pay. Yup. I knew that.   \n\nHere's the saddest thing about it: I really liked the food there but I will never go back. I was a semi-regular customer too. I visit about once a week, so they lost all that business because they wouldn't eat the cost of a $12 bowl of soup.   Bye-bye Huy.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-huy-alexandria-2?hrid=MmU99hXcljpcF_NrZQoDrQ&utm_source=ishare&utm_content=review",

I would've just shrugged my shoulders, ordered a breakfast item, and then requested a refund through the app later. Imagine getting this bent over $5.",

            "Do you not realize that you didn't pay the restaurant, you paid into an app. They can't refund something they didn't receive payment for. This isn't even malicious compliance, this is wasting a police officers time, and being rude to food service workers. Smh.",
            "The thing is the employees were being disrespectful to a customer. \n\nIf it takes calling the police to fix this so be it. It is bullshit that the manager couldn\u2019t resolve this the way it ended with out the police involvement. \n\nThe manager should be fired for his/her actions.",
