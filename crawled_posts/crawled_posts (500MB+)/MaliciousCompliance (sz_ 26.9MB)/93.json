        "selftext": "I work as a cashier at a Commissary, a military grocery store. The way we handle proof of membership is by scanning the customer's I.D. card at the cash register. We have the ability to bypass this for workers who aren't in the military, but only for items that will be consumed on site. Now that the background is out of the way, on to the story.\n\nOne slow day, I decided to go on my scheduled break a few minutes late, as we had most of our cashiers out on break already. As soon as we had enough back that my coworkers wouldn't be unduly burdened by my absence, I close up and turn in my till.\n\nApparently, the cash office disliked this as she started to mutter about us taking breaks whenever we liked. Now I'd like to point out that not only did we have 6 cashiers just come back from break, we only had 3 customers in the past hour. Additionally, if we didn't handle breaks ourselves we would have to leave work early or accrue overtime, and Lord help you if you got so much as a minute of OT.\n\nNow being the nice guy I am, I ask if she wants me to open back up. She then spends the next 5 minutes ranting about how we just come to work to take breaks and we don't follow directions. Finally, she takes my till and I go on my break, but she'd really pissed me off due to some accusations of lying during her rant. Still, there isn't much I can do, or so I thought.\n\nCome the end of my shift, who should I see but that same cash office teller with a cart full of groceries in my line. I wait for her to unload all of her groceries before I ask for her I.D., she says she left it in her car and I should just bypass it. Since I had just been ranted at about my work ethic, I stand firm. I never would have expected what happened next, but the memory still warms my shriveled heart.\n\nShe starts going through the 5 stages of grief! I've chosen a few lines from each stage, but they lasted an average of 4 minutes each. \n\n- First stage is denial, \"oh, you don't really need my I.D. do you? Stop playing.\"\n\n- Second stage, anger, \"my husband served in the military, of course I have my I.D.! Who do you think I am!\"\n\n- Third stage is bargaining, \"please, I know you do this for other workers, just do it this once.\"\n\n- The fourth stage is depression, \"do I really have to walk all the way to my car to get my I.D.?\"\n\n- And finally, after 20 minutes of alternatively ignoring her and citing policy, she reaches the last stage, acceptance, and begins loading her groceries back in her cart.\n\nTL;DR teller rants about workers not following directions, unable to buy groceries because she can't either.\n\nEdit: So I got front page, didn't expect that. Thanks everyone.",

        "selftext": "As a school principal, one of my responsibilities is to solicit parents to join the parent advisory council. In fact, it is written into law with specific regulations as to composition, frequency of meetings, etc. One of the requirements is that the meetings have to be held \"at a time convenient to parents.\" A decade or so ago, I was principal of a small, rural high school that was in a town that served as the hub for a larger area. Most parents of the school worked in town but lived out in the countryside, some as much as an hour away. Because of this, the only way to get parents to attend meetings was to hold them right after school at 4pm. Parents were either done work themselves, or could make arrangements to dip out a little early, attend the meeting, and get home at a decent time. Particularly in winter, this was important as it was pretty dark and snowy on the rural roads.\n\nPartway through the school year the district hired a new superintendent who had oversight of the high schools. She had come from a large, urban school district, and didn't fully understand or appreciate how a rural school district worked. At our first meeting with all the principals, she asked each of us for a summary report of school operations, including parent meetings. I dutifully submitted mine as requested and forgot about it.\n\nA few weeks later I got a call from the superintendent. We chatted, got to know each other a little bit, and then got down to the reason for her call.\n\n\"I see from your report that you hold your parent meetings at 4pm?\" she said.\n\n\"Yeah, it's the best time so that everyone gets home at a decent hour,\" I said. \"A lot of people up here have long drives home, myself included.\"\n\nShe took this to mean I had scheduled the meetings around my personal convenience.\n\n\"Well, when I was a principal, I always held them at night so more parents could attend. I think you need to start holding your meetings later.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't think parents will attend . . . \" \n\n\"No, no, the meetings have to be open to all parents and held a time convenient to them,\" she insisted. \"I think you should start at 7pm to make sure all parents have the opportunity to come.\"\n\nNow, in a big city school, this works fine as most families live within a short drive. But the boss is the boss. \n\nCue Malicious Compliance.\n\n\"Ok, not problem. Say, why don't you attend the next one to introduce yourself to the parents?\" I offered. She immediately agreed, and I sent the calendar invitation for a month hence at 7pm.\n\nMy school was located about a 90 minute drive north of the administrative offices where the superintendent worked, and she herself lived about an hour's drive south of it. She was in for a long day.\n\nThe day of the meeting rolled around, and the superintendent arrived at the school around 6:45 pm in anticipation of the meeting. She brought doughnuts and cookies and I supplied coffee and water. I had set up the library with a big conference table and seating for 30.\n\nNo one showed. \n\nI suppressed the urge to say \"I told you so.\"",

        "selftext": "A bit of background. I worked for a really small company straight out of undergrad with about 3 employees and the owner. My degree was in engineering, but I wound up doing procurement, fabrication, welding, machining, shop management, site management, safety, etc on top of my engineering duties. Overworked and undervalued. I will say that it was good experience for the rest of my career. Side note to you prospective engineers: an engineering degree is among the few where grades in college do matter and significantly affect your prospects for your first job. I chose to not focus entirely on my studies and paid the price with this shitty job for 3 years. \n\nOnto the compliance. A big part of this job would be that I was out of town on a job site anywhere from 2-4 weeks a few times a year. Toward the end of my time with this company, the fact that I knew I was leaving soon (got a business graduate degree now) really empowered me to not back down on a lot of things. Around this time, my 1st child was on the way and sure enough, a job was scheduled near the due date. The owner, while he had a lot of shortcomings, understood when I told him I would not be going. However, he refused to keep me on my regular salary while they were gone. There was plenty of work to be done so it wouldn\u2019t have been a vacation. He instead insisted he would pay me on how many units of a certain part I produced while they were gone. Inventory was low and we actually did need the parts. Fine by me if that\u2019s how you want to play it. For the 2 weeks they were gone, I only came in about 4 hours a day 4 days a week and busted out a ton of these parts. Ended up costing him a substantial bit more to pay me his way and a lot of other things that I did for the company were put on hold during those weeks. Should have paid me my salary, dude.\n\nEdit: For everyone asking, no the owner/boss was not trying to give a baby bonus. He was hoping to pay me less. I was there.\n\nAlso, my statements about GPA speak in general terms of what students in similar situations will experience on average, not individual paths. I\u2019ll leave it at that. I stand by what I said. Thankfully GPA drops off immediately after the 1st job. It\u2019s a great way to redeem a lackluster college effort if you put in the work. \n\nThanks to everyone for the awards and comments! Very interesting to read everyone\u2019s experiences.",

            ">\tSide note to you prospective engineers: an engineering degree is among the few where grades in college do matter and significantly affect your prospects for your first job. I chose to not focus entirely on my studies and paid the price with this shitty job for 3 years.\n\nSide note to your side note - in those three years, you probably learned 10x what the smart kids learned at their fancy jobs. That kid with the 4.0 who went to GE to work on jet engines? He spent the next three years designing cowlings for jet engines. That kid who with the 3.9 who went to GM? She spent the next two years designing trunk latches for the Chevy Cruze, until they decided she was competent enough to move up to designing belt tensioners for the 2 liter four cylinders. The smart kid with the 3.85 who went to Exxon? He spent the next 3 years poring over P&IDs and writing SOPs for benzene processors. That smart kid with the 3.8 GPA who went to Intel? She spent the next three years as a quality engineer on the fab line, analyzing doping defects in 8-inch silicon wafers.\n\nBut you, my friend, you learned everything there is to know about running your own shop. Once you get your PE license, you can hang your own shingle and start your own company that puts your old employer out of business. Or you can find a better shop or even a plucky startup, and become the Director of Engineering, while all those smart kids are still climbing the ladder as Engineers, Grade 3 at JumboCorp.",

I was told that I was chosen because they wanted someone who was more personable than their higher GPA candidates. \n\nThat being said, if you're out there and able to get a 4.0 AND build people skills, good on you.",

I do them in 6 minutes a piece but being able to run both OPs at the same time makes it essentially 3-4 minutes a piece. That job makes $300/hr now and a typical order runs for 2 days. \n\nBut normally you'll find me taking my time trying new things reprogramming the same part for the 5th time because I want to try something different.",

As an engineer myself and having dealt with recruitment and spoken to a number of managers and engineers about new graduates GPA is the last thing anyone cares about. \n\nYou can have a great GPA and be bad at the actual job,  or a bad GPA but a great grasp of the real world and how things go together. GPA has no correlation at all with expected work performance. \n\nThe only time I could see it mattering is for large/ multi national companies who need to hire 50 graduates at once and HR needs to cull a few hundred applicants.",

        "selftext": "20 years ago my brother lived by himself about an hour away from where my mum & I lived (I'm much younger than my Bro, so was still a child while he was a late-teen). We lived in a rural area, while my Bro was in the nearest city. Whenever my mum had need to go into the city, she would pick him up and they'd just spend time together. \n\nHe had a really bad habit on these occasions, to wait until she was already there and then get out of bed, shower, get dressed and then meet her outside for them to go do whatever they were doing that day, either errands or shopping etc. This process would take anywhere from 10 minutes to half an hour, which would eat into the time mum was willing to spend in the city. \n\nOne day mum arranged to see him, and he just said 'okay just text me when you're here.'\n\nThe next day, she texted him 'I'm here' as she was leaving her house - an hour away from my Bro.\n\nSo my Bro got up, got showered & dressed and went to stand outside, looking for her car. After waiting for about 15minutes or so, he finally rang her to find out where she was parked.\n\n> Mum: \"Parked? I'm not parked anywhere. I'm still driving.\"\n> Bro: \"But you texted me you're here.\" \n> Mum: \"I am here. You're there. I will be there in about 15mins. Are you ready?\" \n> Bro: \"Yes, I've been ready for 15minutes and waiting outside for you!\" \n> Mum: \"Oh good. I won't have to wait this time. See you in a moment!\"\n\nOn that occasion mum was able to get on with her day immediately. In the future, my Bro did end up being dressed in time for mum getting there, but he is still perpetually and habitually late to this day 20yrs later. We still talk about this text every time Bro is late tho.\n\nSuper late edit: I'm getting the same comments/questions over again, though I wasn't expecting this to gain so much traction (who does?) Just wanted to address these specific repeated comments:\n\n\"Your brother might have ADHD/Time blindness.\" He's capable of being on time for things that have a time limit (like work, appointments etc) but when it comes to social engagements where time is just a concept not a set thing, he's terrible at. We've just learned to live with it over the years. Thankfully he was on time for his own wedding, though that was mostly to do with his groomsmen more than anything tbh. Also, ironically I am the one who is currently being tested for ADHD so maybe he does and it's a family thing? Idk.\n\n\"Texting wasn't a thing 20 years ago.\" First of all, yes it was. Lots of Americans are coming on here and saying it wasn't in the USA, which I wasn't aware of. I was given my first phone in 2001, and it had been used by my mum for 2 years prior to that, and I had it for another two to three years afterward too (yay Nokia!). Besides - not expecting people to be so exacting, I was intentionally inaccurate with the time. This incidenet happened at the very least 17 years ago - which would've been 2004ish. I'm pretty sure this happened around 2001-2002 sort of time, just going by where my brother was living at at the time.\n\n\"This isn't malicious/This isn't compliance.\" Mum followed my brother's instructions ('text when you're here'), without following what he meant ('text when you're geographically close to my location'), with the intention it would inconvenience him in the same manner he'd been continually inconveniencing her (making him wait while she was 'ready' to begin their excursion). I'm pretty sure that is both malicious and compliance. Thanks!\n\nHope this clears some things up, and thank you to those people who've given awards to this small story. I appreciate it!",

An hour later, I start prepping for dinner since she hadn't shown up yet. Then I get a text saying she just left her house. She lives 5 minutes away so there was no point in starting dinner anymore. We didn't eat until after 10 that night. \n\n\nI learned my lesson. Next time I'm still making dinner on time, we'll probably be able to finish eating in that 5 minutes in \"my mom's time\".",

Enquired with co workers and no one got paid extra. We went to management and they came with \u201cwe are on salary, we don\u2019t get paid extra for working extra\u201d bullshit.\n\nCue the MC. They requested workers for the following Saturday and everyone declined. They missed a lot of deliveries. Same for the next Saturday and the next. By the 4th time we were all called in to a meeting. They told us we do not have a choice, we have to work. One of the guys said no we don\u2019t, our contracts state Monday to Friday and for weekend work they have to request. We don\u2019t get paid so we do not have to accept. They say they will schedule us for Saturday and if we don\u2019t come to work we will get a warning. Meeting dismissed. \n\nThe following morning was chaos. The labour dept was at the office and wanted to speak to the drivers. Long story short, we had a lot of very stressed out managers, we got back pay for the Saturdays worked and all of us got put on hourly meaning 5hours extra pay a week. It was glorious.",

He f\\*cking flipped that we weren't doing anything, but the manager had a talk with him and since there is no way to force people to do OT, he had no choice but to leave us alone.

The teacher was out of the classroom for a bit, and someone asked me for the answers. Now I had secretly hated this kid for almost a year because he had destroyed my $210 phone and only payed me back $20 and said \u201chopefully this will be enough for a screen protector\u201d.So anyways it turned out he had skipped a question, so he accidentally had about 75% of the questions answered in the wrong box, making them all wrong.  He asked me to erase them for him so he could copy my answers because his arm hurt. I was just about done with mine, so I finished it and erased his, but instead of giving him my answers, I turned my paper in. He now had 5-10 minutes to answer about 30 questions. The teacher then walked back in while he was pleading with me and asked what was going on. I told him that David was trying to copy my answers. No regrets.\n\nEDIT: getting a lot of comments about how he broke my phone, so here\u2019s the story, I\u2019ll try to keep it brief.\nWe were at a youth group that our church does (I\u2019m catholic) and I was scrolling through all my photos to show one to my friend. I scroll past one of David looking very.. less than good. Friend starts laughing and tells me to go back to that picture, so I do, and he starts dying laughing. a few more people came over to see what was happening, and one of them was David. He sees the picture and just snatches my phone out of my hand and runs into the bathroom. I\u2019m banging on the bathroom door, and telling him \nTo give me my phone back. He runs out of the bathroom while i\u2019m screaming at him and holding  onto his arm. Then he just slams my phone into the ground. The [screen](https://imgur.com/gallery/eDX5sJT)  was completely shattered and the home button didn\u2019t work.\n\nEDIT 2: people are now calling me a bully, but I have a few more things to say about David.

It was a scan-tron so we had friends tests that were already graded so we had all the answer key. We actually memorized just the letters of a 30 question test by rhyming them to a song before class.  \n\nNow I was terrible at Chemistry, hence the cheating, but I knew just enough to answer the easy questions.  I realized right at the beginning that our test had an extra question so all our answers needed to be shifted down one question.  I was busy figuring this out and my friend stands up to hand his in.  HE HAD ANSWERED EVERY QUESTION BY MEMORY IN LESS THAN 2 MINUTES.  I didn't even get a chance to warn him.\n\nAnyway, I took my time and got one wrong trying not to be obvious.

My computer neighbour asked me what it was and I told him, so he asked for a copy, so I passed the disk along.\n\nThen I actually read the students assignment, and it was bad. It was just a list of dot points about the assignment, which would be barely enough for a C. So I deleted it and wrote an essay. After an hour I was done and handed it in.\n\nThe next class the teacher came in looking mad as hell. She went on a long tirade about how disappointed she was and that all of the cheating students would get a note home. 16 of the 20 students in the class had done the copy it and pass it along to the disk. I just sat there stunned. The teacher asked who found the disk and started the whole mess and my computer neighbour ratted me out as being patient zero for the cheating epidemic.

Before the start of a new unit we did a pretest, exactly the same as the test at the end of the unit. We graded them ourselves but were only supposed to mark them off and not write the right answer next to them. Our teacher checked to make sure we didn\u2019t do that, however, when marking them off with a diagonal slash I would put a tiny dot at a different part of the slash to show what the correct answer was without it being noticeable to my teacher. We would receive our practice tests on the day of the real test to copy over our right answers only, assuming we already knew those ones. I copied over the dots into dots in the corners of each number to show the answer as ABC or D. Then when the test started all I had to do was pretend to take the test when really I was just writing out the letters I had already marked with dots. I did this the whole year and didn\u2019t get caught.

The teacher was very free with the extra credit too, and once told me (when I complained that I had a 108 on a paper, when it should have been a 112), \"if I took all the points you have over 100, and gave them to any other person in this class, they would still be failing.\" Anyway, at the end of the year, he gave us all the option to find out what we would need on our final in order to pass the class. He was going alphabetically, calling out names and letting them come up to the desk, where he would tell them privately, and skipped me. I asked him about it when I realized I had been passed up, and he said, where everyone could hear, \"you dont even have to show up for the final.\" \n\n\nOf course, not being a person that could drive, and with nobody to give me a ride, I didnt actually have a choice on whether or not I attended to final. It was the last one of the year, and I was beyond burnt out, so i completely half assed it. Tried on a few questions, guessed on most, some I changed my answer to make fun patterns on the scantron sheet. \n\nAfterwards, a group of 4 kids came up to me and thanked me for coming to the final. Turns out they were specifically copying off of me in a line (girl next to me copies mine, girl next to her copies hers, and so on). Oooops. I didnt know them very well, but I know the one I had mutual friends with ended up in summer school.",

We had to write a long resume on a textbook and burdened with other work a couple of us decided to do a couple of chapters each and then combine our work personalising them before handing them in not to get caught. I (and one of the others) early realised that the quality was clearly not on the same level with all of us so after sharing was done we redid most of their parts and edited our own parts too. That was good, we passed while the other 3 or 4 (it was 20 years ago) had chapters that were all the same with only minor changes like where they had line-changes an a few synonymous. Was a bit in disbelief when afterwards one in the group asked why we didn't fail too, when they were told to rewrite everything except the parts that we did most work on, they weren't only failed because of the copying but because of the poor quality (that we spotted and changed). I bet the teacher knew that there were more people involved, my fellow students didn't rat tough, actually they were really good guys, just not really motivated for that course.",

We had cheat sheets hidden EVERYWHERE in that science room by the day before the test. We were set! Everyone had worked really hard, even if it was to cheat lol we were all going to pass. \nWe get to the final. Everyone gets in the room and gets settled.

Kettle had to be removed within a week.  Our reply was that there were no burns since we had the kettle, and the nearest kitchen with hot water was 2 floors up and the other side of the building, and that it used a water boiler.  It would take extra time to make drinks and then have to carry them down the stairs where accidents could easily happen.\n\nHealth and safety said that it was their way or not at all.\n\nWe relented, and the kettle disappeared.  My boss said that it was only a matter of time until someone trips or slips on the stairs carrying a tray of hot drinks.\n\nDay 3 after the kettle went (AK).
