        "selftext": "The Customer Is Always right, right?\n\nThe was the attitude of all upper management at the company I used to work for. Despite us warehouse workers having the entire system down pat... the customers who would pick up their goods always seemed to know better.\n\nAt first it was small things:\n- telling us how to bag a lounge properly, as they watched and corrected us\n- demanding that we open up an item, exposing it to the dirty elements in the warehouse , then throwing a tantrum and expecting us to clean that item we just unwrapped and re package it\n\nWhich became bigger things like customers abusing us if we wouldn\u2019t load up a product, or hurry up with unloading something... usually resulting in an injury for one of the warehouse workers.\n\nNaturally I would always try and reason with customers, which would result in customer complaints, which resulted in the Area Manager realising a company wide email detailed that-\n\nIn every scenario we could imagine, we had to do what the customer said.\n\nEspecially when it came to picking up their goods at either a store or warehouse.\n\nThe email finished with a morale boosting statement that - if any feedback or complaints against a worker involving correcting or contradicting a customer made it\u2019s way to the AM , that worker would be written up with an official warning.\n\nA few weeks later we had a transfer from our interstate warehouse, included in that transfer was a stack of customer pick ups.\n\nI signed off on the transfer paper and the sales associates began calling customers and organising pickups.\n\nMost of the pickups go smoothly until we get to the douche with the white pants , or white pants McGee (WPMc).\n\nWPMc rocks up in a battered flat bed truck.... with his polo with popped collar and his slicked back hair.\n\nHe scans the warehouse and clicks his fingers at me.\n\nI reluctantly walk over and he stares at me expectantly.\n\nMe - yes sir ?\n\nWPMc - you have my sofa\n\nMe - are you picking up sir ?\n\nWPMc - well I won\u2019t be picking anything up... you boys are going to load it.\n\nHe chuckles as he says this.\n\nMe - well sir, as the sales associate would have told you, warehouse staff are unable to load anything up, and it\u2019s the customers responsibility \u2014-\n\nWPMc - ( cuts me off ) yeah yeah yeah I\u2019m sure your manager would be pissed knowing you cost them a $9,000 sale\n\nI sigh and check the paperwork... this guy has a four seater sofa bed... heavy, cumbersome, and will definitely be too big for the vehicle he\u2019s selected.\n\nWPMC see\u2019s me checking the paperwork and smirks\n\nWPMc - just do what I say and it\u2019ll be easier for all of you\n\nMe - and what would you like us to do?\n\nWPMc - load it up, and I\u2019ll take it from there \n\nMe - okay sir, just sign the paper work\n\nWPMc signs off on the pickup and that he\u2019s taking responsibility for transporting his goods.\n\nMyself and four other guys grab this monster of a sofa and load it up with a little difficulty.\n\nI make an attempt to see if this guy needs any more help and he snaps at me -\n\nWPMC - I got this chief. Let me do my thing.\n\nI shrug. \n\nThe guy \u201csalutes us\u201d jumps into his car, without strapping anything down.\n\nI go to stop him and offer him some straps. But he slams the car into drive and begins driving at break neck speed towards the exit area and towards the main road.\n\nMe and the boys watch, holding our breath as the jackass takes a turn at full speed, the sofa kicks up a bit, slams into the side of the truck. \n\nWPMc slams on the brakes as he nears the main road, the sofa kicks up, hits the roof of the truck and flips off, hitting the gravel road hard.\n\nThe warehouse erupts in laughter, as a sales associate rushes out to see what the commotion was.\n\nA few minutes later the AM is on the phone wanting to know what happened.\n\nI politely explain that the customer asked us to load up and only load up... and that he was happy to take care of the sofa once it was in the back of his truck.\n\nThere was a pause and I also happily pointed out that I could bring the signed off / completed customer pickup form to the AM\u2019s office.\n\nAnother long pause and the AM said ... don\u2019t bother \n\nIn the end... the sofa was damaged and there were no repercussions as we did exactly what the customer instructed us to do ",

I was undoing the packaging the way the box instructions said to, stripping it down from the top so that the bases stay on the ground, you have to cut the box in the corners and then pull the styrofoam off.\n\nhe says dont unpack it like that because then if I move I wont have the boxes any more. turns out he was laying the speakers on their front and pulling them out the bottom. I saw immediately why the tweeters on these $28k speakers were \"damaged in shipping\", the speakers weighed something like 260 lbs each and he was balancing them on the tweeters (through the styrofoam) as he slid them out.

            "What's dumb is that you eventually reach a ratio where \"cost of purchase\" vs \"delivery and/or installation\" is so overwhelming that not getting complete service is dumb.\n\nIf you are getting a $60 microwave and the extended warranty is $30, that's stupid. But if it's a $1500 stove and the warranty is $50, why not gamble with house money?\n\nEven if he rented his own truck to transport it, you're still getting into the cost of actual delivery. And if your company doesn't offer delivery and install (which I couldn't imagine, but anyway) there are still people out there who are bonded and will do it for $200. \n\nIf you look at the appliance analogy, 50% for a warranty doesn't make sense. But 3% or even 6% makes a ton of sense because it's very little in the grand scheme of things and you stand to lose much less than the person offering the warranty.\n\nSame logic with delivery. Paying $200 to have a $300 IKEA couch delivered is stupid. *That* goes in your flatbed truck. Paying $200 to have a $9000 sofa is a brilliant deal - it's just 2% of the overall cost. ",

        "selftext": "One day at work for my lunch break I decided to run around the corner to McDonalds.\n\nThe drive through was packed so I decided to just go inside. There was a homeless fellow out front who wasn't asking for money, but some food. I could tell he was legitimately in a bad way so I told him \"Yeah no problem man, sit tight and I'll bring you a couple McDoubles.\"\n\nI ordered 2 for me and 2 for him, and as I'm waiting for our order to be called I noticed an employee had gone outside to pester him and tell him he can't be there and has to leave, etc. I go out and explain he's waiting for me, I was going to bring him some food. The worker adamantly stated that he cannot stand out front because it's bothering other customers. Well I wasn't about to let them run him off because he's hungry and actually about to get some food.\n\nSO, I decided instead of taking my food back to my office, I'd go ahead and eat in the restaurant, with my new friend as company. Like 2 minutes later our order is called, and while we ate we had a nice chat. He told me about why he's homeless and why he doesn't trust the shelters here etc. After we finished eating we both left the restaurant and parted ways, never saw him again but he seemed like an alright guy.\n\nTL;DR Bought a homeless guy lunch, the staff didn't want him waiting outside for it, so I brought him inside as my lunch guest.",

            "Never told this story until now. My spouse and I were visiting Portland Oregon over a long weekend. We were walking around downtown and came upon a homeless man asking for money for food. Well we were also starving so I asked him what he\u2019d like for food if he had the money, \u201csubway\u201d, he said. Alrighty not my first choice from a tastiness perspective but I asked him if there was a near by one and we walked there. I gave my order, then my spouse gave hers and when the gentleman began giving his the employees started giving him a hard time. I\u2019ll admit I sort of pulled a mini Karen and loudly said , \u201c Excuse me this gentleman is with me so anything he orders is on my bill.\u201d I told him to order whatever he wanted. I think he got like 2 foot long subs, some cookies and a drink. We sat down and ate together for a while. Found out the reason he likes subway was it doesn\u2019t hurt his teeth and it keeps longer. We said our goodbyes and he couldn\u2019t stop thanking me. That part felt uncomfortable. I didn\u2019t like being thanked for doing what I thought was the bare minimum. Anyhoo that was the story of how I met this nice guy in Portland and had dinner with him.",
            "There was a homeless man who lived mostly in the bus shelter across the road from a school for kids  (12 to 16 year) . His clothes were black, his skin was filthy and sometimes very very red as if he was having a bad reaction to something. Locals left him bedding, food etc.. He was polite but didn't like adults much.\n\nThe council would spray clean the shelter and throw all his possessions away.\n\nThe local story was that he used to be the headmaster of the school. His house burnt down, killing his wife and children. He couldn't bare to be in a building after or too far away from looking over the school.\n\nA new family moved into some posh houses near by and made a big thing of getting him moved on. The council tried and the community turned on the council, local paper did a piece on who he was and his shelter was filled with new bedding, flasks, boxes of food. Community wanted him to stay in his shelter, he was one of them.",

            "I worked for mcjerks once. I used to work overnights. As i was leaving One morning i saw this poor fellow afraid to go in because he's homeless and not buying food.  It was below zero with windchill, it was 6am an he's nestled against the side of the building trying to stay out of the wind.  I said nope. \n\nBrought him inside, and told him he was allowed anything he wanted.  He was very hesitant to even order a hashbrown or coffee.  I asked him what he liked to eat,  and when he wouldnt tell me i asked him if he liked this and that, he mumbled yes.  So,   I ordered him a slew of food. If i recall almost $30 in food, including pies that he could eat later. Then i got him a gift card for another 20 and told him it's not much,  but he's now a customer and they couldn't kick him out today.  Id seen some customers order a coffee and occupy a table for all 8 of my hours and my mangers were cool and didn't care if someone ordered or not. Just no harassing others.\n\nI never did see him again.  He looked ready to cry and i hope he's doing OK.",
            "I used to work as an advocate for people with disabilities.  We helped them find any type of resources needed, in home health care, benefits,  employment if wanted, etc. \n\nI worked mainly alone in my office, when I wasn't traveling.  The building was in an area that has a large homeless population.  I always kept snacks and drinks in the office and cheap cigarettes for the guys that frequently came through the parking lot.  Well, management had a fit when a new man showed up, he was well into his 70s, was pretty bad off, and I befriended him like I did the others that stayed in that area.  They called my parent office and complained that I was allowing \"non clients\" into the building.  Actually, I was giving out water and protein snacks in 105 degree weather.....you know, being a human.  They said that only clients could be inside. Ok, since all we required was someone to say he or she had a disability,  no other proof, that was easy.  I made all of them clients and helped them with goals.  \n\nAs of today, 5 years later, 5 are still in housing I helped them obtain.",
            "I had a similar situation at a McDonalds a few years back. He was in front of me in line and we started chatting about sports and what not. Didn\u2019t even know he was homeless at first. Ended up sitting down with him for a bit. One of the nicest most genuine people I ever met, was in the military and afterwards was living in NO when Katrina hit and ended up homeless. Never asked for a thing the whole time seemed like he was just glad to have a normal conversation for a change. But he never stopped smiling and speaking positively about his situation. \n\nI ended up giving him some of my food before I left and promised him I would bring him some home cooked food later that week. Sadly I looked for him several times where he said he usually hung around but never saw him again after that. I hope he\u2019s doing well.",
            "I used to live close to a shelter. The neighbourhood did not like that the shelter had opened there, as it attracted homeless people. I always just greeted them as fellow human beings, nothing special.\nOne night when walking my dog I felt I was being followed, so I went to the closest safe place: The people standing near the shelter. Half the group stayed with me, the other went to talk to the guy following me. Just a quiet word, but the guy sped off and I never saw him or his car again.\nI changed my route to always go that way, never felt safer.",
            "It's regrettable that people treat the homeless with such disdain and it, often, weighs on my conscience and heart to see people who have more money than I do just treat them like they're nothing.  I don't make much money, but I'm always happy to help someone in need when I'm able to.  It's bitten me in the ass a couple of times, but I don't pass off my scraps or my ear for some sort of benefit.      \n\nThat said, I will roll my eyes when someone gives me a story that is obviously bullshit, like \"my car is out of gas down the road and I need some money so I can get to....\".  I've heard that one a few times, even from the same person.  I'm a lot more willing to part with my dollars if someone is honest with me.  I remember the dirtiest, smelliest homeless guy I've ever met asked me for some money to get some booze.  At some level, I felt bad for enabling him, but I gave him $20 because he was keeping it real.    \n\nRegardless, I generally don't carry cash anyway, so I have an actual excuse to not give money, but I generally offer to buy some food or alcohol at a nearby fast food place or restaurant when the opportunity is presented.  Hell, I think the last interaction I had with a homeless person was about a year ago and I gave him the socks I was wearing since it was a cold, wet autumn and his shoes were just beaten to a pulp.      \n\nPoint is, it's good to be a bright light in a weary world and I'm glad to hear that someone else is like that too.",
            "During college I worked at a hobby shop and was allowed to give folks discounts if they were good customers etc at my discretion. There was a young nerdy husband and wife who were really into magic the gathering, this come in later. Anyways one day this homeless guy asks if he could sweep or wash windows for a few bucks he was hungry. I remembered the husband and wife worked at the buffet just a few blocks away and had their number for an order that came in. Was able to work a deal where they got a nice discount homeless guy got a free meal there a couple days a week and he insisted on working he would sweep wash windows etc. Helped him find so.e social services through a local church.",
            "I lived in a less than great neighborhood.  Apartment block across from a strip mall.  I got to know all the people that worked the roadway in between.  Crazy shit, they had a hierarchy on who worked which traffic light.  I'd often pick up lunch for them.  Real good folks.  Some mental illness, criminal histories, etc among 'em.  Got to know 'em all by their street names.\n\nOddly enough, I went to buy some beer after an all nighter, so I'm carrying a case at like 9am crossing 8 lanes of traffic.  One of the regulars runs up like he's asking for change and is like \"Yo, my man, you got 2 cops looking at you, don't look up.  They in <vehicle>, be safe, brother.\"\n\nAfter that, I knew every criminal activity within a mile.  Can of soup was a small price after that.  Those dudes didn't even have a cell phone, but they could pass news faster than Google.  No lie, I learned that Prince had died from one of them before it was on the radio.  I thought he was crazy and talking shit.  Get home.  Breaking News!  \"Prince Dead at 57!\"\n\nHow the actual fuck.",

            "I LOVE THIS.\nWhen I lived in SF I had a favorite street guy. He was always nice and idk I think I saw him enough that I just wanted to help him. Never gave him $ like he asked but always always a fresh cigarette. I lived in a pretty nice quiet area. Ended up seeing him completely across town at a kinky adult festival and we recognized each other and said hi. My friends were very confused I had a hobo friend, he was confused by my not so work attire outfit, and I was confused that he was so far from the neighborhood. But after that, im a firm believer in knowing the homeless in your area. They are apart of our community too.",
            "I was at a Whataburger with my dad one day when I saw an elderly guy in a wheelchair struggling to get in the door so I go across the entire restaurant and open the door for him. He looks at me and says \u201cI bet your dad was a military man, must be coast guard, right?\u201d Which my dad was in the Coast Guard....so he followed me over to our table and talked with us for a few before asking to buy him lunch which I graciously accepted to do. I go to the counter and order for him and the manager comes up and asks me \u201cnow did Gabriel the Angel of God over there ask you to buy this, you don\u2019t have to if you don\u2019t want to\u201d but I told him I don\u2019t mind and paid for his meal. Over the rest of our meal with Gabriel, he continued to say things that shook both me and my dad. Even though he was as vague as a fortune teller, he was still  saying things that were actually relevant to us.

            "I remember working in Berkeley, CA which had a large 'gutter pubk' population. One group of them sat outside a fast food place and were lucky to get 1 meal a day.\n\nThen a rival fast food place came out with a kid's meal toy, a very desirable one. They were short in supply and selection in the Bible Belt, where my Pok\u00e9mon obsessed brother lived. He wanted me to buy as many as possible and mail them. \n\nSo I found the homeless teens. I explained the situation to them, and told them I'd buy them as many of whatever kind of kid's meal they wanted, but I wanted the toys. They were thrilled with this arrangement. Especially since it gave them an excuse to hang inside for the hottest part of the day. \n\nAnd that's how I got two dozen toys to my brother without having to eat or waste any fast food.",
            "This reminds me of a situation i had in a shopping centre when i was 19. My approach to money has always been if someone needs it more than me then it is on me to pass it on. The world is full of money ill make more or come across more in my life. Anyway i was in a relaxing area at a shopping centre in hornsby australia and a guy my age came and sat down completely distraught. He calls his mum begging her to let him stay with her tell her he has been clean for 3 months and she isnt believing a word of what he is saying. Then out of no where he passes me the phone and asks me to tell her that he is in the shopping centre because if she doesnt believe him maybe she will believe someone who is with him. In the end she hangs up on him and i just see this broken man in front of me. I get up walk to an atm and withdraw my last 50 bucks and walk back to him and hand it to him and gave him a hug. I have never seen him again but the last words i said to him is advice ill give to everyone. Sometimes people just need a break. And when you can see that they do pass on the helping hand that someone gave you.\n\nIf you are out there dude i hope you patched things with your mum and are still clean.

            "This reminded me of a homeless man who used to come into my old workplace, a pizza shop. He had a shopping cart and I\u2019d see him all over town. Whenever he\u2019d get enough money, he would come in to buy pizza and a soda. We never let him pay. He was well spoken and polite and never seemed to ask for money or anything. \n\nOne morning, the flower shop next door had some stuff stolen from outside. The police came to take a report and when the man walked by, she pointed him out as if she was sure it was him. None of the stores had outside cameras, so she was definitely making an assumption. My GM walked out there so quick to defend him for how he always brings money to pay for his food. I\u2019m sure the local police knew him anyway, and hopefully never had issues with him, but they let him walk away and I was so happy.",
            "Yo, I\u2019m glad you had a good experience with this, but I need to warn you, and others inspired by you, that many homeless people are turned away on purpose, and that minimum wage workers turn down panhandling for good reasons.\n\nI worked at a popular coffee shop, and we weren\u2019t allowed the right to deny service, cause everyone was welcomed. Well, one guy decided that he didn\u2019t like one of the girls, so he took his boiling hot coffee and threw it in her face. Lovely, sweet woman that had BOUGHT him coffee several times before.

He took me up on it. \n\nPicked him up in the Benz the next day with lunch waiting on the heated seat. The man was literally in tears before we could get his bags in the trunk. \n\nWe chatted all the way over while he enjoyed being in charge of the iPod.\n\nI saw him back on the coast not even 3 weeks later.

        "selftext": "When I was a freshman in college I had a maths teacher who was very strict about how she taught and how she expected us to learn. For example, she would force students to take notes and if they didn't she would make them leave. \n\nDuring our midterm exam, someone asked how much time was left and she said 5 minutes. At this point I was only about halfway done with the test, so I rushed and finished it barely in time. Me and most other students delivered the test and left the room. When I checked my phone, I realized there was another 20 minutes left. The students who hadn't finished in time told me that after we left, she realized that she read the clock wrong, and gave them another 20 minutes that me and the others didn't have. \n\nI've always been pretty good at math, but obviously, after rushing half the test I didn't get a good grade. The part I didn't rush was perfect though. \n\nThe next class, after showing us our results, she said that we needed to develop a strategy to improve our grades. She said that if we created a plan, stuck to it, and provided evidence of us doing it, she would give us some extra credit. What she expected us to do was say something like \"I'll practice every week\" and submit pictures of us doing it as evidence, or something like that. \n\nNow, while I didn't blame her for reading the clock wrong, I did blame the fact that I thought I only had 5 minutes left for not doing well on that test. I was confident that I could have gotten a perfect grade on it if I had the extra 20 minutes. And so, what I said I would do is \"bring a watch to the next exam\".\u00a0 Was it an arrogant thing to say? Yes, but I also thought it was stupid to follow along with her plan to micromanage our studies. She got mad at me and said that if I didn't do anything else I would fail the final for sure, but I assured her that the watch was enough for me to do better. \n\nA few months later, on the day of the final, I submitted a picture of a watch on my wrist as my evidence for sticking with the strategy. I got a perfect grade on the final. Since my strategy for improving my grades worked, she had to give me extra credit, not before arguing that I didn't deserve it, of course.",

I\u2019m a lot more math phobic than you are, and I was taking a stats course because it was recommended for my major.

Well my account wasn\u2019t working; my credentials weren\u2019t being accepted and neither I nor my aged professor (he was in his 70s) knew how to fix the problem. I had to contact the publisher and they were no help. The IT department told me to contact the publisher. For the entire semester I couldn\u2019t do any of my homework\u2019s and my test grades were suffering as a result. By the end the professor gave me enough extra credit to bump me up a letter grade because it wasn\u2019t my fault.

        "selftext": "I used to work for a marketing company that serviced small and medium-sized businesses across America. It was a multi-billion dollar revenue company. The CEO was a true rags to riches story. He joined the company right after he got out of jail in his early 20s for a small drug charge and worked his way up over 20 years to eventually become the CEO of the company.\n\nThe CEO strongly believed that the success of the company did not come from the brilliant and intelligent minds that he hired for his executive team, but the hard work, sweat and tears of the infield sales reps, service reps (made sure the customer services where properly installed), collection reps (chased after customers who fell behind on their payments), and sales managers.\n\nHe would often say, without sales we don't have the revenue to pay your salaries\n\nWithout customer service customers will drop us faster then we can bill them\n\nWithout collection reps we'd lose too many accounts due to non-payment\n\nAnd without sales managers to hold it all together we'd fall apart\n\nAnd he had a rule\n\nEVERY SINGLE EXECUTIVE team member would spend 1 full week of each quarter in the field with a Sales Manager, Customer Service Rep, Collections Rep, or Sales rep. In addition when they are in the field they are to SUBMIT to whoever they've been assigned too and they may not pull rank. \n\nThis rule applied to EVERYONE to include the CEO. I know this, cause the CEO personally road along with me for 5 days in the field. He was a legit cool guy (I got a story at the end about this)\n\nSo...apparently we had hired a new VP Of Marketing from a major brand that I'm sure everyone in this sub would know of. Anyway apparently the first time he went in the field the VP Of Marketing pulled rank on a sales manager and the sales manager reported this directly to the CEO.\n\nA new quarter went by, and I got an email stating that the VP Of Marketing will be joining me in the field on such and such week. Ok cool, not the first time I had some higher up come out and ride with me.\n\nBut about an hour later I got a call from my CEO.\n\nCEO: PJ the VP Of Marketing is going in the field with you\n\nMe: Yes sir, I got the email...\n\nCEO: PJ I picked you cause when I was in the field with you, you seemed like the kinda guy that wouldn't be bullied or let someone run all over you\n\nMe: Ok, well thank you\n\nCEO: This VP is new to the company, and the last time he went in the field he pulled rank. I've told him not to pull rank again, and if he does I want you to call me as soon as you can.\n\nPJ: I understand\n\nCEO: Thank you\n\nThe VP meets me up, honestly for the first two days everything was fine. However on the 3rd day I was meeting with an existing client. This client was a difficult to please customer, he would always say we weren't worth the money, but I knew we were cause I could see his results, and over the years this clients business had grown alot. Said client would beat us up over pricing I'd stand firm, give him a 3% price increase, and offer him upgrades on top he'd haggle me down to a 1.5% price increase and we'd sign the contract.\n\nNow I told the VP what would happen, that it would be a long sales call, and a difficult high tense one. But to let me handle it, I've dealt with the client quite a bit and was well prepared.\n\nNow this meeting with the client lasted 2 1/2 hours but I'll get to the point. The client wanted a discount and was threatening to go to our competitor, he wouldn't. That's when the VP  spoke up and said \"I'm the VP and I'll personally give you a 15% discount on your current plan if you agree to sign a 1 yr contract\" the customer said \"20%\" the VP said \"Spilt the difference 17.5% and we have a deal\" they agreed I was mad as hell.\n\nOne thing to mention my commissions depended on me generating MORE REVENUE and this VP just fucked me over.\n\nWe get in my car, and I go \"You pulled rank you shouldn't have done that\" he said \"I got the deal done\" I said \"Had you kept your mouth shut I'd have gotten more money, not given 20% back\" he goes \"We got the contract signed\" I said \"We gave away tens of thousands of dollars that we didn't need to\" he goes \"Look I'm the VP...\"\n\nI then called my CEO, he saw the name pop up on my cars bluetooth\n\nCEO answered\n\nCEO: PJ, how are you doing?\n\nPJ: The VP pulled rank on me and gave my customer a 17.5% discount on his current plan right as I was about to close him for more money\n\nCEO: That's not right, where is the VP?\n\nPJ: Your on speaker, he can hear you\n\nCEO: Excellent, hey VP\n\nVP: Yes sir\n\nCEO: Tell me what happend\n\nVP: Told his side of the story, which he admitted the truth but also admitted to pulling rank and giving the customer a discount\n\nCEO: Ok, thanks for your honesty. Your fired.\n\nVP: Excuse me? \n\nCEO: Your fired, you have a 1 yr probation clause your done you don't pull rank when in the field\n\nVP: You can't do this\n\nCEO: I just did, you are to get on a plane come back to your office and clean it out, PJ take Mr. VP back to his hotel and drop him off.\n\nPJ: Sure, no problem\n\nAnd for the next 20 minutes I had an awkward car ride back to my former VPs hotel.\n\nLater in a all hands on meeting, the CEO made sure to talk about how if an executive is in the field and pulls rank its a firable offense for the executive and he wants all the sales reps, sales managers, customer service reps, and collection reps to know that.\n\n**Side Story on this CEO**\n\nThe company had a data plan, which gave us 4G on our Ipads, Phones, and Laptops. Well the company changed the service plan, and our data plan went down to ONLY our phones and we had to hotspot off that. They said this move would save us $80,000 a month (we had like 4,000~ employees in the field)\n\nWell 2 months later we had a conference (we had 3 conferences a year) and after the conference, everyone went to the hotel bar. That's when I approached my CEO with another sales rep and talked to him about how much of a PITA it was to hotspot all our devices and how much it drained our phone batteries and blah blah and that I get it saves money, but it also costs producitiy.\n\nThe CEO nodded and said \"Tell you what, in 2 weeks the CIO is supposed to go in the field, I'll have him to go in the field with you and if he agrees that its costing our reps productivity and causing to many workflow issues I'll bring back 4G data to all devices\n\nThe CIO was there and said \"CIO, your going to XYZ area and you will be riding with PJ, pay attention to how he uses his 4G data and if you think we should go back to the old plan where all devices had 4G\" \n\nThe CIO went into the field with me, on the 3rd day at breakfast he said \"Last night I called the CEO\" and I said \"yea?\" and he said \"I made a recommendation that we go back to our old data plan and ensure all your devices have 4G data, its obviously creating productivity issues and when you look at the cost per user, its not that great\"\n**FAQ**\n\n**Do you still work there? If so why not?**\n\nNo I do not work there I was much better at maintaining and growing existing clients than acquiring new ones. The company ended up buying another company and started laying people off, and made acquiring new business more important then maintaining the current business meaning I was going be let go so I quit and switched jobs before ethey fired me.\n\n**Sounds like a great CEO/he's what I wish all CEOs would be comments**\n\nHe's still a ruthless business person, I'll give you an example of what he did to a lot of managers. When he bought out his competitor. He had a lot of redundancy and a lot of managers on rock-solid employment contracts which he couldn't just \"lay off\" so he took the managers with those contracts and turned them into phone reps. Imagine being a sales manager or even a VP and getting a call and being told you are no longer a manager or a VP and your demoted, not even an outside sales rep but an inside phone rep.\n\nThose managers obviously didn't perform very well after being demoted and would be written up for poor performance and let go. I know of a VP in the company who was demoted to a phone rep position. And literally got written up for poor performance for his first month. O and he was still getting his VP salary (per the contract, they could change his position/duties but they could not pay him less and the only way they could fire him would be through poor performance)\n\nAlso another thing he did, he invested a lot in automation during this time so he could lay off even more people. I had a talk with my manager one day, and he said the CEO was obsessed with revenue/per employee number and was determined to drive that number up.\n\n**I want to work for them, can give me the company name/etc**\n\nNo, for two reasons\n\nFirst reason, the company is currently not hiring and actively laying people off. Their primary revenue comes from small, and medium-sized businesses. As you can imagine due to the economic circumstance those small businesses can no longer afford to pay their bills, which includes my former employer. As a result, they've had to downsize. I'm sure the company will survive, they had crazy healthy margins, and I heard right before the economic downfall they had a lot of cash on hand for another acquisition of some competitors which they didn't go through with cause I bet they are using that cash to survive. \n\nSecondly, I don't want to be doxxed. \n\n**What's my opinion of this CEO**\n\nHonestly nothing but fucking respect. The dude is inspiring. He is also not someone I would not want to be, he's an obvious work alcoholic, his personal net worth is in excess of $100+ million and he doesn't need to work ever again but according to all the VPs/Managers I spoke to the dude literally works 7 days a week at all hours of the day.\n\nPut it this way, he travels SO MUCH in his biggest markets he keeps a car that he bought since its cheaper then buying a rental everytime he flys in\n\n**What did I take away from my time with them?**\n\nHonestly, I think a lot of companies could learn a lot from this company. Seriously why more companies don't force their top leadership to work within the ranks on a regular basis is beyond me. Its one gripe I have with my current employer.\n\n**This is how he reduced his sales staff**\n\nWhen he bought out the competitor he removed all sales objectives. He then made maintaining current/growing current client worth 1x he made acquiring new clients worth 5x. Also losing revenue cost you 1.5x Everyone was ranked against everyone, and he placed everyone in quadrants if you fell in the bottom 25% for 2 months in a row you got laid off.\n\nAnd this created for some interesting results. Example I had a family emergency. I took off for one week. For that one week I did $0 in business. however because people who were ranked ABOVE me lost revenue I rose in ranking. And the first week I came back I closed on a new business, increased revenue, and fell in rank because others around me did more.\n\nIt created for some depressing performance reviews, a co-worker of mine closed decent sized new business and he thought for sure that'd save his job. It didn't, because another person sold more then he did, and it kept him in the bottom 25% and he was fired. Thursday evening he was so excited about his new account, thinking it saved his job. Friday afternoon he let go.",

I've had to talk many customers out of doing exactly what your company did. Not only is it a productivity drain, you're not decreasing data consumption. You're still having to buy it, just among fewer devices. Buying in large quantities (say 10GB per device vs 5GB per device) can save a few pennies on the data, but smartphone data plans are always more expensive per GB than aircard/mifis because they include voice and messaging allotments. This means on a per GB expense, you're paying more. What about the reduced hardware expense? Guess what: vendors will literally give away aircard/mifi devices for use on laptops. They're cheap and they want the recurring revenue associated with a data-only plan. Also, what happens when a sales rep loses/breaks their smartphone? Single point of failure: no more internet in the field, and replacing that smartphone will cost you literally 100x the cost of a replacement aircard/mifi.",

        "selftext": "Hi, my first post on Reddit, so please excuse any formatting mistakes/any other mistakes.\n\n*Obligatory statement that I'm on mobile yada yada yada*\n\nTL:DR at the bottom for you lazy cows /s\n\nSo this happened a couple years ago when I was fresh at high school, in year 7 (I was in the grade for 11 year olds for international peeps).\n\nOne important thing to note with me is that I'm profoundly deaf in both ears, and cannot hear a single thing without the use of my cochlear implants (CI). However I can lip read pretty accurately so I'm not completely  lost without them. Another thing to note is that my CI run on batteries and these need to be replaced every ~2 days (this will be important later on). \n\nMost of the teachers were pretty understanding about this and would often go out of their way to make sure that I could clearly hear what they were saying (such as seating me towards the front of the class, and standing directly in front of me when addressing the whole class). \n\nExcept for one teacher who was a hardass about it. She also happened to be a music teacher, she will be known as Ms O. Also this is probably the worst combo because music is also my weakest subject (for obvious reasons).\n\n*Enter malicious compliance*\n\nMy and my form (we're a pretentious school and like to call the class that we register and go to lessons with our 'form'), are off to our music lesson, and this happens to be a double period (yes we're pretentious and period means lesson) which is about 1 hour and 30 minutes long. \n\nAnyway so we start the lesson, and pretty much 2 minutes after we sit down, the batteries in my CI had run flat (remember how I told you earlier that they go flat every 2 days), and so I needed to change them. However as my bag (which had my batteries in it) was in the room next door, I decided to raise my hand (like an obedient little boy) and ask if I can go and grab my batteries. At this point I could still lip read, and understand what the teacher was saying, but I'd much rather be able to hear lol.\n\nAnyways she pretty much ignores the fact that my hand is up, and after a couple minutes I pretty much get the hint that she doesn't want to answer my 'question'. I thought 'Whatever' I can still lip read and understand most of what she's saying.\n\nSo Ms L basically asks the whole class to go on the computers, listen to an audio file she'd sent us via email, and then use that as inspiration to digitally create our own piece of music. She also wanted us to show it to the class at the end of the lesson.\n\nNow because I didn't want to get into trouble, I raise my hand again to try and ask if I can get the batteries from my bag, but she ignores me again.\n\nSo I'm like \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af, I don't even like music anyway so no big deal. As a result, I pretty much sit in front of the computer screen doing nothing, as I can't hear the audio file or make any somewhat decent piece of music (remember this is a a double period, so a pretty long wait). \n\nAfter 5 minutes, I get bored and I decide to start talking to my friends (did I mention I can lip read?) And basically let them in on the joke, and we're all trying our hardest to not laugh too hard. Pretty soon, word gets around the class and now they can't wait until the end of the lesson to see what Ms L is going to do.\n\nEnd of the lesson rolls around, and when it's my turn to play my piece of music, and I pretty much sit in silence, and the whole class starts laughing but trying to stifle it at the same time.\n\nThis is how the conversation goes between me and her at that point:\n\nMs L : Can you not hear me???? I asked you to play your piece of music. \n\n(Ironic, ikr)\n\nMe: *sits in silence, and the laughter is getting louder*\n\nMs L: Are you even listening to me????? Are you trying to disrespect me by not listening to anything I say???\n\nMe: well...\n\nMs L: Honestly, just play your piece of music, it's not that hard.\n\nMe: *trying to stifle my laughter at this point* I can't... \n\nMs L: *cuts me off* This is how your treat your teachers???? Get out of the class right now!\n\nSo I get out and pretty much wait there until the lesson is over, I think she was expecting an apology from me (which was never going to happen) because after a couple minutes she pops her head out of the door and barks at me:\n\n\"YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO RESPECT FOR YOUR TEACHERS, MEET ME AT THE CITY VIEW AT LUNCHTIME!!!\n\nSo I'm like yea yea ok whatever.\n\nAt lunchtime, I meet her at the principal's office like she said.\n\nAnother important thing, is that I'm pretty friendly with the headmaster.\n\nShe opens the door and the conversation is as follows:\n\nMs L: this guy was giving me an attitude during my lesson and wouldn't listen to me. I would give him a Friday after school detention but I feel that he deserves to get a Saturday detention.\n\nHeadmaster: *turns to me* what happened?\n\nMe: well my batteries for my CI died and I raised my hand to ask if I could get the replacement batteries from my bag, but she proceeded to ignore me.\n\nMs L: *looks like she just had an epiphany*\n\nHeadmaster: We'll are you sure about this, because he has not prior record about being disobedient?\n\nMs L: *looking a bit flabbergasted* Yes I'm absolutely sure he was disrespecting me.\n\nMe: Sir, you know that I'm deaf and that I would never on purposely do that to a teacher.\n\nHeadmaster; We'll I'm inclined to believe the student here, if you have no proof otherwise, there is nothing to discuss.\n\nMs L then goes extremely red as she realises her mistake and storms out of the office\n\nThe headmaster gave me a slight smile before ushering me out of the office as well\n\nEver since then, she's never ignored me whenever I've had my hand up :)\n\nThanks for reading this \u2665\ufe0f, I know it was extremely long.\n\nTL:DR I'm deaf and need cochlear implants (CI) to hear, batteries in my CI go flat, and music teacher gets mad at me cuz I didn't do any work cuz I couldn't do/hear anything. Proceeds to embarrass herself in front of the headmaster \n\n\nEdit: wow I didn't realise I'd get this much of a response, thank you so much for the gold and silver and also the general response has been largely positive \ud83e\udd20\n\nEdit: stupid spelling mistake in my original edit \n\nEdit: spelling mistakes ",

        "selftext": "Concrete mixers are big, ungainly things.  Trying to maneuver them around a crowded jobsite is like trying to play miniature golf with a tennis ball.  The biggest problem is, of course, other people, specifically other people's cars.  Nobody is going to lug 50 pounds of tools any further than they have to, so if there is an open space near where they want to be, they park there, never mind that it is right next to a sidewalk or directly across from a driveway that a crew is obviously prepping.  It only makes things worse when it's done by people who should know better (and done intentionally).  \n  \nSo, we're pumping a grout walls in the late afternoon, which already has me in a bit of a mood.  Grout jobs tend to be very slow.  Each cinder block has two cells, and the crew [pumps the grout into those cells](http://www.asilo.com/house/pictures/pouring-grout.jpg) filling them all the way to the top of the wall.  Grout is really just a term for a weak concrete mix that is pumped super wet.  It has to be that wet to make it all the way to the bottom of the wall, otherwise it sticks to the sides of the cinder blocks (or gets caught up on steel reinforcement).  There is a lot of stopping and starting, as well as a lot of moving the pump.  It all takes time, during which that concrete starts to go off and stiffen up.  Things only get worse on a hot day, and the subs will do anything to get more water in the load (heroin addicts looking for a fix have nothing on grout pumpers eyeballing your last 20 gallons).  \n  \nAs we move to a new street, we find a line of cars parked all along the side of the street we are working on, just far enough apart to take up as much space as possible without leaving enough room to get the pump in there.  Turns out it is another concrete crew setting up to do patios.  No problem, we're all concrete guys here, and they know how it is.  We ask them to move.  That I am writing this post tells you what their response was.  It turns out they are waiting for their own pump and mixer to show up, and they intentionally blocked the street because they don't want us to be in their way.  Their crew chief tells us we can wait for them to finish and move on, or we can just work around them.  \n  \nIt's pretty obvious he expects us to wait.    Waiting is, of course, going to make the concrete go off even more and will rack up standby charges for the customer, but trying to work around their cars is going to mean blocking the street and rolling up the hose every time we move (normally the crew just drags/carries it down the sidewalk, but we can't do that with the cars in the way).  It would take much longer; depending on when their pump shows up, it might not even save us any time.  Still, Todd the pumper rolls his pump right up next to the lead car and feeds his hose out around it.  \n  \nAt the best of times, a concrete pump farts and sputters like a nervous chihuahua, flinging small globs of concrete out the hopper.  If the driver isn't paying attention and *accidentally* lets the concrete level get too low, the pump sucks in air.  Feeding a concrete pump air is like feeding a hippopotamus Olestra; shit's not pretty, and it gets everywhere.  We probably end up moving that pump twice as many times as we have to, but it ensures that every single one of those cars gets to spend some quality time next to the hopper.  \n  \nWe finish are done with the job and are washing out the pump when the crew chief (whose own concrete and pump still haven't shown up yet) storms over to complain about all the concrete splatter on their cars.  I point out that we told them we'd be pumping there and asked them to move, but they refused.  At this point he sees that I have a truck wash bucket strapped to my water tank and demands I let him use it to clean off his car.  \n  \nI tell him that is a terrible idea, smoking lounge on the Hindenburg levels of terrible.  The stuff we use is designed to dissolve dried concrete, and it will probably damage his car.  The concrete is fresh enough that he can probably just rinse it off with water.  He isn't having it.  He tells me to stop lying; if it doesn't damage my truck, it won't hurt his car.  Besides, he's done this before and knows what he is doing.  \n  \nNow, keeping a concrete mixer clean is a downright Sisyphean task.  No matter how hard you try, chutes overflow, pumps splatter, and plants huff cement powder all over your truck.  There are a variety of chemicals used to clean off concrete, and most of the modern mixes are relatively safe (for something that can dissolve concrete).  Our plants provide a phosphoric acid mix (relatively safe isn't the same as actually safe) to any drivers that need it, so it quite common for there to be a bucket of it stashed somewhere on the truck.  \n  \nOf course, part of what makes these chemicals safer also makes them somewhat less effective.   That's why some of us will bring in our own cleaning products to fortify the company mix.  These are not the friendly chemicals that will just leave you with a mild chemical burn; my bucket of fun dips down to the good old days of leaded gasoline, asbestos and red dye no. 2.  Still, I warned him, and he assured me he knew what he was doing.  Besides, he's intentionally being a jackass and expected my sub to pay standby for his convenience.  I let him have the bucket.  \n  \nI half expect him to stop when he pulls the lid off.  The witch's brew in the bucket smells like Walter White's bathtub.  Somehow, the fact that his nose hairs are curling up like a spider in a flame doesn't seem to faze him.  Brush goes in the bucket.  Brush comes out of the bucket.  Brush slams onto the hood of the car with a wet slap.  I can only watch in mute horror as the man proceeds to not just clear off the concrete, but bathe his entire hood in hydrochloric acid, rubbing it in to get out all those nasty water spots.  It's like watching an orphan unwittingly skin his favorite puppy.  None of us stick around long enough to see the final result, but it is already apparent that he has scrubbed off the clear coat and is in the process of etching brush marks in the paint.  I don't want to be anywhere near him when that hood dries out.  I let him keep the bucket.\n  \nTL/DR:  Another concrete crew tries to preemptively block us from our job so they can do theirs first.  We take their suggestion and work around them, splattering all their cars with concrete in the process.  The offending crew chief then asks to wash his car with my bucket of hydrochloric acid, and, after warning him that it will eat his paint, I let him.",

I was with a crew notorious for this one day, and was sick of them wanting to add water to what was concrete with a damn near perfect 5 inch slump. So I pulled the drivers aside for a little chat while we waited on the current truck to empty.  \"Look, these guys are gonna tell you to add ten gallons no matter what it looks like. So I want you to just spin up that drum and don't add a single drop of water unless I tell you.\"    \nSure enough, they wanted ten gallons in it. Driver spins it, and the exact same stuff comes out.    \n\"Oh, beautiful. So much better, thanks buddy.\"     \nDriver just smiled.",

While it is a truism that concrete truck drivers must guard their own wash out water closely, as the pump crew always needs to loosen the concrete, it is also a truism that most drivers are weird as fuck about the mix. We brought our own water, and it is amazing how resistant the driver is to adding water on general principle. What those principles are, one might only surmise. Assholery is the likeliest explanation as near as I can tell. The truck is 30 minutes late-traffic-I get it, no problemo. Let\u2019s add some water. Can\u2019t do that, I only have 80 gallons, and I have to wash out after the pour. Oh, no problemo, we have our own water, and running water at the wash out station. Any and I mean any resistance to that is just straight cocksucker bullshit.\n\nAs for admittedly using HCI to wash your truck and obviously letting that shit run onto the ground, into the sewer, water table whatever...that shit is dickmove 101.

Let's say we're pouring 5k psi mud (usually used for warehouses and such.)\n\nAnyway, those cylinders he made will get placed into a hydraulic press at different intervals (24hours, 3 days, 7 days, 14 days, and 27 days). Sometimes a company will request different intervals. \n\nWell, by day 27, those last cylinders will need to break at >5000psi in order to 'make strength.' For certain jobs, they will also need to make lesser strengths by those different intervals. (I.e. 2700psi on day 3, 3400psi on day 14, and so on. This varies.

        "selftext": "This happened when I (F, 20 at the time) was a junior in college. Here's some context. I had taken a long weekend trip to Florida with a friend of mine to visit her brother and go to the Universal Studios Fright Night Halloween event (which was awesome, by the way). We had an amazing trip, and we were on the plane about to head home. This was only my second ever time with air travel. We didn't have much when I was growing up, so vacations were not a regular thing, and the ones we took were low key.\n\nSo, there I was, just excited to be flying in my coach seat, waiting to take off. And we kept waiting. It became clear that there was a problem with the plane when the flight attendants started calling various passengers to exit to be placed on different flights so they'd make their necessary connections. Eventually, after around 40 minutes, it was just my friend and I plus around 6 other people. And then it was our turn to leave the plane. We were sort of near the end of the group tromping back out into the waiting area. One couple, probably in their mid-fifties, had stormed up ahead of us; and by the time my friend and I emerged from the gate entrance, the rude husband was already berating the pair of attendants, who, to their credit, remained poised and calm.\n\nThey tried to reassure him, but he was talking over them. \"This is unacceptable. You better get me the same seats we had on that flight.\" (He had the first row in coach, the one with no seats in front of it and therefore with extra leg room.)\n\nBy then, the rest of us had gathered around, and the attendants began addressing the whole group, offering reassurances, filling us in that there was a critical problem with the plane (which made me very glad for the change, despite the inconvenience). The rude husband was going off through all of this, and when the attendants left to make arrangements for us all, he and his wife sat there and he continued his commentary to his poor wife \"... unacceptable ... how dare they ... better have same seats ...\" and so on.\n\nShortly, the attendants returned, and the man practically rushed them. \"I demand you make this right.\"\n\nThe attendant smiled and said. \"You guys are all set. Sir,\" and she smiled at him specifically. \"I'm very happy to tell you that we have a flight leaving shortly, and we were able to give you and your wife the exact same seats as you had booked on the previous flight.\"\n\nRude husband: \"I should hope so. That's the least you can do.\" And he huffily returns to his seat.\n\nMeanwhile, the rest of us are just waiting. The attendant then turns to us, and she says, \"And I'm happy to let everyone else know that you'll all be flying first class with us today.\"\n\nRude husband was furious and immediately jumped up to demand why they weren't flying first class while the rest of us just sat there in a state of stunned glee. The attendant just informed the man that she'd given him his request, and didn't stick around for more abuse. The wait wasn't long, and soon my friend and I were boarded into the unicorn, fabled place that is First Class. As a poor, air travel newbie, it was like some fantasy land: huge seats, real hot wash cloths, and though we were underage and couldn't partake of The Free Cocktail, we did get to choose from a basked of \"Distinctive Pepperidge Farm\" cookies. And the food! We got a whole meal, which was truly delicious, with real crystal salt and pepper shakers at each place setting and actual metal cutlery.\n\nMeanwhile, rude husband is irate. My friend and I were in the last row of first class, which only had around 8 seats, and we could hear him heaping abuse on the coach attendants, going off on how those \"kids don't deserve\" first class and how they \"should have gotten them, they're older, they should be respected, not some kids.\" Someone else who was in first, not from our original plane, caught on and was quite tickled with the man's ire.\n\nThen, the best part of all happened: the flight attendant in our section overheard rude husband's tirade, with language specifically directed at my friend and me, \"who do those kids think they are?!\" as unworthy of the honor he should have been granted. The attendant shook his head and addressed me and my friend: \"I'm sorry about that. Let me take care of this for you.\" And he closed the curtain to the coach cabin. Rude husband realized what was happening, which makes it even getter. I got one last look at his red, irate face before he was gone forever. It was **glorious**!",

            "Had something similar back in March 2001 when I was a lot younger. Flight from Philly to DFW was late due to bad weather in flight (pilot said we had to fly a bit out of our way due to a storm and at 25,000 feet due to turbulence). Was at the back of the plane so one of the last off, run over to the connecting gate and get there to see a plane there but the jetway already pushed back.\n\nThere were some other passengers (6ish, IIRC) who missed it as well (I think my flight as they said they got in late, but could have been others) and I arrived to them all berating the 2 gate agents and screaming how the jetway must be put back so they can board. I take a seat near the commotion and wait for the agent to rebook everyone. When they're done, I go up and say I also missed the connection and ask for the best way for me to get to SFO. She responds \"The best way is First Class\" with a smile and prints me a ticket for the next flight.\n\nLike OP, was under 21 so couldn't drink onboard, but I still remember that to this day. Wouldn't expect that nowadays (I think most airlines flag agents who rebook people into a higher class of service without a very good reason), but always makes me smile when the memory comes back.",

            "Reminds me of my first trip to Las Vegas,  back in the nineties.  We got to our hotel at 1 in the morning,  and at check-in,  the people  at the desk next to us were having a shit fit about being on the 10th floor,  same as their friends. The desk clerks had a confab, and ours came back, explained the situation,  and ask \"would you mind terribly if we placed you a little higher up?\" All the same to us, so we were gracious and accommodating. Which is how we ended up with a Strip-view jacuzzi suite at the top of the Luxor Pyramid.  I really hope the folks next to us appreciated being on down 10 with their friends. It's been 26 years, and I still think of that with delight.",

She has seen me, cramped and still being polite, not making a fuss, and pointed me out to the twat couple \u201cHe\u2019s got more of a right to be complaining, yet he\u2019s the nicest one here. (To me) Come with me sir.\u201d She got me bumped to business class with a LOT more leg room for my (I think) 14hr flight from Atlanta to Tokyo. Was so appreciative of that attendant and never forgot her generosity getting that done for me.",
            "I had an experience semi-related. I fly a lot for a living. (I work overseas and my flights are rarely less than 2 connections and totaling more than 18 hours.) I always fly business overseas or 1st for domestic. \n\nWas returning from the Middle East. Landed in JFK and had a connection to Tampa. Got to the gate and there was an older couple (70s, I\u2019m guessing) who were trying to get upgraded to 1st but there was only one upgrade available. I went to the counter after hearing this and offered to take a coach seat so they could have my seat in first.\n\nThe older lady was surprised and grateful but didn\u2019t want to accept because she was worried about me \u201closing money\u201d for the ticket I\u2019d bought. I assured her my company was paying and it\u2019d be no problem.\n\nAfter our tickets were \u201cswapped\u201d and the couple boarded, the desk agent called me over to say how it made her day to see compassion shown when there\u2019s usually so much anger and selfishness. She managed to get me a a first class meal and I got free drinks (alcohol) for my trip.\n\nIt was nice to do something nice for someone and the service people got a brief respite from the hysteria.",

            "One of my best stories, no mc involved also involved an airline.  It was around Christmas, and I was flying out of Boston.\n\nThe airport had been hit by weather, and flights were delayed or cancelled.\n\nI was in line to get rebooked, and the person ahead of me in line was yelling and screaming at the clerk.\n\nWhen it was my turn, I was calmly talking to her, explaining where I needed to go, and that if at all possible I needed to be there by the next evening.\n\nShe thanked me for being calm and polite, and I answered that I assumed she would be doing the most she could for me, and joked that if she wanted I could tell and scream, but I was pretty sure that wouldn't help.\n\nShe told me I could be on the next flight, and have 3 connections to my destination, or cat h the 6 am one, have a direct flight, and make it home before the earlier one.\n\nI opted for the direct flight. And when she gave me the boarding pass I was surprised to see I was bumped to first!\n\nI was never si happy to have had arise person in front of me!",
            "Long time frequent flier.\n\nBack in the days before smart phones and all the handy travel apps I learned to sit close to the attendant station while I waited for boarding, especially when there are delays.  As you know the airlines don't tend to like admitting there is a major delay unless they have no choice, but if you sat close you could overhear what was really going on and act accordingly.\n\nThis one day my flight was delayed and another one had been cancelled so there was quite a crush of people. So many people being rude about not getting their way and the poor attendants were just trying to get everyone where they needed to go.\n\nFinally things settled down and this young couple came up and explained it was their honeymoon - they even showed their marriage license - but because of the cancellation they were sitting far apart for a cross country flight with a close connection. The attendant tried hard, calling up people around their seats and any open middle seats trying to get people to volunteer to swap to a middle seat just so this couple could sit together. No takers.\n\nFinally the attendant called them up and broke the news that they were unable to get a volunteer but that they were able to switch one of them to a different middle seat so they would be in adjacent rows so they could at least talk a bit.  Better than nothing and the young couple was appreciative.  As the attendant gave them their new passes she mentioned their seat assignments and one of them was in the middle seat next to me.  So as soon as they left I went up and told the attendant and volunteered to swap so they could sit together, but not too tell them who it was; I preferred to remain anonymous.  Just wish then a wonderful honeymoon.  I've never seen people so profoundly grateful.  I think the attendant was even more grateful than the couple.\n\nA few minutes later the attendant called me up and asked me if there was any way I could take a later flight.  I checked to make sure the later flight would get me home not too late and I agreed, I said especially if I could get an aisle seat on the new flights.  Sure, no problem.  A few minutes later she hand me my new boarding passes - first class both legs all the way home.\n\nIt pays to be kind.",

            "This reminds me of the time my friend and I went to see the music of the Beach Boys being performed in a concert hall.\n\nAs soon as the first big hit started playing, we jumped out of our seats and started dancing. It didn't take long for the people behind us to complain to the usher.\n\nThe usher removed us from our seats... And upgraded us to box seats right above the stage, where other people were dancing too.\n\nLooking down into the audience where we were originaly seated, several other people eventually got up and started dancing, in front of the same people who had complained earlier.",

I usually stop at the post-security stores and pick up a small box of goodies and give them to the attendants for all of the flight crew. I have been upgraded from cattle car to coach dozens of times and to 1st 2 or 3 times. Being a Karen or Kyle will get you exactly nothing. They do make notes of who is nice and who as rude and they do share that info with the Flight Crews on the connecting flights a lot of the time.",

            "Ha! I had something similar happen a number of years ago.  Planned group trip while stationed overseas.  Flight was over booked and an officer demanded he and his wife be on that flight before a couple of us enlisted.  They got on the flight alright, and were separated in seating.

            "Honestly, the only time I\u2019ve ever flown First Class was because I was patient and polite to the gate attendant after a flight was cancelled.  Several times I\u2019ve been bumped into the Business (or Comfort Plus on Delta) section for the same reason.  It *may* also be because I\u2019m 6\u20195\u201d. But I don\u2019t act like I deserve those seats, I\u2019ve patiently waited in line, and I thank the agent, no matter the result.

            "Patience and politeness pay off with service workers. Had similar experience on a work flight back from Colorado. \n\nDue to a mechanical failure, the plane that was supposed to carry me from PHL to BDL was downsized and I got bumped. As I wasn't in the hugest hurry, I waited patiently for an hour for the gate clerk to get everyone booked. About 30 minutes in the passenger ahead of me in line started regularly harassing the gate clerks about getting re-booked. When the line was down to about 6 passengers, the passenger was standing at the desk and bugging the clerks between every other sentence. They get the other passenger re-booked, and after the problem passenger's turn, they leave the booth in a huff with their tickets. I greet the remaining ticket clerk, who looks at me and basically goes \"Thank you for your patience, as I have to close out the remaining seats on your flight, I can book you through Charlotte or (some other airport), either way, I only have first class left\". I graciously took my tickets and my voucher, and head to my gate. I noticed the other passenger in a huff hovering around the same gate as I board. Turns out the other passenger got the bathroom door seat on both flights that I got booked to, as I sat enjoying free drinks on my first ever first class flights.",

        "selftext": "I might not be in the right sub, my art teacher said i wasn't good enough so i worked my damn hardest to prove him wrong is the summary.\n\nContext:\n\nThe  school i go to is well respected in my country, so it was not uncommon  for venues to request to display a students work or to ask for students  to sing live for them. On the occasion in question, the largest art  gallery in the country (gallery X) had asked my school to submit  'inspired art' to be out on display. The school agreed and said that  they would submit 5  pieces of work (one piece per year for years 9-13).\n\nBack to the story:\n\nI  hated art growing up but it was a mandatory subject until you got to  choose your subjects in year 10. Needless to say, I dropped the subject  ASAP. Despite hating the subject, i still put effort into my work and  some of it wasn't that bad. However at the same time i would not hide  away from expressing my views when we were given a task that i didn't  see a point too, even if the teacher was in earshot. Needless to say my  relationship with the art department faculty wasn't the best. My teacher  at the time particularly had it in for me. He was one of those teachers  that has the view that their subject should be your most important  subject, regardless of your future ambitions. If he thought that you  weren't prioritizing art then he would make your life hell. Yet again, I  **hated** art as a subject, he knew this, but i would still do any work set to the best of my ability.\n\nWe  had just finished a project where we had to mix different pigments to  create our own unique colour. Being colour blind i struggled a lot as i  literally could not differentiate between half of the pigments. I gave it my all but ended up giving up half way through the project. My  teacher hated me for giving up. in his defense he had tried to make it  as easy as possible for me, but i hated the subject and saw a way out so  i took it. My teacher was beyond mad. When we went to hand the project in he gave me a lecture about how i need to put in more effort and work harder because of the quality of work was unacceptable. Remember, i literally couldn't see half of the project.\n\nOnce that project was  finished, my teacher told us that gallery X has asked that we create  some 'inspired art'. We were basically shown 5 different paintings that  we were supposed to recreate in our own way. There was a big fuss about  this. People were saying that art schools would be giving out  scholarships, that there was a  $10,000 reward and other nonsense that  14 year olds make up. But never the less everyone wanted to be the one  have their painting in gallery X.  So for the next month and a half in  my art classes we would work on our piece. After the first week of  working my piece, the excitement of the new project wore off and so did  my eagerness in lessons. My teacher noticed this and went from  complementing my work to yelling at me about what i was doing wrong. By  the 4th week i was over the project and just wanted to be done with this. With 2 weeks left on the project my teacher pulls me aside to tell me that my work isn't good enough and i need to improve it. I tried to improve but he kept on belittle me. So out of arrogance and spite I made art my most important subject until the end of this project.\n\nI drag myself to each lesson, quietly working my self to the bone, counting down the days until the deadline of the project. After what  seemed like a year to 14yo me, the second last lesson arrives. This  lesson was not for final touches or anything like that. My teacher had  decided that he should review what each student has done well and where  they could have improved. He walks round the classroom, complementing  everyone's work, until he gets to mine.\n\nI  don't remember exactly what he said but I'm pretty sure none of it was  positive. I do remember however how he finished talking about mine. 'You  can tell that OP hasn't given this any thought and hasn't taken this  seriously.' That stung like a bitch because yes i had lost interest in  it, but i had still worked hard in lessons and given it my best shot.  The bell then went and i sulked out of the class with my tail between my  legs.\n\nThe last lesson finally  comes and i cant wait to be over with this stupid project. This lesson  was the big one too, the judges from gallery X were coming to school to  judge all of the work. They come into our class, do all the formalities,  'These all look so good! i have no idea how we can decide on only one!'  ect... Then they start walking around the room muttering to each other.  The whole class is stood silently at the back trying to hear what they  are saying. They do a full lap of the room, then walk back over to my  spot. I don't even notice this as i had tuned out after they had looked  at the second painting. They then ask the teacher whose work they are  stood over, he looks at them almost in disbelief as he gestures to me. I  snap out of my daydream and just smile politely with no idea what is  going on. The judges then confer for a while, whilst my teacher and i  frantically try and figure out what is going on. Finally after about 5  minutes of mumbling, they say that they want to shortlist it to  potentially be shown in gallery X.\n\nI  look on at them in shock, then yet again smile politely and say thank  you. i cannot begin to describe the look on my teachers face. I don't  think i have ever seen someone more confused, angry and disappointed all  at the same time. My teacher then begrudgingly thanks the judges and  walks them to the door. He thanks them again as they leave then stumbles  back to the class. He doesn't even congratulate me on my work he just  defeatedly says, 'Good work everyone. as a reward ill put on a  documentary for you all to watch.'. And he did just that not saying  another thing until the end of class.\n\nlater on that week i got an email from gallery X asking for my permission to display my work, of which i happily said yes to.\n\nTo  sum it up, the work that he disrespected and said that no effort into,  was selected from 192 others, got featured in the biggest art gallery  in the country.\n\nhope you enjoyed.\n\nEdit 1:\n\nspelling + grammar mistakes\n\nEdit 2:\n\nHere's a link to the piece i was given for [inspiration](https://www.google.com/search?safe=strict&client=firefox-b-d&sa=X&hl=en&sxsrf=ALeKk03aX2pJLYRezYJZAYo3T5SO2vFm_Q:1601473549760&q=Morning&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgFuLSz9U3MKoyjjcyV-LVT9c3NMxKtzA2TEs201LITrbSTyxKzsgsSU0uKS1K1c8tLU4tzbUqzy_KLo4vM1rEyu6bX5SXmZc-gY0RAALuoaZMAAAA&ved=2ahUKEwivurPwgZHsAhXLXisKHTUTCGsQ-BYwSHoECCkQcA&biw=1920&bih=915) ill update if i can find my version.\n\n&#x200B;",

            "I had something a little bit similar happen to me in school.\n\n  \nI had a choir teacher in 7th and 8th grade that told me that I didn't have the voice for solos.  We would try out for solos to be performed at concerts and I never got to do one.  It was disheartening. Side note - she was a pastor's wife.\n\nThe next year, I had a different teacher (as it was a different school) for choir.  I performed a solo for contest. For those that didn't do music, for contest, you perform a work of music (solos or ensembles) in front of a judge and are given a score (1-4, with one being Superior - the best).  You don't compete against other performers.  The judge just bases your skills and assigns a score in several different categories. These are done at differing levels of competition.  First contest is district level.  I performed my solo and got a Superior, which allowed me to go to state contest.  I then went to state contest and got a superior on my solo.  \n\n\nI wanted to go back to that to that choir director from the year before and shove my medals in her face. Alas, she had moved due to her husband's job, so I couldn't show her how wrong she was.  \n\n\nShe did teach me an invaluable skill, though.  I learned to sight read music from her class.  It's a skill that many vocalists don't know (especially those that did not go to college for music). It allowed me to be chosen for graduate level choir as an undergraduate.",
            "My wife ran into something similar when she went into a business college trying to learn something about creative art design. The teacher was very much a stickler of coloring with the lines and no one's allowed to deviate from the rules and everybody is work must look exactly as the example picture with no deviation or creative input whatsoever. They didn't even let the students create their own portfolio. The school would literally put every single piece of work that they did in class into their portfolio as an example of what they're capable of. Including all the stuff that they weren't good at and didn't do very well with and looked absolutely horrible was forced to be in the students official portfolio for the school.\n\nMy wife's work was constantly getting critiqued and all of her choice of font and color even to the point of making a circle bigger than the teacher light was critiques negatively on all of the projects that had nothing to do with my wife's desired career choice. My wife wanted to go into digital design for things like advertisements and Banners and signage and things like that and she was great at working with computer programs in that way but absolutely sucked hand drawing or hand painting anyting.

            "This reminds me of one of my art classes in high school. We had to sort of recreate a painting on a wine bottle, I chose a beach scene (just spent 30 minutes trying to find it on google, no luck) . I was actually stoked with how mine was coming along. Brought it up to my teacher for a critique before handing it in; just see if she had any comments about things I should add or touch up, etc. She suggests I add some '3-d elements', and I'm like wtf does that even mean. So she proceeds to coat the area of the bottle where I had painted sand with glue and shoves it into a bin of craft sand. She's like, \"does that make sense?\" and hands it back to me. Now I cant just leave it like that so I do the rest of the sandy areas, and to try and even the whole thing out I glue some pipe cleaners and tissue paper to the areas where the reeds were. It went from a respectable, if not pretty modest and amateur, attempt at art to looking like something a toddler brings home from school. I was so upset. It helped me to see clearly why I never enjoyed art in school, which always seemed like a subject that should have been more fun than it was; at an entry level I feel like art shouldn't be \"taught\" the way it is, at least in my experience. \n\nEvery single art teacher I ever had a class with had this weird controlling attitude. There's a difference between \"I'm not sure you're quite understanding this concept. We use varying line weights to convey depth\" for example, and \"go glue some fucking sand on your art project cuz i think thatd look neat. oh, turns out it looks awful... my bad!\"",

She had told everyone to study topic A intensely but I preferred topic B. She wouldn't let up, telling me to study topic A even though I hated it. I stuck with topic B.  Exam day came and topic B was a walk in the park for me, whereas the question on topic A was really difficult.\n\nOn results day I realised it had been a good choice - I ended up with an overall B grade, while the teacher's pet and everyone else in the class got D and below!!

            "I had a similar experience, though it wasn't as intentional as yours.\n\nI took piano lessons for years.  I had natural ability but I wanted to learn the piano as a hobby/for fun while my teacher had the intent for every one of her students to be concert pianists and zero patience for anyone striving for less.\n\nThis lead to a lot of pushing by her to practice practice practice and me getting more and more disengaged.  By the time I quite piano I actually had at least 5 years where I would physically shudder whenever I walked by it just from the memories of being forced to sit there.  Memories of her lambasting me for not practicing enough, memories of my mom sitting me there and putting an egg timer and me being required to practice until it went off etc.  I was allowed to quit, but I didn't want to...I just wanted to do it less religiously.\n\nA few times a year we would have recitals where a bunch of teachers and students would get together and each student would play a piece for all the parents.  Coming into the recital, I had gotten pretty disengaged and I did NOT have the piece well memorized.  My teacher would gloat to myself and my mom about how bad I was going to do because I hadn't practiced and I didn't have it memorized and how I was going to utterly fail. To be fair, she was right. She almost seemed to relish the failure that was coming as an opportunity to prove to me how horribly I was going to do.  \n\nThe piece was from a new composer that all of the piano instructors had fallen in love with, and to be honest I liked his work too.  They all knew it.  \n\nI got up to play my piece, and sure enough she was right.  About half way through my mind completely blanked and I couldn't remember anything about what was next.  I could remember the general flow of the music but none of the notes.  I was NEVER good at composing but I panicked and just kept playing.  Nothing I knew, just making stuff up as I went along...and it was WORKING.  I kept playing in circles until I got back to something that felt familiar and was able to finish the end of the piece.\n\nAfterwards all of the piano instructors were coming to my teacher to tell her how impressed they were that I had composed my own version of the piece and how great it had sounded.  She was absolutely furious over it.\n\nTo this day I have no idea how the hell it turned out well.  I can't compose worth shit, and I sure as hell can't sit down and just play.  Something happened when I panicked up there and what came out sounded good rather than like someone took a hammer to the piano and I have no idea why.",
            "Ok here's a hot take I haven't seen in the comments yet, your art teacher sounds terrible, that's the absolute worst way to reach art, especially to a 14 year old. I'm really sorry you had to go through that as one of your first intros to the art world and I'd recommend taking an art class again sometime if you can, there's a huge difference between a critique and doing what your teacher did. I'm an art student now in college and I've never had an experience like that, ya I've had projects that a professor didn't personally like, but they didn't go into any of that, it shouldn't be a bias in teaching. Crits should go through the technical aspects of how did you actually paint it, did you use a good technique, then go into some of the why things are the way they are questions, like why did you frame it this way and why are different elements where they are, or why did you leave brush strokes in one spot and not another and really just getting you to think and talk about it from a different lens than you had while making it. It should never be just that you suck, that's not helpful in the slightest.",

Your story reminded me of my art teacher story\n\nWhen I was in fifth or sixth grade, I had this art teacher I very much disliked. The one I had the previous year was so fun. We did stuff like embossing and making prints. I got to be creative and it was super fun for me. \n\nI\u2019m not good at drawing. I never have been. I\u2019m pretty good at colors; shading; pastels, colored pencils, blendable gel pens and even paints. But I sucked and still suck at drawing. \n\nThe assignment was to draw a horse. I\u2019m pretty sure each little table of six kids had a couple figurines of horses to look at and draw from like still life. \n\nWell, I\u2019m doing my best. Draw an oval shape for the body, four sticks for legs, you know. Like someone who is bad at drawing would draw a stupid horse. \n\nTeacher is walking around oohing and ahhhing at the kids pictures. She comes to mine and gets a sour face. Picks up my shitty drawing that I tried my best on and said \u201cwhat is this?\u201d, loud enough for the whole class to hear. She literally holds it up and shows it around like goddamn show and tell. \n\nI\u2019m like \u201cuhh it\u2019s a horse\u201d. My face must\u2019ve been bright red. I\u2019m embarrassed and pissed just remembering how she shamed me. \n\nShe went on about how it didn\u2019t even look like a horse, and what was wrong with me, and this was disgraceful and she didn\u2019t believe I was taking it seriously. Some kids in the class were laughing. Some kept looking at their own drawings, probably glad it wasn\u2019t them. \n\nI was humiliated. Angry and embarrassed, I fucking despised that bitch. I went home and cried about it, and ever since then I hated art. Dreaded the mandatory art classes. And I never forgot what that bitch did.  \n\nI don\u2019t have a good revenge like OP. I still suck at art and I\u2019ll never try to draw in public again, lest some stranger walk over, hold up my weak attempt, and publicly shame me. \n\nWhen I grew up I realized how fucked up that was for her to do to a kid. I was maybe 12. I hope I never ever make someone feel as bad as she made me feel. \n\nSorry for rambling, I hadn\u2019t thought of that in years. The older I get the more messed up it seems that an adult in a position of power would berate a child and shame them in front of their peers. I wonder how many other kids she scarred for life?",

Well, it was a random mix of freshmen and several people in the class I hadn\u2019t seen since elementary, and I have the gift of gab, I can talk to anyone, just about any subject. So, people would gravitate to me although I sat with two of the most reserved students in class. I was getting my work done talking like crazy bc people would start conversations with me, but the other people were getting distracted, although not my two table mates, they loved having me at their table and the three us became very close. Anyway the teacher hates that I\u2019m getting my projects done, hates that I\u2019m decent at art, hates that I\u2019m pumped for class everyday, and most hates that everyone In the class would kinda gravitate to me. Next thing I know someone standing at my table talking means I have to go cut paper. \n\nThe art room was a massive basement room divided into three sections but completely open, by the door about 20 light table desk, the middle, teachers desk with the massive paper cutter, then the tables for art one, with sinks and a darkroom on the back side. \n\nSo, I\u2019m in the middle of the room slicing paper, for as much as I can talk I absolutely love doing things alone with my thoughts, and cutting paper in one of those massive cutters is so satisfying. Anyways, slowly but surely people start coming to the paper cutter and talking to me. This drove my teacher insane. So she started standing with me and having small talk, this led to her asking me what youth group I was in? I was very confused by this question bc although raised in the Bible Belt of the American south, I have never been to church. I say something along the lines of oh I don\u2019t do that. \n\nThis led to three years of me trying to take her art classes and being denied, she refused to have me in her classes. Because of being pushed out of classes the school threw me into pottery one. The pottery teacher became my favorite human, I grew up with his kids but having him actually teach me just blew my mind. I told him about what happened with art one teacher and next thing I know I\u2019m the only student in my state to get a credit for a class that didn\u2019t exist. Turns out every time she denied me a class my pottery teacher would write the state and get approved for me to get a credit in advance classes. So, he legit kept me in art, wrote out paperwork to support \u201cmy class\u201d, and planned my projects, he even cleaned a spot in the massive closet for me to privately, so I could focus. I will forever owe that man, he pushed me to create amazing sculptures, to the point I won my senior art show at the gallery in town, that was the first state art competition, ever and I got 1st place in my section. \n\nAs someone that continued taking art classes, art teachers are either inspiring, or absolutely tackless, my art would be criticized about the talking in class instead of my strengths or weaknesses.

I convinced the teacher to let us listen to iPods when we worked because it would make us shut up and be quiet and it worked perfectly. The only issue tho was I procrastinated like a mother fucker. I would wait till the last 2 days to do my work and turn it in. For my junior year the teacher said she changed classroom rules to include a daily \u201cparticipation grade\u201d which meant I had to do something. We have a local museum who does what you described but it\u2019s at the end of the school year and the teacher said if your work got picked it would improve your grade by a whole letter if you needed it. This year the museum said they wanted to collect 4 pieces of art per student to display so we had to do a bunch of projects then they came selected 4 of the 6 projects we did. I procrastinated on all of them and got Ds on all my assignments for not working on them daily. Then when the judges came then ended up taking 4 of mine which ended with me getting an award and I made a joke about how my teacher would have to raise my grade to an A instead of the D I was currently at and the principal made sure I got my A. In my senior year I decided that I wanted to test her and see what would happen if I finished the projects just 2-3 days into them. She would make me start over by doing something else in the same project. So when 1 was done I\u2019d have 3-4 of each project so I collected everything and brought it to the principal and asked why I\u2019m required to do 5x the work as everyone else.

Other students in the class really liked what I did.  Fortunately, it was just a required credit for my undergrad so all I had to do is pass.

        "selftext": "This story is from June 2012, a week or so short of 10 years ago. I have generalised my exact work for anonymity. This story takes place in Australia where we have very stringent laws around employment, firing, hiring, redundancies, maternity etc etc. \n\nLittle bit of background, I had started working for this particular company in March 2011. I was hired basically on the spot once I demonstrated my knowledge of the product that I would be working on, and started 2 days later because of a deadline that had to be met. I had a very specific contract for what I did. I was thrown in the deep end, a sleepless 7 days followed but by the end I managed to do a decent job on the first of many products. 2 months after I started, my direct boss (General Manager) was let go and not really replaced properly but a consultant took over their responsibilities. I should also add that majority of operations were in Australia while a smaller team operated in the UK which is also where the CEO was based, despite 80-90% of products coming out of our office. Towards the third quarter of 2011, the CEOs contract ended and not renewed, so the hunt began for a new CEO who was eventually found and began working also in the UK location. \n\nAfter a very busy 2011, hiring approximately 30 new employees and launching a bunch of new products, business was booming... until the second week of January 2012. By this point upper management couldn't stay on top of everything, bringing in the COO of the parent company to oversea operations in Australia (because we had a lot going on but the CEO was based in the UK and new). At this point we had a group meeting where we learned the future of the company and that operations in Australian would cease on June 30th 2012 (End of financial year in Australia). This was followed by management explaining that everyone except a handful of people would be made redundant with payouts. The handful who would remain will instead be made redundant after finishing their projects at the end of 2012. \n\nSo over the next 5 months as operations were slowly winding up and people started to exit the company, I'd lined up a few job interviews, one of these was my dream job, based in Europe working in the exact field I wanted to be in. I kept this quiet, telling only a handful of my closest friends at my still current job. The recruitment process took quite a few weeks, many late night Skype interviews, general chats, it was a big job and a massive interview process, and towards the end of May, I'm still in the running for this dream job, and by this point, pretty much everyone knows, wishing me luck.\n\nAround comes the start of June, and everyone starts to get their redundancy letters, giving them 28 days of official notice outlining their pay schedules and all legal entitlements. When I say everyone, I mean everyone, except me. I find this very strange, but quickly realise it's because if I hand in my notice, I won't be entitled to a pay out and the company gets to save a few thousand dollars. \n\nThis is where my malicious compliance kicks in, I keep quiet and don't say anything. By about the second week of June I find out that I didn't get my dream job, and I tell one other person but make sure they don't tell anyone else. Fast forward to the last week of June, and now there's just 7 employees including me left in the office alongside the GM, COO and CFO. Everyone, except me, has packed up their desks, and at this point just showing up to basically be social and reminisce. \n\nOn the second last day, I run into the COO (remember, he was from the parent company brought in to oversea the winding up of operations) next to my desk and he goes \"You must be saddened that tomorrow is the last day?\" casually I respond with \"Oh, is it? I know it'll be quiet but I didn't realise it's my last day\". He takes a closer look at my desk, still not packed up, has the most confused look on his face and responds with \"Yeah, it's everyone's last day. Why wouldn't it be your last?\" \"Oh, I never got a redundancy letter\". At this point I can see the expression on his face go from 'huh' to 'oh shit'... In the hope that I would get a different job and resign so I don't get redundancy entitlements, among everything else going on, between the GM, COO and CFO, they forgot to issue me an official redundancy notice. \n\nAt this point he realises all this and goes \"Oh, come and see me in my office in 30 mins\". Half an hour later, I go to his office, he's sitting there with the CFO by his side but also kind of behind him. There are a few papers on the desk, I sit down and he starts \"Sorry we didn't do this properly at an earlier point, but here is all your redundancy paperwork\". The first piece of paper is the official letter, I pick it up, start reading, and the first thing that catches my eye is the date. It had been backdated to 27 days previously. Now this is a 2 copy letter that needs to be signed by both employer and employee. I put it down and go \"That's not today's date\". He gets flustered and responds with \"Sorry we forgot to get to you, but the notice was issued on that day\".   \nMe: \"It might've been issued then but this is the first I'm seeing of it, and you'll note it hasn't been signed by me\"  \nHim: \"Yes but you knew this was coming\"  \nMe: \"I did, but I assumed I'd be retained for longer because I wasn't given official notice.\"  \nHim: \"What do you want us to do now?\"  \nMe: \"Put today's date on it and I'll sign it.\"  \nHim: \"But legally we need to wrap up operations before the end of the month, we can't do that\"  \nMe: \"You could try to fire me instead, but I don't think Fair Work Commission would be satisfied with your reason of me not wanting to sign a falsified redundancy letter\" \n\nBy this point he's very flustered, meanwhile I'm just laughing my ass off in my head.\n\nHim: \"Ok, let me change this for you\". He disappears, comes back with another copy with the correct date. \"Ok here you go\".   \nMe: \"I'm not signing this yet\"  \nHim: \"Why not?\"  \nMe: \"Well I've got 28 more days of legal employment now, which means I'm owed an extra day and a bit in annual leave in my final pay schedule\"\n\nHe looks at the CFO and the CFO looks at him and nods in agreement. He changes my payout schedule, adding another day of annual leave to it, prints it out and hands it to me. I carefully look over everything, it's all in order now, I sign the paperwork, we both get copies.  \nHim: \"So what will you be doing here for the next 28 days?\"  \nMe: \"Nothing, I'm not coming back after today\".  \nHim: \"But you are legally employed for another 4 weeks, we can't be paying you for nothing? You should help out the IT guy and pack up some boxes\"  \nMe: \"There's nothing in my contract about packing up boxes, so I won't be doing that. Also, if you read my contract, it says I'm employed to work on this one specific project only and any other work outside of this needs to be agreed on separately, and since you sold my project to the competition yesterday and is no longer at this company, I have no further contractual obligations to fulfil\"\n\nBy this point the CFO is barely holding in his laughter.   \nHim: \"Well that's not fair we have to pay you an extra month for nothing\"  \nMe: \"That's not my problem, my contractual obligations have been fulfilled. I'm going to pack up and go home at 5pm.\"  \nHim: \"Ok, please make sure it's not before 5pm\"\n\nI get back to my desk and pack it up in less than 5mins, put all my personal belongings in a box. and just sit around doing nothing. One of my colleagues who was remaining for a few more months comes over and asks \"What was all that about?\", I explain everything in detail, he lets out the biggest booming laugh, goes to his office, closes the door and continues laughing.\n\n15 mins later, the CFO comes over and goes \"You don't have to stay until the end of the day, you can take off whenever you want\".\n\nAnd this is the story of how I got an extra month's pay due to management's incompetence.",

            "PS. It won\u2019t let me edit the post but I should clarify that for the last week I had no work to do since my project was on hold pending the sale to the competition so I just used their high speed internet to browse the internet and apply for jobs. In an amazing turn of events, I ended up being hired by the competition where I continued to do the same work for the next 6 years.\n\nEDIT 2: Just to clarify, whether they forgot about me, or were hoping that I\u2019d leave before they had to pay me out is debatable. I was the third most senior person there by this point, so I\u2019m sure they would\u2019ve kept tabs on whether I would resign or not. At some point after most of finance and HR was gone, they must\u2019ve forgotten to follow up and check. It would\u2019ve saved them quite a few thousand dollars. Not to mention, every time I was asked about the recruitment progress I\u2019d play it up and say they wanted someone to start right away, I wasn\u2019t going to give them and real ammunition.\n\nEDIT 3: I wasn\u2019t going to go into the character of the COO at all but just to give you a brief insight, this is a man who bought a very expensive luxury European car a week before telling everyone that the business was closing. And didn\u2019t drive to work for a week after sharing the news. I had absolutely no sympathy for this man and didn\u2019t care what bridges were burnt.",

            "German laws are even more stringent. I know of one case where an U.S. manager came over to hold an all hands meeting (no reason given). He told everyone they are terminated effective end of the month (including German HR staff) with one month severance pay. As all managers were dismissed too, he would handle the shutdown. \n\nIn German law any termination must be in writing to be valid. As HR staff was affected as well, they didn\u2019t feel any obligation to educate the top boss. The German managers (also affected) also shrugged (and maybe smirked a bit when he was not watching). \n\nSo everyone was still legally employed and continued to appear at work. End of the month approaches and the people keep requesting vacation days and so on. Asking where they should appear next week, when the offices are closed. When the CEO wonders about this, they tell him, that they are still legally employed.\n\nSo he wants to fire everyone in writing. HR staff saw this coming and all of them had called in sick. So he tries to write termination letters himself and in a hurry. Not knowing German law, he completely messed it up. The next week he had a lawsuits from every employee including HR all with the same lawyer. \n\nAs his own German legal staff was also suing, they cited conflict of interest rules and refused to help him. The CEO then called in an external lawyer.  Only then someone told him, how completely he fucked up. \n\nBy making an illegal termination he made sure that every judge would check for every t crossed and i dotted on any followup termination.  Since he made more mistakes (he had offered one employee a followup job, missing mandatory warnings for mass dismissal), his chances for any termination to stand was practically zero. \n\nIn the end the termination was delayed by six months and everyone received two monthly salaries as severance package per year of employment. Some received two years of pay through this. This created a local vacation boom.",

After all, who would dream of costing a friend a huge amount of money, just because they couldn't keep themselves from tattling to upper management? They all distrusted senior management.   She'd helped every one of her colleagues at some point or another and they had a lovely, close-knit team.\n\nThe day came round when everyone got their redundancy: everyone but her, that is. Management invited her for a chat and told her that she had been selected to stay on in some weird invented role. She would NEVER be offered redundancy, regardless of how long she decided to stay. The way they were sniggering, it was obvious they knew about Hong Kong. \n\nMy friend lost \u00a310k because someone she had liked-had helped and supported -had told senior management her news.

        "selftext": "I used to work in a warehouse and one day we got a new Floor Manager.  He had this grand idea that he was going to make an already functional supply warehouse work even better.  It is important to note that all of our deliveries were sent out on time, received on time, no workplace accidents other than the occasional stubbed toe or splinter from a wooden box.  This place ran about as smoothly and efficient as possible but it wasn\u2019t good enough for the New Manager.  He made it a point to check on everyone, getting into things that weren\u2019t his business and things he didn\u2019t know about.  \n\nOne of his biggest things was making sure that everyone was at work on time.  We didn\u2019t have a time clock, we just wrote down when we got in and when we left.  The New Manager insisted that a punch card system would work much better for us, but the owners weren\u2019t willing to invest in that.  So, New Manager would spend every morning watching everyone come through the front door.  We had maybe fifty people who worked there, so he made sure to count who came in and when.  Anyone who walked in the door past 8:05 am got written up.  That is when he met the Old Guy.\n\nOld Guy had been with the company pretty much since it opened.  He knew everything and everyone there.  Great guy and everyone liked him.  On the second or third day of New Manager watching everyone come in, he sees Old Guy walking in the front doors at 8:15.  New Manager rips into Old Guy telling him that he was late, that it was unacceptable, and that he was getting written up.  He is yelling in the middle of the warehouse where everyone can see and hear him.  Old Guy tries to explain, but gets told to shut up.  New Manager tops this all off with an order.  \u201cThis warehouse opens at eight am sharp every day, five days a week.  And I expect you at that door at eight am to begin your shift.  You will be here when the warehouse opens!  Is that understood?\u201d  Old Guy just kinda smiles, takes the paperwork, and apologies stating that he would be in tomorrow at eight am just as he was told.\n\nThe smug look on the New Manager\u2019s face was picture perfect.  He was certain that he had just fixed the biggest flaw in the company.  The next day at eight am sharp, Old Guy walked through the door and simply made sure that he was seen.  Then he went off into the warehouse.  \n\nThat day was a nightmare.  Orders were backed up.  Trucks were waiting on paperwork.  New Manager is almost in tears because of the chaos.  The Owner comes in and starts trying to make sense of the situation with New Manager, and they track the paperwork issue back to Old Guy.  New Manager is upset, but Owner is concerned and asked Old Guy if everything is okay?  Old Guy just tries to hide his embarrassment saying that New Manager wrote him up the day before and he was told that he had to come in at eight am.  Not at four am like he always did to get all the orders and paperwork ready for the day.  The day before when he walked in the door, he had been coming in from a break.\n\nNew Manager tried to back peddle, saying he didn\u2019t know, that it was Old Guy\u2019s fault.  Owner knew better.  After that, the New Manager wasn\u2019t working at the warehouse anymore, or for the company.  He went off to become a New Manager for someplace else.  Thankfully, Old Guy knew what was going to happen and had most of the paperwork done for the day already so we weren\u2019t too behind when the smoke cleared.  \n\nI made this as a comment to a different post.  Felt it deserved a full story.  Enjoy.",

            "I know a man who worked at a number of food processing factories in the UK doing maintenance on very specific and very old machines, the complexities of which he explained but I won\u2019t profess to understand. He was on the books with his engineering company for decades and was relied upon at confectionary factories in particular, of which there are now a lot less than there once was. The company tried to make his life difficult so that he would voluntarily leave when he was 60, but he knew he was in for a big pay off if they sacked him, so just went about his job ignoring their pettiness.\n\nHe eventually got his redundancy and retired, happily so. Only problem is - the confectionary factories have a few particular machines very few people know how to tune up and fix. They\u2019re gargantuan contraptions full of intricate parts that are incredibly old by industrial standards and as you might expect, they are prone to collapse on a semi-regular basis.\n\nDue to this, they pay this man one off repair contracts every time the machines breakdown that are worth more than he ever earned as a salaried employee. All the while he\u2019s collecting his pension, sitting on his redundancy, and earning a very good living.\n\nIdiots never even asked him to train someone else.",

            "My dad pulled something like this but with less of an overarching effect unfortunately. Office hours were 8-4:30, he always showed up at 7 (more like 6:30) so he could get all the pertinent information he needed from night shift to help with his scheduling. One manager decided to get grumpy about him leaving early, told him he needs to do his normal hours. Started showing up for 8, and immediately daily started harassing the manager for all the information he would normally have gotten from the supervisor, delaying when the daily schedule would be sent out, delaying receipts in the ERP system, etc, nothing too major. \n\nEventually the owner was in for his weekly meeting and mentioned how he normally has this and that ready by then, and he knew it wasn't my dad's fault, but my dad had a pretty unique relationship with him (owner poached him personally to be a specialist for a product line, knew my dad knew his shit, my dad was probably the only one comfortable enough to tell him he was wrong or that a manager was making a bad decision), so he just straight up \"Oh yeah, I used to have all the info I needed from the supervisors but I was told I need to come in for 8 so I'm not leaving early\". Everyone went into the manager meeting, manager came to my dad at the end of the day and said he can come in whatever hours he wants to do his job best, and never mentioned it again.\n\n15 years later, whoever is doing that job still works 7-3:30, much to the chagrin of the occasional manager who notices the discrepancy",

            "Old Red. We called him the fireman. If you had a problem, he had a solution. Knew every machine and how finicky they were as they were older than he was. We were maintenance. Red hated paperwork as it was and refused to do it especially when we went digital. That's what I was for. No problem for me as I loved sitting in his office doing orders, maintenance tickets, scheduling preventative maintenance an all that.\n\n\n New engineer gets hired and he is going to streamline this that and the other. Every month we were over budget on material orders, but under on labor and down time. A certain machine could go down and you shut the plant down.  Hundreds of thousands of dollars lost per day and management would start sending hourly employees home. New engineer, known as NEW from here, makes strict policy of all materials, maintenance schedules, and overtime authorizations go through him. No exceptions.\n\n\nFine until he begins to question Red about things and finds out I'm doing them. What are we paying Red for the? NEW decides Red is out, I'm in. I'm pretty much clueless to a large aspect of plant operations and machinery and tried to explain in a 1 on 1 meeting where NEW told me of his plan for Red.\n\n\nI of course go to Red. Now Red could have retired a few years earlier, but old engineer convinced him to stay with a modest bump in pay. Red also had Retired from the military, so he didn't care if he fished for the rest of his days. And that's what he did after he went to HR and put in for retirement.\n\n\nSlowly Red starts watching the system start to burn. Red wanted no fanfare of retirement party and we just had a nice lunch on his last day. Everything kinda goes smoothly for about 3 months and then it happened. Machine down. NEW calls us and it's an oh shit moment. What's wrong. Don't know. Who does. Red. He scoffs and asked for schematics. Sure. I print the 1 page 80 year old schematic that showed nothing what the machine looked like. We called Red. He was fishing. Do this, change that, try this. Ok. Machine up, thanks Red. Happens again, this time different problem. Then another machine. And another.\n\n\nAll of us called into a meeting where we are reamed for an hour. The Big Boss gets there. Where's Red. Fishing. What? NEW went on to explain how he saw no need for Red. Well, can you fix this mess? I'm trying to figure it out with the crew now. We are lost. We don't have materials for what we aren't lost about and a good bit was due to lack of OT approvals for PM.\n\n\nBig Boss leaves motioning me to come with him. We call Red. Red will come back on 1 condition as an independent contractor. He gets to be Head honcho when there. Big Boss agrees no questions asked.\n\n\nA couple days later due to needing materials we are back up. We heard the estimated loss was near or over a million. Next day, no Red. NEW calls and demands he be there. RED complies. Now Red is no fool, and has a contract and is getting paid well for his time there. And remember, his head honcho status request to come back? Yep, in there. NEW tried to buck it for a while, but Red was a sly fox. Basically Red saw no need for an engineer that didn't have up to date schematics. So he made him draw new schematics for months. It effected us as well, but we thought Red had a plan.\n\n\nHe did. After a few changes to the schematics here and there, his old policies and schedules along with keeping materials we needed on hand, We were better than ever. Red comes in one day with a push broom. Hands it to NEW and tells him when he wears it out, he has another just like it for him. Guess the guy needed the money more than anything because he pushed that broom. I left a year or so later and sadly, went by one day and the whole building was gone. Ran into Red and Big Boss died and the kids moved the operation to Brazil. NEW went with it and Red fishes.",
            "Was a department manager at a grocery store a while back. Used to come in at 4 and knock out all the front of department displays and generally make the place look nice. Orders come down we now have to start at 6 no exceptions. So I kept working at 4 and doing my thing. Had gotten compliments on how the dept looked by big bosses who walked in early in ghe morning. Got a talking to a month or so in that they noticed I wasn't coming in at 6. I said yep that's right, I'm doing all this stuff. They said unfortunately you need to come in at 6. Sure thing gang. Boss walks in at 7 the next day and immediately notices my dept looks like a bomb went off. Walks over and asks what happened. I just told him I came in at 6 but I don't have time to talk I need to start my order soon so I'm trying to get done everything I can before that happens. He asks what time I'll have the department looking normal. I looked him dead in the eye and said with the order being top priority and my state mandated lunch before 5 hours, it is quite possible the dept won't be ip and running normally until 10 or 11. I was walking out the door at the end of my shift when he calls out yo me and asks if I can go back to coming in at 4. No prob boss, kind of a reason I've been doing it thay way. Still friends with ghe guy and it wasn't his fault he had to enforce it. It was his boss. Manglement screwing up a smooth operation as usual",

            "I worked for a company that needed someone with a security clearance to sign paperwork regarding a contract. Right after we put a bid in for the contract we hired a new manager and he took a dislike to me immediately and made it his mission to get me fired. He claimed he had been in special forces in the military and had the highest clearance. One day out of the blue the owner said they were splitting the company, one side would be marketing, tech support and sales. The other half would be hardware and software innovation and installation. The new manager would run that part. \n\nThe next morning when I came in, new manager was sitting in my chair in my office with an envelope in his hand. I stopped, looked at him, and said \"You're firing me.\"\n\nHe nodded and said \"I am.\"\n\nSo I said \"Where is owner?\"\n\n\"On a business trip.\"\n\nHe then started stuttering about how with the split neither side had room in the budget for my salary and most of my duties would be built into sales and marketing. They gave me a check for three months of my salary and he allowed me to pack up my own desk. As I was packing up. I grabbed the original of the contract with my signature on it. Now, yes, this was bad because that contract didn't belong to me. But my signature did, and I was taking it back. The new manager could sign the contract if they won the job. \n\nThree months later I am in a new job when the old owner called me out of the blue. Seemed that marketing lost the original contract when they transitioned my office over, and it turned out that new manager was full of it, a blowhard, and a thief. Would I be interested in a consulting position where I would only be responsible for signing off on the contract? \n\nI sat for a moment then asked him to hold, went to the bathroom and laughed my ass off. Then I went back to my desk and picked the phone back up. I said \"Sure, I'll take that contract. My fee is $500 an hour, ten hour minimum each time I am required to come in.\"\n\nHe hung up on me. I came home to an answering machine full of profanity, so I sent him an email reminding him that he was too chickenshit to fire me himself, so he gets no respect. They lost the contract. The company almost went under. They are still there, but only have one office and three or four employees. Owner has to actually get out and pound the pavement as their only sales person.

As we were figuring out the organization we realized that the previous place we were there was this guy Alan. he did all sorts of things and his role was hard to define, but it was the role that made the place run smoothly.\n\nWe got to talking about how we needed an Alan for the new place.

The new manager was blazing furious when he returned an hour later, ready to fire him. But he soon found out the man couldn't be fired, since the man's job involved picking up small shipments of items we required daily, from a supplier about halfway in from his home an hour outside town. (He did write him up for \"insubordination.\" We all got a good chuckle out of that.)\n\nNot only did my coworker never stop on his way in to work again, he began charging the company for the travel and gasoline expenses to which he had been entitled for years, but had never taken.

            "I'm at the age where I can consider either retirement, or just leave my old job and get a low-paying part-time one doing work that doesn't stress me out (like stocking shelves at a grocery store, which I did in my teens and early 20s).\n\nNow, I have a lot of clients whose accounting and tax work I've done for 30 years or more.  I don't want to leave them flat, so my plan is to make excruciatingly precise notes and procedures--on my laptop.  If I leave under good circumstances, as I expect, they get a download from me (Client K--This is what they send me, this is how I compute sales, this is how I enter the data, this is how I do the payroll reports).  If they give me the boot, I call the client and tell them, \"Well, my old firm has zero idea how to do your work, so you can either stick with them, or wait for me to tell you who I've found who you can trust, who will be armed with my written notes and procedures.\"\n\nI'm not Old Guy, but I have my ways of doing things, and the clients like them.  F\\*\\*k me over at your peril.  Again, I don't anticipate that happening, but in case it does, I'll be ready.",
            "My place is currently in the process of doing something very similar. \n\nWe are a small team, within a larger organisation. Perhaps 30 professionals covering the workload, with about 6 managers and 2 senior managers. Actual work done as always tapering off the higher you go. \n\nThey are implementing a new electronic system which is so bad that other regions who have experienced it are coming out on extensive strikes (and I mean 10 days as a solid block being the opening gambit). So now they come to implement it in our region they announce they are opening up another 20 posts for trainees. \n\nAlmost doubling the size of the team. When there is little capacity to properly train them, and little immediate or obvious need for such a large increase in manpower. \n\nIt's pretty clear what they are expecting, a mass exodus of experienced professionals, to be back filled by cheaper labor. They even downrated the grade of the job in the pay scale by one to ensure they didn't have to pay the newbies the same as me (which for the record is poor pay to begin with)\n\nIt's absolutely obvious what's going to happen. Trainees will be poorly trained by the last few experienced staff on their way out of the door. Most either won't complete the training (bonus for the balance sheet as they stay on low pay in perpetuity until they do) or will leave due to the stress (already starting with the last batch of trainees), along with all the skill and experienced people which kept the place together.",
            "Not defending the new manager at all. But new management is always under pressure to improve and not just maintain the status quo. The real issue is that managers don\u2019t get hired for their management ability, they get hired for their ability to do the job before management. And being the best at stocking beans on a shelf does not translate to being the best at managing people. So they fall back on small details that they can control, time clocks, metrics, paperwork, etc. if you ever have a boss that is a huge micromanager or super into small details that you\u2019d consider unimportant it\u2019s because they don\u2019t actually know how to manage, they just got the job because they were the best at the job before being a manager and now they are trying to figure it out and probably failing.",

I brought this up to him and offered to show him pictures of his progress, which he obliged, so I opened Facebook to show him pictures that I didn\u2019t take. I found out later he had mentioned to his boss that I was on Facebook on company time. That was the beginning of a beautiful relationship, let me tell ya.\n\nETA:  he didn\u2019t like women.
