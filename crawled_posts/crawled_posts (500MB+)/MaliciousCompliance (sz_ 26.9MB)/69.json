        "selftext": "My nephew is really into online gaming.  He knows I am as well so thought I would appreciate this story.  Sorry if some of the details are fuzzy, it is a retelling from something told to me by a hyperactive 16 year old.\n\nCompanies that do online gaming are starting to push back against toxic players that make the game less fun for everyone by issuing bans for racist comments, threats, etc.  Depending on the game it might start with a warning, then a 24 hour ban, then a 7 day ban, then a permanent ban.  A lot of these games are free so a perma banned player could create a new account, but all progress and benefits they earned are lost, so it's still a big deal.  This one game in particular has a forum where players can discuss and appeal bans.  \n\nSo, one day a person posts complaining they received a 24 hour ban for what they considered minor offenses, like saying butts or boobs, and could they check the chat logs to reconsider the temp ban?\n\nTheir response: We checked the chat logs and over the course of that single gaming session you made several racist, homophobic and sexist remarks as well as threatened to go to another player's home and punch them in the face.  We're not sure how we missed that.  The 24 hour ban is overturned.  Your account is now permanently suspended.  Thanks for bringing this to our attention!\n\nEdit: thank you for those who educated me on what being \"a little\" means.  ",

Light would then upgrade the temp suspension to a full account ban as well, we would call it getting smited by Light. It was always hilarious to see toxic players get their just deserts.

It reminded me of a funny story with my mom. \n\nMy mom absolutely *loathed* whenever I cracked my knuckles around her. I can't help myself, it's a bad habit and once I start I have to do all of them. She would constantly yell for me to stop. She would tell me it's bad for me and that I'm gonna get arthritis from doing that. \n\n One day at home I started making my fingers into rice crispy treats; snap, crackle, pop. Mom had enough and snapped herself.\n\n\"I want you to write a 2 page essay about cracking your fingers including about arthritis.  No more than double space, 12 point font and all of that. I don't want you trying anything funny.\"\n\n... Well of course I'm going to try something funny. We wouldn't be here if I didn't... so cue that malicious compliance. \n\nI sat at the computer and pulled open google and typed in \"how cracking your fingers does not cause arthritis\". Turned out that was correct. I had plenty of sources including one guy who cracked his knuckles regularly on one hand and not at all on the other. The other hand got arthritis and the cracking hand did not. I included that, a few other truthful things like it does cause loss of grip but ultimately it was about how it helped prevent arthritis in the long term. \n\nShe took the essay without a word, skimmed it and called it good to my surprise. Couldn't believe I got away with it. \n\nBut\n\nI also remember that it got brought up in a conversation in my adult years before cancer claimed her.\n\nMom: what did I tell you about cracking your knuckles? I had you write an essay on that and everything!\n\nMe: you.... didn't read that did you? \n\nMom: what makes you think that? \n\nMe smiling like a fox in a hen house: cause I wrote it on how it prevents arthritis\n\nMom with surprise Pikachu face: no you didn't! \n\nMe: Cited sources and everything!\n\nMom: you brat!\n\nMe: Apple doesn't fall far from the tree!\n\nI loved my mom.",

I'd show my classmates she wasn't that bad.\n\nthen she walked in. the first thing I tried to do was introduce myself. upon my introduction, as if I hadn't said anything, she ordered me to get to my seat, and that the bell - which had gone off a few minutes earlier at most - meant it was time for class, not chit-chat. a little disappointed but still optimistic, I hurried to my seat without a word, staying attentive and trying to answer any question I could.\n\nnow, I was a very talkative child, overly eager to share everything i knew, (and I was definitely a know-it-all) so every question my hand would shoot up, and sometimes I would simply say it without thinking. this, of course, was a mistake, and had me sent to time-out. this I understood, because I knew I'd spoken out of turn. I asked how long it would be, and she told me ten minutes. I took note of the clock and knew the class would be over in about fifteen minutes and we would be transitioning to another subject, signalled by the bell. I waited patiently by the door, listening under the crack for more of the lesson and waiting for her to let me go. this didn't happen, and class changed over without ceremony.\n\nknowing it had been over 15 minutes now, I knocked on the door to get their attention. I was ignored, so I started knocking on the door more insistently, probably for a few minutes until my knuckles hurt, but it got her attention. when she opened the door, I told her it had been more than 15 minutes and asked if I could learn with the rest of the class. her exact words in response were: no. now you've disturbed the class again and you can stay here until the next period. I tried to understand why her mistake was my fault, and in that time, she closed the door on me again.\n\nI lost it. utterly lost my mind. I don't remember much about the next 10-15 minutes, but I remember screaming as loud as my lungs would allow and and kicking and punching at the thick oak door, protesting and saying that I want to learn over and over again. by the time the principal came to restrain me, I was in hysterics and they had to call my mother to get me to calm down properly while two teachers had to keep me still during my freakout. \n\nto be honest, I don't remember much about the time after that, but as far as I can remember, I never saw that teacher again. quite frankly, I hope the rotten hag was fired on the spot.",

We were a bawling mess. My mom had to work (single mother of 2 boys) and dropped us off at school. I walked in and my shrew of a teacher asked where I had been and explained I was an hour late. I was crying still and a complete fucking mess. I explained in front of everyone my cat had died.

I walked into the back and came to find out that the morning shift did not have a dish washer therefore there was a mountain of dishes. No bueno. On top of all of that, we got slammed that night. \n\nAs a minor, I was required to take a 30 minute break in order to work my full shift (4-10pm I believe). As I clocked out for my break I asked my manager if she could have someone cover my position while I was on break to prevent an even worse situation than was already at hand. She responded \u2018Won\u2019t be able to. You\u2019ll just have to stay late and finish it\u2019.\n\nAn important thing to keep in mind is that this manager was notoriously lazy and unhelpful. She never lended a helping had to get things done faster. She would rather stay 3 hours past close sitting in the office waiting for us to finish our closing duties instead of coming out and helping and getting everything done in a timely manner. She also was not very familiar with child labor laws in Ohio.\n\nSince I was a minor, not only did I have to take a 30 minute break, I also could not work past 11pm on school nights. So after clocking back in from my break, I resumed washing the mountain of dishes that had accumulated. I took my time and didn\u2019t rush to get everything cleaned, but also wasn\u2019t going extremely slow on purpose. \n\n10:59 rolls around and I walk into the office to tell her that I am leaving. She asked \u2018got everything done?\u2019\n\u2018Nope!\u2019 I said. \u2018It\u2019s a Wednesday night. Can\u2019t work past 11pm. Labor laws. I left the water turned on for you. There\u2019s still a lot left!\u2019\n\nThe look on her face was priceless. I clocked out with the biggest smile on my face knowing that she was going to have to leave the office and do something for once.  Asked another manager the next day to see what time she clocked out. 1:15am!",

I remember bugging out one night because someone tossed two french knives in the sink with it tumbling. Found the first one without losing a finger thankfully.

Still had to sweep, wipe down tables, restock a thing or two, and get that laundry folded. And I stressed to her that I was NOT going to leave the morning shift with nothing and make them scramble to get ready. She had everything she needed to be done finished already. So I'm just going at my regular pace (my shift is supposed to end 30 minutes past close). She sat at the desk on her phone clearly miffed that I was still working. If she had lifted a single finger to help me, we would've been out real close to 7 like she wanted.\n\nPart of being a manager is stepping up when your team needs help.",

Since my station was directly next to the sink and i was very good at timing my tasks with the mixer so i could get stuff done while waiting for it, I started doing my own dishes as I went along to stay on top of things. This gradually turned into me doing EVERYONE'S dishes. I didnt mind at first bc if I have no tasks of my own to do Im down to help out others. But it turned into one of MY responsibilities and ended up staying later than everyone else after we closed. My last week there I just stopped doing dishes and at the end of the first night the manager just stared appalled at the mountain of dishes left as everyone walked out. I didnt feel bad bc 1) he knew we didnt have a dishwasher and instead of making sure everyone picked up the slack he just let it all be dumped onto me. 2) he still hadnt put me on payroll so I hadnt been paid. 3) he started me out at a lower wage and saif after a couple of weeks he would give me what I wanted if i was a good worker. And I was as him and the owners said I was the best at that station they'd ever had. learning new stations was also supposed to come with a pay raise. and the dishwasher position alone is paid more bc it sucks. So after 3.5 weeks of no pay I just said I quit. You owe me money and a $4 raise."

Also Thank you to RSlash on youtube for making me realize I have so many stories to share.\n\nHere's my story\n\nWhen I was 15 I got my first paid job working for the fair. It was a pretty big fair that travelled across Canada and along the east coast of the US ending in Florida for Christmas. If you've ever been to the PNE(Pacific National Exhibition), CNE (Canadian National Exhibition), Red River Ex, Calgary Stampede and whatever they call it in Edmonton and Regina, that's the one. I loved this summer job because it was short (only a week as I did not travel) and gave me enough cash to get through the summer. I worked for the privately owned donut vender which tasted better and paid better than the show donut venders.\n\nFast forward 4 years when I decided to travel with the show. I was 19 and it was easier to travel at this point cause I could sign my own forms, and being 19 I needed more money for school and the like. We start in my home city and make our way across the country visiting city after city. We were in Edmonton when our story really begins.\n\nNow the travel crew is pretty small and we hire our bagging/cashier locally. I, along with senior crew members, are in charge of training the baggers, re-oiling the machines, switching out the dough canisters and making sure they are running and putting out donuts in a consistent manner. As I am checking dough levels and teaching a bagger how to efficiently fill bags for the evening rush I hear a commotion behind me.\n\nQue Entitled Woman\n\nKaren: \"No! I want the\u00a0*fresh*\u00a0ones!\u201d\n\nBagger: \u201cMa\u2019am these are fresh, I just made them.\u201d\n\nKaren: \u201cNo, I want them to be fresh. Make me new ones, I didn't see you make those, they could be old.\u201d It was 9 in the morning. At this point in the day, most donuts are made to order so those donuts wouldn't have been older than 5 minutes.\n\nThe Bagger calls me to turn on his machine to start the donuts. These machines are so temperamental and really old because the owner built them himself many moons ago. But I love them cause they make perfect donuts that travel in a circular conveyor belt in 400-degree oil. They're a lot of fun to watch. I start the machine and scoop out the first few rejects and make 15 donuts.\n\nThe donuts fall off the belt into the glass case and the bagger slots them into the sugar and into a bag.\n\nHe hands them to her and she dramatically sighs\n\nKaren: \u201cuuuugh, No. I want the fresh ones and those have touched the old ones. How do I know you didn't mix them up. I don't believe they're fresh. I want\u00a0*FRESH* DONUTS!\u201d\n\nBagger: \u201cMa\u2019am those are fresh. I made sure to pick only the new ones out.\u201d\n\nAgain she huffs and puffs, so I fire up the machine again, scoop out the rejects and make 15 donuts. This time I grab the new bag and place the bag right under the shoot so the donuts have no choice but to fall into the bag. They do I hand it to the bagger and walk away just to have to turn around again.\n\nKaren: \u201cNo I want the one\u2019s directly out of the oil, that way I know they're fresh. Those ones have cooled down and are not fresh anymore.\"\n\nMe: \u201cSorry ma\u2019am but that is against the policy, the oil is 400 degrees, and besides, they\u2019re not done cooking\u201d\n\nKaren: \u201cI want the fresh ones! Get me your supervisor.\u201d\n\nMy \u201csupervisor\u201d is off doing supervisor things, and I don\u2019t feel like calling her. She\u2019s also a lifer and doesn\u2019t take flack from anyone and I know if I call her, and she\u2019s busy, this woman will leave crying. So to avoid this and say\n\n\u201cI am the supervisor on duty right now and the policy states we can\u2019t give you donuts from the oil.\u201d There is no policy but its common fucking sense.\n\nKaren: \u201cI have been a patron of this company for so many plus years. I have never been denied a fresh donut. this is so unprofessional! I want to talk to the owner right now!\u201d\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m on day 5 of this show and we work an hour before open to an hour after the close (depending on the show and after some new laws, roughly 16 hours daily).\n\nI\u2019m tired of her and in general. That's when I get a brilliant idea. I smile,\n\nMe: \u201cthere is no need for that, I will get you your\u00a0*FRESH*\u00a0donuts.\u201d\n\nI start up the machine again and discard the rejects. I then grab a bag and let the donuts plop into the oil for half a second and scoop them out immediately. Not long enough to get hot, but also not long enough to hold a shape. I then take the bag of dough and sprinkle in some cinnamon sugar and say as sugary as I can muster \u201chere you go, sorry for the inconvenience, enjoy the rest of your day.\u201d\n\nShe smiles smugly having thought she got her way. About 10 paces later she stuck her hand into the bag and I hear a squeal, a snarl and then swearing.\n\nThat\u2019s when Gregg (not his real name), one of the senior machine guys, returned from his break. Gregg was a FUCKING LEGEND when it comes to dealing with Karen's. He makes it a hobby to seek them out for fun on his breaks so he can tear into them. He once told a heavy customer in a scooter he would not sell her 50 bags of donuts because he didn\u2019t want to be responsible for her coronary and could not have that on his heart and that she should take her business to the other donut stall. He can be quite savage. I don't condone his behaviour and sometimes he scares me but this is also why I like working under him because it means Karen's never get away with their shit.\n\nThe women came storming back and demanded a refund and demanded I be fired. He asked why and she screamed, \u201cTHAT BITCH SOLD ME A BAG OF DOUGH!\u201d\n\nGregg asked me if that was true. I smile sheepishly and said yes and explained she did not want the fresh donuts off the belt she wanted the fresh donuts from the oil and would not leave till I gave them to her.\n\nGregg turned to her and said \u201csorry for that but we don\u2019t issue refunds to dumbasses so take your fresh donuts and leave before I start pelting you with these donuts. You have 5 seconds. 5, 4, 3...\" She tried to huff and puff at which point he took the bag of donuts she did not want and began pelting her with them.\n\nAfter she left he told me he was proud of me and would let the Boss know. I got an extra hundred bucks in my per diem for that week.",

That paperwork has to be submitted in a timely manner or the facility goes from $700/day to $200/day (just tossing numbers out. Don't remember the amount) This is important in a second.\n\nI worked for a facility that I loved. The people were wonderful. It was like a huge family. The staff ate their meals with patients, the independent people visited often, and our bosses were easy to approach. Then the bosses retired. At the same time.\n\nOur board then decided that maybe we would make more money if we hired a management company. All of these changes happened within weeks of each other.\n\nThey hired a traveling nurse to head up the skilled nursing unit for a year. We didn't react well to her. She never smiled, she would just look  at you if you asked a question, and she decided that new rules (that didn't apply to her) were needed.\n\nShortly after her hiring she began firing everybody. It was like a war zone had erupted on the floor! Nobody smiled, no laughter, no visitors, no family meals and loads of stress.\n\nI was the last one fired. Oh I had been written up (zero write ups when she walked in) for things like cell phone in the floor (my pocket), drink on my desk in my office (water) and filling a certification form late (doctor signed it the day it was due but they photocopied it before I had left for the doctor's office). So they had their three write ups.\n\nAt 1500 on Friday the administrator calls me into his office. I'm informed that I've been terminated. I'm floored. I work my ass off. I am actually great at my job! I've been there seven years. I'm escorted to my office to gather my stuff. They have turned off my computer, asked for my passwords and escorted me from the building. \n\nHere's where the malicious compliance comes in. \n\nThey called me in to fire me just as I was creating the packet to send to Medicare. I was never able to send it. They never asked if things were situated since it was Friday. I volunteered no information. \n\nRemember that timely manner? Well that Friday was the very last day to submit about 30 different forms. Most were 14 day assessments that literally covered 14 days! Billing (friend) called and let me know that the default cost over $100,000 by the time they figured everything out.\n\n\nEdit: the passwords they needed were system admin. I ran two different systems for the campus. They couldn't access either without the password. As for my other passwords? Hell no. Which includes the filing one which created a longer delay! \n\nTL:DR job fires me at the wrong time and costs them over $100,000.",

            "When I lived in El Paso I bought my first car (%18.9 interest on a 5 year old cobalt), I had no clue about how to go about insurance. So, the dealer \"helped\" me find one, Fred Loya, it was almost $200 a month, this was back in 2009. But, me being dumb, I agreed to the insurance after he convinced me that when I turn 25, about 6 months from when i bought it, that the insurance will go down significantly. So, i went there the day after my birthday, all happy that i was going to save some money, and they told me that it was not stated in my contract that it would be decrease based off of me turning 25. I then said, I want to cancel my insurance and go with someone else, they then began speaking in Spanish (which I do not understand, and they would do this a lot if I asked them a question). They then decided, out of their generosity, to give me a $10 decrease, which is not significant at all. I decided to stay with them, because again I was dumb at this stage of my life, and when i deployed to Iraq for 1 year I was paying my regular price on the insurance, after telling my boss about this he told me there is such a thing called storage insurance, since my car was in a car holding area, where people would start it every day and make sure everything was ok while i was deployed, that the insurance place would only charge storage insurance fee, not the regulars price. This was after being there for 2 months that I figured this out, so i decided to contact the insurance place. They \"thanked\" me for my service and protecting our country, but unfortunately the only way to change the type of insurance i have, is to go there in person.......... I am sitting 1000's of miles away in the 120 heat, and they have the disrespect to tell me that they are thankful for my service, but can't do anything unless I go there in person. This resulted in me paying them almost 200 a month for a year of my car sitting in a parking garage. (if they did change it to storage insurance, it would have been 35 a month).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey are the worst, most deceitful business i have used while i was in the military.

            "Sounds like you were an insurance agent who knew what you were talking about and gave good advice.\n\nIn my experience, that is not always the case. Two stories of my experiences with incompetent insurance agents:\n\n1.) Decades ago, I moved from one US state to another. My old insurance would only cover me for the first 30 days in the new state.\n\nI got busy on the telephone, calling around to arrange new coverage. An \"Everystate\" agent in my new state offered coverage at a reasonable price. He said he was \"binding\" coverage over the telephone and would mail me the paperwork. He said I was covered from the moment I hung up the phone.\n\nI had never heard of binding coverage over the phone. I wanted proof in writing. So, I waited for the new policy to arrive in the mail before cancelling my old policy. When a week passed with no policy in the mail, I called the Everystate agent back. He lied through his teeth to me and claimed that he had never agreed to bind coverage for me at all. Turned out he had not done anything to even begin processing my new insurance. I didn't want to do business with a liar, so I took time off work to go in person to a different agent's office to arrange coverage with proof in writing, and only then cancelled my old insurance.\n\nBut what would have happened if I had believed and trusted the lying Everystate agent, and then had an accident?\n\n2.) More recently I bought a newer car and then sold my old car to \"John,\" a friend of our family. We filled out the paperwork so John could transfer the title to his name at the courthouse. *As is legal in our state*, we checked the box on the title transfer form telling the state that my old license plates remained on the car.\n\nThe next morning I called our current insurance company's call center to have the old car removed from our policy. The agent who answered my call got agitated when I told him the license plates had stayed with the car. He told me (incorrectly) that that was illegal in our state and that he was going to have to report me to the DMV for breaking the law. (I'm not making this up.)\n\nThe agent and I went round and round a few times over this. (He couldn't explain why the title transfer form had a box to check whether I was keeping the plates on the car or removing them. He couldn't explain why I had left plates on cars I had sold in this state in the past without any problem. He just kept saying I'd broken the law and he was going to report me.)\n\nI finally said that he could just go right ahead and report me to the state, but I wanted him to confirm that he was taking the old car off the policy first. Before he would do that, he said he needed to confirm some policy details with me.\n\nThe agent proceeded to accuse me of lying when I gave the estimated mileage I thought I'd be driving in the newer car. (I'm retired. I don't go many places in my less-nice car because if we're going to go on a trip we would take my wife's nicer car. We report higher estimated  mileage on her car and less estimated mileage on mine.)\n\nAt that point I had had enough. I hung up on the call center employee.\n\nLooking back, I wish I had called back and filed a complaint.\n\nInstead, I just called back and spoke with a different agent. When I explained what had happened in the previous call, the second agent agreed with me that leaving the license plates on the car when it is sold is completely legal in my state. She also took a look at my estimated mileage in the newer car and told me that she believed me when I explained how I'd come up with the number. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe whole point of telling those two stories was to say that I've found that I cannot always trust what an insurance agent tells me.",

They would argue. I'd advise that if they booked a basic rental upon pick up they would be required to pay triple the amount for insurance compared to what I would charge them up front. They would argue thinking I was trying to upsell them. I made no commission and would explain that.

Between titling, lax insurance and registration requirements no wonder everyone has to sue one another to ensure your personal rights are maintained. In Canada when you buy a car you own it outright, you do not also need to get the title. The previous owner surrenders all rights to the vehicle, and while turning in plates is voluntary you have to cancel the registration.\n\nThe new owner has to show proof of ownership (Bill of Sale) and proof of active insurance (Pink Card) to be issued new or transfer existing plates and register the vehicle. Being caught without current registration is an immediate fine, being caught without insurance is a **big** fine and a license suspension. Registrations must be renewed annually. \n\nIs it a pain in the ass? Yes. Is it a big expense? Yes. But it is also a process that ensures every vehicle on the road is insured so that accidents are largely appropriately covered, of course there are exceptions, but you don\u2019t need to sue the guy that hit you in the Wendy\u2019s drive-thru to get your car fixed because he chose not be a responsible vehicle operator.\n\nCan someone explain to me the rationale behind the lax US standards for vehicular ownership and operation?",

        "selftext": "Arkansas has well known laws that lean heavily on the side of the property owner which leaves the renter pretty vulnerable to owners who want to be difficult to say the least. Or at least they did when I lived there, I doubt much has changed since.\n\nSo I move into town and find a 2/2 apartment, intending for it to be a short period of time while I scout the town and look for a more permanent place. As for paying rent, they wouldn\u2019t/couldn\u2019t take an automatic monthly check from my bank or charge my debit card monthly, it had to be a paper check from me, with a 4 day late fee window. I hate writing checks and I had the cash so I paid out the 12 month lease all at once. \n\nI find a great place about 6 months later, thinking I\u2019ll just break my lease and pay the extra one month penalty and walk away from my apartment. I call and let them know I\u2019ll be moving out, long conversation short, the way the lease is written makes you think that\u2019s how it works when in reality, at a second or third read, I\u2019m still liable for the entire 12 month lease, and to break the lease essentially adds a 13th month worth of rent money. Knowing that upfront, why anybody would break a lease is beyond me. \n\nSo at this point I\u2019ve already made the deposits on my new place when all this comes to light so I\u2019m stuck with two places. I tell the apartment complex I won\u2019t be moving out, figure I\u2019ll just go ahead and let the lease run out, set the AC to 80, and open the breakers to keep costs low. I slowly move my stuff to my new place since I have plenty of time now and in the end I leave behind my ironing board and iron just to leave something and I never really use them anyways.\n\nAbout 2 months later I get a call from the power company asking if it\u2019s okay to transfer power into somebody else\u2019s name. Shocked, I reply, \u201cAbsolutely not\u201d, while laughing a little on the inside. I decide to give it a day before I call the apartment complex. First thing the next morning I get a call from the apartment complex and with a super snarky entitled tone I hear \u201cWe need you to drop the power from your name so the new tenant can take over and move in.\u201d I explain that I still have an active lease on the place and can\u2019t fathom why they\u2019d rent it out. She accuses me of abandonment and therefore she is allowed to rent the apartment. My reply went along the lines of, \u201cI rent that apartment with the sole intent of having somewhere to iron my clothes. Did you not see my iron and ironing board there?\u201d She said she did and she took it to the office to get it out of the apartment.\n\nWe go back and forth on the semantics for a little. I let her know that I\u2019m open to receiving a refund to the date on the new tenants lease and at that time I\u2019d be happy to drop my name from the power. She refused and the call ended with getting her boss\u2019s number from corporate. After mentioning to her boss that I can recognize a breach of contract when I see it, and that nowhere in the lease does it say I actually have to live there, not to mention her employee admitted to entering my apartment and stealing items of mine from inside. She quickly assured me they are putting a check in the mail that day refunding my money to the first of that month and told me I could go to the office to pick up my iron and board anytime. \n\nYes I know they could have run up the power bill but they\u2019d only be able to do so much really and a few days isn\u2019t that huge, and they didn\u2019t do it anyways. Even if they had it would still be worth the expense considering the refund.",

            "I used to work at an apartment complex and if something like this happened, we would offer to sublet the apartment. We would have leasers move home for the remainder of the summer and essentially clean out the apartment. But we would never just move in a new person while the original lease is active lol, that's illegal in my state. We would arrange for original leasehold to relinquish the lease and sublet to the new person (with permission!), it was a win win for the person moved out and the person moving in because original owner no longer had to pay for the apt once it was taken over. \n\nIt was always more difficult to claim they had abandoned, so for them to do that leads me.to believe they wanted to double dip.",
            "Even with states that favor the landlord, double dipping is still illegal, and that's what this would have been. They absolutely would have been on the hook if you reported that they were renting out the apartment you had a signed lease for. \n\nIt would have also triggered a major audit for them.",
            "Ahh Arkansas. Where Tenants and Employees have 0 rights and can be fucked over at any time for any reason.",
            "I'm sure a lot of people have a crappy landlord story, so I'll contribute mine.  \n\nMy lease had an early termination option of 60 days notice + 1 month rent.  So basically, I wanted to move out immediately and knew I'd be on the hook for 3 months rent.  Both I and the current property manager (PM) were OK with this, so I went ahead and gave written notice and agreed to pay the full amount in installments.\n\n1 month before \"move out\" date, I showed up to the office to pay (part 2 of 3) on the empty apartment and chatted with the PM.  She told me a new owner had bought the complex and laid off everyone but her, and she figured she was next.  \n\nSure enough, on move-out day next month, I show up for the move-out inspection and to pay the final $650 termination fee.  But, nobody is in the office.  It's closed and locked with a new company logo and phone number taped to the door.\n\nI tried to call the apartment complex phone first, and it just rang and went to a full mailbox with the old PM's voicemail message still on it.  They hadn't even bothered to change it or forward the old phone number to the new company.  I called the new number and it's a 3rd party property management company.  They had no idea who I was or that I was due to move out that day.  What pissed me off was that they refused to send anyone out and refused to re-schedule a move-out inspection (which I knew is illegal in my state) and told me to just drop the keys in the box. They said nothing about the early termination fee, so I didn't feel the need to mention it and just dropped the keys in as instructed.\n\nSince the new PM company was already being shady and disorganized on my very first interaction with them, I had a few hunches.  First, they probably didn't know I owed them more money (ETF fee) than they owed me (security deposit).  Second, they probably were going to dick me out of my deposit.  And third, they probably weren't going to follow the state's security deposit laws.  In my state, if a landlord doesn't refund your deposit they have 30 days to notify you in writing of why they kept it.  If they don't do this, they legally owe you 3x the deposit.\n\nIt's now been 2 months, and my hunches paid off.  They haven't returned my security deposit and haven't provided me anything in writing.  If they had just followed the law in the first place and did the walk-through inspection with me, I probably would have handed them the $650 check I had already prepared along with the keys.  And they probably never would have refunded my $300 security deposit either.  But since they didn't provide me anything in writing, they now legally owe me $900 while I only owe them $650.  By not following the rental laws, they actually saved me from paying that ETF fee.\n\nSorry for the super long comment.\n\nTL;DR: New owner fires their staff, hires a shitty property management company to replace them, and misses out on up to $950 from me because of it.  And since they broke the law, they actually owe me money now.",

            "My old apartment complex tried something similar. I bought a house but still had two months left on the lease. They didnt want to release it so I paid the last two months and moved out almost everything. Knowing the manager would try some bullshit, I checked on the place a few times and didnt plan to clean it completely until the end of the last month. One day I went to check and found the maintenance guy was working on prepping the place for new tenants. I moved all his stuff out and let them know we weren't done there. They had changed the key to enter the building but not the apartment so I got the new key fob from the maintenance guy and told him we would clean it at the end of the lease. \n\nThe bitch manager knew she was wrong and tried to let the maintenance guy take all the blame telling him I moved out even though I still had stuff there. He was apologetic even though it wasn't his fault. She really thought I would let them get the place ready while I still paid for it.",
            "I had a landlord try and keep my deposit and pay the last 2 months of my lease. \n\n This was after a hurricane Ike tore off part of the roof and destroyed pretty much everything I owned at the time. \n\nHe was going to fix it back up but did want to loose out on the 2 month rent during repairs and tried to claim my dog  destroyed the wood floors - not the 6 inches of rain that sat in there for a week.",

            "Read the contract once more carefully. Your landlord might owe you now one month rent for breaking the lease.\n\nThe clause in its form is probably meant for tenants who break their lease and refuse to pay for the remaining month. This gives the landlord a way to recoup legal cost if he has to go after them.",
            "The same thing sorta happened to me in Los Angeles!  I was living with my then-boyfriend at the time at an apartment that we signed a year lease for. Four or so months into our lease, we broke up. I moved out within 1-2 weeks and he did the same. We told our landlord that we were going to break our lease and were going to have to pay an enormous fee for doing so. We had until the end of the month to vacate and pay the fee. A week before the end of the month, I go back to the apartment to clean up a bit with the cleaning supplies I left there and the entire apartment was empty. I called the apartment complex and they said they noticed we had moving trucks there earlier so assumed we had left the items in the apartment as trash and they wanted us to charge us another fee for leaving the apartment dirty. We had left a vacuum, a bunch of cleaning supplies, and a grill on the balcony that still needed to be picked up. All gone and never to be recovered. So they had gone into my apartment without notice, stolen our stuff, and never gave it back. Long story short, the fee for breaking the lease was waived and we got a month\u2019s rent back. Along with fair-compensation for the items lost.",

            "I'm not sure how long ago this happened and if it's worthwhile to you, but you could take a few minutes to read over the landlord-tenant statues in Arkansas.  I once had a landlord try to keep my full security deposit because they were upset that I invoked a clause in my lease to terminate halfway through the lease when I opted to take a job out of state. \n\n I advised them under the laws of that state it's not legal to collect rent from two tenants for the same rental at the same time.  I'd vacated before the end of the month but had paid through the end of the month.  They moved tenants in there a day after I moved out and charged them a prorated rent for the remainder of that month.  They'd double collected rent for that last week and a half of the month.",
            "I\u2019m trying to figure out why you didn\u2019t try to sublet it. We had to bail once on a 1 year lease after 3 months as we were going onto build but ended up buying. It was easy. I told the property manager the situation, advertised and found a renter myself, got them the contracts from the property manager, collected the first and last for them, and off we went.

            ">the way the lease is written makes you think that\u2019s how it works when in reality, at a second or third read, I\u2019m still liable for the entire 12 month lease, and to break the lease essentially adds a 13th month worth of rent money. Knowing that upfront, why anybody would break a lease is beyond me.\n\nNAL AFIK all states require the landlord to mitigate your loss, so if you break a lease and leave within two months in, after communicating it with required notice, it\u2019s up to the landlord to repair whatever needs repairing and find another renter.  If the other renter can move in say for example on what would have been month 4th of your lease, then you\u2019re out 5 months of rent and whatever other fees and whatever was itemized on your security deposit.  Not the 13 months.\n\nAbandonment is a valid reason to terminate a lease typically.  Whether or not you paid for the whole term.\n\nIt actually sounds like your misunderstanding of the above made this more challenging to get your money back.",

It's 'reasonable' food at the cheaper end of the scale, and ok when you're not looking for a posh dining experience or anything.\n\nThere was a daytime 'soft drink, salad bar buffet, main course & dessert' offer on which came to \u00a330 for two people. A bargain, which we ordered.\n\nThe food turned out to be pretty good; we made more than one trip to the buffet and suffice to say by the time we'd finished our main courses we didn't feel we needed the dessert, so I instead asked the server for the bill.\n\nThe bill arrives and we have been charged an additional \u00a39 for \u00a339 in total.

You can bring them over, we won't eat them, and you can get the \u00a39 knocked off the bill for us?\"\n\n\nAt this point the server looks at me with a bewildered look and says she'll get the manager. My other half who is more of a shrinking violet in these situations is looking a little uncomfortable. A few moments later the manager comes over and asks why we don't want to pay! I explain that I do, but I don't expect to pay *more* for saving waste but by all means to bring over the desserts and we will leave them there on the table when we leave. Comprehending this she agrees to just charge us for the meal deal.\n\n*Edit*\nJesus Christ Reddit, I get it!; \"You would have requested the desserts to be boxed up and taken them home for later\".

        "selftext": "Edit: Title should read.\"Wasting her time\" not \"wearing her tone\". Sorry. Super tired from work when I wrote this and I missed the autocorrect.\n\nSo I work as a mover for a very small moving company. My boss, let's call him Mike, is a really nice guy. It's really just a two-man operation, with me working as a subcontractor under him with a few regular guys we call in for bigger moves.\n It's really physically demanding work sometimes, but typically our customers are super nice and the pay is pretty good. Most people are just happy to have someone else to lift their heavy stuff and get it into a truck. And we're always super careful to not cause ANY DAMAGE to the buildings we're moving in and out of or the items we're moving, which most people appreciate. \n\nNot this lady. Let's call her Darcy.\n\nSo Darcy booked a move with Mike, and told him she had a small storage unit she wanted us to load up into a 20 foot truck. We said \"no problem!\". As the date of her move approached, though, so did a huge snow storm. \n\nDays before her move the news started reporting that the weather was expected to take a severe turn for the worst. Not uncommon for the time of year in our state, but also something not to be trifled with. \n\nWe called Darcy a couple days before the move to see about rescheduling to avoid the storm and she said she absolutely HAD to move that day, no other days would work. A lot of (probably much smarter) movers would have cancelled, but after talking, Mike and I thought it was no big deal. We move in the snow all the time. Just meant we would have to dress appropriately and be extra careful not to injure ourselves or damage any property. \n\nCut to the day of the move. We get to Darcy's storage unit, expecting a 10x10x15 standard storage unit full of your usual stuff based on what she'd indicated on the phone, and load it into a 20 foot truck. That's a pretty easy job to get done in the 2 hours that she'd already prepaid for.\n\nAs we pulled up the snow was already coming down pretty heavily, and the first thing that made us nervous was the truck. Instead of a 20 foot truck, there was a HUGE 26 foot truck. Darcy greeted us by the truck and showed us the storage unit.\n\n*Darcy*: Okay! So, this is our unit. We shut down our businesses and I'm moving it out of town to pursue other opportunities, and I need all of this loaded up in 2 hours. The last movers I had got it unloaded in about that long. \n\nMike said something about the truck being bigger than she told us. \n\n*Darcy*: Yeah, it's the biggest one Uhaul had. Last time we used a another company and it was much bigger. I'm worried about getting it all, but you guys will have to figure it out. I *need* all of it.\n\nThis was a **HUGE** storage unit. Like the kind you'd store a few cars or some farm equipment in. When we opened it up it was filled with what appeared to be the contents of a couple of pretty decently sized businesses. A dozen of those huge floor-to ceiling filling cabinets, several desks, office chairs, some really huge glass tables. And all of it was *incredibly heavy*.\n\nNow, our company safety guidelines for weight limits are 100lbs per person lifting an item, but there's no real practical way to enforce that in the field, so we usually wind up using our best judgement, even if the item is over that limit. Nearly everything there was over limit, but we had our equipment and we were pretty confident we could handle everything, weight-wise. Mike and I are both pretty strong. But in my estimation, this was definitely going to take a bit longer than 2 hours.\n\nMike told her that we would do our absolute best. To be fair, he should have leveled with her then and there that it would take a bit more time, but he probably wanted to see if we could just get it busted out as quick as possible and see where we were at before getting the customer needlessly worried. \n\nDarcy sat in her truck nearly the whole time we were working, so she could stay warm. Perfectly understandable since it was -2\u00b0F outside and the snow was coming down pretty hard. Though she'd occasionally roll down her window to offer up critiques. Mostly about how much time we were taking going up and down the metal ramp of the truck, which was now COVERED in ice and snow.\n\nAbout an hour and some change into the move, Darcy gets out of her truck and starts chatting with Mike about her previous movers, and how they did cause some damage to her stuff, but they were SO fast. It was weird. She went back and forth between complaining about them and praising them for their speed. And she kept referring to them as \"the *professional* moving service I hired\", which really bugged me, because the way she said it seemed to be implying that because we aren't a big national company like Mayflower, then somehow Mike and I weren't professional movers. Despite the fact that this is literally our full-time jobs.\n\nNow we're far enough into this move that we could tell this was going to run long. Mike decides it's a good idea to let her know that it's probably going to take a half hour or so longer than expected (which was still a feat, considering how much there was to move and how well-packed this truck was. I pride myself on playing a mean game of Truck Tetris). \n\nDarcy was NOT having this. She started to get upset and started saying how we were just trying to get more money out of her, and we were \"Dilly Dallying\" (yes, those words actually left the mouth of a grown woman). Then she starts in on how \"the *professional* movers got this same stuff unloaded in 2 hours, it should take the same time to load it!\"\n\nMike explains to her that unloading always takes less time than loading, because you're moving it into a bigger space and you don't have to pack and pad the stuff to fit into a truck. \n\nI also mention that there's literally a blizzard coming down, and we're only going to go a little over. \n\nShe gets quiet and seething. Mike can tell how angry she is and let's her know we won't charge her for any extra time since it's not her fault the weather is crappy. He also brings up that they damaged her stuff, and we've done a pretty good job.\n\n*Darcy*:I don't CARE! YOU SAID TWO HOURS, I EXPECT IT DONE! JUST GET IT DONE! I'm going to leave you guys a TERRIBLE review!\n\nShe stomps back to her truck without saying a word.\n\nI'm usually pretty chill, but I was already getting increasingly mad at this woman. Her yelling at my boss and calling us lazy when we were risking our health and safety to move her stuff in a blizzard was just too much for me. \n\nMike thinks about this for a moment. I know customer reviews are super important to us as a small business. The booking site we use highlights the last handful of reviews, so a bad one takes FOREVER to stop showing up as basically the first thing people see when they click on your page. So I'm expecting Mike to try and keep her happy, but instead he just grins and turns to me\n\n*Mike*: Fuck it. You heard her!\n\nCue malicious compliance.\n\nShe wanted it all loaded in 2 hours? That's exactly what we'd do.\n\nThe front half of her truck was loaded up neatly, with everything padded and stacked tightly floor-to ceiling to keep it from moving on the road. I pride myself on my ability to load a truck properly and safely without wasting any space. The second half of her truck was the worst, jankiest truck I've ever loaded in my life. We're talking huge heavy office furniture haphazardly stacked on top of each other at the weirdest angles. Heavy stuff on top of light stuff, anything to just get the storage unit empty and the truck door closed. We even stacked REALLY heavy office chairs on top of glass table tops.By the end of it, the truck looked like you'd asked Escher or Giger to draw you a picture of an office.\n\nI just wanna be clear, we've never intentionally damaged a customer's property, and we never would. We pride ourselves on our professionalism, courtesy, and specifically our ability to get your stuff where it's going safely. But the particular combination of unsafe conditions and this lady's outright disregard for our safety and feelings was just too much. And technically we didn't damage anything. Nothing was broken when we closed the truck doors. But literally the first bump in the road or decently tight turn was definitely going to cause hundreds, maybe even thousands of dollars in damage. \n\n We closed the truck door and walked over to Darcy's truck and let her know. \n\nMike went to her truck. He told her that we were done and that he wasn't going to charge her at all for the move. She insisted that \"She's not poor, and doesn't need charity\" and Mike just said that it was clear that she wasn't happy, and that he didn't need her $150 (that's right, we charge $75/hr, so the extra half hour we needed to do it right would have cost her a whopping $37). \n\nHe cancelled the job and refunded her what she'd already prepaid. \n\nAs we drove away in Mike's car, I looked at him. \n\n*Me*: You realize that by the time she gets where she's going, she's looking at a LOT of damaged furniture, right? She's going to hit us with a bad review and maybe even try to sue.\n\n*Mike*: She was worried about paying an extra $37. I doubt she'll risk more money on hiring a lawyer. And besides, you can't leave a review on the site if the job gets cancelled. We just gave her exactly what she wanted. And besides, it's worth losing out on the money I would have made just to see her face when I said I didn't need her $150. \n\nWhen he dropped me off he still paid me for my time because \"Fuck that lady\". My boss, Mike, is a really nice guy.",

I just went with different movers the next time around, and I was very happy for it.\n\nI always strive to treat people doing me these kinds of favors with respect, even if it's \"just a job\" to them. I'm not willing to drive a large truck, and at times, I haven't been able to move/lift some of my heavier boxes (filled with books). I am just so glad & grateful there is someone out there willing to do both for me. I'm especially unwilling to do either during a snow storm, and I definitely wouldn't ask someone else to do it during a snow storm, either. That just seems like a recipe for disaster.\n\nI am glad you & Mike were able to be safe during this adventure! And I hope your other customers are nicer than that bitch.",
