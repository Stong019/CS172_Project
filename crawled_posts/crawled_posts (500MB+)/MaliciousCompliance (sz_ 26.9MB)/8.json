One rainy day, my partner and I got dispatched to a fairly upscale neighborhood on a call of \u201cchest pain.\u201d Chest pain means flashing lights and sirens.\n\nWe quickly arrive in front of a pretty nice house and find a woman standing at the curb with two suitcases packed (already a red flag!) I shut down the siren but kept the lights going for safety.\n\nWe ask if she called 911 and she confirms. She steps into the ambulance, sits on the bench, and asks us to get going. I tell her we need to do a full work up before we leave, so we can provide care en route and take her to the right facility. She says she doesn\u2019t really have chest pain, she has a procedure scheduled at the hospital, and she wants me to turn off the flashing lights so her neighbors don\u2019t notice and ask her questions.\n\nObviously, this is EMS abuse, and I tell her so. Suddenly her chest pain is back! So I say I need to get vitals and start an ECG. She protests again, mentioning the start time for her appointment in less than thirty minutes, and so I ask her point blank: do you need medical attention or do we need the police?\n\nI proceeded to do a full work up, in front of her house, taking my sweet ass time, asking enough questions to make her eyes roll, and leaving the strobe lights on the whole time so the neighbors would see. \n\nAnd she was late to her appointment because we admitted her to the hospital through the ER instead of the front doors.",

            "Similar MC: \n\nNight shift on the bandaid wagon. We get a lot of calls arising from police encounters, usually involving warrants/arrests, that suddenly precipitate urgent medical issues; it's a well established fact that hospitals have more comfortable beds and better turkey sandwiches than jail, and if you're lucky, your offence/warrant is relatively minor, and the police department is busy, they won't have the resources to hold you in custody through a 3 hour chest pain workup in the ER. Get out of jail free card.\n\nGet dispatched emergently to a call for difficulty breathing and chest pain adter unsuccessfully running from police. On arrival, young 20s dude clearly not in medical distress, prefect vital signs. Insists he needs eval at hospital. Shift has been long, full of BS and abuse, and this call is holding the unit over past shift end time. \n\nCue MC:\n\nIn my area there is often kind of an unspoken understanding, for better or worse, when it comes to emergent incarceritis calls- you do the assessment, keep treatments minimal while fulfilling ethical and legal requirements, transport quickly and try to free up the resources for actual emergencies. The (medically stable) subject is often directed to triage if ER is busy, then walks out after EMS leaves and before being admitted to a room. That's definitely what the expectation was in this case. Wasn't having it. Chest pain / diff breathing differential is heart attack, arrhythmias, blood clots in lungs, collapsed lung, etc. Full assessment, cardiac monitor, 12 lead ekg, vascular access. Dude gets all confused why he's suddenly covered in wires and getting stuck with needles. \"Sir, the symptoms you're telling us are highly concerning for conditions that are immediately life threatening, we are taking you at your word and taking every measure to ensure your safety and survival.\" Deliver him to ER and he has to go to a room due to IV in place and cardiac monitoring. Nurse is pissed off but police are entertained and decide they have the resources to sit with the fellow thru his workup to give moral support and make sure he comes out ok. Oh and to take him the rest of the way to jail when he gets discharged, that too.",

            "We had one woman who would call 911 with an emergency every time her husband had an appointment because his chair lift from the porch to the driveway was broken and she didn't want to spend the money to get it fixed. So she'd just have whoever responded carry him out. Eventually we (fire dept) were the ones called for a lift assist, and unbeknownst to anyone else at the station, one of our guys who responded managed a quick fix on the lift, but told her it wasn't going to last and she needed to have it repaired. A couple months later she calls the station and demands we come out and fix that lift again because XXX ambulance was coming to transport him and they refuse to lift him anymore.  She was nasty right from the get-go and I ended up taking her number and telling her I'd call her back. After a bunch of phone calls, I found out the above, PLUS XXX ambulance was *not* coming to transport - that company is owned by one of our officers, I called him and he immediately recognized the address  and said they were blacklisted. Long story short, one of our higher ups ended up calling her back and telling her to fix her own damn chair lift, and our guys were told, do *not* do repairs on things anymore.  No good deed goes unpunished.",

            "In BC natives get free ambulance rides.\nMy best friend is from a reservation in the middle of the province.\n\nThere's a casino in town, on a Friday night it's apparently common to call for chest pains right after lunch. The bandaid buss drives all the way out to the reserve, the old guy gets loaded in, and his concerned wife gets in the front.\nBack into town to the hospital, and a short exam to get an all clear, then they go to dinner and then the casino.\n\nI have no personal knowledge, but my friend used to rant about it constantly because he knew the persons doing it, and it twice delayed his grandmother getting urgent care.\n\nI always thought the local health region should just pay for a mini bus to go to the reserve before dinner, and come back at midnight.

            "TL:DR - try using Ambulance as a taxi, end up further away from home as a result.\n\nI worked in a small town in WA, Australia. Our ambulance service (volunteers) had problems with a certain sub-group of the population using them as a taxi - they would call up with some complaint in town B, and be transported the 20 min drive to the (small) Emergency Department in town A > The ED was staffed by private doctors- we'd get called in to assess the patients, 15 min drive each way, paid for by State Government. More often than not, they'd disappear out of the ED before we got in, so we'd get out of bed, drive in, and there's no patient - no patient seen = no pay.\n\n There's another larger town, town C, B-C being about equidistant with  A-B. I asked the local ambulance volunteers to get the \"patient\" to tell them their home address before they got transported \"for identification\". If they gave an address in town A, they were assessed as \"high risk\" and taken to the larger ED in town C. If their address was town C, they'd be taken to the smaller ED in town A (unless they had some serious complaint- rare occurrence, but no-one was put at risk). Either way, they'd end up 30 miles/40 km further from their home address. A lot of the local families who did this were also well known to the volunteers, so a false address didn't help them. Took about 2 weeks - no more false callouts!!",

We had a list of patients that we would not respond too if they called because of EMS abuse. If they called 911 PD was automatically dispatched before us and if it was legitimate then we would be dispatched.

And he would intentionally under water the bush so the peppers would be as hot as they could be...\n\nWhen he would bring us the peppers, I would grind them (seeds and all) into a nice paste which I would combine with our suicide sauce and keep to the side for when our spicy wing coneseurs would show up and complain about the suicide sauce not being hot enough. \n\nI would only serve them one Death Head wing (seemed a fitting name). I would make them wear gloves to eat it to prevent capsaicin burns on their skin. I would specifically tell them about the heat they were about to get into, trying to dissuade them from eating this culinary monstrosity. \n\nBy the time we got through all this, every single person always now viewed this as an insult to their manhood (never had a woman complain about heat, but would sometimes actually ask if there was another level they could try) and could not be stopped from eating this wing...\n\nSo they did...\nThe fun thing about capsaicin oil is it can often take a few seconds to kick. Usually just enough time for the person to scarf down the wing and start to smuggly tell us how it wasn't that hot...\n\nAnd then the heat would begin. And once it started it was relentless. \n\nThe wing was free, but the cup of milk after was $20.\nI never had a single person ask for a second one.",

            "Not exactly a wing story, but something that might fit in here. When I was in college, a friend of mine got a job working at a USDA farm where, among other things, they were growing some pretty hot peppers. One morning he was tasked to pick some of the peppers. The person he worked for warned him once you start picking them don\u2019t rub your nose or face until you\u2019ve washed your hands. He was careful not to rub his nose or face while he was picking the peppers. At lunchtime, a truck came out to take him into the nearby office so he could eat lunch. Because he\u2019d been out in the hot sun, picking peppers, he first went to the men\u2019s room to relieve himself of some of the water he\u2019d been drinking all morning. No one told him that he should also wash his hands thoroughly before he urinated. He ended up having to explain to HR why the office receptionist heard him shrieking and when she went into the men\u2019s room in a panic thinking he\u2019d hurt himself his pants were down and he had Mr Happy in the sink frantically trying to wash it off.",
            "Freshman year of college I had a chocolate habanero plant growing in my room. They were very spicy, and I say that as someone who grew up eating spicy food. I didn't go through them that quickly, so if my roommates wanted one they were free to take some. One day, I'm out of my room when a roommate has a friend over. He sees the plant and asks about it. My roommate tells him about how even I find them spicy, and his friend responds with \"Your roommate is a  bitch, I bet they're not that hot.\" He plucks one and takes a bite, and pretty soon he's tearing up and his nose is running. It was very satisfying to hear the story later on.",
            "I have a similar story, my family owned a restaurant and our wings were really big deal, we made wing sauce differently than every other place. We had mild and hot and that was it. The hot would probably be a medium at most places so we would crush up some red pepper flakes and coat the wing in them and then put on the sauce for those who wanted it extra spicy.\n\nWell in walks regular customer who always complains that the wings aren\u2019t spicy enough. To the point he would tease my dad for the baby spice wings. Well I had recently gotten a bottle of mad dog pure capsaicin(sp?) to use for our chili just to add a little heat and not affect the flavor. This stuff only took a couple of drops to kick up the heat on a five gallon batch of chili! \n\nSo the customer asks are you going to make my wings spicy this time? So my dad went all out with the crushed pepper, sauce, and then put two drops of this  mad dog on each wing. I\u2019m pretty sure the wings took on a bluish color until everything mixed together and sent them out. Now it\u2019s important to note that this was a to go order.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later I get a call and it sounds like someone in serious pain asking for my dad. I put him on the phone and it turns it was the customer. The wings were so spicy he wanted to know what was in there and if he should call poison control or go to the hospital. We told him if he drinks some milk and has some ice cream it should dissipate some but he will be feeling it for a bit. One good thing to come of this, he never never asked for extra spicy wings again!",
            "I literally did this same thing.\nWe randomly got wings shipped instead of normal chicken and had to keep it at the restaurant I managed. So we briefly made a special and of course everyone was like \u201cfinally wings\u201d which they took forever to prep in our small place.\nI had one guy who would never hush about wanting wings or super spicy chicken fingers (kids meal item that doesn\u2019t exist) and demanded to hottest wings we could make.\nI asked if he was sure he wanted that hot because the head chef was from Mexico (I can\u2019t remember the region but it\u2019s where hot hot food is standard and even smelling it made me cry).\nOf course he says yes.\nSo those wings got drowned in 7 spices and sauces plus the chefs own personal spice sauce that made every server look like it was a funeral.\n\nI gave him the extra ranch and milk for free and he never bothered us again.",
            "This reminds me of a story (not MC) from about 10 years ago. \n\nI had two roommates, and we were all into spicy foods. I returned from work one day, and the apartment felt like someone has set off a pepper spray/bear repellent bomb in the place. I make that comparison because I've been in the vicinity of that happening in an enclosed space before. Not pleasant. \n\nWhat happened? Yeah, those two doofuses had made a pasta sauce and added ghost pepper sauce. And not a teaspoon. They added half the bottle. The water reduction as the sauce boiled spread it around the whole apartment.\n\nFortunately for karmic debt purposes, they had punished themselves by actually eating the sauce with some pasta. It was the very least they could do. Their tears were delicious. It took about three weeks for the lingering pepper smell and to dissipate.",
            "Ha. Sounds like fun!  I love spicy wings but I prefer them to have flavor.  I remember me time I was in Pittsburgh attending a college football game. My dad, his buddies, and I went to a 3 story building restaurant called Ugly\u2019s.  I had to sign a waiver but I ordered something called Dancing with the Devil. I believe it was an order of 6 (or 8) of their spiciest wings. I believe I ate 4 of those before I couldn\u2019t handle it anymore. I offered the rest of the wings to the table. My dad said he took one bite and couldn\u2019t taste anything the rest of the evening. I think that\u2019s why I try to opt for 2nd hottest. Usually it\u2019s flavorful and has some heat.",
            "I love very spicy as long as it also has flavor. Pain for pain's sake is no longer my favorite thing, especially since I have undergone the gastric sleeve. I don't want to punish what's left of my stomach. \n\nThe only time I had a bad reaction to peppers was actually not that spicy of a meal, but it was awful. The bar I performed at (guitar and singing) started a Tuesday night fish taco (California style, with the crispy fried fish, cabbage, etc. which are my FAVE) special. I asked the cook if he ever had habanero peppers that he could add to the tacos, and he said sure, he would bring some in.\n\nThe next Tuesday he brought me my plate of tacos and told me he had given me some habaneros in there like I asked. The plate of three tacos was deliciously spicy and I loved every bite. \n\nAbout 30 minutes later, about 45 minutes before I went on stage, it felt like the sun had spawned in my guts. I had to run to the drug store next door for a bottle of Maalox and a cold bottle of milk. It finally died down about halfway through my show (basically 2 and a half hours later).\n\nAt the end of the night the cook told me he had chopped up one whole, fresh habanero for each taco. I thanked him, and never asked for habs on my tacos again from him.",
            "I purchased some ghost pepper candies.\n\nVery small pieces like half the size of a pencil eraser. \n\nNow I eat habenero peppers on a regular basis\n\nI can only eat a couple of these candies crushed up on food.\n\nI was telling a coworker about this and he wanted to try them, so I put a couple dozen in an old plastic pill bottle for him.\n\nI heard he was a bit nervous about eating them so he decided to smell them first.\n\nHe took the bottle and popped the cap and took a sniff.\n\nApparently when he shook the bottle it created a bit of dust from the pieces and he got a snoot full.\n\nBesides the red teary eyes he didn't stop sneezing for a half hour.",
            "Have you watched \u201cWe are the Champions\u201d on Netflix? The first one is about the worlds hottest pepper eating contest. Ed who bred the ghost pepper has made an even hotter pepper variety and you get to watch people lose their minds. A great and dear friend competed and made it pretty far. It she regularly subjects herself to his strange concoctions. \n\nWe also had a hot sauce shop in the mall near us and you could sample their deadliest sauce on a chip after signing a waiver. This guy came in boasting he couldn\u2019t feel pain, signed the waiver, scarfed down the chip, starting telling us the flavor profiles; \u201cYummm, it\u2019s a bit Smokey with a garlicky hint, followed by this...\u201d he starts sweating, then a little cough, \u201cI\u2019m good, (cough) I just inhaled a (cough) hit wrong (cough cough)\u201d Then he\u2019s sweating more, and tells his wife to go grab a drink from the machine. He\u2019s fanning his mouth and coughing something awful while still proclaiming between coughs that it is delicious and not hot, he just ate it wrong? Finally he runs out of the store to find out what is taking his wife so long. We follow cause, well, it\u2019s super entertaining. The dollar will not go in the vending machine- it keeps spitting it out. So the man rips it from his wife\u2019s hands and try\u2019s to force-fuck it into the machine with no luck. Then he just turns around and throws up everywhere. He\u2019s just standing there in the middle of the mall bent over, saliva, tears and pride dripping from his face while he flailes his hands for help from his wife who mortified self just left him hanging and disappeared. I like to think that was the straw that broke the camels back- that she later went and filed for divorce because she couldn\u2019t possibly look at him the same.",

            "I remember cooking wings for my son and I.  My son was probably 8 at the time and was developing a taste for spicy food.  So I'm cooking and my roommate had \"Dave's Insanity Sauce (180k Scoville).\"   I hadn't tasted it before but I've had hot sauce...how much hotter could this be?    So I drizzled a bunch on the wings figuring it would be no problem.\n\nMy son takes a bite and a minute later tears are streaming down his face...he says, \"too hot Dad, too hot!\"  I said, \"It can't be that bad.\"  I take a bite...and a minute later it hits me.

Then I profusely apologized to him, took him out to dinner and then got him DQ to make up for it.\n\nMy roommate laughed when I told him the story.

It simply lowers the threshold for when we feel a temperature is burning us, making the comfortable 35-37 degrees in our mouth (and the rest of the tract) feel like a toasty 50+ degrees instead.\n\nThat is also why capsaicin won't feel nearly as hot on areas that are more used to heat, like the top of our tongue, as the change won't bring the perceived temperature as high compared to our comfortable zone.\n\nA side effect is that being very used to capsaicin can lead to the negative side effect that one won't feel food is too hot before it have already severely burned the tissue, making eating just cooked food more dangerous.",

I like my wings very hot, so if I order the 'suicide' and I don't break out sweating, I will feel a little bit cheated. \n\nI was in New York last year, and some place had like: mild, medium, hot, very hot, crazy, suicide or something line that.  I went for the suicide, the people there were all like: are you sure, they are really really hot. I was taken aback a little bit by their comments but bought them anyway. When I ate them though, actual mild sauce with a few flashes of pepper. \n\nThe restaurants that only have mild, medium and hot ate usually the ones that you need to be careful at.

        "selftext": "This happened about a year ago now when I was in high school. My calculus class was very chill. About 20 kids who were all friendly with each other, a laid back but enthusiastic teacher, and a light enough workload that we could afford to goof off in class but still learn and do well. \n\nAt some point in the year I got really into cooking. It's my stress reliver. My family couldn't possibly eat the amount of food I was made so I started bringing it into school and \"hosting\" Friday parties in my calc class, with my teacher's approval of course. Now, I'm Vietnamese and I live in a predominately white town. This is only important because it meant that most kids from town only ate American or European foods, and weren't used to eating other ethnic foods.\n\nLast year around Lunar New Year, I wanted to bring in some Vietnamese foods to celebrate. It is a very important time of year for my family. I ended up making a bunch of B\u00e1nh Da L\u1ee3n, a steamed layer cake and a traditional Vietnamese dessert. Some of my friends from class found out I was going to bring in a traditional dish and brought in their own traditional dishes from their own cultures, whether they celebrated Lunar New year or not. We had different Indian, Korean, Filipino, and Spanish desserts. It was great and I was really excited that my friends wanted to celebrate with me.\n\nApparently this was an issue for one girl in my class.\n\nI would say B\u00e1nh Da L\u1ee3n is an acquired taste, so when not a lot of people ate it I wasn't offended. I knew not everybody would like it. There was a lot of other food anyways. During our lunch period one of my friends (who wasn't in our class but knew I brought food in) overheard a girl from my class complaining about the food while on the lunch line. Apparently she was saying really negative things about how I \"forced everyone to eat weird Chinese foods.\"\n\nLater that day I texted her just saying I heard she didn't like the food and wanted to know why. I don't really care when people don't like the food (I make it for myself and bring it in when I have extra anyways), but her calling it \"weird Chinese foods\" (when she *knows* I'm Vietnamese) didn't sit right with me.\n\nWelp, she texted back that it was rude of me to bring in weird ethnic foods that nobody would have liked except for me and said I should know better since most of the class was white.\n\nI told her that I bring in food to share because I feel like it and that I don't have an obligation to cater to her tastes. If she has an issue with it, she literally does not have to eat it, and other people can bring in food too so if she wanted to she could bring in something more to her tastes. After that she just told me that I shouldn't bring in ethnic and foreign foods and stick with American foods, \"because we're in America.\" Excuse me??? Like??? How much you wanna bet if I brought in jambalaya, which originated in Louisiana, she would call it a \"weird foreign food.\"\n\nFine. She only wants to eat American foods? Then she can eat American foods.\n\nThe next week I brought in a bunch of Oliebol, a Dutch doughnut, and started passing them out at the beginning of class. When I got to her desk I pulled out a loaf of Wonder Bread and plopped it on her desk, saying \"Sorry but these are Dutch, too ethnic. Here you go, all American cuisine.\"\n\nLater she texted me asking wtf my problem was, so I told her that almost every single food I brought in this year was ethnic and that it pissed me off she only had an issue when it wasn't European. She's entitled to not liking Asian foods but if you're going to complain about it being ethnic, then you better have that same attitude when the ethnic food is white. And especially don't call another person's culture weird. \n\nShe didn't complain about the food again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, before anyone comments: white bread isn't the only American cuisine out there. Here's a short list of what I've enjoyed making: tater tots, jambalaya, fried chicken, many types of pies, smores, and Philly Cheesesteaks. America is a very diverse place, and that's reflected in its food. Happy eating!\n\nEdit: thank you all for the awards and the love in the comments! i really didn\u2019t expect any of it. don\u2019t worry, i\u2019ll cook for you all some day!",

I don\u2019t remember if we won that part of the competition (it\u2019s been over 35 years ago), but I do remember that the food was tasty and was a break from our usual recipes.

In a small town you might find a generic \"Chinese\" restaurant but here there are many Chinese regional cuisines.  Most of the Mexican styles are from the central and northwest regions but there are southern and Caribbean styles of Mexican food down the street.  I might have to drive a couple miles to find Turkish, Afghan, or Ethiopian but it's all there and wonderful.  Vietnamese is one of the best.  Vietnam seems to have picked up little bits from all the surrounding countries' cuisines and added in a touch of French colonial influence (the best french bread is from the Vietnamese bakeries).  I don't object to plain Midwest American cuisine but why would a person want to stick to just the on style?",

If you try it and don't like it, great, at least you tried. If you want to pass and not try it at all, fine I guess, but you're missing out on an amazing learning experience.

Well, that was the idea, but I naively \"helped\" my girlfriend pay her part of the bills (i.e. paid completely for most of them). The rent was in my name, the electricity in my girlfriends', etc.\n\nWell I eventually got tired of her crap (arguments, smelly gerbils, not doing chores), and we broke up. It was messy. She took ages to move out, making sure to mooch every penny she could before leaving.\n\nWhen she left, I immediately started a new electricity account in my name. A week later, I got a letter of confirmation in the mail, but I also received the electricity bill for the last three months my ex was living with us. I opened it without thinking. We couldn't even pay it if we wanted to because the bill was in her name. I shot her a text:\n\nMe:  Yo, you got the electricity bill in the mail. It's 120 bucks so come pick up $40 from each of us.\n\nEx:    Um where's the other $40? We agreed I wouldn't pay bills after I move out. (as if she did before)\n\nMe:  You were still living here for the time period of the bill.\n\nEx:    This is bullshit, I'm not going to pay a thing. We had an agreement.\n\nMe:   Well... you can come over to get our part, or you can pay it alone.\n\nEx:    The way I see it, you can either bring the $120 to my place or have fun in the dark lol.\n\nMe:   You got me there!\n\nAt this point I realized that she doesn't know I started my own account with the electricity provider. She thought that by refusing to pay, the provider would cut our lights. Good way to mooch another $40 from us, right? But that's not quite what happened.\n\nA few weeks later, I received another letter from elec. company with her name on it. Probably a late payment warning. I sent her a text to tell her, and she responded, \"lol why are you so desperate to talk to me. You know what you have to do :)\"\n\nAnother letter came in for her. This one was probably late fees. I have to guess because I never opened them. I messaged her and she said, \"I thought I told you to never talk to me again.\"  As you wish, ma'am!\n\nMore letters arrived, but from a new address. I Googled the new sender's address and found that they were debt collectors. Scary stuff. It's too bad I couldn't say a word to her.\n\nNow about two or three months later, I received a phone call from my ex and I'm greeted by \"WHAT THE FUCC THESE PEOPLE ARE CALLING MY PARENTS' HOUSE I'VE GOT ALL THESE LATE FEES BAAHHHH DEBT COLLECTORS.\" I told her if she wants our part of the bill, she knows what to do :)\n\nRealizing that she had no other choice, she caved and came for the money. My roommate and I didn't give her a cent toward late fees, and I probably looked so fucking smug giving her my money for the last time.\n\nEDIT: Lots of people are saying I shouldn't have given her a cent. As u/shelchang eloquently put it: \"Not paying it would be a dick move. Way more satisfaction in letting someone else get screwed while you play by all the rules.\"",

            "I know this isnt malicious compliance, but my god, this reminds me of a situation that happened at my last job (which I quit almost 2 years ago, this happened a year before that) that pisses me off to this day whenever I remember it.\n\nI worked for a natural gas company as a CSR taking frontline calls. Guy called in to take over service for his address. He gave us a contact number which happened to match _a_ (not primary) contact number on the previous account that had just moved out.\n\nThis triggers what we called a 'positive identification', where we take all of the information from the customer (name, birthdate, social security, address, all the original contact information, and any other information required to start an account), but then we tell them we cant start service _yet_, until one of the positive ID reps investigates. The purpose is to combat the common tactic of shuffling the primary account holder, and starting service after a disconnect, without paying the debt or disconnect/reconnect fees.\n\nHes waited longer than the estimated time we told him the process would take, so he called. Enter me, with a beep in my ear. He explains to me the situation in full. Turns out this guy had a ex-girlfriend who was psycho, but the account was in her name. He had already admitted to living at the house during the previous account's debt accrual, so we now had a HARD requirement that either he provide us alternative proof that he was NOT living there (a dated bill or something with another service address.) or the other account needs to have its balance paid off.\n\nHe perks up at this and says \"Yeah, I'd be happy to pay the account, whats the balance?\".\n\nThis is when shit starts to approach the fan. He is not authorized on the previous account, so I cant talk to him about it. He's confused at first, understandably, because I just essentially told him that hes responsible for a debt that I'm not allowed to discuss with him. I tell him that the best course of action would be to contact the account holder (I couldn't even say/confirm her name to him), and have them either A) talk to us(to make a payment), or B) talk with her to convince her of option A.\n\nHe says \"She wont talk to me, I've already tried to get her to pay the bill, and she refuses. Can I just please pay the bill?\"\n\nShit hits the fan. I hold the call, talk to my supervisor. No dice, we are not allowed to discuss the account, period. (I hate this, because the only thing you have to do to get us to spill guts about your account is just say \"Yeah, I'm <account holders name>\" and we can do anything to the account). He could contact our IVR to make a payment, but that would require him knowing the account number, yet another thing I cant give to him. He asks me if we can call the IVR together, and I could put the account number in myself. No dice, because the IVR would tell him the balance, which is \"privacy critical\" and also why I couldn't take a check over the phone.

Landlord found out and was super chill, just charged her for a year of water, instead of upping our rent. She moved out after 8 months on the lease, and we broke up. She asked the landlord for half the water bill back, and he said no it's non-refundable.\n\nPrior to that, I told her if he didn't pay it back, I'd try to help her out. TRY. Not \"I'm going to give you money.\"\n\nLater, I start seeing a new girl, so naturally I want my key back, because all of her stuff is gone. She says I can get the key back when she gets her water bill back. \n\nLandlord said okay, and stopped over the next day to change the locks for me.\n\nI probably would've tried to help her with the money if she hasn't used my key as collateral.

I was a naive 19 year old, so I know some of the shot that happened was on me, but she was extremely rude, passive aggressive (she called to get my bfs car towed from the guest parking because she didn't like him), and just plain mean.\n\n It all came to a head when she shoved me out of the apartment and I had to call the police to be let back in. I agreed to move out 3 weeks from that day and out of kindness I was going to pay the next month's rent. \n\nWell, she spent the next three weeks sitting outside of my door talking about what a \"cunt\" I was to friends, sending me harassing text messages, changing the wifi-password when she knew I had assignments due and was still paying for the wifi, turning off the AC when she left for work at 6 am, again even though I was still paying for it, and damaging my brand new rented textbooks by throwing them against my door. \n\nI owed them about $500 for rent and utilities, but I decided to recheck my paperwork the week before I left. Turned out that as of the 1st, I wouldn't legally owe them anything. As long as i paid utilities, i didn't legally have to pay for the next month since it wasn't in the paperwork letting me out of the lease. \n\nThis ended up being way longer than I intended but I packed my shit and left on the 30th with her screaming about the next months rent. She sent me texts for months after claiming she was going to \"put me in orange\" for not paying, and I'd just send back one of her previous texts of her harassing me. Worked out pretty well for me in the end. \n",

She was a dynamic executive who climbed the corporate ladder quickly. One of her special talents was reducing healthcare benefits for patients. She initiated a policy where women who underwent cesarean section would to be discharged in two days rather than the standard four day hospital stay. Shortly after having in vitro fertilization she found herself pregnant with twins. During one of her office visits I mentioned the new two-day policy. I told her that for some patients it was really rough to be discharged after major surgery in two days and be expected to care for a newborn infant. She just smiled and said that she didn't get where she was in corporate America by giving away money. And patients just needed to suck it up. Health insurance wasn't meant to be a convenience.\n\nShe was 42 years old and went to full-term with her twins. Despite her age she elected to attempt a vaginal delivery because of the quick recovery. Her labor was long and extremely difficult and ended with cesarean section. On day two I went to her room to complete her discharge from the hospital. She said, \"I'm NOT leaving! This is inhuman! You can't expect me to go home and take care of twins like this! I can barely walk! All you need to do is write a note in the chart that says I'm having a complication. My stay will be authorized.\" I told her that would be fraud. And I wouldn't be willing to falsify a medical record. Anyway, about a year later the state of California forced them to reverse the policy.",

My specific profession has a Code of Ethics- bc they are questioned and put in bad positions daily has caused me to apply to other jobs. God forbid you question, pushback, or truly document well without being talked to bc \"it makes us look bad\". That's exactly why I'm covering myself and these at-risk individuals, to show the state of the real actions this company pushes during state audits. I feel so bad and dirty working here- it wasn't apparent to me in the beginning, but now it's dreadful.

            "So this one time, me and my wife go through security. My wife was ahead of me and went through, no problem. But something set off the scanner when I went through, so the TSA dude says he needs to do some additional scanning. Fine, no problem. He takes out his manual scanner thingy and scans near my nether regions. I was wearing jeans with buttons and apparently that made the scanner go off. So he asks me \"Sir, do you have anything down there?\" my wife turns around, looks him in the eye and says \"Oh hell yes, you better believe he has something down there!\"... now, I am colorblind, but even I could see the shades of red that appeared on the TSA dude's face...",

I can't remember the exact numbers but the guideline for the amount of toothpaste you're allowed is something like 200g. I had a 50g tube but instead of saying \"50g\" in big writing, it said \"250ml\" with the 50g in small print. So the dude threw my toothpaste out for being over the limit but actually he just couldn't read.\n\nI could've argued about it but I felt like telling this dude that he shouldn't be doing this job if he can't even tell the fucking difference between grams and millilitres would've led to an unpleasant day altogether and I was actually just better off buying a new toothpaste once I got to my destination.",
            "I 100% of the time opt out and request pat down. Whenever they ask why, I politely say:\n\n\"I morally object to being forced to surrender my rights to board a plane. I refuse to allow a law designed inconvenience and attempt to shame/humiliate me into compliance to do so.\"\n\nI get various responses. Always get that sweet sweet government funded public groping though. Sometimes I get bonus double super secret groping when their machine pings if I recently walked through some fertilizer or something. \n\nI also always deny their request to take me to a room as is my right. If the other passengers want a show, smile and let 'em have one.\n\n\nAs for setting the testing machine off, Tannerite will trigger their test, also some high concentrated fertilizers. If you've taken a mine/cave tour recently, you'll probably also set it off due to dynamite residue in the dust of the mine/cave. Same for open pit mines and some gravel pits where blasting happens.\n\nYou can trigger it by being present at the site of a controlled demolition that spread a bunch of dust around too.\n\nLastly (and I haven't tested this one in a while) but pure glycerine can set it off too. So if you've got glycerine based soap or spilled some glycerine based vape juice on your hands or clothes, you used to be able to set them off all the time.\n\nHandling your own heart medication \"nitroglycerine pills\" will also make them freak out.\n\nSoooo... if you're staging your own little protest, you could probably get everyone in the line to set off the swab test by shaking hands with them after applying glycerin based lotion to them and convince some/all of them to do the pat down.",

One was a 3 foot tall plastic doll from my childhood, and the other a homemade telescope. While in the xray machine, something caught, the bag ripped, and the doll's leg poked out, dressed in little kid clothes. That, combined with an odd metal bazooka-like tube, was enough for security to do a double take. It was embarrassing to me, being the center of attention, but the cool thing? We all laughed and they helped me tape the bag. I miss those days.",
            "I was picking up a client at the private terminal. I'm five feet from the flight line. TSA comes by. They have NO authority with private jets. I reminded him (I think- not trying to offend, I just couldn't tell) of that. \"No! We are the ULTIMATE authority at this airport.\"  FBO clerk says, \"As we've told you all before, you have no authority here and over there (pointing at the public terminal) you're in the top 5.\" They continued arguing while I met the client and left. The client asked, \"What's TSA doing? They can't touch us...\"\n Some FBO's do background checks but typically you show an ID and away you go. There are airports where you drive up to the aircraft, transfer your luggage, and away you go.  Fond Du Lac, WI airport was ordered by the FAA to put gates up on the road access points, so they did. There's no fence connecting the gates, but they have gates.\n It's all theater. If the TSA had ever caught someone, we'd never hear the end of it. \"See? All this works!\" \n  Sorry for the long comment, it's a particular grumble of mine.\n\nFBO is Fixed Base Operator.

            "Last year flying from Europe to the US I was randomly selected at the gate for a second search of my carry on luggage. This is after regular security and after passport check. Of course nothing was found. About 30 minutes later we were informed of a delay in our flight and a change in the gate. We had to leave the \u201csecure area\u201d We all got a voucher for some food while waiting for the new gate being announced. About one hour later as I was entering the new gate, the same airline employee who had searched me an hour earlier, randomly selected me again for the identical search. I told him I was not into him.",

I took my shoe and sock off, and rolled up my jeans, and the TSA agent patted me down. I don't have any implants or anything (anywhere). I have no idea what caused it. System error, a tiny piece of metal picked up by an extra sensitive part of the machine, you name it. \n\nI was still nervous, though, and the whole time I was thinking about how they would see that I'm nervous and assume the worst",

I had been working a lot of overtime because of it, to help my coworkers through the rush.\n\nI got written up by my supervisor for doing too many overtime shifts without approval. I was explicitly informed to not work overtime again, I had lost overtime privileges until corporate deemed I could have them again, and working overtime again prior to that would result in further disciplinary action.\n\nThe day after I was written up, right as my shift ended, 3 big buses FULL of kids unloaded and filled the shop. At 1:30pm on the dot my watch alarm went off and I went to go clock out. The store manager who wrote me up the day prior said, \"wait where are you going?\" I reminded her that I'd lost my overtime privileges, clocked out, retrieved the shift drink I'd made for myself right before the rush, and left.\n\nThe next day I was informed my overtime privileges had been re-instated...  \n\n\nEdits: Woah this took off in a way I didn't expect. This was almost a decade ago, when I was in my early 20's and an eager to please employee, so I didn't demand they take the write up off my record (unfortunately). My coworkers all knew about the write up and were pissed about it too, so none of them were mad when I spite left to prove a point. I worked the super morning shift by choice because I used to be a morning person, because the field trips were super sporadic and there was no way to predict them without knowing the field trip schedules of the entire region, our manager had somehow managed to avoid ever experiencing one since she typically left around noon. Once she saw what they were like and started believing us, they scheduled one of the afternoon shift people to come in an hour early so we had better overlap. ",

        "selftext": "Back in 2013, I was a senior at a high school I had just transferred to.  I had moved earlier in the year because my parent got divorced, and I made the deliberate choice to leave my old high school and move in with my dad, attending a new high school.  I won't go into much detail about the why, but it was my decision to leave my mom, my old school, and my home town in the Bay Area, and move into a small apartment with my dad.  This comes up later.\n\nNormally, switching schools isn't a huge deal, but it was sort-of an abrupt move; I wasn't able to take any of the AP classes I normally would have taken because they all had mandatory summer projects that I wouldn't have been able to do in a week.  Additionally, a week into the school year, we were told about this stupid senior project they wanted us to do.\n\nIn a nutshell, there was some acronym like IMPACT or something, and each letter represented a value of the school.  They wanted us to write about how IMPACT had influenced us in our time at the school.  We were then told that, should we *not* do the senior project, [we wouldn't be able to walk for graduation.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zrMykBnidM)\n\nI heard this and thought it was stupid for a number of reasons - not the least of which being that I had only just gotten there, so their dumb acronym didn't mean anything to me.  I brought this concern up to the lady telling us about the project, and her response was that I just \"figure something out, or don't walk.\"\n\nWell okay then.\n\nI brought it up with my dad, asked if he gave a hot shit weather or not I walked for a high school graduation.  He did not.  So I just figured that I wouldn't do the project.  End of story, right? \n\nWrong.\n\nYa see, a few months into this senior project, they did a checkup on every senior.  We just lined up in our homeroom to talk to some lady from the principal's office and told her how close we were to being done.  When I walked up, I told her that I wasn't doing it.  \n\nShe was confused.  \"You're not going to do it?  You have to.  It's non-negotiable.\"\n\n\"No it's not.  I don't have to do it.\"\n\n\"But you won't walk if you don't do it.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\nThen we just sorta stared at each other, and she wrote my name down and shooed me away.  I correctly assumed that this would not be the last interaction I had regarding this non-issue.  Several weeks later, my suspicions were confirmed when I was pulled out of class and brought into the main office.\n\nThey ushered me into the vice-principal's personal office, where she made a bit of a show of pulling out some papers.  She told me that the meeting was regarding a misunderstanding I may have had regarding the senior project.  She was apparently told that I didn't know what to do for the assignment, and I chose to boycott the whole thing as a result.  I quickly corrected her, and explained that I very clearly understood what they wanted me to do, but that I thought it was stupid and wasn't going to do it.  I also explained that I understood the penalty, and was fine with it.  She, like the first lady, seemed confused by this course of action, and just let me leave, since there wasn't really much of a conversation to be had.\n\nA few more weeks later, I get pulled out of *yet another* class for this same thing.  Again, I'm brought up to the vice-principle for a one-on-one.  When I get there, she looks like the cat that ate the canary.  \n\nShe begins, \"So, I know you were in here awhile ago, and you said you didn't want to do your senior project...\"\n\n\"No,\" I interrupted, \"I said I wasn't doing the project.\"\n\n\"Well,\" she continued, \"we had a chat with your mother over the phone earlier this week.  She told us that she *really* wants you to walk on your graduation.\"\n\nI was quiet for a moment.\n\n\"Um...  I live with my dad.\"\n\n\"Right, but your mom said she'd like to attend the ceremony and see you walk.\"\n\n\"I don't think you get it,\" I stated, \"I live with my dad *for a reason.*\"\n\nIf ever there were an expression the perfectly exemplified the dial-up tone, that's the face she made.  After she collected herself, I was released and headed back to class.  \n\nBy this point, I was mostly just not doing the project because it was dumb.  But them calling a family member to strong-arm me was crossing a line.  On top of that, they tried to strong-arm me using a parent with whom I was no-contact.  I decided right then that, no matter what, I wasn't caving in to their bullshit.  Fuck the project, fuck the school, fuck the weird tactics they were trying to use.  Though, in my anger was also confusion.  Why the hell did these people care so damn much about one guy not doing an optional assignment?  Also, I made myself very clear, so was that the end of it?\n\n**Spoiler: It wasn't.**\n\nA few more weeks later, I got pulled into the actual principal's office.  The principal, for reference, was one of those guys that tried to make a show of being overly friendly and goofy, but to the point where it came off as superficial.  When I got to his office, he was his usual extroverted self, greeted me, and sat me down.\n\n\"So, I've heard about this whole senior project problem you've had going on.  And I get it.  Trust me, I really do - you're new here, so our motto hasn't had as much of an impression.  So, after talking about it with the folks grading the projects, we think it'd be just fine if you had a modified project.  Just do a project on one letter of IMPACT, and you're golden.\"  He gave me a big warm smile.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Sorry?\"  He asked, still smiling.\n\n\"I'm not doing it.\"\n\nHis smile was slowly fading, \"But you only have to do one letter.  It's really not that much.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I got that.  I'm still not going to do it.\" I stated.\n\n\"But you won't be able to walk on graduation day.\"\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\n\"So what's the issue, exactly?\"\n\n\"You called my mom.\"\n\nHis mouth was open like he was going to say something, but I guess nothing came to mind, as we sat in silence for a good twenty seconds - him trying to formulate an argument, and me making a [Jim Halpert face.](https://img1.looper.com/img/gallery/why-jim-halpert-should-have-been-fired-from-dunder-mifflin/intro-1565380589.jpg)\n\nI told him if that was everything he needed to talk about, I would be heading back to class.  He didn't protest, so I just left.\n\nIt was after this meeting that I eventually got some context.  Apparently, California schools will shuffle principals around every few years for some reason that probably makes sense, but I don't care enough to research.  Our principal was going to be switching schools after the 2013 semester had ended, and one of his big plans was to leave that high school with 100% participation in the senior projects that would otherwise not affect any final grade...\n\nHe used the threat of preventing students from walking at graduation to bully everyone into doing the dumb project.  ...Almost everyone - I stuck to my guns and refused to do it.  And sure enough, after the deadline had passed, they made a big deal about how happy they were that 99.6% of students completed their senior projects, even though they were hoping for 100%.\n\nAnd the absolute dumbest part about this exercise in stupid?  After everything was said and done, I was called in one last time to the VP's office.  She told me that despite my refusal to do the senior project, they were still going to let me walk, and gave me five tickets for friends and family.  I laughed, walked out without the tickets, and didn't attend my own graduation.\n\n**TL;DR - I was given the choice of option A or option B.  I chose option B, the admins regretted giving me the option, and then it got personal.**\n\n**EDIT (12/14):** Managed to get ahold of my pops.  I asked him if they ever called him, and what he said was;\n\n\"I don't know.  Maybe?  I feel like I had something prepared for if they did call.  You know, I would have told them that your grades were great, you had just transferred from a different school, you didn't know anybody, and that you were just looking to finish up and go to college.  But I can't remember if they actually called me and I told them that.  I feel like I did, but I'm not sure if I did.\"",

My turn comes and I tell her that she never got back to me. She looks surprised and says I can pick a topic for a project or write a 10 page paper about a topic of my choice. Cool. That I can do. Still have to make a presentation about it but that\u2019s easy, just need to make a PowerPoint. Unfortunately, I still needed to find a mentor and staff evaluator. Why? I don\u2019t know. I went to the office and made an appointment with my guidance counselor. I figure that they usually want students to succeed so it would be a good choice. A few more weeks pass, I had decided on a topic and we have our next check in. I tell the teacher my topic. She stares at me.\n \u201cPeople write books about that.\u201d \nAre you shitting me? How the fuck else am I supposed to research it? So she shoots down my idea and tells me to pick something more narrow. Okay. Fine.\nMy counselor agrees to be my staff evaluator, so I just need to present to her when I\u2019m finished.\nI pick another topic and start doing my research again. At the next check in, same shit. It had been over two months at this point so I was starting to get nervous. I had to start over again. This time I picked something even more narrow.\nNext check in, guess what. Same thing. This was extremely frustrating.\nShe was refusing to help at all and I was getting a solid amount of anxiety every time I had to go to her class. This was on top of having to do my normal class work as well.\nI eventually just gave up. I realized any way I looked at it, I was doomed to fail. I did attempt to complete a paper. I decided to write about classical music and how it compared to baroque. I got a solid seven pages done. Formatted perfectly, sources cited. Made my presentation. On presentation day, I dressed up in my suit(we had to dress fancy) and gave my presentation. We had to talk for at least eight minutes. Made it to ten. Doing not too shabby... at least so I thought.\nAfter class, I went to present to my counselor. She straight up refused. I had forgotten to set up an appointment and even though she said she wasn\u2019t busy that afternoon, she thought I needed to learn to be more responsible. Wtf. I thought guidance counselors were supposed to put the students\u2019 success pretty high on their priorities. I understand that I should have scheduled an appointment, but dealing with my English teacher was a nightmare and it had slipped my mind. She wouldn\u2019t let me reschedule either. Rip.\nSo grand total: one 7/10 page paper, one presentation, no mentor. Not looking good.\nAbout two weeks later, grades come out. I landed a 9.5 on my paper/presentation. Out of 100 possible points. 9.5. Not even double digits. \nNeedless to say, failed English class because of that.\nOnly class I had ever failed as well. (If I didn\u2019t have to do this stupid project, I had a B in the class.)\nHad to go to summer school. We didn\u2019t have to do any dumb project, just had to write another 10 page paper, from a provided topic list. Wrote about castle sieges. The teacher even let us put pictures in the body of the paper so we wouldn\u2019t have to write as much. Very nice. Did have to make another presentation, but that was easy. Passed with flying colors.\nGraduated in August, with my advanced studies diploma, with around 12 other people.\nAll in all, requiring a stupid project is a terrible idea. Any students transferring in are at a distinct disadvantage. I never understood the point. Why cause a decent student to suffer and fail the grade over something like that? Dumb.",

A real dumb system, but what can you do in good ole conservative USA. \n\nSo schooling goes on and I end up joining the band, and really digging it. At one point I was in concert band, 3 jazz bands, and arranging for and student running the choir band at the same time. Senior year I decide I want to go and try at joining a drum corps. I would spend a summer traveling the country doing some of highest level marching band there is a learning a ton doing it. Spent months preparing, traveling, and spending money to try out. Even got a job to make money to pay for it. The entire time I am communicating with the school because it required some days leaving early to drive to another city to audition and would likely require me graduating early for the camp before the tour. I eventually got it and earned my contract and get dates for when the camp starts. And this is where they decided to fuck me. \n \nI found out later that the some of the metrics used to consider the school as passing included graduation rate and walking for graduation (cause school spirit is a factor?). The school system was also pretty backwards and said graduating early didn't count as graduating for their metrics for some reason. I had things set up, I was going to leave after the AP tests were done, the few non-AP courses would have given me early finals, and the end of year concerts for the bands would be done. I was one month away from packing my shit and traveling the country performing a music show I was excited about. Out of nowhere the principal calls me and my friend who both were signed to join the drum corps to tell us we couldn't do it. \n\nGave us a long speech about how important walking for graduation is (ahh, how he still remembered his like it was only a week ago), and the only people allowed to graduate early were people enlisting in the armed forces (which is a different kind of bullshit). I argued it was all set up with the teachers, the last month of school is usually senior hurrahs and shit, no real learning anyway. He doubled down with a threat, if I left early I would be marked as dropping out and not get my diploma. That would throw off my college since I'd then have 1 week after the corps season to take a GED test and get results to stay enrolled. It was choose to finish 1 month of high school, and miss all of the training camp (would have meant i was learning the show while on tour between stops and wasn't reasonable imo) or throw college off and a lot of the work I'd done for that. I pretty much got forced to take the L and quit the drum corps. Threw away a potentially great summer learning music before going to a music college. But nope. HAD to walk. Kinda made music a little sour for a few years.",

We all graduated.\n\nAlso, I didn't complete a single assignment for my last 3 trimesters in that class, yet I got an 80 on each report card. I'm pretty sure our teachers just hated us so much that they wanted us gone no matter what.",

            "I was kicked out of the National Honor Society my senior year in high school because I refused to go to the banquet. Same basic thing happened to me as to OP. The school sent out a form a couple months before the banquet to get a count of how many people (students and parents) would be attending. I don\u2019t remember why, but at the time I just didn\u2019t want to go to the banquet. It was most likely a pretty stupid reason. I was asked by the sponsor why I didn\u2019t turn in the form. I said I just didn\u2019t want to attend. Was called in to the guidance office the next day and asked the same questions. Gave the same answer. The guidance counselor told me that if I didn\u2019t attend, I would be kicked out of the National Honor Society. When I questioned why, I was told that it was mandatory. I told her, okay kick me out then. Got called to meet with the vice principal and the the principal over the next two days. Asked them the same question and got the same it\u2019s mandatory answer. My parents told me that it was my decision to go or not, so I stayed home. I graduated with a 4.2 GPA, a 30 on my ACT, a 3 sport varsity letterman, and I was the President of our community service club. My college resume was pretty strong. It\u2019s unfortunate that the adults in the situation (both OP and myself) took such a hard stance of do what we say or else instead of trying to understand the why at the beginning. If someone would have talked to me and asked why I didn\u2019t want to go instead of threatening me with punishment, I probably would have ended up going. Once that ridiculous punishment was thrown on the table, I was all in to hold my ground.",

        "selftext": "So this is about five years ago. I worked as a chef at a bakery. It was my job to make everything but the baked goods. Every morning the Baker and I would walk in at about 4 am and knock out all the food needed for the day. This would leave me ready to go home around 10 AM or so. This put us at the perfect time to deliver online orders.\n\nIt was common for companies or other entities to place large catering orders with us. The baker and I would split them down the middle and deliver them on our way home.\n\nThe delivery in question was for Bob, Dick, and Harry, Attorneys at law. I have never delivered to BD&H before, but they were a regular of sorts. Every financial quarter, they would hold a huge meeting. This meeting would require roughly $700 of bagels and bagel accessories. This spread included eight dozen bagels, all ten of our flavors of cream cheese, pastries, brownies, and enough coffee to power a college dorm though finals week.\n\nMy passenger seat, entire back seat, and entire trunk are filled with food. Now BD&H is located on the ninth floor of a commercial sky scraper deep in an industrial complex downtown. parking was non-existent. There were meters outside the building, but I knew I would need close to ten trips to deliver all this food, and didn't have a lot of change on me. Company policy was to just pay whatever fines I needed to park and then turn in my receipts. the money would end up on my next paycheck.\n\nSo the building has its own parking garage, so I pull on in. The security guard, lets call him Sam, stops me and says that the parking garage is for employees only. I happily show him my delivery invoice, and offer him a bribery bagel, (never leave the store without at least two.)\n\nSam refuses the bagel and says I can park in one of the guest spots on the bottom floor. the fee is $5 for every 30 minutes, minimum $10. I thank him and head to the bottom floor of the garage. So there are a total of six guest parking spaces. Just six. All of them are taken. I head back up to talk to Sam, when I see an open parking spot reserved for Bob, Dick and Harry, Attorneys at Law. There are cars in every spot, with many spots being reserved for employees by name. The last spot is empty, and is reserved for \"Guest of BD&H\".\n\nPerfect. I pull on in. I grab the most important part of the delivery (the coffee) and head to the stairwell. I get into the elevator and hit the button for floor nine. The elevator asks for my employee ID card. well... crud. So, I try the lobby. That works. From there its nine flights of stairs until I am outside the law firm of Bob, Dick, and Harry. After introducing myself, I am shown to the room where the meeting will take place. A table is set aside for me. I set down the coffee and head for trip number two.\n\nThat is when I see Sam talking to the receptionist. He runs over and starts shouting at me. \"I am putting a boot on your F\\*\\*\\*ing car. I told you to park in guest on the bottom floor!\" I don't get a word in before he launches into a speech about security and how I could be hurting his building or people. That is when a very well dressed man walks over. It so happens to be Bob, the Bob of Bob, Dick and Harry's.\n\nBob asks what is the problem and soon the two are arguing.\n\nBob: OP is delivering food for my meeting. He is allowed to use my parking spots.\n\nSam: Those parking spots belong to the building. You are leasing them like you lease this floor. I am the one who says who can park there. He isn't an employee so he isn't parking!\n\nBob: Then I am making him an employee!\n\nSam: You can't do that!\n\nBob: ... ... ... You know what. You are right. Harry! Harry! get over here.\n\nHarry walks over with an amused look on his face.\n\nBob: Harry here is the head of our HR department. Harry, hire this boy.\n\nHarry pulls out a piece of paper and scribbles, \"OP is now a member of Bob, Dick, and Harry's\" and signs it, then asks me to sign as well. I do so.\n\nBob reaches over to the receptionist, who is already grabbing some things.\n\nBob: Here is your employee badge, your -PARKING PERMIT- and your elevator key card. Now please, do the job I have -HIRED- you to do, and deliver my bagels.\n\nSam looks on in utter fury as I ride the elevator down to my car.\n\nSeven sweet sweet elevator rides later, all the food is delivered. Bob and Harry meet me at the table.\n\nBob: OP, you have made great strides in this company and I am proud of your work, but I feel it is time for us to part ways. Here is your final check.\n\nBob then hands me a crisp $50 bill.\n\nHarry: And your severance package. Now please be sure to return your badge and card on the way out.\n\nHarry hands me a $20 and sends me on my way. The receptionist is sure to validate the parking ticket that Sam gave me, and I head on out. On the way out, Sam grins at me and asks for my ticket. I place it in the machine in his station. It sees the validation I got, and lets me out for free. Sam glares at me as I drive off into the... late morning sun.\n\nTL:DR, Security guard said I didn't work here so I can't park here. Client pretends to hire me to get around the rules. Never argue with lawyers.",

            "One of my favorite stories of malicious compliance involves a certain patient care facility and their continuing battle with bureau-crazy.  This happened long ago.  One particular patient needed long-term care essential to his well-being, not to mention survival, but his health care policy had a time limit for the number of days that he could be admitted to the facility, per admission, for which they would pay.  To comply with this requirement, each time, on the final day of his admission, he would be signed out of the facility.  A nurse would then wheel him out, in his chair, to a municipal bench just outside the boundary of the facility\u2019s property line.  The two of them would then enjoy an amicable half hour of pleasant conversation in the warm sunshine, after which he would be \u201creturned\u201d to the facility and re-admitted.",
