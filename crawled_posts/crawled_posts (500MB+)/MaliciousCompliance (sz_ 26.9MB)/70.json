        "selftext": "Kind of a long background info, tldr at the bottom.\n\nI work at an elementary school with a child who requires a 1-on-1 assistant. (That's me!) The kid has a few things going on, both a physical and mental disability as well as a general miasma of social anxieties. All in all, a pretty good kid, but has some extra difficulties at school.\n\nHis mom, on the other hand, is kind of a piece of work. She has reamed out the school and the special education department because we try to hold him to (reasonable) standards such as doing homework, learning independence, and interacting with peers. Now, anyone in SpecEd will tell you that no, kids that require the extra help are not going to always be on grade level with their peers, but if you help support them and expect reasonable outcomes, they generally rise to meet those. She apparently thinks that we're a glorified daycare and he shouldn't be required to do any work at all.\n\nThe kid picks up on this, and knows how to read a room. Any time his mom walks in (which she does often and unannounced) his entire demeanor changes; he throws tantrums, he complains that the activities he's been doing and succeeding in are too difficult, it's a real treat. \n\nSo recently the kid has been doing things to get out of work. He'll lie about what work he has, he'll complain about it, he'll \"forget\" or \"run out of time\" at home. We brought this up to his mom, and (as should have been expected) we were shut down.\n\n!Mom: \"My son doesn't lie. My son can't lie! He doesn't know how.\"\n\nMe and everyone in the SpecEd department: *are you fuggin kidding me lady?* -_-\n\nSo today, the kid was doing an independence exercise, where he's given instructions to go to one of his specials (music, p.e., art, etc) without adult supervision, and his goal is to get there without stopping and getting distracted. I had to have a quick meeting with his homeroom teacher, so he had about 10 minutes to get 30 feet.\n\nWhen I catch up with him, he's about halfway there.\n\n!me: hey man, what's up?\n\n!kid: Ensign53, you're not mad at me, are you?\n\n!me: naw, just curious. Why aren't you where you need to be?\n\n!kid: *trying to avoid being in trouble* ...........my leg hurts! *He grabs it and does a quick intake of breath* I had to stop.\n\n!me: uh-huh...\n\nNow, I know he's lying. I also know that he has work that he has to make up because he \"ran out of time\" to do it the night before. I *also* know that directly after music is P.E., his favorite special.\n\n!me *super serious and* ***definitely***  *believing him and worried*: oh man, that's really unfortunate! Well, I don't want you to get hurt, so here's what we can do. Let's sit down right here, and we can work on your homework that's due today.\n\n!kid *realizing the crap he just dug*: no, Ensign53, it's ok n...\n\n!me *interrupting and laying it on thick*: no, buddy...I know you're telling me the truth, because we just had this discussion that words matter. I really don't want you to get hurt, so if you tell me your leg is hurting, we can just skip PE today and work on your worksheet here.\n\n!kid *realizing what he's done*:oh no....\n\n!me: it's ok bud. I'm not angry or upset. I'm just worried, if you tell me your leg hurts, I have to look out for you. We wouldn't want you to hurt yourself, especially in PE. So it looks like we've got about an hour to work on this worksheet. So, problem 1...\n\nTL;DR: student has mom who tells school he can't lie. He lies, and misses P.E. because I \"believe\" him.",

            "I had a similar conversation with a parent once when I was a teacher.\n\nOne day, while teaching kindergarten, I was going to have the students complete a paper on the carpet rather than their tables.  So I told the students to go get the materials they needed and to come back to the carpet.  I watched the students do this transition and noticed my smallest boy (SB) say something to my biggest boy (BB) (seriously, he was the size of a 3rd grader) as they walked to their tables, which were on opposite sides of the room.\n\nAll the students returned, and suddenly BB wouldn't look in my direction and was trying to hide his face.  Suspicious.  So, as I was looking at him, trying to understand what was going on, SB calls out, \"BB stuck a crayon up his nose!\"  Oh, what fun /s\n\nI sent him to the nurse, who had to call his mother.  Mother had to take him to the hospital.  They finally got it out.\n\nMom and dad came in the next day PISSED.  They came down the hall (mom more stomped) and mom yelled at me.  She said some things about the cost of the ER visit and other things.  I let her vent, repeated back what she said, adding feeling words.  In other words, \"You said it costs $200 to fix this problem.  That is not a small amount of money.  I can understand that you're feeling upset right now when bills are coming up due.\" That worked 90% of the time to calm a parent down.  But then she started on how their son told them that SB held him down and forced the crayon up his nose and I wasn't even looking to know.  At that point, I said something like, \"I understand that he's been through a lot, so he may have trouble remembering, but here is what happened from my perspective,\" and went on to explain what actually happened.\n\n\"No!  That is not what happened!  I know what happened!  My son may lie to you, but he would never, ever lie to me!\" and so on and so forth.\n\nI worked so hard not to eye roll.  She eventually just stormed off and I got to go in and actually do my job.\n\n",
            "Some parents simply shouldn't be parents. I teach a boy who is on the spectrum, but very high functioning. He has no issues interacting with teachers or other students, and has an incredibly dry wit. He rarely has any difficulty completing set work at school. However, whenever he takes work home I frequently get an email from his mum saying that because of his learning difficulty he doesn't understand the work. This work is no more difficult than the work he already did in class with no problems. His mum uses every opportunity to bring up his autism and how hard it makes things for him and how he struggles with this and that and blah, blah, blah.\n\nWe organise a meeting to discuss what more can be done to help him and ask her to bring in his diagnosis and any other relevant documentation since she has yet to do so. At the meeting there are 5 of us, me, 2 other teachers, and her husband. I was the senior most staff member so I ran the meeting. Immediately after introductions are made, she talked for about 10 minutes straight about how difficult things are for him, following a script I am familiar with in her emails. I allowed her to go on for so long because I naively thought she might at some point feel the need to take a breath. \n\nEventually I cut her off and ask for the documentation regarding his diagnosis. She hands over 3 heavily redacted sheets of A4 paper. She had used a texta (permanent marker) to block out large sections of text, including the name of the physician and practice. Perhaps 60% is 'redacted'. I ask her why she has done this, she said because I don't need to know it and to protect her son's privacy. I think back to the dozens of reports of a similar nature I have read, and in all their un-redacted glory there was never anything I did not need to know, and there most certainly was never any inappropriate private information as these reports are written with the specific intention of been given to teachers. \n\nAfter I, and the other teachers read through what we can she demands it back from me.\n\nMe: Can I keep this, it will be useful to have in his file.\n\nHer: I will make a copy and give it to you later.\n\nMe: I can make a copy right now.\n\nHer: No, I want to continue with this meeting.\n\nOther Teacher: I can make the copy\n\nHer: No.\n\nMe: The photocopier is next door, she won't be 30 seconds.\n\nHer: No. I will give you a copy later.\n\nNeedless to say I never got a copy. The rest of the meeting was relatively uneventful. The mum continuing to explain how difficult things are for her son, and as a result how much time and effort she puts into helping him keep up. All our suggestions of how to provide support were ignored in lieu of her telling us what a great mother she was because of how difficult things are for her son. I wrapped up the meeting thanked them for their time and sent them on their way with their redacted reports. What did the father do during all this? Well he nodded in the right places and shook his head when required. Te real kicker is this woman is also a teacher.",
            "I work with special needs kids and this story made my day! I have a student this year who administration admits has the worst mother in the whole school. \n\nShe thinks her kid is the only one with special needs in the entire universe so of course no one could possibly know how to handle her special snowflake. In reality, she\u2019s a super smart 5 year old with a ton of potential but we are so hamstringed by her ridiculous demands that her kid isn\u2019t getting everything she needs to really flourish.

Well I go into the bathroom later that night and he is in there yelling at the boy and said, \"can't you at least act like a real human, for once, your embarrassing me\" I lost it, I completely blacked out, next thing I know I'm getting dragged off the dude.

Treating them like real, actual people (to the extent that's possible, of course), is good for them and good for you. If they are treated like normal people, with some level of responsibility they feel good and included, and it's better for you because you don't have to following them around micromanaging everything. Many parents don't get this.\n\n(Of course, some cases are easier to manage than others. The thing is knowing when you can \"loosen the leash\" a little)",
            "Ugh. That's so unfortunate. Parents like that are the same ones that end up putting their kids in residential care in their late teens/early twenties because \"They just can't control them anymore!\" Keeping expectations on the higher end of reasonable is so important for special needs kids. \n\nKeep teaching him consequences, though.

OH and he needs physical therapy because his muscles are barely there since you let him lay around literally all day and he can't even climb stairs without a significant amount of time allotted?

Kid, understandably, was very frustrated through out the day as expectations changed drastically depending on the setting and it was impossible to coordinate effectively between all of the settings. He assaulted me but received no consequence and when we met with his parents they didn't even apologize, they interrogated me. Requested transfer, denied, they wouldn't \"put someone else in that situation.\"\n\nI think if I had done what you did I'd have been reprimanded after the parents complained they missed a class.

I talked to her teacher at that time and she insisted she do it. One was make a model of the solar system the other match names to pictures of 8 presidents. Cost me 30 dollars in supplies and 2 hours to make the model. With lots of prompting, I had her pick up strips of papers with the names written on them and placed those in the order she picked them up next to the pictures.

This went on forever, and if you didn't know how to handle his obstinate behavior correctly he would find a creative way to get out of what he had to do( he had a whole bag of tricks).

            "Welcome to the outcome of the modern education system. \n\nThere was a time when people would strive to prove they could keep up. But that is over. It's done. Gone. Now we accept \"not trying\" as an acceptable alternative. We allow mediocrity as an acceptable alternative. The truth is, these children are now no longer challenged to meet higher expectations because asking them to try is cruel and unreasonable. \n\nThe modern education model is a farce and a complete failure for the children involved in it. Children grow from facing conflict and finding ways to overcome it. We have removed all conflict. They won't overcome anything anymore. They are helpless bodies seeking a leader to lead them. Who will lead them? Not the teachers. Maybe the state has an interest. In fact, I'll bet they do have an interest. They have these kids primed to believe anything they want them to believe. It's scary. But this is the truth. All it will take is an ambitious enough group of political advisers to see the benefit these children could have for their movement to make them drones for the next folder of a war. But, I'm being kind. They will take advantage of your children to be warriors in a war they have no idea of the consequences. Am I crazy? No, your government has been working with autistic children for some time. They know they can be the perfect soldiers that follow specific instructions without question. Does that scare you? It should. I didn't make this up. Nearly 5% of the newborn children are autistic. Think about that number. How many will the military want?",

I'm certain by your nasty description of her and her child, that you've been some rounds with her and she is extremely concerned (and rightfully so) by your belittling unprofessionalism. I can imagine that she doesn't have alternative options for education for her child either, so they are stuck with you. I can also imagine that's EXACTLY why she shows up to your room unannounced. She clearly doesn't trust you to educate her child because you have been so openly venomous with her and her child in the past. It sounds like you hate this student and his mother, and with a nasty attitude like yours, you should do everyone a favor and look for another line of work. When you get to this point of badmouthing your students and their parents on an anonymous website instead of trying to amicably trying a collaborative approach, you certainly aren't earning the taxpayer's money.

Myself and the shop manager had had a few run-in\u2019s and I assume he disliked me as much as I disliked him. \n\nI had refused to do a job and told him he didn\u2019t pay me enough. It was at the stockyards and I was expected to put on a set of waders, crawl down into a raw fat reclamation tank, and replace a submersible pump. Wasn\u2019t going to happen. \n\nAnother time he wanted me to lie to a customer to make an issue they were having sound like it wasn\u2019t our fault. I refused and told him if he want to lie about it, he was going to have to drive out to the job site and do it himself. He told me to keep my mouth shut and did come out.  \n\nI think the only reason he didn\u2019t fire me was I was by far one of the most efficient and versatile employees.  This fact had me questioning how much I was getting out of this apprenticeship and was passively looking around for another shop to apprentice at. \n\nMy wage scale was structured and I got regular raises bringing me closer to journeyman\u2019s level over my time as an apprentice. So, I had to find someone that would sign up to complete my apprenticeship as well as want to hire me. \n\nOne of our better journeymen had gone to another shop and had introduced me to the owners. We had talked about what it would take to get me to move. Things were progressing but nothing committed to at that point. \n\nQue the malicious compliance. It\u2019s my evaluation and raise time. My manager calls me up to the conference room and explains that due to my performance and the shop being in a slow period he was not going to give me the 25 cents an hour raise as my contract said but, was going to give me a dollar more an hour once I became a journeyman. We argued and I told him if I can\u2019t trust you for a quarter why would I believe the dollar?\n\nThe argument ended in him telling me if you don\u2019t like it you can always quit. Oh really?  I picked up the conference room phone on the table in front of us and called the shop I had been talking with. I asked the owner if I brought my tools over today would I have a job? After  a quick and uncomfortable discussion with his partner he said yes. \n\nI informed my manager I resigned effective now. I loaded my tools up punched out and went straight to work that afternoon.\n\nEdit:  Well now I know what RIP my inbox means. It figures that my single largest post or comment is one where I am a complete a$$hole. My wife and daughter are laughing and apparently find that fitting. I would like to state a couple of things. \n\n1.  I was only a couple years out of the Marine Corps and was young and cocky. \n2.  I was still adjusting to civilian life. \n3.  0/10 do not recommend this course of action. \n4.  Yes, it was a breach of contract but I left before I lost anything so didn\u2019t feel it was a reasonable thing to sue over. \n\nI tried to answer any direct questions.

She owned a house and lot a bungalow type near the sea, this house wasn't paid in full and there's still remaining balance about 5,200 in US dollars (this is already a big money for us). Because my father is the only son his older sisters agreed he should get the house (there was no will) but he should pay the remaining balance. We live there and renovated the house my father did almost 75% of the work he added 2 bedrooms, ceiling,  furnitures, add another bathroom, tiled the floors, kitchen sink, and septic tank (no drainage system on that location) .  Basically we recieved the house in bare shape. We paid fully in 2015 but we didn't recieved the title there was so many excuses.  \n\n2016 comes his nephew a retired commander visited my parents and told my father that he wants to add a second floor so he and his wife could live there also.  My father didn't agree and he called his older sister if they want that to happen. They just said that they don't want to get involved. His nephew showed him that he already had the title of the house (don't know how he did that maybe he used his political background?  I'm not sure) my father was furious he called me and told me what happened. That time I already bought a small patch of land for them when they want to retire, but I'm still saving enough money to build a house suitable for their needs. \nThere were court battles that I will not include but in the end his nephew won. But there was an agreement that he has to pay my father 7,400. He mailed us the contract that we should vacate the house after 6 months.  And there was a specific item that our lawyer pointed out. a.  We should repaint the house (no specific color) b.  Leave the house in original state. \n\nGuess what we hired a construction team to demolish the bedroom, the bathroom,  removed the ceiling, kitchen sink l,  tiled floor also the septic tank. Leaving it in original state. We spend about 2800 including the labor. The cherry on top we painted the house with black inside and red outside with violet dots it was a huge eyesore. I was bombarded with lots of calls and messages from my aunts and cousin which I didn't replied. We went no contact after that. \n\nMy parents now live in a beautiful farmhouse tending their small garden. They enjoy morning walks by the lake, just living a stress free environment. They are planning to adopt a puppy next month.\n\nMy grammar sucks I know sorry 'bout that\n\nEdit: maybe your wondering 5000 is a small amount for monet I didn't include that the title was pawned to someone. Not a family member.\n\nEdit2: we got our money back because we have receipts proving we paid the remaining balance\n\nEdit3: I think this is late but, I think I had made  errors in computing our currency into dollar. The judge ruled that besides the remaining balance that we had paid we should also get paid with the renovation expense.",

I understand the frustration of someone showing up years later and saying that all of your hardwork is now all theirs, but you didn't include much of what the nephew even said. He even went to court with the title and proved it was his. Did you want him to just surrender the home to you? Sorry, but he doesn't have to. And then on top of all of that you reached an agreement to leave in an agreed time frame, as well as him agreeing to pay you thousands in fees (which I can only assume is paying for the renovations) . I understand this is only a snippet of one point of view about an enitre legal situation, but IMO, this doesn't seem like malicious compliance at all, doesn't seem well deserved, just plain petty because you got talked into doing something that bit you in the ass later.",

They clearly said not valid on weekends or holidays and had expiration dates. I would regularly have to argue with guests because they were trying to use them in violation of the terms. \n\nAnyway, one day.

Instead, what I say is...\n\nMe: Absolutely Sir. \n\nYou see, what I was going to tell him before he cut me off was that his coupon was out of date and from the height of tourist season. Since the season was over and we\u2019d already gotten snow, our regular nightly rate was almost half of what his coupon said.

I've been in the general area now for 3 years, been in management and recently stepped down this year to focus on college. In early July I turned in my letter of resignation letting them know that August 13th would be my last day. \n\nIt's now about mid July now and we've got an audit going on. Basically everything has to be perfect, they ask you questions about your job, everything has to be on code etc.\n\nUp till this point we've been having an issue with staffing because instead of hiring employees full-time they hire everyone part time, I am the only full time employee in my department. Because of this, there's never enough people to work and they'll schedule 4 people working 3 or 4 hour shifts one night and then the next one person will be closing alone the entire night, usually me. \n\nI'm fine with that, I enjoy working alone but this night was extra stressful with all the extra work I had to do because of the audit. \n\nI was all alone the night in question, and working a shorter shift than usual. We tend to close the deli around 8 p.m and have 2 hours to clean up. I was scheduled till 8:30 p.m and spoke to my managers about it and got permission to close at 5 so I could take a lunch break and have 2 hours to close up. My managers also said that I would be sent someone around 7:30 p.m to help me close on time. \n\nAround 7 p.m a woman comes up to the meat slicers asking for some sliced meet, I tell her I'm sorry but we are closed for the night. She bitches me out for a moment, complains that she comes here every other night and we are always open and I explain to her that we are low on staffing and I've already cleaned the slicers for the night and she leaves. \n\nAbout 5 to 10 minutes later my assistant manager walks up and asked me what the problem was. She had gone to management and demanded we slice her the meat. I explained the situation and his response was to berate me for closing the deli down early and tell me to help her and just clean it again. \"Just stop being difficult.\" Is what he said. \n\nAfter slicing her some meat we ended up being out of a different kind and she walked out of the store leaving everything behind and meaning I had created more cleaning for nothing. I was pissed. \n\nI took a walk to cool down and went to find my buddy who was supposed to come over at 7:30 p.m and ask when he was coming over. When I found him he told me he wouldn't be able to come over because the assistant manager had come over and given him a long list of stuff to do for the rest of the night. \n\nThat pissed me off even more. \n\nI found the assistant manager and was like dude wtf and reiterated that I was leaving at 8:30 p.m and needed assistance and he told me to once again stop being difficult and just to get it all done. I told him there was no way I was getting it done in time and said that my schedule says I leave at 8:30 so I'm leaving at 8:30, regardless of how much is left to do.\n\nI guess he hadn't gotten the memo that I was quitting soon and so, in response, he tells me that if I can't do my job well enough that maybe I should start looking for another job. That was my breaking point.\n\nAfter 3 years of working with shitty management and their backward ways I decided I didn't need to do it anymore. \n\nI told him ok, found some of my favorite coworkers and told them goodbye and it was nice working with them and walked out. Haven't gone back since.\n\nThey failed their audit, 6 other employees in my general area quit shortly after time due to most of them traveling out for college. The rest are planning on leaving as well. As far as I know the entire area is fucked up. Hope the manager got his ass chewed out but I doubt it. I've reported some of the managers there for serious issues (telling me they were too busy to help women whos lives were being threatened in store, retaliation, threatening to fire people if they didn't work overtime causing someone to lose Medicare and ration their insulin and be hospitalized for a few weeks) and they never went anywhere.\n\nFuck that place.\n\nEdit: Grammar, also for those asking is was the world of wally.",

            "I felt you on the meat slicer issue. I worked in a deli for a large grocery chain some 7-8 years ago. Usually I was the closer, but we weren't given extra time to clean. We were expected to close at 8pm, and be punched out at 8pm. So I had to do all my cleaning while somehow keeping the deli open.\n\nI recall several times people would make a stink about meat slicing near closing time, but there was once I made the mistake of giving in to a customer because he asked very nicely. \n\nWhile I was slicing turkey for this perfect gentleman, the entire basketball team from our local community college walked in and demanded I bring out the fried chicken. I'd put it away an hour ago and the hot case and fryers were turned off and cleaned. But he sat there banging his hand against the case yelling at me for my attention *while I was still busy slicing meat.* I guess he wanted me to chop my hand off. I told him twice that I no longer had any hot food, apologized for the inconvenience, and directed them to some of the cold packaged meat in the island case.\n\nThe young man swore at me and left while a crunchy ass Karen lined up behind the dude I was helping. I weighed the meat for the man and he thanked me and went on his way. Asked if I could help her. She started asking me why I wouldn't help the other kid at the hot food case instead of telling me what she wanted. I answered that I was in the middle of closing and I no longer had the items he asked for, and again what I could do for her. She got upset and said that she was going to ask for deli meat but she wasn't so sure anymore because of my attitude. I was kind of irritated at that point and told her to have a nice day, she trotted away so I recleaned the slicer really fast because I was already late now.\n\nI high-tailed it out of there and apparently just missed the store manager who she went to complain to. I got a write-up in the morning.\n\nI will never work food service again.",

            "All of what OP presented here is truthful and 100% accurate.\n\nI have experienced all of these things first hand (and much more) while working in the deli/bakery for the grocery store who's mascot is a green dragon.\n\nIn retail grocery, if you aren't in management, you are a third-class worker bee, whose worth to the company is less than you can imagine. You are not there to think or have an opinion. You are there to put up with the complaining, whining and insufferable Karens and Kyles, while you slice their meats and cheeses, All while putting on your best smile, while you are grinding your teeth and are reevaluating your career choice. You are repeatedly reminded that you are easily replaceable. You are talked down-to by customers and thrown under the bus by management, in the quest to avoid customer complaints at all costs.\n\nDo I sound salty? Well, that's because I am. Did I do something about it? Yes. I got the fuck out. It took me eighteen fucking years to realize what a fool I was for putting up with retail and I feel much better about life since I left and found a different path in life.\n\n/rant",
            "I worked at a the grocery deli for four days as a second job several years ago. I did the typical onboarding, spent a day watching all the videos and doing \u201ccomputer training\u201d. My second day I was supposed to be trained in the deli. But the person said they were too busy to train me, and had me doing dishes and cleaning the floor. Whatever. It was a second job, I didn\u2019t have any expectations or aspirations. \n\nMy third day, the \u201ctrainer\u201d from the day before wasn\u2019t scheduled, and the person working had no idea what to do with me, so I once again did dishes and cleaned the floors. \n\nMy fourth day, I clocked in, and the \u201ctrainer\u201d was back. Yay. But she was swamped at the counter with a long line. She asked me to help her out. I said sure, but I don\u2019t actually know how any of the equipment works. She said she figured they would have shown me the day before. Nope, I can do the dishes though. lol She gave me a very quick once through on how to use the slicer, and set me up at the counter, and split the line. So now I was faced with frustrated customers on a Friday night. The first person was a guy who wanted something we didn\u2019t have at the counter. My co-worker said it was in the walk-in. I looked, and sure enough I eventually found a spot labeled with that kind of ham, but it was empty. \n\nI stood there, and literally out loud said, \u201cI could go out and turn right, and try to explain. OR. Or I could turn left, clock out, and go home. \n\nAs I was leaving I saw the manager chatting in the bakery. I handed her my hat and said they probably needed some help in deli. I felt SO GOOD to just walk out. lol",

Hell, I was even in the deli.\n\nThey wanted to give me the responsibility *and accountability* of a shift leader, but without the title, pay, or benefits.  We *never* had enough staff, and basically never properly closed because of it.  But every morning my department head would chew me out for the shit my coworkers did wrong, and tell me to make sure they did it right, even though I had no actual authority over anyone.\n\nI got so stressed and anxious about it I just stopped showing up.

Many telling what management  \"gave them for thanks\" after all their work as \"heroes\" in the last wave.  $ 42, gift coupons for $ 5 off of a fast food meal, just \"thanks\" in an email, nothing at all(not even a thanks in an email).

If the name on the ID didn't match, or if the customer didn't have their ID; no sale, no exceptions.\n\nOf course the first time I ever come across a customer buying over $100 in gift cards with a credit card that doesn't match their ID, the customer throws a fit worthy of a toddler (just imagine all the \"I spend money here\" and \"The customer's always right\" Karen-isms you can think of).

But you said management has been difficult. \nBe aware that many employers see an employee who has already given notice as a liability and will end employment immediately. Frequently, employees who have given notice are unmotivated to do the job well, prone to calling out sick, show up late, are eager to leave early, and can be a higher risk for pilferage. \nGiving notice in early July of a mid-August departure seems excessive to me. Especially if you were planning on those weeks of pay for rent and other bills.

It really backs you up. Not to mention that those screens get dirty fast and need to be wiped down often. Having to tell people to do what exactly is being said on the screen.

Some five or six years ago...\n\nMy wife\u2019s grandmother passed and left us her home in her will. The house was rather large, but had been built some time in the 1960s and needed updating. We decided to basically gut the home and do a full remodel. \n\nFirst thing was to talk to my insurance guy and see what I needed to do with the insurance. He comes out and explains that I need to do a fire policy, which basically will replace the structure in the event of a major catastrophe. Cool, insurance in place I start remodeling. \n\nFast forward seven or eight months and I am done, and so bone tired and mad at the world that my reflection in the mirror tried to avoid me. I was working a rotating shift (days, evenings, midnights) and spending every waking moment working on this house. Five hours a day/night was the most sleep I was getting. I would snap at the wind for blowing I was so strung out. Que the insurance guy and his antics...\n\nWhile I was sleeping after working midnight shift, my wife has IG (insurance guy) come to look at the house and change the policy back to full coverage. When I wake up for my next shift, she informs me that we have to put a new roof on before he can change the policy. I almost came unglued. I had ripped the ceilings out of this house, so if there had been a roof leak, I am pretty sure I would have found it. Luckily this was Friday evening, so I had the entire weekend to calm down and plot my next move. \n\nI called first thing  Monday morning and set up an appointment for 8 a.m. Tuesday at the house, and explained to him I was on midnights and to please make sure he was there by 8 a.m. No particular reason, I just hoped it would discomfort him having to be somewhere else that early in the morning (a dick move mostly). Tuesday morning rolls around, and he shows up with his boss. At first this threw me off, but I figure what the hell, two birds, one rock and stuff. \n\nMe: IG, hows it going?\n\nIG: Pretty good, how are you?\n\nMe: Tired. How bout you show me exactly what is wrong with this roof so we can get going?\n\nIG: Sure thing, step right over here. You see that shingle?\n\nMe: Ya.\n\nIG: See how bad a shape it\u2019s in?\n\nMe: Sure do! (thinking to myself, \u201chell no, what the fuck are you looking at?\u201d)\n\nIG: And over there see that place?\n\nMe: Yup, gotta bad spot or two there also!\n\nIG: This roof has taken some serious storm damage, it is in rough shape!\n\nWe proceed all the way around the house with him pointing at random spots, as far as I could tell, and saying things like \u201cThat shingle is shot. Those too. Ya, and right here.\u201d The whole time I just did like a chicken pecking and affirmed him with \u201cYup! You\u2019re right\u201d All the while his boss is saying nothing. \n\nAfter he is finished pointing out all of these bad places,\n\nIG: So see, you will have to replace that roof before we can cover it. \n\nMe: Your right, I had been so busy on the inside I hadn\u2019t paid much attention. So, can you file the claim for me, or do I need to go talk to one of the ladies down at the office?\n\nIG: CLAIM??!! What do you mean a claim!!???\n\nMe: Well, best I can figure it was those bad storms back in April that did all this damage, and y\u2019all were covering it through my GMIL\u2019s policy, so I reckon y\u2019all would be who I s\u2019posed to talk to right? \n \n(I like turning the backwoods country accent up to 11 when dealing with people who think they are smarter than me, adds flavor to the humble pie for them)\n\nIG: Well now, hold on. \n\nMe: Naw, you\u2019re a hunnerd percent right. It\u2019s took some serious storm damage, and we ain\u2019t had none since that bout back in April. Now, I put the fire policy on in July, so any damage done woulda fell back on the old policy. \n\nIG: ......(standing there sucking air like it\u2019s gonna run out)\n\nIG\u2019s boss: He\u2019s right. And since they have a year to file that claim, we will have to do it. Get the paperwork started and let me know if you need help.\n\n\n\nI am no roof expert, the roof could have been shot all to hell for all I know. It looked good, and didn\u2019t leak. After I explained to the adjuster what the whole deal was about, he found enough other stuff wrong so that I wasn\u2019t out one nickel on an entire new roof!\n\nTLDR: Insurance guy decided to be a jack wagon for some reason, and I got a free roof out of the deal!\n\n\nEdit: A few points to help clear things up some. \n\nMy wife was executor of the estate, and had a POA for the deceased. \n\nI referenced the storms in April because that year there were multiple bad hail storms that came through. Car dealerships lost entire inventories from these storms. It was an insurance nightmare all year long, which was why nothing was really questioned. The rest of that year was fairly calm weather wise, so it was most likely the event that \u201cdestroyed\u201d the roof. \n\nThe roof was about 5 years old give or take. Wear and tear wasn\u2019t a concern, and the insurance company had held the policy on the house since forever and were familiar with it. \n\nIG was wanting me to pay for the roof out of my pocket. If this had been pointed out in July when I had the policy changed originally it would not have irritated me as much. After spending the entire summer and fall working on the house and him popping up with \u201cOh yeah by the way\u201d, yes it rubbed me the wrong way. \n\nI am a hick, bumpkin, and some of the other names mentioned. I love that people automatically shave 30 points off of my IQ for talking the way I do (insert jokes about my now negative IQ here please). It gives me a distinct advantage when someone does this. Yes I play it up for my own amusement/benefit. It is no different than a woman using her looks, a policeman using his badge, or any of the other advantages people use daily. \n\nI do not type in my southern accent all the time because it isn\u2019t easy. It\u2019s almost like making a language up as you go, and if it is that hard for me to type, I can only imagine what someone who is unfamiliar with the vernacular would go through reading it. I would imagine there would be migraines and brain scans involved before they got to the end of the post. \n\n",

Now obviously it's funny that it ended up being their money that covered it, but it sounds like he's just doing things by the books. That's not being a \"jack wagon\" that's his job.\n\nWhat's he meant to do, just take your assurance that it doesn't leak? C'mon.\n\nThe adjuster even found more things that were wrong. You needed a new roof and he pointed it out. The fact that you didn't like that doesn't put him in the wrong.",
            "There is so much incorrect about this story it makes me wonder if it\u2019s true.  I\u2019ve been in claims since 2004.\n\nThe adjuster and boss would have no idea about the prior policy on the house while adjusting yours.   There would be no reason to have information about another customer.  They would never had agreed without looking that up first, and then they wouldn\u2019t discuss it with you.\n\nAdjusters loooooove cutting checks.  They really do.  Even when they don\u2019t owe something.  No one argues when they get money.  There are shitbags out there who try to interpret the policy for denial rather than coverage, but they tend to not last long in the business.\n\nI\u2019ve worked or supervised claims in 42 states.  The standard ISO policy for each of them carries no 1 year statute to make a claim.  Some have a 1 year to sue limitation, but courts have found that doesn\u2019t limit your ability to make a claim.\n\nThis a a maybe for me dog.\n",

He is supposed to point out those problems with the roof and also supposed to help you file a claim if it happened while covered (not tell you to pay for it out of pocket).  Even though your roof wasn\u2019t leaking yet they are trained to spot damage that will lead to a leaking roof in the near future.  While they are not excited about paying the claim they probably prevented a larger claim in the future that would have included water damage.

It turned out the damage was caused while you had a policy in place... they replaced the roof for you.\n\nMaybe I missed somewhere how the fella was trying to do anything other than his job, and why you were so upset by it. From your writing the only reason was because \u201cyou had taken out the ceiling and there were no leaks\u201d, but the insurance company doesn\u2019t care much about leaks... they care about storm damage or moss build-up or old decaying roofs.\n\nI also don\u2019t find this to be malicious compliance. Half of all roof replacements in the US are storm damage. It\u2019s not like it affected this guy in any way.  Unless of course you were being a prick about the whole thing, in which case it was probably annoying having to give an ass hole a free roof... but it isn\u2019t like it came out of his pocket.\n\nNot trying to be a downer, but sounds like a good insurance company. Half of the ones out there would have fucked with you hard, and would have taken months and the threat of legal action to cover the damage... and then would have only covered \u201cstorm repairs\u201d, and then would have refused to renew the policy because of roof age.

He informed you of that and also walked the house with you to point out the damages.  Upon being informed that the damages likely took place when you had full coverage policy, he set up a claim for you and paid it in full.\n\nWhat you did:  \n\nFlip out when told about the damages to your roof.

It was clearly dead and leaning over my house.\n\nInsurance guy was like, \u201cNothing we can do about that, but if you wanna pay the contractors we send over to cut it down for you, you can do that\u201d\n\nPadre said \u201cNo thanks\u201d.\n\nQue a few years later, the tree falls on my house. The impact shifted the roof on the whole house over a few inches, and damaged the underlying structure too. When the rain came, the roof leaked, and water damaged abounded.\n\nPadre paid the deductible or whatever, and that ended up being less than what it would have taken to cut the tree down. Insurance people paid many thousands of dollars having contractors cut up and remove the tree, fix the water damage, replace the roof\u2019s insulation, fix the supporting structure, and finally replace the entire roof. The whole process took a few weeks to do with a whole crew of people. All because Insurance can\u2019t do anything preventative.",

I also posted this to /r/talesfromtechsupport, but it was removed.\n\nI used to manage a Cadillac dealership's network a couple of years ago. There was a car salesman who also liked to study computers on his spare time. Unfortunately that also meant that he knew way too much to be absolutely dangerous. I would constantly get complaints about him bunking down on a specific floating desk on the floor and locking it out from anyone to use it but him. I reached out to management about it, but they didn't want to do anything about it. Even though he was bypassing many security features like local admin (used a boot env to give himself local admin), web filtering, unapproved apps, remoting, etc (all via a USB with a bunch of portable apps).\n\n**Management:**\n\n\"Why are you coming to us about an IT problem?\"\n\n\"This isn't a management problem when it involves computers.\"\n\n\"Isn't that your job? I'm pretty sure that's in your job description.\"\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nBut I was sick and tired of getting calls and messages daily about this one guy. So I decided that if management wasn't going to have my back on this issue, then I guess I have free reign to handle it how I please, right?\n\nSince I was dealing with an above average user, I decided to go to the furthest extreme. I took a machine, imaged it to the same image as the floating desk machines, and went to town planning all the restrictions needed.\n\nBIOS locked with password. Boot to USB disabled. Chassis locked and closed (no cmos reset). Auto Login to a generic \"sales\" account. USB disabled in windows. Desktop redirected to a folder on the file server with locked permissions (no delete. specific icons only). Chrome browser only no IE or anything else. Chrome bookmarks set to only what is needed. Log off removed; only restart or shutdown (Even if he did managed to somehow log off, it would just log back in to \"sales\"). And a litany of other basic windows restrictions that essentially silos the machine to either chrome or their Car sales software.\n\nI brought all my changes and my purchase requisition for the locks over to management and was approved with no questions. I sold it as a necessary security measure and threw my weight around about how \"This is in my job description to address it and implement it.\"\n\nSpent an early Monday morning rolling out all the changes before he came in. Late afternoon rolls around and he finally shows up. I'm off the clock, but decided to stay to see the fallout. He walks in, makes a bee line to his \"desk\" and watched as he sat confused at everything.\n\n\"I can't log out. I can't boot my USB? Windows can't see my USB either. I can't do anything at all!\"\n\nI watched in pure satisfaction as he just got up from the chair and walked around the sales floor aimlessly with nothing to do. The bonus part is after all the changes, whenever a different sales person complained about the changes, all I needed to say was \"Sorry for the inconvenience! The changes were necessary due to a salesperson messing with the computers. I'm not allowed to say who it was though. So unfortunately the changes will need to stay.\"\n\nThey all knew who it was though.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the awards!!! I appreciate it!!",

One sales guy decided he wanted to hook his laptop into the network at a table that had a network point that wasn\u2019t patched in (this was before wifi was common).\n\nThe first we knew of it was one of our monitoring systems going red as the entire branch office dropped off the network. Troubleshooting mode: try to ping the branch server. No response. Try to connect to the network switch. No response.\n\nI called them and asked the (reasonably clueful) junior office manager to see if the lights were on in the network/server cabinet and the reply chilled me to the bone: \u201csorry, I can\u2019t see - Sales guy is in the way\u201d. \n\n\u201cIs he standing in front of it\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, he\u2019s doing something in it \u2026 you don\u2019t think \u2026?\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope not. Please tell him to beck away from it. Right now please.\u201d\n\nSales guy had gone and re-patched half the damn cabinet trying to get the network point he wanted working.

        "selftext": "This pains me to write. I keep going back and forth as to which of my sentences  I should start with , the former or this next one. Tears are rolling down this old teachers face; a rarity. \n\nI\u2019ve had a fairly rough teaching career. In my sixteen years of contracted service, I\u2019ve spent five of those in the school I\u2019ve been at this year. This is a record possible in part due to my eventual kickassedness at teaching algebra, part from learning when to shut up (always), part learning that the students, and my care, are all that matters, but mostly due to my great rapport, relationship with my principal . He gets my quirkiness, knows I\u2019m a great teacher so he doesn\u2019t need to tell me what he has to others (for the most part), and he\u2019s as hands off as an amazing principal can be. I\u2019ve finally hit my groove in education when my principal , we\u2019ll call him dr. J, just got his doctorate and now is moving onward and upward.\n\nShit.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if this is just a school thing, but he\u2019s doing his farewell tour while introducing us all to the new principal. We\u2019ll call him Not the Mama. Anyone from the 90s who also has suffered from the New Boss Blues knows my pain, and gets this reference. \n\nDuring the tour Doctor J tells Not the Mama about me, how I\u2019m the hardest, smartest worker and teacher. How I have a great relationship with my students, hoe they stop by the school to see me years after. He also mentions in this live recommendation that I have second job working fast food. \n\nNot the Mama instantly winces at this, right about the same time as everyone\u2019s favorite teacher /s, Miss Why-aren\u2019t-you-paying-attention-to-my-ironic-T-shirt, pops out of a sky filled with irregular sized suspenders and stories about someone\u2019s relatives that amazingly have no relevance to any person, living or dead.  I\u2019m pretty sure she said something to distract dr. J long enough to give Not the Mama the opportunity to turn back to me, like a dad threatening his children into \u201cbein hayve \u201c while he tries to convince his first date since his wife left him that he\u2019s a great dad. \n\nHe manages to quickly mutter under his breath what confirmed every fear I had about the new boss: \u201cHaving a second job won\u2019t cut it with me so you better fix that pronto\u201d\n\nReverse jerry McGuire, you lost me at pronto. You had me at Hell No. \n\nI despised this person so much in such a short time that it wasn\u2019t even an afterthought that, despite my \u201csecond\u201d job being minimum wage, and despite my current job just issuing me a longevity bonus (literally yesterday), I would press the biggest, most important Malicious Compliance button of my life and see how the fuck it goes.\n\nPronto means soon, so that afternoon I put in my notice that I won\u2019t be coming back. Hey, he wants me to only have one job right? Voila. That\u2019s French for Check this shit out. Your man OP started going back on School Spring. Two interviews set up for tomorrow via zoom. \n\nOh, and I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019ll be a juicy update, because I just received four missed calls from Dr. j and I\u2019m going to check my email, as requested by Dr. j. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m leaving. Pretty sure he can\u2019t either.\n\nBarely worth reading update:\n\nI read Dr. Js email. It was shorter than the texts, but both basically said he needs to meet with me to find out why I\u2019m suddenly out. I can tell based on his wording that he suspects it\u2019s the new boss, but he\u2019s never be accused of explicitly saying anything via email. I didn\u2019t give any reason for making the decision, and he begged me not to send anything officially to district until we talk. \n\nAs we\u2019re texting back in forth right now, yes at midnight, he asked how I felt about \u201cDesert Valley\u201d, the district he\u2019s going to be Director of Pancakes or whatever at. I\u2019m looking into it right now. But I\u2019ll sleep on it. Next update in 12 hours ish.\n\nOkay. Nothing iron clad, but three schools need an academic advisor for Math in \u201cDesert Valley\u201d. He says I\u2019m a shoe in. Pay scale looks promisingly better too.\n\nUpdate: \u201cConfirmed\u201d. Interviewing with two of the three schools for a job that pays me what I\u2019m worth. Fingers crossed. \n\nOn an unrelated note, it appears that I have people that either really like, or really can\u2019t stand my writing. Can\u2019t please everybody. Not gonna try. But thanks for the input. What I HAVE noticed is that those who enjoyed it will give examples of what they liked, you know, claims reasoning and evidence. Very few who claim I\u2019m a terrible writer give me specifics. I would like to know how I can improve. I swear, it\u2019s not just to call out the haters and call them uncreative copypasta whores.\n\nUPdate/Editto: Regardless of whether I land the interview I'm going to later this month at Dr. J's new district, I will be leaving this place, and have had three teachers come and ask me what's up. I told them outright that I don't have a good feeling about the new principal. Word is getting around. I just replied to an email from my closest colleague about this post and what the dude said, verbatim. She says that about six more teachers will walk too, because they all have second jobs. The new principal, guaranteed, will probably lose the job before he gets it. I've seen this type of behavior before, and when the gossip train leaves the station it always comes back with less passengers... and in this case no conductor. There's only two options: Option 1: this guy meets with district about the influx of feedback, as negative as it was instantaneous, and decides to walk. Option 2: Same beginning, but decides to stay and fight the good fight. The uphill battle just got a steeper incline for him. He is such a drastic change from Dr. J that it's a wonder he got the job in the first place. I'm curious how his interview went. Either way, I do feel for the kids, because that's who will suffer the most in all of this. Unhappy teachers are education killers. But I can't think of all this right now, I have to get my mind right... positive....and forward thinking.\n\nTLDR- Algebra teacher gets a new job and is either a great or terrible writer.\n\nFallout Boy\u2026.\nMy current/old school is begging for me back. NTM won\u2019t be principal next year. Evidently I\u2019m not the only one he rubbed the wrong way. Still moving forward with interviews\u2026just now I\u2019m in a crevasse of doubt. Or something else overly described.\n\nUpdate!\n\nI interviewed for two schools, got offers from one already (from the one I didn\u2019t think I did so well at) and the other I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve got a good shot. Decided to take the first offer just to have it not looming over my head any longer. It\u2019s 12000 more per year than current, plus many bonuses tied to school performance that could extend that to a cool 20,000 (8k in bonuses possible, 1 per school that beats the national average).   Excited to be moving on, and I\u2019ll probably still do Wendy\u2019s until I get a few new checks in the bank. It\u2019s actually less take home work this new academic coach job. I\u2019m loving it.",

            "You want specifics about your writing. OK.\n\nThis is full of spelling mistakes, bad grammar and missing words. For example, in the fourth paragraph you are missing an 'a' before 'second job'. In the first paragraph, the semicolon before 'a rarity' should be a colon. There are many, many such problems.\n\nThat is quite mundane stuff, but it does make a difference; it just greatly increases the friction/difficulty of parsing your writing, and strains the reader's patience.\n\nMore distinctively, you frequently leap from one idea to a very different one, or introduce an entirely new idea mid-sentence, without any warning. Look at the first sentence of your fifth paragraph, for example. It is very jarring and clumsy for you to introduce that female teacher in the way that you do. The way you did it would be more appropriate as a joke about an established character, not as a way to introduce them. As it stands, I had to re-read that first sentence about four times before I understood that an entirely new character had appeared and had started telling irrelevant anecdotes to the departing principal. Also, it comes across as childish and spiteful, which does not endear you to me in a story in which you are supposed to be the winsome hero.\n\nIn general, your style of writing, and presumably your style of thought, is scattershot, casual, and oddly evasive in a curt, sardonic way. It feels like it would cause you pain to tell a story briefly, coherently and without spilling over into your pet hates (such as of colleagues who wear suspenders).",

            "I don't particularly enjoy your writing style and will add add my reasoning as requested.  \n\nOverall, it's the amalgamation of two generally disliked styles: \"math teacher word problem\" and \"rambling storytelling\".  \n\nMath teacher style is a series of logic steps that generally don't have flow or overall context, but presented in a way that implies significance.  Basically, presenting details in a way to make readers think they are important it that you'll revisit them later in the story.  \n\nEx: classic train speed problem includes departure time, distance, and speed.  While a normal discussion usually includes arrival time, style of train (comfort of travel), cost of ticket, etc.  \n\nIn your story, you don't do basic setup like describing the size of your class/school (helps paint a picture), why 5 years working at the same place is an achievement(sets the stakes on what you're risking), or your emotional/financial state (currently seems like you quit your job cuz you can afford to be petty and Dr J has your back; comes off entitled).  \n\nThen the rambling storytelling compounds that with you: going on tangents, explaining references, and generally disjointed commentary.  \n\nWriting is not as forgiving as talking.  When you verbally tell a rambling story, it's slightly less annoying to do the, \"oh and he was there doing x. I hate that guy, always smells of cheese.  Small hands, too\"\nIn writing, you have to introduce characters ahead of time, even generally.  \"My math dept is about a dozen teachers, most are standard, but my nemesis is a purple-haired Karen, that we'll call... Karen.\"\n\nI imagine you write like your talk, but with slightly better results, as hopefully you filter out the more irrelevant tangents simply from timing.  \nIf you want to improve your writing, add basic info, edit down your refs+explaination (or make them less specific/obscure), and stop trying to sound \"quirky\".  I'm sure your tryhard antics is adorable irl and why your students like you, but it's just annoying in writing.  \n\nHope that helps and congrats on the new job.",

            "I didn't grow up in the US, but spent a year there as an exchange student in the '90s. My host parents were both teachers, and both had second jobs. I didn't get it - they weren't rolling in money form working 2 jobs each, they just seemed to be comfortable. I couldn't understand why they didn't earn enough from teaching.\n\nAt the school I went to, in a small town where I knew most people, many of the male teachers' wives didn't work, or if they did, they were teachers too. Of the female teachers who weren't married to the male teachers, one's husband didn't work, a few were single and the rest were married to farmers and I got the impression that they loved their husband's but hated farming, so just continued to teach like they had when single. The families that had both spouses working were really well off, and the ones with just one person working seemed financially comfortable. So why did my host parents both need second jobs? I couldn't believe how much poorer paid teachers in the US were than in my country.\n\nNow I'm a teacher, in my country, 25 years later, in a pandemic and recession and yeah, there is no way my husband could give up his job and survive on my income alone.\n\nAs long as you're in class when you're meant to be, and you get all your prep and marking and pointless paperwork done, then what you do outside of school hours is mostly your own business.",

I forget the name of it, but for the sake of this story, let\u2019s call it Fells Wargo. \n\nIt may not truly be MC.  It took some creative thinking outside the box prompted by their own phrasing. You be the judge. \n\nThere are some important parts that come into play:\n\n1. My spouse and I were young and dumb financially.  We both had bounced a few checks on our own checking accounts.  They were closed a few years prior.\n\n2. Fells Wargo offered a way to rehab your checking account history.  They offered you the opportunity to pay them an additional $10/month to have the right to have a checking account, they restricted the release of funds and made life difficult to even have a checking account but if you played by their rules you could \u201cgraduate\u201d to a traditional checking account after a year. \n\n3. I participated in the \u201copportunity checking\u201d and graduated my account.  My spouse had lived without a checking account for a few years and wanted to try again. \n\n4. I took my spouse to Fells Wargo.  We specifically explained their previous history, and specifically asked for the shitty checking rebuilding account. We knew my spouse needed to start at the bottom.  \n\n5. The manager of the branch enters the basic information and declared there was no need for the rehab checking account.  They qualified for the regular account.  We asked again to be absolutely sure.  Yes. No rehab needed. Here\u2019s some starter checks.  Your ATM card will be in the mail in a week.  Gladly took an initial cash deposit of $500.\n\nFast forward a week.  We get the ATM card.  Call to activate it.  \n\n\u201cYour account has been closed.\u201d  \nWhy? \n\n\u201cWe determined you have bad checking history previously.\u201d\n\nWe go round and round about how we covered this, disclosed it up front and asked for the checking rehab account. \n\n\u201cYou will have to go back and open that account if you want it. We can\u2019t change the account.\u201d\n\nSo, they\u2019re closing the account.  Because we needed to have the rehab checking account.  The one we specifically asked for and they refused. *facepalm*. My spouse didn\u2019t know what to say so we got on speakerphone. I started asking questions.  \n\nSo, will you pay the outstanding checks and refund the rest?\n\n\u201cNo. We won\u2019t pay any checks.  You\u2019ll be charged for returned checks from your merchants.\u201d  \n\n(My spouse wrote 3 checks totaling less than $100. Very few places accepted starter checks.). They have the funds in the closed account to pay them. Where is the issue?\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nAt this point they became flustered.  Nobody seems to ever have the funds or the audacity to demand them to pay checks written in good faith. They had no answers on how they refused the checking account we requested and would have been okay to have.  They didn\u2019t think they had a responsibility to notify us the account was closed.  And how dare we challenge their policy. They didn\u2019t like how I kept pointing out how there wasn\u2019t a single thing we did wrong but they think they are not responsible for returned check fees. So they decided to not talk to me any longer.\n\nThey hung up.  We call back. Repeat. \n\nFinally they offer this gem:\n\u201cWe won\u2019t talk to anyone except the name on the account.\u201d *click*\n\nTheir only possible choice to avoid a difficult discussion where they own their mistakes was clinging to not letting someone else ask questions with the account holder\u2019s permission. \n\nTHEY EVEN REFUSED TO LET ME TELL MY SPOUSE WHAT TO ASK AND RESPOND TO MY SPOUSE DIRECTLY!\n\nCan only talk to the name on the account? Okay!\n\nSo I called back.  \nMiraculously, in sixty seconds, I now identified as a different person. \n\n\u201cThanks for calling Fells Wargo. May I have your name?\u201d\n\n(Spouses name)\n\n*Long pause*\n\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t (spouses name)\u201d\n\nSure I am! Ask me anything!\n\n\u201cName. SSN. Address. Mother\u2019s maiden name. DOB.\u201d (Verified it all as the name on the account)\n\n*Long Pause*\n\n\u201cNo. You aren\u2019t (spouse)\u201d\n\nWhy do you say that?\n\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re a man.\u201d\n\nWait a minute! That\u2019s why you closed my account? Because I\u2019m a man?  I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s against ECOA, maybe Reg B. (Laws stating discrimination on gender is illegal.  Banks can\u2019t reference gender or other protected classes to close accounts)\n\n\u201cPlease hold\u201d\n\nA manager finally comes on. We have a little back and forth about who I identify as. But seeing how I\u2019m not doing anything except demanding they pay checks on my spouses account, written by my spouse, with funds in their possession, there isn\u2019t much they can fight. But they finally agree to pay the 3 checks from the funds in the account. They didn\u2019t want to. Even in the end\u2026but the name on the account demanded it. \n\nFallout? They had to do the right thing after wasting hours fighting it.",

            "I had an interaction with a bank at work that was similar. At the time I worked for a company that was the parent company and there was an offshoot branch for one aspect of what we did. We shared the same contact information and bank accounts and the offshoot branch specifically stated they were a branch of the parent company. I called trying to sort something out with the bank and as is standard practice for what I was doing, they had to verify I was authorised on that particular matter which involved giving some details about the matter (name, address, reference numbers) and the name of the company I was calling from. At the time I was working for an area of the parent company so I identified myself as being from there. Didn\u2019t even think of the offshoot branch immediately since our work rarely crossed over in that way. Several times the bank told me I wasn\u2019t authorised because our company wasn\u2019t on the authorised list.

            "A few ways to avoid some pitfalls with banks:\n\n1. Never opt in to overdraft protection. Around ten years ago the regulations changed in the US to make overdraft protection opt-in. Now they sell it as a feature. Great. \n\n2. Don't make purchases with a debit card if you can help it. Only use your checking account for bills. Credit cards have much better fraud protection than debit cards, and in the event of fraud, they don't already have your money, they have the cc companies money. If you can use credit responsibly, do so. If not, pay cash. \n\n3. Pay bills first, then take out your spending money in cash. That way you can't overdraw your account, and you know exactly what you have to spend. \n\nThese are all lessons I've learned the hard way.",

She kept screaming (not hyperbole, actual screaming), that her boss was too important to speak to someone as unimportant as me and I'd have to speak to her if I wanted to resolve the issue (she'd called us, and there was no issue, they were just impatient for the delivery). I told her very clearly and in the most *nudge nudge wink wink* voice I could, that I could only speak to the person who's name matched the name currently on the account, even if she had the login details, and that \"her boss\" could change the name to her name if he wanted her to use the account.\n\nAfter five times of her ringing back screaming at me me telling her the above and then having to terminate the call due to abusive language, she finally called back and the name in the account was magically hers.

Everything was more important that cashing my check. Most staff were opening new accounts or wheedling account holders to get more \"banking services\". There was one staffer handling regular customer transactions, and she wouldn't even look at me, because she was solely focused on drive through customers.\n\nAfter she'd finished with a drive through customer, and the next one hadn't yet appeared at the window, I asked her to help me, she rolled her eyes and said she was working the drive through. I replied that she was only staffer dealing with ordinary transactions. She rolled her eyes again, and turned back to the drive through window.\n\nI blew my stack, demanding that my transaction be dealt with by somebody, right now. The ugly, bug eyed branch manager said I would just have to wait. I said, no, you're going to complete my transaction, now. She repeated her statement, and admonished me for being loud. I replied, just complete my transaction, and I'll get the hell out of here. She told me not to \"curse\". I narrowed my eyes, and said you have never heard cursing like you're about to hear if you don't get somebody to serve me right now.\n\nShe made the drive through cashier serve me. She literally threw the money at me.

To put it simply I help both minors, elder and the disabled to their next flight. This didn\u2019t happen to me directly, but I was somewhat involved and it was funny.\n\nThis happened just yesterday. I was assisting a disabled women in one of the airport wheelchairs with possibly finding a seat on the flight as she was on standby. As I\u2019m explaining the situation to my passenger, a heated discussion breaks out between the gate agents and a high quality Karen. The agents are trying to explain to her that per the airlines policy, masks must fully cover your face from your nose down and the bandanna over her face was not good enough and they could give her a proper one.\nKaren argues that she \u201chas had this mask on for the past 3 flights and it was never a problem\u201d. The gate agents severely doubts her claim.\n\nThe arguing continues for a minute more before Karen uses the signature line, \u201cCan you go get your manager? I wanna speak to someone who knows how to do there job!\u201d The gate agent says you got it and almost skips away to find her manager. They both come back over and the manager addresses Karen one more time, as the agent had already given him a quick run down of the situation. Manager: \u201cMam\u2019m, per whatever airlines policy your mask must cover your nose and mouth fully. Hanging facials clothes, gas masks and masks with valves are not permitted. We have extras to give you if you need one\u201d\nKaren: \u201cSo basically you don\u2019t know how to do your job either\u201d\n\nThe manager breathe a quick sigh, says ok and take over the computer for about 5 minutes before waving me and my passenger on to board the flight. It wasn\u2019t until I walked out of the jet lane and seen Karen still standing in the waiting area that it dawned on me. The manager had taken Karen\u2019s seat and given it to my passenger who was on standby. Judging from the screaming and cursing after that door closed, Karen didn\u2019t realize it right away either.\n\nEdit: omg wow thanks so much for the awards! You guys are awesome! :)",

Airlines in the US specify that you cannot wear a mask withe an exhalation valve, even if it is filtered. But no airline, nor the FAA specify that you cannot wear a cloth mask, such as a bandana or gator mask. The rule is that it MUST COVER YOUR MOUTH AND NOSE, and NOT HAVE AN EXHALATION VALVE, but that is where the rules end.  Anyone care to explain what I am missing here?",
