        "selftext": "So I used to work for one of the top delivery companies in the UK. There was a lot less competition 15yrs ago. \n\nI was very good at my specific delivery job and I often undertook every office task from single delivery routes to maintaining the office and delivery distribution to all routes. \n\nThen one day in comes the new manager and it was the cliche that you dread. You probably all have met the type. Suit slightly too big and a trainee moustache. He had just finished Uni and to his credit got himself a business degree. \n\nThe problem with this company was every office around the whole country was run differently and this poor manager was expecting every person to do things by the letter but most of the work was done on good will since we were allowed to finish for the day when we had completed our deliveries. It was creating a rod for our own backs tbh but it was nice to finish earlier on lighter days. \n\nFinally on his third day after watching me daily and asking me why I was doing things in certain orders I told him my delivery route was complex and required it to be done in a certain order to ensure the timed deliveries got there before 1pm and the other delivery staff were \u201cfed\u201d their delivery materials by myself at certain times to ensure optimum delivery speeds and minimum delay. He replied \u201cNo it doesn\u2019t work like that\u201d. I simply stared for a bemused few seconds and said I don\u2019t understand. \n\nHe wanted it by the letter today as per company guidelines. I argued very hard against it and said he will really regret it because we won\u2019t complete but he insisted I was wrong because it was all timed and measured.\n\nSo after an exasperated 15 minute heated discussion I did as I was told. To the letter. The 5 staff I fed deliveries too weren\u2019t happy but understood. \n\nIt was like a domino effect of carnage. \n\nAt 12:30pm we all rang in the office to report the failed timed deliveries which he promptly freaked out about because they were strictly monitored. The subsequent enforced break times and shuffling required also left 15-20% of each walk unfinished which he also now has to complete himself on top of the timed ones. \n\nHe had to fill out reports for all failed 1pm deliveries, all walk failures and then had to call in managers from other offices to finish it all. They all finished around 4hrs late. \n\nHe was not popular!!\n\nThe next day he came to me asked me to show him the mechanics of the delivery route in detail because \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that to happen if I\u2019m honest\u201d. It was close enough to an apology for me \ud83d\ude01. \n\nWe actually became good friends over time but he never questioned me when I said \u201cnope\u201d ever again.",

            "Similar thing happened to me. First day on the job, the new manager told us (a great team of experienced professionals) that we WEREN\u2019T to do any filing of orders: this was the \u201cmanager\u2019s job\u201d, that the back room was \u201c*HER* office\u201d (which we shouldn\u2019t even enter when she wasn\u2019t there), and those were the \u201c*manager\u2019s* files and books\u201d, which were \u201cnone of our business\u201d. \n\nAfter trying to argue with her (and finding her extremely patronising), we all gave up and left her to it. If she wanted to do some of our work, fine. But how did she even know about our orders? Something was wrong somewhere, but what can you do?\n\nRoll forward in time, and there you go: everything is chaos, collapsing in all directions. The woman hadn\u2019t been fully trained and there were procedures that she\u2019d never even heard of-which subsequently hadn\u2019t been done for months.\n\nTo give her credit, she wasn\u2019t a bad person-and she came to us, explained it all and thoroughly apologised. We all pulled together, got the department out of the hole (it took several weeks) and hushed the whole thing up. It was a horrible company to work for and she certainly would have been sacked.\n\nAfter that, she was absorbed into our team and we went back to being a group of really solid, efficient working friends. It was a bonding experience for all of us, actually.",

            "This reminds me of a common problem with engineers right out of college (and a joke with engineers in general) which is that the math they do is for their own little world. My dad was a programmer for blast furnaces at sand and garbage dumps for over a decade on his own and another decade prior where he learned and specialized. He would always tell stories of arguments with resident engineers that had it all mathed out and would get snippy when he pointed out that it wasn't possible (pipes in the way, too close to the furnace to run properly, etc).

I put a lot of thought into the options and consequences. And as a result, I'm confident in my results.\n\nAfter this discussion, even if you have different opinions or choose a different option than I recommended, you'll at least be informed of the high quality of my work.

        "selftext": "So I had some \"attendence\" issues at an old job. Not really, the policy was that within five minutes of the shift is still considered on time. Well I had a manager who wanted to abruptly change corporate policy and define clearly that late = late.\n\nSo background, it's retail and I'm in my senior year of college. I'm not making a career out of this job, and I'm five years older than all of my coworkers. My immediate manager felt threatened by me, as I had previously declined leadership positions to finish school. He always had something he needed to \"fix\" about me even though I had seven straight months of \"Rockstar\" performance (exceeding metrics by +10% above goal) and I frequently aided in training new employees. Once again, this was a college filler not a career move for me.\n\nI'm not a bad employee. However, I was a busy employee. My last semester working there I had five classes, and would be usually within a minute or two to my shift.\n\nSo manager one day specifies I'm late (it's 3:01 and my shift starts at 3:00) to which I said \"marginally\". He, in front of other coworkers decides he's gonna put his foot down. \"no, combustablegeoduck one minute late is late\". So I stopped my task and calmly asked him, \"then what does it mean when I'm staying 45 minutes after my shift to help when we're short staffed?\". And he said, \"we don't even want to have this conversation right now\", and left. \n\nTo be fair he's not wrong-- he handled the situation wrong. If he wanted me to change something we could have talked in private, he wanted to swing dicks in front of the new hires. \n\nSo I complied. I made it a point to clock in and out exactly when my shift starts and ends. It's glorious. A couple weeks later he tells me I need to do something two minutes before my shift ends. So I start the task, and two minutes later I said, \"sorry manager, my shift is over!\" clocked out and left.\n\nMy mindset is go ahead, try to fire the best looking employee on paper for working exactly his shift and not a second longer. \n\nHe didn't want to swing dicks after that.\n\nTl;Dr A minute late is late, and I don't get paid overtime to work after my shift, so if your operation is so concrete that we need to be accurate to one minute of the schedule, you don't need me when I'm done.\n\nEdit: someone wanted a tldr",

            "My favorite is when I had a job where being more than 5 minuets late carried the same penalty as calling off completely.  \n\nGet stuck in traffic ?  Oops cant make it in at all. Enjoy.",
            "I had a similar scenario in an old job: the MD/CEO decided that he was fed up of people arriving a few minutes late even though almost everyone there would \"average\" being about 5 minutes early (5 minutes late one day, 10 minutes early the next).\n\nOn top of that \"Averaging about 5 minutes early\" (which nets the boss nearly 30 minutes per week of extra time per employee), the entire company was salaried and almost nobody went home on time, nor did people often take their full lunch hour unless they had an errand to run.\n\nSimilarly to your scenario, the boss started making a big fuss about anyone arriving late. Unfortunately for him, the most popular person in the company was having a bit of a rough time and so was late a few times in the first week, and thus got singled out.\n\nFor nearly a month, every single employee would arrive at their normal time and stand outside the front door chatting until 08:59:50, then walk in and sit down. Every single employee would stand up at either 12:00/13:00 (we had staggered lunches, to ensure cover) and walk out for lunch, then walk back in at 12/13:59:50. And every single person would stand up at 17:30 and go home.\n\nNobody said a word, nobody made a fuss, everyone just followed the clock perfectly.\n\nAfter 3-4 weeks, the boss announced a new flexible working policy allowing staff to work 30 minutes around scheduled start/finish times without permission, as long as they made up the difference within the same day (eg no leaving early unless you started early, if you arrive late stay late)",
            "This is so cathartically relatable to me.   I have a research job where for some reason my company has us all pick a specific 8.5 hour window to work during.  But our job does not have any reason, apart from meetings, where it matters at all what time we put in the work.\n\nUp until recently, I had been routinely staying anywhere from 30 to 60 to sometimes 90 or more minutes late just to get things finished when I was on a roll.  Didn't strictly have to, but I like my job well enough and sometimes when I was in the middle of stuff I just wanted to keep rolling.  Because I'm contracted to work 40 hours per week and I always go way over that, I tend to not sweat it about being 10-15 minutes late for my start time, and nobody has ever cared.\n\nWell, anyways, a few weeks ago, my manager sent out a very rude email to a few of us saying that she knows we have not been following our scheduled working hours, and that we need to start doing so immediately.\n\nAt first, I was super angry.  I was like, \"Okay, it's fair to want us to be on time for this arbitrary meaningless start time if you want to, but can we at least acknowledge that most or all of us way more than account for this lost time by staying late?\"  I considered sending a polite message back pointing this out to her that we're working more than our contracted hours, and the fact that this was a hard requirement had never before been made clear to us.\n\nBut then it hit me.   Her email said to \"follow our scheduled working hours\".  So, every day since this happened, I've simply arrived right on time or a few minutes early, and then left at my ending time, TO THE MINUTE, regardless of what I was in the middle of.  A couple of other people are doing the same.  It's fantastic, and I get such savage pleasure in the fact that my manager's own unnecessary pettiness has cost her hours upon hours of productivity every week.",

Sometimes I\u2019d even let it slide if the OT was less than 15 min. But once he started complaining about the few times I walked in 1-2 min late, you better believe I clocked in and out for exactly what I worked and made him justify my OT to his boss.",

Then told me to write down the exact time I leave as we were paid by the minute. So I did 6:05 6:09 6:07 (I'm making up the times as was shift work but you get the point) after a couple of weeks of this he came to me and said you can just round it off.",

            "My previous job was like this. The last three months I was there they had decided that the 5 minute grace period policy was unnecessary and held all the non-management employees accountable for the new policy change for the previous year. Even went as far as printing out everyones time sheets and highlighting any \"late days\" during a company wide meeting. This was one of their many mistakes and they had to hire a completely new staff before the end of the year.",
            "Boss tried to tell us that we needed to be on the job site 5 minutes early, but couldn't write those 5 minutes on our time sheet. \"So you want us here 5 minutes early, but we're not going to be paid for those 5 minutes?\" \"Yes, you need to be ready to work *at the start of your shift*\" \"that's illegal, I'll be calling the labor board on Monday to report wage theft if you try to implement this system\". Never saw a manager stutter, turn purple from holding back her rage, and backpedal so fast... she would have effectively stolen (from my shift) 20 minutes/ week per staff, and we had 12 staff so... 4 hours of time? Yeah. She ended up getting demoted for other things later on. She also gave me my only bad evaluation ever because she would bark orders at people and I told her \"do not bark orders at me like I'm a dog that pooped on the carpet in your house, because I'm not and you don't pay me enough to treat me that way\" so my evaluation said I had a \"poor attitude toward authority\".",
            "Love your username, btw.\n\nThis reminds me of a story I've told here before. I was the transportation manager at a previous job. Like all managers there (and most other places I've worked), I stayed pretty busy and took breaks when I could instead of at scheduled times like the lower level employees did. This usually amounted to me skipping lunch or eating at my desk, and taking maybe a half dozen 3-minute working smoke breaks during a 10-12 hour day. During these breaks I was usually talking on the phone with customers or other employees, or working with other employees in person.\n\nApparently someone complained to the GM that I took too many smoke breaks, and he informed me that, despite the fact that other managers didn't have break schedules (even managers of lower rank than me), I was now to follow the break schedule of the warehouse. (I didn't even work in the warehouse.)\n\nSo my maybe 15 minutes of working breaks per day turned into a one hour lunch break and 30-45 minutes of 15 minute breaks where I completely shut down and refused to work.\n\nWithin a week enough people had complained about my lack of availability that I was asked to go back to my previous method of taking breaks.",
            "Had a boss who sent me a SMS like 3 minutes before I got there because I usually come sooner.\n\nFrom there, I strived to be \"on time\" both for clock in and clock out.\n\nThat's the most stupid thing an employer can do.\n\nIn my current work, I simply shift my clocking out accordingly. It's that simple!\n\nSometimes I need less than the 8 hours, sometimes more. I do accordingly too. Just trying to not overwork and being honest. (no hour teft)",

            "I'm regularly 5 - 20 minutes late for my shifts. I'm a backshift worker mostly and the roads are generally bloated with traffic when I leave for work, but if I leave earlier, I usually beat it and am far too early and get made to start immediately. It's regularly brought up that I'm always late, people like to huff and moan, but when asked about it, they don't really have a retort to the fact that I stay easily an average of 30 minutes extra at the end of each shift. \n\nTo the end that, when we recently got a new system for clocking in and out, an owed hours test was carried out. Most people earned between 4 and 40 quid based on their trends throughout the data collecting period. I earned over 300 in extra minutes here and there (in a single month) before the new system came in to play. Now we have a log and are supposed to be 1 minute early for shift... I'm owed many many hours according to this systems data. \n\nI'm in the same boat as OP, though. This is not a career place for me, though I'm often the top employee and help to train staff, having passed up promotions to focus on school. Only difference is, my manager understands the difference between regularly late and regularly works more than is paid even though it's slightly offset.",

            "I know how this feels. Used to have a 30 min commute to a job I had, with no traffic. Traffic in the area, however, was very unpredictable. \n\nOne day I show up about 10 mins late. Not a big deal, my schedule overlapped with a coworker so there was someone there either way. The next time I see my manager (worked at a park and she was only there one day of the week I was scheduled), she chews me out and threatens to fire me. A bit intense for a first time offense, but okay it wont happen again. I made sure I started leaving with time to spare and got there a bit early from then on out.\n\nOne day, I get in about 20 mins early and decide to go ahead and clock in and get to work. I figured, \"sure I'm early, a bit, but I'm working so what's it matter?\" Well, manager lost her shit at this, changed my time card so that I clocked in at the start of my shift and not early, and threatened to fire me if I did it again because I wasn't \"allowed to clock inearlier than what she scheduled me for.\" She made sure to mention I was more than welcome to get to work early, I just cant get paid for it. \n\nThis was not my only job. By this point, I was regularly working 55 hrs at my other job and scheduled between 20 and 30 there weekly. No way in hell was I working without pay if I'm already at 70 hour weeks. The next time I got there that early, I walked in to the office (it was winter at this point) and sat my ass down in a chair to enjoy the heat. Manager happened to be there that day, and asked me to get to work. Informed her I wasnt on the clock, and since it was too early for me to clock in, I would be enjoying the heat as opposed to freezing my ass off for no pay.\n\nI quit shortly thereafter. It was a mix of this and her scheduling me at days/times that we had agreed upon at the time of my hire that I could not work (I was at my other more important job at those times.) It would be one thing if she had just fixed the schedule the 4 or 5 times she did it, but instead she told me that it was my problem and if **I** didnt find someone to cover then I would be in trouble.

One day, a group of us went to a restuarant for lunch, we didn't invite the manager but he and another group ended up at that same restaurant. My group left before his did and were back to the office working before he and his group got back. We got an email that we were late from lunch and we owed him 15 minutes from our comp or vacation time. When we pointed out that the email wasn't including his group who were later, he claimed he would send them a separate email. We all opted to just stay 15 minutes later.\n\nShortly after that he had a staff meeting that said if we were even 2 minutes late, we owed him 15 minutes of our comp/vacation. I told him then if I worked 2 minutes past my time then I was putting down on my time sheet that I worked 15 minutes of comp time.

Some approved but, well, we don\u2019t win every time and although that\u2019s frustrating, we have powerful reports after to show what didn\u2019t work and why and point that hey, we have to try a different approach next time. \n\nI hope you get a better boss on your next job and actually learn from them.

            "Reminds me of something I pulled at age 16. It was my 16th birthday, and we were going to go to Chapters/Indigo after lunch. I had been saving up to buy the rest of a book series I loved. Mom promised to buy me something there for my birthday as well. When we got in I knew exactly what I was going to ask for, I wanted the His Dark Materials trilogy. When we got in I asked her and she told me that I could pick 1 Thing. I saw the books I wanted on a table and grabbed all 3. I ran back to my mother, and she looked at me and said: \"I see three things there! I said only 1 Thing!\" I was upset, but I ran back to the table to put the books back. I held the first book (The Golden Compass) in my hands and was doing mental math to figure out if I could afford to buy the other two books (The Subtle Knife, and The Amber Spyglass) and I knew that there was no way that I could. I needed to get Mom to buy all 3 books, but how? That's the moment it hit me, BOX SET!!! \n\nSo, I put the book down and ran over to another table, where I spotted many box sets. I grabbed the Hardcover trilogy box set, but when I saw that the price was $59.99 I damn well knew that that was pushing it way too far! So, instead I grabbed the Paperback trilogy box set, which was only $29.99 \nI ran back to my mother, and I held it up and asked if she could get it. THE LOOK ON HER FACE!!!! So I smiled my most evil grin, and said, \"Mommy, you said 1 THING a Box Set IS 1 THING\" \n\nShe looked at me and yelled: \"YOU LITTLE SHIT!!!! THAT WAS SNEAKY!!! BUT IT WAS SMART SNEAKY SO I'M GOING TO REWARD IT!!! NOW PUT THAT FUCKING THING IN THE CART! YOU LITTTLE SHIT!!!!\"\n\nI was laughing my ass off!!!! It sounds horrible if you read it, but in my house growing up being called a little shit was a good thing. Mom only called us little shits when we out smarted her on something, so if she called any of us a little shit we would run away laughing! \n\nI shit you not, she was SO MAD!!! I could hear her yelling: \"THAT LITTLE SHIT!!! I SAID ONE THING AND SHE BRINGS ME A BOX SET! THAT LITTLE SHIT EXPLOITING MY EXACT WORDING!!! THAT LITTLE SHIT!!!! All through the store. I was laughing my ass off the entire time. (Thank goodness smart phones weren't a common thing yet or else someone would have put that on YouTube LOL) \n\nShe was still grumbling during the entire ride home. And as soon as we got home, she picked up the phone, called my Aunty Lori, and yelled into the phone: YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE WHAT THAT LITTLE SHIT DID TO ME!!!\" I lost it laughing all over again, and I could hear my Aunt laughing her ass off on the phone.

Essentially we go to their town and service important equipment to make sure everything is running smoothly and things meet regulations. The department I work in is to call and email the heads of departments to have them renew their agreement so we can keep coming to service the equipment.\n\nWe send a lot of reminders because some places it takes a while to get things approved and people tend to forget about the agreement. Recently I had a gentleman, we can call him Bill, respond to one of my emails saying he doesn't need a reminder unless the contract expires. Okay easy enough, well two days after the contract expires, I send Bill an email. He is very frustrated and says he asked me not to email him unless it expired. I tell him it expires two days earlier. \n\nWe email back and forth for a bit and it becomes clear he cannot find what he did with the contract. So I ask him if he would like me to send it to him again, he responds \"send it to someone who cares.\" Okay, so I call the main line of the municipality and find out who is above Bill when it comes to decision making. They give me the email and I send it off. I get an email back very quickly asking why Bill hadn't handled this. I respond explaining I've contacted Bill a few times and he said he would handle it but then it never got taken care of. He then asks me to forward my email chain with Bill over to him so he can take a look at it. I was so excited he asked for this. \n\nAbout ten minutes later I get a phone call from a very upset Bill. Asking me why I would contact his boss and now he is in a bunch of trouble. I responded \"Bill, it was not my intention to get you in trouble but I did what you asked. I sent the contract to someone that cares.\" \n\nI don't take a lot of pleasure in getting someone in trouble at work but I did what he asked so it really isn't my fault, right?\n\nEdit: okay before I get more comments about it. I have explained a few different times in the comments that my last statement isn't totally accurate. At the time I didn't feel 100% great about having to go to someone above Bill but as the day progressed I got more and more pleasure out of it.  Bill was preventing me from getting my job done. Bill was risking the safety of other people by not taking care of this. Bill got what he deserved and I'm glad that I could be a part of that.

I had sent seven boxes to the company but received a quote for eight boxes instead, and the surplus they charged on it was quite a lot. I wrote to them asking why there's this extra box and they never replied to me to say that they'd look into it or to cancel the charges for the eighth box that didn't exist. I called them every week and the line was bogged up every time, and emailed them near every day because the situation was just so stressful. They kept saying the extra charge was because I stored an extra box and they can't do anything about it, despite me being explicitly clear in all my correspondence that there was no 8th box. \nNow that they've asked for confirmation that I received all my boxes, I said that after two months, I still haven't received the final box. I got my delivery charges refunded as a goodwill gesture (not that I would go back to them ever) but the satisfaction now lies in the idea they are tramping around the warehouse trying to find a box that doesn't exist. If they still haven't found the non existent box by Month 3 I might just as well demand reimbursement for no loss on my part (aside from the extreme annoyance I suffered throughout this unpleasant ordeal).\n\nEdit: I'm so happy that there are people who can find catharsis in unfortunate situations like this!

Or say nice things about them. \n\nExcept for one guy who worked at the location where my boxes were; well, the location they were connected because they put my boxes into long-term storage without telling me and when I wanted to come in and unload them, they couldn\u2019t find them, then they misplaced them, then when they were supposedly at the location and I came with movers for my stuff \u2026 the wrong boxes were waiting in the unloading area,and they had to go back into the warehouse and search. The one guy who was helpful had been at the location when the worst of the mess was going on, but had left and a year turned. He remembered me and was speechless that it was still happening. He took charge and figured out where my boxes were, found the right boxes for the movers, etc. (Two people with my last name were picking up their stuff the same day, but it never occurred to anyone to notice that two customers wanting two boxes each meant four boxes.)",

        "selftext": "When I was in high-school, I had the typical minimum wage cashier's job. It was store policy to ask for a legal government ID when a customer purchased cigarettes or alcohol. We had to ID every customer who looked like they could be under 35. If you didn't, and they turned out to be under age, you could be fired (if caught in an in-store quality check) or arrested (if caught by a regulatory agency). There was no way in hell 16 year old me was going to risk getting fired or arrested for a shitty minimum wage job, so I ID'd EVERYBODY.\n\nNow 99% of the time, the person reacted amicably, handed over their ID, and went on their way. But on occasion, I would end up with some Karen or Chad who had left their ID in the car and wanted me to proceed without the ID check.\n\nOne particularly Kareny Karen (who looked to be in her late 40s) would come in to buy cigarettes, and never had ID. So I refused to sell her cigarettes, she'd pitch a fit, and storm out.\n\nAfter doing this three or four times, I guess she had enough and bitched to my manager. I had to go on a break at this point, so didn't have a chance to actually look at her ID that time either.\n\nThe following week, Karen returned and once again tried to buy her cigarettes without ID. As usual, I requested a DR License, and the usual circus ensued.\n\nManager asked me afterwards why I still asked for an ID after he had completed her purchase himself the last time. I pointed out that I had yet to actually see the ID myself. Therefore, as per company policy, I couldn't assume that he had done his job and confirmed her ID. I had to keep asking until I confirmed her age myself.\n\nShe continued to come to the store and throw the same tantrum for a few more months before I moved away. I never saw her ID, and I refused to sell her cigarettes for a solid 6 months (I think?)\n\nEdit, wow thanks for the awards and comments everyone!\n\nAlso, for those of you concerned that this lady didn't have / couldn't afford ID, she was driving a brand new BMW Z3? finances were not at issue.",

She then told me off for not IDing her for cigarettes, so I asked her for ID. She left it in her car so she went to get it. Turns out she was 20. I was 21 at the time and I was so shocked she was that young. \n\n\nMoral of the story; if people don't ID you for stuff when you're around that ambiguous age, you should probably quit smoking.\n\nETA: this was in the UK, where you only have to be 18 years old to buy alcohol/cigarettes atm.",

They seemed a bit upset, but handed over their cards regardless. Well, they were so pissed that I asked, they went up to the hostess stand (which was inside- so they had to go out of their way for this), and demanded to speak with a manager. And since this was a chain restaurant, the visiting quality manager Went With The General Manager!! to their table so to hear their complaints. \n\nSince neither could displine me for following the law, because technically I didn't do anything wrong, the GM just verbally reprimanded me later. \"Just visually judge next time.\" Yeah, and get fired for thinking a 20 year old is really 40? Pass. \n\n\nNever got people who found any and every reason to complain. You're ordering a beer, buying cigarettes, or otherwise wishing to purchase something that requires ID.

Since this was back when you could still chalk a NY ID to change the birthdate,  we lost a ton of cigarette sales because we told them that we can't accept an altered ID.  Of course, we also jacked up the prices ($9, back when it was still $6 or so a pack anywhere else), and people still got pissed, mainly because they had to walk to the gas station across the street.\n\nStill came back to bite me though, when I turned 21.  My birthday is in November, and my new ID was sent home, so I just figured I'd pick it up when I went home for Thanksgiving.  At that time, NY ID's looked the same for everyone, they just had \"Under 21\" on them if you were underage. Couple days after my birthday, I stopped at a gas station to pick up a 6-pack, and this was the conversation:\n\nCashier- No sale. ID says under 21.\n\nMe- Is this a valid ID?\n\nCashier- Yep.\n\nMe- Has it been altered in any way?\n\nCashier- Nope.\n\nMe- Does the birthdate show that I'm over 21?\n\nCashier- Sure does.\n\nMe- So, can I buy this beer?\n\nCashier- Nope.\n\nMe- Why?\n\nCashier- ID says Under 21.\n\nTechnically right, but still a little payback for denying all those college kids their Marlboros though.

I even tried simplifying it by saying \"this is like arguing with the washing machine, do you really expect it to see things from your point of view?\" but still nothing, he seemed to think this machine should know exactly what age he was when he walked up to it and that it's entirely the store's fault that it didn't.",

So I did.\n\nI copied the passwords into a Google Doc on my phone, changed the font to lobster bold italic, and took screenshots of them (so they couldn't copy and paste), then emailed them to the owners.\n\nNot all of them were 100 characters, but I had to give the passwords for PayPal, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.\n\nThey didn't ask me for the WiFi password as that was still set to the same as when I started, but I did change it along with the router password, and inside the shop is a 4g blackspot. \n\nEdit: to those asking if they could have just reset the passwords....the Google password was linked to what I think was the owner's old number.

        "selftext": "**EDIT 1:**  Thank you for the awards. I appreciate them all. \n\n**DISCLAIMER:**\n\nThe names and some of the situations have been changed to protect the identities, but the dollars and general nature of the situation is completely true.\n\n**BACKGROUND:**\n\nA year out of school in the early-1990's, I procured a job as a business analyst for a large, family-owned tech company. This business was located in the booming heart of technology at the time and was very profitable. As tech took off over the next decade, the company thrived and remained family-owned. What was a rich family and company became exceedingly wealthy with a valuation/net worth in the high 9/low 10-figures.\n\nThe family that owned it was quite neurotic, very moody and had a reputation as very ruthless (greedy) when it came to financing, deal-making, employees, etc. I truly believe this is what held them back from ultimately becoming a household name as a company.\n\nAs I progressed in the company, I gained more and more face time with the owners. I worked on some projects directly with ownership that really paid off and gained me even greater access to their inner circle. Now, like a lot of people at the time and particularly those who worked in tech, I was heavily invested in tech stocks. I discussed some of my investments and gains with ownership as casual conversation, though investing had nothing to do with my role in the company.\n\nThat is until one day in late-1999 when the owner came to me and asked me if I would invest some of his personal money. He wanted me to take big risks to see if they would pay off using 1 million dollars of his personal money. I was a bit hesitant, but still being in my late-20's and wanting to prove myself, I said I would. I asked for a written agreement where they acknowledged this wasn't my role in the company, was a personal matter between the owner and me, and to document my compensation for this side arrangement (20% of all profits).\n\nAround this same time and by working in the industry I started to notice the weakness associated with a lot of tech companies. They just weren't living up to their hype and stock price and some seemed like they were starting to run out of money. I had no inside information, just a strong sense of which companies were struggling based on my work in the business.\n\nBased on this sense I started using both my money and the owners money to short tech companies just after the New Year in 2000. For anyone unfamiliar with shorting, it means if the value of a stock decreases, the value of the investment increases. I had a few long positions, but my overall position was very short.\n\nSince the owner wanted big risk and big reward, I used his money and obtained leverage or margin from the financial institution where I maintained both his and my trading accounts. The accounts were separate, but both under my name (again, I documented this and gained consent).\n\nWell, both my account and his suffered some moderate losses in the first two months of 2000 before the bubble began to burst and both accounts, but his in particular, began to skyrocket.\n\n**OWNERSHIP'S PETTINESS**\n\nIn June, the company began to suffer a downturn. We were still profitable, but since we provided tech services and products we were not immune to weakness in the broader market. I had not informed the owner of my short strategy. He came to me one day and asked how his money was doing, saying he suspected it was way down like the general market. To his surprise, I informed him that while we still had some money tied up in options (puts) and shorts, but based on the positions I had closed, there was $1.35 million in cash sitting in the account that belonged to him. Again, I still had a bunch of open positions which, if memory serves, were worth about a million on that date, but the positions I had closed had yielded $1.35 million in cash just sitting in his account (which was in my name).\n\nThe owner, either through ignorance or lack of attention, said \"Great, $1.35 million. Fantastic work in this down market. Will you please wire it to me?\" I responded that I would, but would be taking my 20% of the $350,000 profit, or $70,000, before wiring him the $280,000. I also reminded him I still had open positions that had yet to pay off or close, but I didn't state the amount. He, once again, appeared not to understand or comprehend the open positions statement, but instead totally focused on and became incensed about my rightful claim for $70,000. He went on and on about how times were tough, I should be grateful for a job, particularly at my young age, and the entire $350,000 was necessary for him and the company. I knew this wasn't true based on my position within the company. Worse, this was my first time personally experiencing the greedy and corrupt nature that served as the basis for ownership's reputation.\n\n**THE REVENGE**\n\nNow comes the revenge. Since, after two separate conversations, the owner didn't seem to grasp that the open positions would yield at least some income, and thus additional profit, I decided not to mention it again. I sent him back the entire $1.35 million and continued to manage the open positions to the best of my ability. And here's the kicker, the owner never brought it up again. He seemed to think the $1.35 million payment was the entire value of the account and never understood or remembered that open positions still existed. He never asked for records, tax documents or any time of audit or financials. Given the fact that he was dishonest with me, I didn't feel the need to disabuse him of that notion.\n\nUltimately, after a bit more net gain, I covered all of the shorts and exercised all of the options (puts in this case) for an additional $1.8 million. I worked for the company for 3 more years and owner never asked about it during my tenure, after I gave notice, or since. I know it's a bit crass and even shady af, but given his dishonesty with me over the $70,000, I felt justified in keeping the additional $1.8 million. I paid taxes on the gain (long term cap gain), and went on my way with a fantastic nest egg. Nobody has asked about it since and I have only told the story to a few people (and even then only after the statute of limitations passed).\n\nThe final ironic cherry on top of this sundae is that during my remaining 3 years I gained greater influence with ownership in position within the company because they considered me loyal for giving the $1.35 million back and not making too much of a stink about the $70,000 profit. Little did they know I got the better of them. The company eventually folded due to family disputes, but my understanding is that ownership walked away in very good financial position. They likely could have been a much better and greater company had they not practiced the same dishonesty that they showed me with their vendors, clients and employees.\n\nThanks for reading and hope you enjoyed.",

I'd been on antibiotics twice already that year, for pneumonia and a UTI, so despite knowing my allergies to both penicillin and sulfa were on my chart, I made sure to request ones I wasn't allergic to, you know, because duh.\n\nThey gave me sulfa antibiotics and I almost died. Two days later I'm back in the ER and get different antibiotics. I have good credit and would like to keep it that way, so paid off all my bills as soon as I received them. Drama with getting additional bills later to the point where I called and asked the registrant to go through my account to make sure I had paid everything, and if I hadn't, I would like to pay it over the phone. Cut to months later, when I get some very angry calls from a collections agency trying to collect on the bills I had already paid. It took a three-way phone call between the ER, the collections agency and me to figure it out, but we figured it out.\n\nCut to the past two weeks, where I have gotten 10 different emails asking me to review the ER. \n\nOne email, every business day, \"How Did We Do?\", \"Reminder: Give us Your feedback!\", \"Don't Forget to Review!\". \n\nSo I did, on Yelp, Facebook, and Google, just like they asked. \n\n\"This place almost killed me with antibiotics that my medical history clearly states I am allergic to.

So not only did they treat me like dirt for not looking presentable at urgent care when I got three hours of sleep and was dangerously dehydrated, but they also tried to get me to double pay the bill and steal an extra $800 from me.   \n\n\nI left them a Google review at this point, and a day later i got an email from the owner asking how he could \"make it right\" with me.

It had gotten to the point where I had to say that \"it hurts too much, I can't breath\" \n\nBy the time I was in the operating room (had apparently been very full) my appendix had completely ruptured; could have been the big bust of pain when I was in the hospital, could have been the huge burst of pain when I was in the bath earlier that day. Either way I was subjected to several hours of having a high risk of septicaemia. \n\nSeveral weeks later, original doctors and nurses had turned me over to others and I was deemed fit enough to leave. New doctor prescribes me penicillin and tells me I have to take it for 4 weeks. Chances are if I had accidentally actually taken it I would have died from my severe allergy towards it and otherall poor state.\n\nStill occasionally get severe pains where they operated whenever I'm stressed or anxious",

Told them how that was super shady and they got very defensive and pissed about that.   \nTurns out I did overpay a little and they had to send me a check to reimburse me so that felt great lol.

They listed other meds and I said she cant have codine or morphine for sure, I don't know the rest but her file was filled with all the info they needed. \n\nThey gave her something and in about 5 mins she was shaking, red splotches on her face and body and unable to breathe. \n\nI was maybe 18 and I laid into her Dr, He had given her morphine. I was so mad. I ended up sending in all sorts of emails and reviews as I'd never been more angry.  This was years ago so there wasn't the same options as now.

I wear a medicalert bracelet these days, after what happened. \n\nI had to go to the ER after some laparoscopic complications. I told them I couldn't have opiates through gritted teeth during admission, I was in absolute pure agony. I kept passing out and they kept giving me morphine and Oxycodone while I screamed in agony between bouts of unconsciousness. \nThey finally gave me ketamine and I was just paralysed but still in pain. I think they did that just to stop listening to me scream. \n\nThree days of that horror. \n\nThey finally treated the actual issue I went there for after they got the opiates out of my system and then sent me home.

I just want to clarify, did you almost died because you took the antibiotics which you knew you were allergic to or because you did not fill those antibiotics?  \n\nIn any event I am sorry that you were prescribed an antibiotic which you were allergic to, and this is certainly something ERs are continually trying to prevent, and it can be difficult in what can be a very chaotic environment sometimes it gets busy and provider can be seeing i dunno 10-12 patients at the same time; none of this is a justifiable excuse though.  Next time please point this out to the nurse or provider before leaving the ER, and so we aren't going to be mad if you point out an error, and everyone in the ER is human so we do make mistakes.\n\nIn regards to the billing.  Unless you are in a very odd system the providers, nurses, and staff in the ER have nothing to do with that.  It has benefits and it has downsides.  I don't have to worry about cost in the ER cause I really have to know nothing about that and so regardless of your ability to pay I will provide the same quality of care to you.  The downside is what if for something that might be more medicolegal than medical I might want to get testing or provide treatment that will incur significant expenses to patients and I cannot provide adequate answers to these questions.\n\nLastly to the survey.  Sorry again.  Staff have nothing to do with this, and is actually at the behest of your wonderful government and CMS and hospital administrators who have no medical training and do nothing but suck up resources because without it they would look like they do nothing instead of looking busy while doing nothing.  It affects the payscale of the hospital for medicare and medicaid reimbursement, before long it will be used in private pay. again, staff and providers have nothing to do with this.",

Most anti nausea meds are anti psychotics that they found helped nausea. For these class of meds a side effect that can happen is Akathisia. Its described as one of the worst feelings in the world. For me it feels like my skin is trying to remove itself from my body, extreme dread/anxiety (not just an anxiety attack Im talking the level of dread of death), physically unable to sit still, shuffling or rocking back and forth and the imminent need to get the fuck out of the hospital. Ive literally had to hold my own hand down from ripping the IV catheter out and running out of the hospital. I was promised that if I started to feel this side effect they would try to mitigate it right away but I was left in a small room for two hours while I was just begging for them to help. I cant even describe this feeling right but if someone offered to shoot me in the head, I probably would have said yes.",
