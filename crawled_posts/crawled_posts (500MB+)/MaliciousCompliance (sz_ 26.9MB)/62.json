I didn\u2019t call ahead as I didn\u2019t see much point as I lived so close and I didn\u2019t mind the extra couple of minutes. \n\nWhile there I saw the were doing a special offer. 10% discount if you mentioned their promotion over the phone and then went in to collect take away. \n\n\u201cI know I haven\u2019t called in first, but now I know you do a discount if you do, and to save us both the hassle of me calling you right now and for the fact I know the promotion exists,  can I still get the 10% off anyway?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. It\u2019s for telephone orders only\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, I get that, but I could literally just call you right now from my mobile and you\u2019d give me the discount but that\u2019ll be a bit weird to make me do that, so can I just get it anyway?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. It\u2019s for telephone orders only\u201d\n\nThis jobsworth attitude pissed me off, so I was literally about to just forget about buying anything from there and go somewhere else, but as I got outside I figured that no, I\u2019d just stand outside and call the number on their door and order a pizza that way to get my discount. \n\nThe phone rang and the same guy picked it up:\n\n\u201cCan I order a pizza to collect with 10% discount please\u201d\n\nHe recognises my voice obviously as it\u2019s just been 15 seconds since we were speaking inside. He looks outside at me. I smile and wave. He looks pissed off that he has give me my discount now. \n\nHe takes my order and says it will be 10 mins. \n\nDuring the next 10 mins while waiting for my discounted pizza, someone else is about to come in the restaurant to order a take out. I ask them if they have phoned ahead for the discount or not. They didn\u2019t realise that\u2019s was a thing. No problem buddy, I\u2019ll do it for you. What do you want?\n\nI call the same number again, same guy answers and hears my voice again and looks straight at me again. \n\nI smile and wave again and proceed to order this random strangers pizza order for them whilst maintaining eye contact with him. \n\n\u201cMy friend would also like the 10% telephone discount\u201d. \n\nHe looks like he\u2019s gonna pop a blood vessel but has no choice but to accept it. After all, I didn\u2019t enforce the rules, he did. \n\nA week later, the telephone order discount is cancelled completely and it\u2019s simply given if you have a menu, and there are menus in the entrance anyway, so you\u2019d be crazy not to see it and use it.\n\nEdit: Well that blew up! Answering a few of the main questions here: \n\nThis happened a while ago, so the promotion wasn\u2019t to do with google ads, or tracking info or storing numbers etc. It was just a badly executed promo that forced you to call to the very person stood in front of you already taking your order anyway if you wanted the discount. \n\nNo, not been waiting 15 years to tell this story like I\u2019m some sort of legend and my life peaked at that moment, I read something else on Reddit yesterday and I was like \u201coh yeah, I remember something like that happening to me and I\u2019ve never posted in MC before, so why not share?\u201d\n\nThe guy behind the counter wasn\u2019t a kid with management breathing down his neck. He may have even been the owner or manager for all I know. It was a small place and not a chain, and if it wasn\u2019t just him there doing everything, then it was only him and the chef. So making me call him on the phone in front of him was him enforcing the stupid rule, I just complied with it. \n\nI agree, I risked a spat on pizza. I don\u2019t suggest pissing off people who make your food. It was not something I was thinking of at the time though. \n\nI\u2019ve also tweaked some text above for clarity as reasons why for not calling in first (lived super local and I\u2019d only ever walked in, never called it before) and realise now that I didn\u2019t know about the promo until there. That\u2019s why I then asked about it. Thank you.",

            "I went to a tourist attraction and while queueing I saw someone with a printed out 40% off voucher. I pulled up the website it was from and had the voucher showing on my phone when I got to the counter but they wouldn't accept that it \"must be printed\".\n\nSo I sent my companions into the nearest cafe to have a drink while I popped into a nearby posh hotel, explained my problem to the guy behind the desk and asked him if he'd print it for me. He gave me the hotel email address, I emailed it, he printed it with an MC-appreciating smile, then 15 minutes later we all turned up back at the attraction with printed voucher in hand. Saved us about \u00a350...",
            "When mobile phones were just introduced, I once went to get some food from the Chinese-Indonesian restaurant in our village. The line for ordering was extremely long, yet the lady behind the counter continuously picked up the phone and took orders from there. So I took out my super-modern mobile phone and called them while standing in line and ordered by phone while waiting in the ordering line. My food was ready before I'd have been able to order normally.",

They were \"one per visit\", so we pulled up to the drive thru and said, \"Listen, we're here to get 25 free tacos.  We can drive around this building 25 times, or you can just give us the 25 tacos now.\" Manager gets involved, says we can have the 25 tacos as long as we actually buy something.  Each of us gets a drink and we drive off with 25 tacos for like $5 worth of soda.\n\nI was a little sad we didn't have to drive around the building 25 times.",

I remember seeing the total price somewhere around $50 but when I get there, the total was $75. The desk guy said their in store prices sometimes differ from the website. I pulled up the website, showed him the price, and asked for a price match. Nope, he refused. \n\nI stepped outside, called the website order number, and placed my $50 order for local pickup. Waited for the email confirmation to come in and headed back into the store. Showed it to the same guy and he literally groaned haha.

            "I worked as a delivery driver for pizza hut. They had just trained and promoted a cook to store manager, at the time pizza hut was running the large pizza up to 3 toppings for 10 dollar promotion on television. He took a phone order. Two large pizzas. Since the lady didn't ask for a discount, he was taught to charge full price unless the customer asks for the promotion. So obviously their was a disconnected between the person who ordered the pizzas on the phone and the recipient of the pizza. It was a cash order. So I get to the house and it's like eight Mexican workers literally pouring concrete at a house for their driveway and porch. The total price for those pizzas? 40 dollars. I felt kind of bad making that delivery cuz the foreman on the job site looked equally surprised by the total. Before then I had been trained by one of the other drivers that had been at the store for the longest time. He would always apply every single discount he could in an effort to increase his tip. Apparently we weren't supposed to do that.",
            "im sorry, but as someone who has worked in fast food and for minimum wage or similar, i just cant get behind you on this one. most of the time, us at the front counter are on specific instructions about certain promotions and can be punished if we deviate. if a customer came in all entitled as if they were exempt from the rules that are stated so clearly, their excuse being that they live close by, i wouldnt be too happy either. i hope you see this and realize im not trying to belittle or disrespect you, but i think that this is not the feat you seem the think it is. he's just doing his job",

If it took 10 minutes for the food to be ready, you wouldn't have taken 15 minutes to pick up your food. You would have taken 10. And gotten a discount.\n\nAnd then expected a discount and told them \"both the hassle\" - dude, it was only you hassling at this point.\n\nI used to live a block from a pizzeria and ordered subs there all the time. Still called ahead. They could be busy and there would be a longer wait, could end up closed, would be quicker for me to pick up than wait for it. And especially for a promotion.\n\nAnd then you're going to say this dude, possibly just an hourly worker, is \"gonna pop a blood vessel\"?  Get out of here. Bogus. He wouldn't care. And if they ran this promotion, they obviously want to get people to use it. Don't know why they wouldn't tell people.\n\nYou were just a jerk in this case. You could have called, didn't, and wanted the discount for calling. \"Oh, I saw a coupon in the Clippers magazine, but didn't want to cut it out so just give it to me? Let's just save the hassle and give me the discount.\" Yeah, that will work.",

I also had to print her grocery coupons for some reason. I printed her email and the response from her boss that I got after he read it.

I said dont worry just have em hold it and i would pick it up myslef as i needed it sooner and would save them the trip. I show up and ask for the part. The total was $20 more. They tell me that that is the price difference from this location and to get the lower price I need to buy it from the other Auto Zone. They are the same company. Sure maybe different franchise owner but cmon. I tell them that Im saving them time and money by not having to drive the part to the other location. Guy was weelllll we will just say..... not smart. Get the manager over and tell him i still want the part but either he can pay an employee time and gas to take it to the other location or just simply give it to me for the price that another Auto Zone just a few miles away would.

Just some bat-shit crazy parents. \n\nI used to work as a checker/stocker at a grocery store. Our store manager (Mike) was a d-bag, and would always try to screw people. There was massive turnover at this store.\n\nSo one day, I get called into his office and asked why I gave overtime on my time card. I was usually scheduled for 1-10pm (hour lunch), but the store didn't close until 10, so I had to count out my drawer afterwards.\n\nI explained this to Mike and he didn't care. He went off saying that I should be doing this earlier, and that I was to leave at 10 on the dot so that I had NO OVERTIME.\n\nGot it, boss man.\n\nA couple of weeks later it was Thanksgiving time. We had extra checkers, but from 8-10pm, I was the only one besides the manager who closed the store that day (Mike).\n\nI made the announcement at about 9.40 that we would be closing in 20 minutes, and to please finish up your purchases to check out.\n\nPeople started coming up to check out, and their carts were LOADED since it was almost Thanksgiving.\n\nI go about checking them all out, but then the clock turns to 10:00.\n\nI stop in the middle of my transaction. Call Mike on the store phone and tell him I'm leaving since I can't have overtime. Walk over and clock out.\n\nThere are still 6 to 7 customers with full baskets in line at this time.\n\nMike comes over and is yelling at me as I'm walking out. But I remind him that he specifically told me that I can't have ANY overtime.\n\nWhen I got into work the next day, I was written up. But it was worth it. Apparently he spent the next 30-45 minutes checking people out.\n\nTL;DR: I did what my boss told me to. He got stuck checking people out by himself for 45 minutes after the store closed. ",

I was bitched at for going over 40 hours a couple weeks in a row, so I said fuck it.  Since he wanted to work me late every day, I just went home 2 hours early every Friday.

            "I had a similar experience. I was closing shop alone and the boss wanted me to count the drawer, clean, and finish jobs all while checking customers out. On slow days, this could be done, but counting the drawer was impossible and too risky.  \n\n\nSo, after hearing the complaint once too often, I told him that I'll start clocking out on time, but I won't be able to close out the register. He agreed and said he'd do it in the morning (he had the open shift and I closed).  \n\n\nA week later and I've got overtime approved and they tell me to make sure the doors are locked when I count the register.  \n\nTurns out the morning customers were eyeing the cash as he counted it was making him nervous.

Got to a point where we were all run down and a week wouldn't pass without someone getting sick which escalated everything for the rest of the team. When they eventually budged on it, nobody gave enough fucks to want to work overtime.\n\nOne time my manager and I got into a fight over a crazy thing she said or asked us to do.

Well, I arrived 45 minutes after my assigned time one too many times and my boss tells me I *need* to arrive at my officially assigned time. I tell him okay and proceed to do it.\n\nWhat follows was a week where without fail I'd get 30 minutes of overtime each day. My boss's bosses were NOT happy about that and my boss called me in to relent and said I could start coming in 30 minutes after my assigned time. He hasn't said a peep about me being late ever since. I guess he figures me missing 15 minutes is a hell of a lot cheaper than me going over by 30 minutes.",

        "selftext": "I work(ed) as a housekeeper at a small local hotel. At the beginning when I started (about three years ago), things were pretty peachy. I got above minimum wage and worked in an environment with a more relaxed working pace. We had more time than your average hotel to clean rooms and it showed in customer satisfaction. We had stellar reviews with customers raving about how there wasn't a speck of dust anywhere, how everything from the lamp shades to the bathroom drain was always scrubbed squeaky clean.\n\nI loved my job and took pride in it, and when we had extra time, (which happened from time to time,) we would do some deeper cleaning like scrubbing all the walls inch by inch, disinfecting the whole bathroom, cleaning the blinds etc. Even though we all had some extra time, we used it to make sure the rooms were always up to a very high standard.\n\nAs a result of this, we got a reputation of being an affordable but very clean hotel, so our popularity spiked. Even before we got so popular (in our prime we were booked full about 90&#37; of the days) our boss made a pretty nice amount of money. We don't have a reception, we're self-service (you just get a passcode for your room via text message) so he saved money with that. He drives an expensive car and seems very well off. We were never struggling financially.\n\nThen things started changing. We're a very close-knitted team of cleaners who have been in the house for years. A couple of us left at the end of last year (one moved to another state, another became a housewife after having a kid), and we started expecting newcomers to our team. They never came. Our boss claimed that it's hard to find workers for this kind of job. We never had anyone interviewed and I never saw ads anywhere that we're hiring, so I'm not sure he was even planning on replacing them. So our work pace got tighter. We managed somehow but there was no longer time for thorough cleaning.\n\nThen, the boss opened a restaurant so that the guests could have breakfast. Cleaning it daily got added to our workload (and that place is massive, it takes at least 1\u00bd hours to clean daily). At the same time, he also opened a separate airbnb-style apartment (three bedrooms, kitchen, living room and bathroom) for larger groups who wanted to reside together. Cleaning that fell on us as well.\n\nSo suddenly, we were down two people (there were seven of us initially) and shoved two massive new responsibilities. We asked our boss again to hire more people, but he said no and that \"we've been having it too easy\" beforehand. He also refused to add another hour or two to our daily working hours (currently 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.). We have six hours and everything needs to be done at 3 p.m. sharp because that's when the new passcodes start working.\n\nUnderstandably, we were stressed out. There was suddenly far too much to do and our boss also simultaneously expected that we would keep up our usual cleaning standard. But when our time per room plummets from 45 min to 25 min tops (usually closer to 15), obviously we're not able to clean everything the way we did before. We would get yelled at when we got bad feedback because there wasn't enough time to clean thoroughly enough, customers who came in after our clean rooms were disappointed and took their business elsewhere. Also, my coworkers started calling in sick because they were burnt out. It was a mess, but our boss maintained the outlook that if he just pushed a massive amount of work on us, we'd somehow magically find an extra pair of hands and get everything done 100&#37;.\n\nLast week, we had a meeting with my coworkers. We discussed the current situation and to my surprise, everyone was considering quitting. Out of loyalty to our long-time employer, the five of us agreed to have a meeting with our boss and try to persuade him to hire more staff to bring the hotel back to its earlier standard. A couple of days later, we had the said meeting. Our boss was still in denial and said that we just need to up our pace and do things faster. He cited that most hotels give housekeepers about 20 minutes to do everything. We pointed out that it's true, but in that case he can't expect us to clean better than those hotels. He scoffed and told us \"If you don't like working here, then leave.\"\n\nThat was all we needed to hear. That night we had another meeting amongst us cleaners. We checked our contracts and realized there was no agreed on notice for resignation as we're at-will. So, we were all going to take his advice.\n\nThis morning, at 9 a.m. sharp, the five of us paid our boss a visit. The look on his face when we simultaneously slammed down our resignation letters and marched out, leaving no one to clean the whole hotel today, will warm my heart for the rest of my days. He was absolutely stunned.\n\nHe tried to call us to talk things over. Nuh uh, we just did what you told us to. Have fun replacing what was a motivated, loyal and dedicated team of cleaners who made your business bloom.\n\nTL;DR Boss refuses to replace employees who left and simultaneously adds a fuckton of work to us employees who are already struggling and burnt out. When we try to tell him that we can't take it anymore, he tells us that \"if we don't like it, then leave\". We take his advice and all resign simultaneously without prior notice, leaving him in deep shit. Feels good man.",

            "It always blows my mind when someone can be so oblivious to what makes their business great in the first place",
            "This is happening to me right now.\n\nI\u2019m an LPN working in an office that does primarily life insurance medical exams. I used to be a contracted worker and would only drive to peoples houses for the exams, or help with health fairs. Health fairs paid $25/hr. The contracted exams paid at minimum $17 per exam and my highest ones would be over $40 as they had blood and urine collection, height & weight, blood pressure, pulse, full medical history, and an EKG. If I had a couple I could make bank at a maximum of $80 or so in an hour of work.\n\nThe in-office nurse quit and a bunch of us took turns rotating in. My paychecks were a lot higher when I would work in the office as you can complete a lot more exams when you don\u2019t have driving time in between each exam. I realized I liked working in the office a lot more than I liked having to drive around all over the place so I asked my boss if I could take over the in-office position and she agreed. Since I would be in-office I would become an hourly wage worker. She told me $17/hr, which I thought was fair enough since that would be the minimum I could make driving around and I often made less than that driving around if I had a bunch of basic exams spaced far apart that it took more than an hour to get to, plus I didn\u2019t have to pay for gas anymore (we didn\u2019t get mileage as independently contracted workers, we only got to write it off on taxes). My first few weeks were awesome. It was exactly what I wanted. Then things started to go downhill.\n\nI am the only examiner in the office. We have a quality control lady in the back offices with me who does purely clerical work. We have two receptionists up front who do all the scheduling and checking in and talking to agents, etc. One of the receptionist ladies had originally been hired in to do drug screens (random, post-accident, pre-employment, you get the idea) so she was responsible for doing all the drug screens that walked in. Between the two of us, things ran smoothly even on the rare occasion I would be double booked by accident. They rarely scheduled an 8am exam for me as 8am is when I am paid to start working and it would get somewhat stressful if I got there at 7:50 and the client had gotten there 20-30 minutes before their 8am appointment and was irritated to be kept waiting so long. The ladies told me they wouldn\u2019t give me many of those unless the client could meet at no other time.\n\nAnother office in our area that does only drug screens closed down and suddenly the amount of drug screens coming in got way out of hand. We would have a waiting room with 5 or 6 people waiting for drug screens on top of life insurance exams. So my boss said she wanted me to get certified to do drug screens (to do federal ones, you must be professionally certified after taking an 8 hour class) so that I could help out in between my life insurance exams. Well, the front office lady hates having to stop her work up front and walk to the back of the office to do drug screens, so over a period of 2 months, I became the sole drug screener. She will do them only if the person has been waiting for 30+ minutes because I\u2019m in with a full exam for life insurance but typically she will not do them anymore. I will come back from an exam to find 2-3 drug screen papers sitting on my desk for me to do, and will be expected to do them even when my next appointments show up for insurance.\n\nThen the QC lady started complaining that I don\u2019t do enough cleaning in the exam rooms and processing lab. I\u2019m not taking out the trash often enough, vacuuming, etc. so my boss tells me I need to be doing these things on top of my current duties.\n\nThen the ladies started giving me 8ams every single day, and giving me 3:30 and 4pm appointments (I am supposed to be out by no later than 4 because my boss does not want to pay overtime). This made it so that I often didn\u2019t leave until 4:30-5 due to the time it takes to complete an exam, get the samples processed, upload the paperwork, and package everything up for FedEx. I put my foot down here and said that I cannot take anything after 3 for full exams and 3:30 for basic ones (I can typically complete a full in 20-30 min and a basic in 10-15, so this gives me enough time for all the post-exam things I have to do).\n\nThen they started moving my appointments into my name days in advance. To explain, our office has an account called OFFICE and an account in my name. OFFICE appointments are able to be booked remotely by customers using an online booking system. When appointments get moved from the OFFICE account to my account, whatever appointment time that appointment was for shows up as available in the OFFICE account. You can see where this would create trouble. Suddenly I was being double booked. Several times they would move the double booking to my name and I would be triple booked. Once I had 4 people scheduled for the same time. The ladies are supposed to call these appointments and get them rescheduled but they don\u2019t, so if I don\u2019t want to be double booked, I now have to make these calls myself.\n\nHealth fairs and drug screen events I am expected to go to at my boss\u2019s discretion. I receive $17/hr instead of the $25/hr my contracted colleagues receive. Emergency breath alcohol tests and emergency drug screens (you have to drive immediately to the job site) I get paid $17/hr. My contracted colleagues get paid $175 (yes, one hundred seventy-five dollars) per 911 screening. I am randomly told to do Saturdays in a county 2 counties away (over an hour from my house) where I am paid again, $17/hr. Nobody asks me if I\u2019m free to work that Saturday, they just tell me I\u2019m working, so it\u2019s impossible to make plans in advance.\n\nI do not have time to eat lunch. I do not have time to take any sort of break whatsoever. I do not have time to breathe and relax. My anxiety is so through the roof these days it\u2019s a wonder I\u2019m still working here. Many days I feel very close to breaking down, especially when I am tasked with so much that it seems impossible for me to achieve. On top of it, everyone is constantly on about how much better my predecessor was, about how much more she had to do (lol she quit but I guess they just overlook that little bit). But since this is one of the best paying jobs I\u2019ve had, even if I\u2019m being taken advantage of to the fullest, I have bills to pay and I keep showing up everyday. I am, however, taking matters into my own hands.\n\nI am enrolled in classes to complete my RN. From there, I will complete my BSN, and finally my CNM (nurse-midwife, a specialized nurse practitioner). I will be gone from this hole by the end of next year at the latest. I am obtaining a couple different certifications that should allow me to return to the contracted work and do appointments in my own time, as well as take on clients pertaining to my new certifications.\n\nEveryone deserves happiness. My plan takes, at minimum, 6 years to complete. At maximum, it could take 10+ years. Who knows? I\u2019m taking online classes at a tiny community college and getting federal aid to help pay for it. Even if I didn\u2019t have federal aid, the classes are $155 per credit hour and are 3-4 credit hours per course, so if I have to take one class per semester so I can afford it, I will. If you are stuck in a dead end job that makes you want to drive into a ditch every morning rather than show up, I promise you there are other options out there. Lots of areas, even small towns, offer weekend and evening classes and payment plans for many different certifications. STNA classes, phlebotomy classes, medical assisting classes, insurance classes, and so much more, are typically inexpensive classes, often offering payment plans that are manageable even with a minimum wage job. Manual labor apprenticeships require no skill and they pay you, you don\u2019t pay them. I worked as an electrician for a year and even my tools and work boots I was allowed to have taken out of my paycheck in $10-25 increments. Find your passion. Find a stepping stone to get to your passion. For me, I started as a medical assistant. The electrical apprenticeship allowed me to pay for the medical assisting 12-week course. The job I got as a medical assistant paid enough to allow me to afford the 2 semester LPN license. The LPN is paying me enough to go for my RN, and so on and so forth. Nothing is unreachable, help is out there. Don\u2019t give up even when it seems impossible.\n\nTL;DR: I\u2019m in a shitty job that takes huge advantage of me. Using what I call the stepping stone method, I am making my life worth living 1 tiny step at a time, even though it is slower, because affordability is a big thing for me. I was born into poverty. I refuse to die in it too.",

Then everything changed once the fire nation attacked. \nWe had a few managers leave for other opportunities, and new management was more focused on their bonus then our humanity. They refused to hire when older technicians left, cut the times of our sessions by 10 minutes (brining is from 25 to 15), and took any simple pleasure we had away. No music was allowed in the repair room anymore, we were hounded for taking breaks for the bathroom or water, and they never told us a full truth about a situation. \nOne glorious mid October morning fate struck, and as I walked begrudgingly from the parking structure to the store front, I noticed the malls Maintenance  staff hoisting those giant tacky Christmas decorations.

        "selftext": "Hi all, This is my first submission to the sub and I hope you enjoy it! There\u2019s a tl:dr at the bottom. \n\nContext: \nThis happened a few years ago, I was 18 and working as a receptionist for a  community nursing service. As the youngest in the team by a long shot (the average age of employees being around 55-60), I was usually the one responsible for the \u201cComputer Stuff\u201d, mostly just simple things - nothing a quick google couldn\u2019t solve. The other staff members were wonderful, and I learnt a lot from working with them. \n\nExcept for the Assistant Manager, Karen. This woman was the bane of my existence, she was 75+, recently came out of a 15 year retirement as a receptionist, and was armed with a certificate in Business Management from a 4 hour online course. She refused to use basic computer skills such as Word or email, stating that she didn\u2019t need to learn them again when she had others to do it for her - namely me. In a 5 hour shift, I would spend 3 hours just fielding her tasks. Needless to say, this came along with all the fun personality traits that make a \u2018Manager from Hell\u2019. \n\nMalicious compliance:\nAt the start of my shift, I receive an email from Karen asking me to print the attached files, one was a pdf and the other an mp4. So, assuming she meant just the pdf, I take the printed copy to her. \n\nThis is roughly how the exchange went:\n\nKaren: Why do you only have one file, I sent two?\n\nMe: ...you want me to print an mp4?\n\nKaren: Isn\u2019t that what I asked? A monkey could do your job, and probably better at that (here, I\u2019m pretty sure she laughed at her own joke). \n\nMe, desperate: Look, I don\u2019t think you understand - \n\nKaren: Don\u2019t try and teach me, don\u2019t forget I did your job for 20 years and now, I could have you fired. \n\nAlready over it, and ready for some malicious compliance, me: Okay, well I\u2019ve never printed this type of file before, so it might take a while -\n\nKaren interrupts: I don\u2019t care how long it takes, I\u2019m your boss and I\u2019ve told you to do this. Once it\u2019s done you can move on to the other jobs. \n\nI\u2019m grinning ear to ear at this point, I get back to my desk and send her an email summarising our conversation and explicitly clarifying she wanted me to print an mp4, to which I got a snarky reply. Perfect. \n\nI spent the next 4-5 hours, pausing the video every 2-3 frames, screenshotting it, pasting it to a word document and printing. The administrative tasks piled up, not that Karen noticed because she mostly spent her time reading magazines/talking on the phone. I felt bad as this placed an extra load on the other receptionists; however since Karen was universally hated, they gave me their blessings. \n\nOnce complete, I took about 100 pages carefully held with clips to her desk and sweetly told her that I\u2019d printed the other file. She looked smug, until she saw what was in front of her. Page after page of almost the same picture as the man moves through the video, some slightly blurry, all in full colour. She was furious, to say the least, but I was 1 hour overtime on my shift and Karen knew that would already cause her some issues, so she let me leave. Though, I knew it wasn\u2019t over yet. \n\nAs expected, I get called into HR for a meeting the following week, where they accused me of wasting company time and not complying with management. I explained the situation in detail, and showed them the email (including her awful reply). I also showed them a few more emails and texts where Karen used some particularly \u2018descriptive\u2019 words to insult our staff members, including the very HR rep taking my interview. \n\nTurns out, this was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back as Karen had multiple reports against her from other staff members, and she had been driving HR insane with her own complaints. She lost her job the following week. \n\nThe best part is that this happened on a Sunday, where I got double pay. I took some of that sweet overtime cash and brought in cupcakes to work once Karen was gone. I said it was an end of week treat, but we all knew what we were celebrating. The HR rep seemed to particularly enjoy hers. \n\n\nTLDR: Boss made me print a video. Complied, used a whole shift and overtime. Got called into HR which added to the case against my boss. She was fired within a week. Cupcakes to celebrate.\n\n\n^**Edit:** ^^thank ^^^you ^^^^for ^^^^^the ^^^^^^gold ^^^^^^and ^^^^^^awards!",

            "Our former company president questioned the invoices from the company maintaining our web sites (six brands; six sites).  I explained the volume of work on multiple sites.  He said I needed to print the web sites so he would have an idea how big it was.  I tried to explain that the sites are huge, change all the time, and are available to view at any time, so you don't need a printed copy.  Nope, he wanted a printed copy.  I was not going to waste my time on this stupidity, so I got a quote from the web developers to do it.  A couple of weeks later we received two huge three-ring binders of printed web site pages - a veritable monument to the company president's idiocy.  I dropped them on his desk along with an invoice for almost $3,000.  I am pretty sure he never got past the first five pages before he realized how stupid it was to read printed web pages.  He was forced out within the year for his horrid management practices (and we later found out he was screwing the frumpy HR assistant).  The executive assistant brought the binders to my office and asked if I needed them.  \"No, you can trash them.\"",

            "I work as a video editor and I got this request once too. We have a number of online proofing tools or large file delivery applications, but this one, particularly Bat Shit Crazy Lady client didn\u2019t want to use them because she didn\u2019t want to \u2018use up\u2019 her internet at home, so she wanted a PDF copy. I suppose, in hindsight, I could have just cut her a copy, put it on a flash drive and send it over, but I was feeling especially Douchebaggy that day.\n\nThe project we were working on was about 8 minutes long and I had the editor export the timeline as a .png sequence, then turned the folder into one giant 29 000+ page 47GB PDF. We tried at first on just one of the office laptops but it kept crashing so eventually we let it run overnight on one of the 4K NLE systems, one with 24 processors and 96 GB of RAM. We put the resulting file on a flash drive and I had our receptionist courier it to BSCL.\n\nCouple days go by, didn\u2019t hear from her, thought that maybe she liked it. Finally she calls me and asks me if this is some kind of joke. The file kept making her craptop BSOD, finally it opened on her son\u2019s gaming laptop, but......there\u2019s no audio! She was quite rude, made a number of comments about the quality of our work, my competency, my lineage, etc.\n\nFinally had enough and asked exactly how she thought we could transform a digital medium into a physical print medium? She said, \u201chow the fuck do I know, you\u2019re the professionals!\u201d No matter how many times or how many different ways I explained it she refused to understand it couldn\u2019t be done, said she got them from other, \u2018more competent\u2019 suppliers in the past. Finally told her I would send her a MP4 copy on a flash drive, but I ensured we had our logo prominently watermarking the entire video.\n\nDidn\u2019t hear from her for a couple of weeks until she called me up one morning to say she loved the video but needed a copy right away without the watermark as it was going to be played at an event that night. I told her she needed to come by and pay us in full, plus there would be a rush charge for the short notice. We had to stop a render job to run this one. She didn\u2019t like it, but agreed to come by in 2 hours and I\u2019d have the final output on a flash drive for her.\n\nWhen BSCL showed up she told our receptionist she was there to pick up the drive but I had told her not to release it to her until she received full payment, about $11 750.00. Took a sizeable interac transaction and maxing out 3 credit cards but we got just under $8000.00 from her. She promised to pay the balance the following and I, against my better judgment, released the video to her. Natch she didn\u2019t come in the next week and promptly went radio silent.\n\nWe still had her 3 credit card numbers on file though, plus signed contracts and change orders, and a signed balance due invoice, so we just started running her cards, twice a day, everyday. Took a month but got payment in full. Predictably, got chargeback notices from the credit card companies, but our preponderance of signed documentation stopped that dead.",

        "selftext": "So here\u2019s a malicious compliance story that made my family laugh for years, and still does. \n\nA good few years back, I was about 24-25 years old, I went to Cyprus with my grandparents to visit relatives. My grandparents originally came from there and moved to the UK when they were like\u2026 16. My cousin, 14 female, also came along. \n\nNow it\u2019s important to mention that we\u2019re Greek Cypriots. Certain things are expected when we visit relatives. Such as helping out with things if we can, and offering our help for whatever our host might be doing. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that I have a sight problem, but I\u2019m extremely independent in spite of it.\n\nSo we were visiting relatives and every time I offered to help out, either taking dishes into the kitchen, bringing them out of the kitchen, washing up, even getting a glass of water, I kept being told to sit down, they could handle it. \n\nI didn\u2019t understand why, as I\u2019m perfectly capable. I thought it might be to do with my eyes. \n\nOne day we were visiting a great auntie of ours, who owns a little summer home by the sea, not too far from where we were staying. Now when we visit this auntie, I always go swimming. She\u2019s literally not even a couple of mins away from the sea. \n\nNow as I went to offer my help to my great aunt, I hear my 14 year old cousin talking to her in Greek. Another important note, I can\u2019t string together a sentence in Greek. My father is English and had something against us speaking Greek. But although I\u2019m not a fluent speaker, I can read, write and understand Greek. My family doesn\u2019t know this. They assume that because I\u2019m not a fluent speaker, that they can basically hide their conversations between other people\n\nMy cousin was telling my great aunt how clumsy I am. How stupid I am. How I\u2019m a little\u2026 soft in the head. She was saying it in Greek. She thought I couldn\u2019t understand her. But I knew exactly what she was saying, even if I couldn\u2019t string sentences together myself, I knew what she was saying about me. I added 2 and 2 together, and realised my cousin was very obviously telling all my relatives this. She did it, because she thought she\u2019d get praised if she helped bring out the food without me. I was angry, but I knew the perfect revenge. \n\nWe ate lunch, and after we were finished eating, my great aunt asked my cousin for her help to take the dishes in, and do the washing up, as she\u2019d been on her feet most of the morning, preparing the food. \n\nMy cousin looked at me, knowing my great aunt couldn\u2019t speak English and said \u201cHey OP, auntie needs help taking the plates in and doing the washing up.\u201d Because now, she was bored, and expected to run off to the beach and leave me doing the hard work of cleaning up after.\n\nSo I looked at her and said \u201cBut I\u2019m too stupid and clumsy, and soft in the head, to help auntie out. Besides, she asked for YOUR help. Not mine.\u201d She went pale, realising I knew what she\u2019d said. But she doubled down.\n\u201cI helped bring everything out. You could help take it all in.\u201d \nI laughed at her, picked up the book I\u2019d brought with me, and got up from the table. Grabbed the towel I brought with me, and went to walk off. My cousin started whining to my grandparents that I wasn\u2019t helping her. My grandmother looked at her and said \u201cYou made your bed. Now you lie in it. Your cousin caught you lying about her, and now she can go to the beach, while you help your aunt.\u201d My cousin went completely white then. \n\nSo I went to the beach. Swam for thirty minutes, then chilled out on a deckchair, reading my book under the shade of a nice umbrella. By the time my grandparents called to me that we were heading home, my cousin had spent all of it helping to wash up, and dry things, and put them away. She hadn\u2019t gotten to be lazy and go to the beach, to enjoy the sea. \n\nI could\u2019ve helped her. I simply decided that I wouldn\u2019t, as she never earned my help. Since then, every time we went to a relatives home, and she was asked to help, I watched with a smirk on my face. To this day, (I\u2019m 37 this year) I still won\u2019t help her. \n\nShe made out I was incapable to people. So now she suffers the consequences. It\u2019s the malicious compliance that keeps on giving to me.\n\nETA\n\nAnswers to some common questions.\n\n1: I was born with Congenital Cataracts and I\u2019m 85% blind.\n\n2: This didn\u2019t actually start out as something to carry on for years. I don\u2019t actually carry it on myself either. It started out as a \u2018consequences for her actions\u2019 type lesson. The family picked it up, because she wouldn\u2019t admit to the lie, and no one liked her lying. They don\u2019t actually make her do extra chores when I\u2019m not there, as the whole thing started because she said I was \u2018incapable\u2019, so the family basically told her she had to help out her \u2018incapable\u2019 cousin.\n\n3: The family carried it on until this point, because she refuses to admit to the lie. To this day, over a decade later, she still says that I\u2019m incapable, clumsy, soft in the head, to any relatives that will listen. She\u2019s now a full grown adult, who refuses to let go of the lie, so the family has kept up her narrative, because she won\u2019t let it go.\n\n4: Some people have asked if my grandmother knew what was going on before I confronted my cousin. She did not. After I caught her lying about me, and used her words against her, my grandmother straight away asked my great aunt, in front of us both, if my cousin had said that. My great aunt confirmed it, as she didn\u2019t know my cousin was actually lying. I\u2019d already put 2 and 2 together and realised this was probably what my cousin had been doing with everyone we visited. My grandmother was one of 10 siblings that made it to adulthood, and my grandfather was one of 6 siblings that made it to adulthood. We visited a lot of relatives. So once my grandmother found out my cousin had done this at my great aunt\u2019s, my grandmother dug around and found out what I\u2019d already guessed. When my grandmother asked exactly WHY she thought that it was okay to do this, she doubled down, and basically claimed it was true. So my grandmother told our relatives, that this was absolutely NOT true. She also told them, that as my cousin refused to admit to the lie, that they should treat her as the only capable one when I was there. If she wants to lie about her family, my grandmother asked they act towards her, as if the lie were true. If I was incapable, then I couldn\u2019t possibly help out, but my cousin was NOT incapable, she\u2019d be required to do the stuff they\u2019d normally ask of me. \n\nPlease don\u2019t get me wrong. She wasn\u2019t asked to do anything OTT, like cleaning hunted kills, paving driveways, or herding cattle. She was asked to wash dishes, carry dishes in and out of the kitchen, drying and putting away clean dishes. Simple things asked of anyone. They just made a point of only asking her when I was there, because of her refusal to admit to the lie. She\u2019s 24-25 years old now, with her own place. But she still goes around telling people the same lie about me. My grandparents didn\u2019t know about it, until I confronted her with it. They just made a reactionary choice when they found out what she was doing.",

After the meal we are expected to wash and dry the dishes because aunt cooked. Well, cousin kept doing the drying poorly so I would end up going through the ones she already did and then she would go swimming. She also admitted that week that she knew I wouldn't be able to leave the dishes done poorly so she did it bad so I'd do my share and hers. Well, aunt comes in while I'm drying the dishes and asked if we traded duties, I said no, I washed the dishes but cousin didn't dry them well so I am doing them. Aunt asked where cousin was, I said swimming. Aunt told me to go swim and she'll finish the dishes. The next day it was dishes time so I went to the kitchen to get started and aunt said, I've done more than enough dishes and cousin will be doing my share since I had been doing hers. So, cousin did the dishes in maybe 2 minutes. Aunt came into kitchen, saw that the dishes were wet and dirty in the cupboards and made cousin redo them til they were clean. I think she had to do them 5 or 6 times. It took like 3 hours. It should've only took 30 mins doing it alone. It was glorious. We were 15 and 16 at the time. I was the younger.",

He's constantly yelling at everyone about basic shit, like punching in a minute or two late/early, or being a word or two off the script during outbound/inbound calls. Dealing with him in general has made me hate the job more. As its getting hotter I've been wearing khaki shorts to work for the past few days, which is something I've always done for the past few years and nobody has confronted me about it before, so I figured nothing would change this year. But boy was I wrong. About halfway through my shift this boss comes to my desk and realizes I'm wearing shorts, and is visibly annoyed. He mutters something under his breath and goes back to his office. An hour later I was called into his office, where he proceeded to berate me about breaking dress code. He was fuming, and ended the meeting with \"From now on you follow dress code to the book, or your fired!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSay no more, boss.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat night I went home and read up on the dress code rules. There was in fact a rule against shorts, so I was annoyed, but kept on. And then I found it, there is no rule preventing males to wear skirts/kilts. Here's where I devised my plan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI immediately ordered a pink and white striped kilt online, as well as matching knee high socks and shirt. There was no rules stated in the dress code against any of this (surprisingly). About a week later the clothes arrived, and here is what ensued the following work day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI walked in, wearing my new pink business outfit, and immediately the whole office is staring at me, and the boss who came in to cover another bosses shift in the morning was beat red in the face, and yelled at me to come in his office. He  goes on a 10 minute rant about how I'm a useless employee, and that he's going to fire me for not following the dress code to a T. I simply stated \"I am in dress code, I urge you to read the employee handbook.\" He ended up reading the whole thing in front of me, and I could see him getting more and more angry as he realized I didn't break any rules. I asked him \"am I free to go to back to work?\" And he looked at me with a death glare, muttered something under his breath and waved me off.",

            "Where I used to work had a similar rule BUT women were allowed to wear capris/shorts that sat below the knee.  One coworker came in, (male) wearing shorts because it is hot (like 80) in our work area.  I am in capris as is another female worker.  HE got told off. (his shorts were nearly covering his knees).    So next day he shows up in the same shorts but has stitched some black bands around the bottom so they were around the same length as the shorts I had on.  Damn straight I pointed out that his were the same length as mine so why wasn't I being sent home too... hrmm well they couldnt do that because no one would be running the returns.. LOL  Rules were then changed to allow guys to wear below knee shorts as well.   \nKilt was suggested to other male coworkers too coz, it's wrong..  Guys should be allowed to wear shorts .",
            "I worked with this one guy at Walmart for awhile. Our dress code then was shorts had to cover the knees, but he's really tall (6'8\") and slender build. So instead of trying to find shorts that fit, he decided to order some kilts. Management threw a fit as they didn't think he could do that (he's half Scottish so hold on) and tried to challenge him based on ethnicity. He brought in his actual family seal and paperwork to the asshat that tried to challenge him, then proceeded to \"open door\" all the way to corporate. That manager no longer works for Walmart and is not eligible for rehire even as a cart pusher.",

Glad I WFH now and work in my PJs half the day.\n\nYears ago though - I worked front desk at a small clinic where I was the only female.  I used to wear tank tops and shorts during the summer because we didn't have AC, just a box fan at the door.  At one point another lady was hired on but she was much older and overweight.  At that point I was talked to about what I was wearing.  \"These clothes look great on you, however we don't want...others...to think that they can also dress this way\".  Damn.",
            "A couple of years ago a subway system in one of the Scandanavian countries had a heat spell and the rules for drivers were \"pants/skirts\" and didn't specify gender.  After some male drivers were disciplined for wearing shorts, they showed up in skirts.  \nTPTB were smart and changed the dress code to allow for shorts.  I bet Asshat would have changed it to be gender specific.  Which, of course, would likely also get him in trouble.",
            "I worked in a large DIY store for a few years, we had no AC and the building was effectively a huge metal shed, so the few days per year the UK actually gets hot it would be even worse inside.\n\nSince it was getting so hot a few people (mainly those in the garden center stood in the sun all day) started coming in shorts. Management complained and said they couldn't as it wasn't allowed in the dress code. A few days later and most of the staff were in shorts, they decided it wasn't worth the argument and just left us too it. They couldn't argue it was from a safety point as skirts were allowed, there was talk of coming in skirts if they put their foot down regarding the shorts, which might have helped twist their arm.",

            "Good for you! I've had two different workplaces that banned shorts. Capri length pants were okay, but men don't generally wear pants that length - so - some men bought kilts. Some management folk got ruffled over it, some did not (VP did not and he was top dog, so nothing was ever said). Honestly, I find men wearing kilts very attractive - but I kept that opinion to myself.\n\nDuring the early 1970's, I was a teenager. The Feminist Movement was in full-swing. The topic of women wearing slacks into offices was quite controversial. Where my father worked, management was 100% against women wearing slacks in the workplace. It was a huge deal, in the news every day. Anyway, I was mildly aware that my father had made several phone calls to his mother around that time and was taking notes during their calls. Then a package came in the mail, dad was excited about it. I didn't know, at first, what was in the box. All I knew was when he left for work on Monday, my mom shook her head saying he was going to lose his job. He was gone from home Mon-Fri. I found out Friday night what the secret was. He was working as a utility lineman. He'd bought a kilt in the plaid pattern of the clan of his mother's ancestors. He wore that kilt every day that week in protest to management to allow women to wear slacks in the workplace. Yup, he was written up over it. Eventually, management gave up the fight against women wearing slacks. He had started something, more and more men were wearing kilts to work as a silent protest.\n\nHe sat me down and said he'd done it for me, being a young woman. He said that what a person wore to work had little to nothing to do with their work performance. He didn't see management's side of banning slacks for women, especially in Winter.\n\nHe wasn't directly written up for wearing a kilt. What was written on the form was that he wasn't wearing underwear and the spotter at the bottom of the pole had to look up and spot him....and all his private bits were visible.\n\nIt was one of the few times he really took a stand on something. He did it for ME, so, I was proud of him for doing that.",
            "I live in Florida and the no shorts thing bothers me so much. I even own fancy dress shorts that go below the knee but most places here still require long pants.\n\nIf i don't interact with customers and they literally aren't allowed in our building, then why does it matter?

I started wearing khaki shorts with a button up shirt to work and did it for a few days until I too was pulled into a meeting with the boss. He went off on me for looking unprofessional and demanded I go home and change into pants.

        "selftext": "\nThis was around 10yrs ago. I\u2019ve always been very technical minded & was able to read blueprints, construct complex devices, weld (mig, tig, stick. Certified in fact among other things.)\nI took a high paying job with a company that made several things for railroads.\nThe job entailed most of my skills, I mentioned above. It was a very small department, in fact there were only 2-3 of us. But we got along great & challenged each other. Which led to higher production. (Sadly the one other guy in my department left for a better job which left me by myself.)\nMy supervisor was great as well; liked to joke around with me, left me alone to focus on my work & had my back when I needed him. We actually assembled Signal Enclosures & Mast & Ladder Houses for railroads.\n\nFast forward to 3yrs later & the owners buy a much bigger location & move the whole company. As you might expect, several departments get shuffled. \nYep, my department gets folded into a completely different department that has no clue what I do. \nAt first, it was fine but it starts to go pear shaped pretty quickly.\nMy new supervisor seemed good at first. But I quickly realize he\u2019s a \u201csnake in the grass.\u201d\nFor example,  I had to help the prototype department assemble a new, lighter type of mast & ladder house. So I\u2019m printing out issues & suggesting fixes, etc.\nNew supervisor is not happy. He keeps coming over huffing, groaning under his breath, standing over my shoulder, etc.\nHe finally interrupts and asks in an angry voice \u201cHow much longer will this take?!\u201d \nI respond \u201cI have 4 more hours today. And eights hours everyday after that.\u201d\nHe looks puzzled. \nSo I explain \u201cThis is my department. This is where I work. These are my responsibilities. So if it takes two months, that\u2019s how long it takes.\u201d\nAlmost as if to get the last word in he says \u201cYou work where & when I tell you!\u201d And storms off.\nNext day I\u2019m called into the office & they force me to sign a letter that states, \n I now work in my new supervisor\u2019s department.\nFine by me.\nI watch from a distance in my \u201cnew department\u201d as all the stock, hardware, parts, orders, etc. of my \u201cold department\u201d begin to rack-up. \nAnd since I\u2019m the only one that works in that department, or rather, used to work in that department\u2026lol.\nNobody is doing a thing about it.\nAfter about 2 weeks, my old department is a disaster. With items being thrown wherever it would fit. Orders had began to miss deadlines and higher-ups wanted answers.\nSure enough, I get called into the office where the new supervisor blames me for everything. But wouldn\u2019t let me get a word in. \nOf course, they let me go without any reason or paperwork. The look of relief on my new, ex-supervisor\u2019s face when I walk out was priceless. He had no clue what was coming\u2026\nI leave with a smile plastered to me face. Because I knew something they didn\u2019t;\nI was the only one that knew how to build the mast & ladder structures.\nI relaxed at home for around 2 weeks because I knew I would be getting a call from them.\nI ignore the first dozen calls. Then I answer : \u201ccan you come back & build, train new hires, etc for your department?\u201d \n\u201cSure.\u201d I say \u201cfor $20,000.\u201d\n(Now that may seem like a lot but it wasn\u2019t. They made millions from these. So there really was only one option; pay me $20k or lose millions.)\nLong story short, they went back-and-forth with me but finally conceded. \n\nI received $20k for two days work & they were helpless.\nThe cherry on top was my new, ex supervisor was fired for being a nitwit & costing the company $20k.\n\nEdit;\nWow this popped-off! Thanks for all the awards! Didn\u2019t expect that.\nSorry it was so long.\nSome further information- I didn\u2019t want to work for them again. It potentially would have been a situation- they used my knowledge & training of the new staff only to terminate me for some made up reason. Which I understand, nobody wants a disgruntled employee.\nWhy $20k? I bounced around on numerous figures but when it came time to say a number over the phone, $20,000 was the number that came out. No real thought. Could I have gotten more? Yes I think so. But it paid my bills, spent some, little vacation & gave me time to be picky about my next job.\nDid I get another job? Yes.\nAs to your questions; could I train 2 new workers in 2 days? Yes. Did I do it well? No. The company wanted it as cheap as possible. So they grabbed two new guys from a different department with zero experience. The best I could do was show them the general process given their limited experience & my limited time.\nAs far as getting all the work up to date; in my dept. the expected prod. was 2 per day. My personal record in one day was 18 before I stopped (previous good supervisor told me to stop. \u201cWhat the heck are you going to do after you finish a months worth of work in a day?! You\u2019ll be sitting around with nothing to do or you\u2019ll be going home early.\u201d ) \nThe first month I was there I set-up a series of jigs the allowed fast, repeatable results. That coupled with years of doing it meant I could build them in my sleep.",

As the eldest daughter it was her responsibility to take care of her younger siblings. Consequently she never learned more than basic reading and math, and although she married and had kids of her own she worked outside the home to add to household income, often doing cleaning and other low-wage work.\n\nOf her own children most were reasonable people, but her youngest daughter was a complete parasite. She had no problem taking whatever she could get from her mother, my grandmother, even having her mother co-sign on debts and then leaving her to pay it off.\n\nDespite not having much education my grandmother was a wise person in her own way, but not when it came to her own kids and especially not her mooch daughter. She just could not stop letting her daughter misuse her.\n\nShe ultimately became ill with cancer. Her kids took care of her, except for, you guessed it, the youngest parasite daughter. On her deathbed she told her oldest daughter she was worried about the mooch, and related where she kept all her money. It wasn't much. Maybe $700 or so. And then she told her oldest daughter that when she died to give it all to the mooch.\n\nAfter my grandmother died, oldest daughter had to stomach giving her own mother's last dollars to her miserable vampire of a sister. But to make it more tolerable, she decided to do it by sending it installments of $10 a month. \n\nSo that's what she did, for years. Just $10 a month, every month. Not enough to splurge on anything, not enough to even make a difference in her life. Almost as if it were nothing.\n\nI always admired my older aunt. She knew how to hold a grudge.",

Do you think she was babied too much and not disciplined or prepared for life? I say this because I see this often with younger kids of immigrants. They\u2019re often harder on their older kids but later in life as they have less stress and a bit more parenting experience they end up over correcting their parenting styles by being way too permissive to youngest ones which often is not good for those kids themselves because they\u2019re so unprepared for life and feel so entitled. \n\nHaving said that she is definitely another level.",

Usually within 30 minutes of closing time.\n\nThey would order 1 large vegetarian pizza, with hot peppers, and ask for the pizza to be well done. They would also ask for chillies on the side.\n\nYou might think, ok, what is wrong with that?\nWell, a large pizza would be cut in 12 pieces.\nThis group would come in, take up a large space, only have water, order the one pizza, each person would have one slice, leave a mess and not tip.\n\nThey started asking for more hot peppers and complaining that the pizza wasn\u2019t spicy enough. They also started sending the pizza back to be cooked more (it was already pretty dark).\n\nWell, one day they sent the pizza back but this time asked for it to be remade not just cooked more.\n\nAt this point it was 15 minutes to closing, I had cleaned everything and was pretty much finishing up my shift. Of course the manager has to appease the customers.\n\nSo I start making them another pizza.\n\nThey want it spicy? Let\u2019s give them spicy. I added a coating of chillies to the tomato sauce. Covered it with toppings and added lots of hot peppers.\nThey want it well done? Fine, let\u2019s put it through the oven twice. (it was a conveyer belt oven. Normally well done is put in the oven 1.5 times).\n\nThis thing came out dark and just smelled spicy.\n\nI cut the pizza and give it to the waitress. I\u2019m now waiting to get an ear full after the customer complains. All prepared with my reasoning that I\u2019m making what the customer asked for.\n\nI finish my shift and the manager calls me over.\nTurns out the customer did ask to speak to a manager... The customer said it was the best pizza they have had since they started coming and it was just how they wanted it. They asked if it could be made this way each week and left a nice tip.\n\nEDIT:\n\nWow. I did not think my story would get so many likes. And my first award! Thank you!\nFor everyone wondering, yes the customers were Indian.\n\nFor others asking why I didn\u2019t just say Pizza Hut. I always find it fun when others subtly describe the well known store / brand. \n\nAs for the tip, it was split between everyone",

Less cooked, but still sent back for being not rare enough.\n\nThe husband was kind of pissed at this point. He cranked the flat-top until it shimmered, threw on a new steak and let it maybe a second per side before putting it on a plate and sending it out.\n\nA bit later the wife comes back. \"He says it's the best steak he's ever eaten.\"",

She didn't spit in it or anything nasty, she just assumed they guy would give it one look, or as most a sip, and send it back.

You also know that they will tip if they are happy with the pizza.\n\nSo next week, start making the pizza ahead of time.  Maybe time it so that it's just starting its second pass through the oven when the walk in.  They get the pizza they really want, within minutes of sitting down.

            "This type of backfired malicious intent is kind of how Nashville hot chicken was created. Not in a restaurant with customers, but in a home with a dysfunctional couple. As the story goes: a wife, angry that her husband has been going out behind her back, decides she\u2019s going to punish him by feeding him his favorite fried chicken, but she\u2019s loaded it with cayenne to make it too hot to eat. It backfired. The husband loved it. Then the family started selling it. I think that was back in the 1930s.",

He took his food and came back about 20 minutes later. \"That sandwich was perfect.\"  He asked for me to make his order every time he came in.

We didn\u2019t have any and they took 7 minutes to cook.  We gave him a regular chicken sandwich and squeezed a few hot sauce packets on it normally given with chili.\n\nHe came back and said he knew it was wrong but wanted to know what we did.  The manager starts asking around and we admitted it.  Expecting to be yelled at, it turned out that he loved it and wanted it that way every time.\n\nThus a new unlisted menu item was born.
