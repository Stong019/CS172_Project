        "selftext": "So my dad had a compactor related story here. Seems fitting that I would have my own to add.\n\nMy company takes safety very seriously. To the point we have safety briefings on the regular to keep us updated. Yesterday, we had a talk on compactor safety. One of our big rules is to Never EVER under any circumstances climb into a compactor unless it\u2019s unhooked from any power sources. Sounds like common sense right? Well, dear reader, as you\u2019re about to learn, apparently common sense isn\u2019t that common.\n\nAfter getting our briefing, we get our assignments and are sent on our merry way. I go to my area, clean it and pull trash. As I\u2019m walking to the compactor, what do I see sticking out of it but two trousered legs. After the shock lasting a nanosecond wore off, I start yelling. \u201cWhat are you doing, you idiot?! Don\u2019t go crawling around in there!\u201d I know I shouldn\u2019t have yelled but I was so mad. \n\nWell Mr. Idiot fell out and starts yelling at me. \u201cDon\u2019t you go yelling at me! Where is your manager!? Get them here right now!\u201d\n\nMalicious Compliance mode activated.\n\nI put on my sweetest smile and say \u201cOf course, I\u2019m so sorry. Let\u2019s get my manager here.\u201d\n\nMr. Idiot smirks and is like \u201cGood girl.\u201d\n\nSo I call my manager over and ask her to come over. Meanwhile Mr. Idiot is smiling like the cat who got the cream. I\u2019m fighting to keep from smiling. Because my manager, Miss Heroine, takes safety as seriously as I do. I\u2019ve seen her reduce full grown men to tears over safety issues.\n\nMiss Heroine shows up and Mr. Idiot says \u201cYou should train your workers to not yell.\u201d\n\nMiss Heroine turns to me. \u201cAnd why were you yelling at him?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I caught him climbing into the compactor and I got scared he\u2019d be crushed.\u201d\n\nIn a nanosecond, Mr. Idiot goes from looking like contented cat to looking like a scolded dog.\n\nAfter a sound verbal thrashing, Miss Heroine calls Mr. Idiot\u2019s manager. Within 30 minutes, Mr. Idiot was clearing out his desk, still smelling of garbage.",

One that will always stick with me was when one of the vets, who had been there for twice as long as I had, decided to shove his hand into the back of a moving carboard bailer (above the moving ram) to try to dislodge some stuck cardboard. He was behind the machine and no where near the emergency stop button or the plug. Standing on the painted \"Danger\" floor markings. His watch gets caught, his arm gets stuck, and he screams in absolute terror as he realizes he's about 10 seconds away from losing his hand in a horrifying way.

They told the operator to wear a hard hat and they'd be fine. A hard hat wouldn't have helped at all.

In the interest of keeping them anonymous let\u2019s just call them Rob Lowe, or, Lowes for short. \n\nI walked in one day looking to finally purchase a new mower, and I was in luck as they had a smoking deal on a \u201cdisplay\u201d model. Unprepared to be going home with a new mower that day I didn\u2019t bring my truck. So I simply asked if I could set it aside and come back in a little bit with my truck.\n\nI returned maybe 30 min later and picked up my mower and headed home. This should be the end of the story but weirdly, it isn\u2019t. \n\nFast forward about 2 weeks later and I get a call from lowes informing me that my mower is ready for pickup. Confused I replied \u201cpardon me?\u201d. So they reminded me that I ordered a mower about 2 weeks ago and it just arrived and is awaiting pickup. \n\nNow I know most would have seized the opportunity right there but I decided to be a good person and I explained to the employee that no, I didn\u2019t order a mower, I bought a floor model and set it aside to pick up later, which I did. The employee thanks me, apologizes for the confusion, and says he\u2019ll update the order. \n\nWelp, one week later they call again, same thing, and I once again explain why it\u2019s not mine. They did this once a week for 3 weeks straight, and after the 3rd time I tell the wife I swear if they call me again I\u2019m going to pickup \u201cmy mower.\u201d \n\nAt this point now I\u2019m just excited, I\u2019m watching my phone, hoping they\u2019ll call, because in my mind I\u2019ve earned it at this point and I want my free mower! Well low and behold week 4 hits and guess who calls!\n\nI am now ready to accept my free mower but I\u2019m also unsure how this is going to play out. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s paid for, I don\u2019t have a receipt, it seems like a long shot. So I simply tell the employee I\u2019m so sorry I haven\u2019t been in yet to get it, but I got called out of town for work and just got back and with that said I have no idea where I put the receipt. The employee kindly replies \u201coh no worries! It\u2019s paid in full so all you need is a photo id matching the name on the order\u201d\n\nPerfect!\n\nI call the wife to let her know I\u2019m picking up our new mower, she just laughs, still positive that once I get there they won\u2019t have a mower to give me. \n\nBut you\u2019ll be happy to know I pull in, tell customer service I\u2019m here for my mower, show them my ID, and next thing you know some guy on a tow motor is loading a brand new, in the box, unassembled mower into the back of my truck and off I go. Still have that mower today!\n\nI thought about returning the original afterwards but I just got nervous it would somehow raise the alarms. Then I was going to sell it on marketplace, but shortly after all this I had bought a new house and my best friend put in a lot of hours helping me move and he too had been looking for a new mower so I just gave it to him instead as a thanks for helping me. \n\nI still ended up with a brand new mower for essentially 60% off and then was also able to pay for movers with the Original one so it was still a win win. \n\nI genuinely tried telling them it wasn\u2019t my mower, but they insisted it was, and it would be rude to refuse their offer.",

            "I bought a pair of folding tables from Home Depot, selected store pickup, and took them home. A week later, I got a call to come pickup my tables. Not being as ethical as you, I went and picked up two new folding tables. Well, another week goes by and another call. I tell the employee this time that I already got my tables, but he's insistent that these are mine for pickup. I don't really need six folding tables, but if they want to give two more to me, why not? Well, the next week I got another call. I don't need any more fucking folding tables. The employee again is insisting that I come get them, but this time I refuse. This was getting out of hand. They called for the next two weeks before I guess they cancelled the order. So I ended up with a refund on the original two tables. I got six tables in all for free. I often imagine the folding table empire I could have had if I just kept accepting them.",

After a month of getting the runaround, he gave up and kept it.\n\n*Edit to add.

            "I once bought some furniture and got it delivered home. When we opened one package we realised that the stuff inside was way too big. Big wardrobe instead of small dresser. Same design, same line. So we had received an item at least 3 times as expensive (but we didn\u2019t need it). I called them and they were really relieved because apparently the guy who had ordered the wardrobe was already pissed and they had no clue why it had vanished from the warehouse and it was the last one. \n\nThey brought our dresser the next day and we got a refund as a thank you - AND they assembled it for free - which quite frankly was the best part!

            "At one point Lowe's decided that they didn't think there was a market for online orders with pickup in store so they dismantled the entire department that was built around it, and they half-assed passed the duties to customer service.\n\nThen suddenly we had that minor pandemic that shut down travel worldwide and they had to scramble to rebuild the department when everybody had moved on or been moved on. What was the department handling maybe 10 to 15 orders a day suddenly jumped up to 50 to 100 orders and if it was a weekend Saturday and Sunday mornings could see over 300 orders for the average, medium sized store. Not only was there a crew that had to be there when the trucks were delivered each night to pull off the special orders they also had to spend their entire night just pulling product off the shelf so they could bag it up for the person to pick up in the morning. Now alongside this there was a system on the computer where you could look up and print off orders that have been submitted by the customer, in fact there were three, but none of them were robust enough to handle the online orders placed in the decade prior where online ordering had not really impacted the stores themselves so when it came time for pandemic level ordering the computers were often unable to properly keep up.\n\nThe three systems they used did not properly communicate with one another so if a note was made in one it wouldn't necessarily be transcribed on the back end to the other two and in fact it wasn't unheard of for the note to instead be deleted when the back end decided to compare the three different programs. At one point we had six different orders of the same garden paver sitting on pallets in the staging area waiting for a customer to come pick them up but they were all for the same customer and we're only one order that had been pulled six times. These are known issues that they didn't want to fix.\n\nLowe's is so cheap as a company that one of their most pivotal programs for managing large orders by customers, was not even designed for Lowe's, it was built for a different hardware and home supply store that decided they did not like it and the company that coded it back in the 90s shopped it around and Lowe's was the only one willing to pay for it, but they did not want to pay too much for the adjustments that would have to be made to match their own system so instead they just kept it as basic as they could; it's basically still running as a Dos program; and it is still one of the most accurate that they have for knowing what's in the inventory.",

It is a huge store, so a faulty chainsaw or two going missing from the returns section wasn't noticed, but she got really brazen and was doing it more and more regularly.\n\nBecause it got so blatant, she would then double-process orders so that the total stock on hand looked right, and customers that had already picked up their orders didn't pick up the duplicates because she was the one supposed to call them.\n\nThe shell game eventually failed though, and they prosecuted her for embezzling around $300k.

The package was delivered a few days later and it was massive. My wife opened the large box and found 4 of the scooters. She tried contacting the company and they told her just keep them. We donated the 3 extras to a local toy drive. Hope they made some kids super happy that Christmas!!!",

            "My son had just moved back from Texas to Minnesota and he desperately needed winter boots. I didn\u2019t have much money and we went to Walmart. A huge end cap was stocked with Dickies boots and I knew they had to be atleast $100. The sign display said $15. I took a picture and proceeded to check out. The cashier rang them and yup they were over $100. I said no ma\u2019am they\u2019re $15. After a very annoyed manager tried to persuade me that I knew full well they weren\u2019t $15 but I persisted and they sent someone back to check. Another lengthy argument about them having the wrong display sign, again, not my problem. I pulled out my phone and showed him the picture. Offfda he was pissed, and I walked out with the boots. I could hear him ranting about it and sending someone to fix that immediately before they lose the entire shelf. Sorry, not sorry. In Minnesota anyway if a store has a product marked with a certain price they have to give it to you.

            "My example happened with university fees. I'm in the UK so my masters cost only \u00a36k, not whatever you pay in America. I went for the option of paying in two installments, one at start of year one half way through. Paid the first one no problem. Then decided to switch to a part-time version of the course which was the same thing stretched over two years rather than one. \n\nI was told that if I wanted I could now delay my second payment to halfway through the second year. I agreed to this as why not. But then they call up on the original payment date asking me about it, only I didn't have the money because I'd been told I wasn't gonna be paying until later. So I explain everything and they say fine.\n\nComing towards the end of the course over a year later, I realise I've never had someone ring me up about the payment and actually missed the date. I'm a bit concerned but nothing has happened and anyway I have the money so I call them up and speak to the accounting department. Explain everything and ask how to pay. \n\nShe says 'you're all paid up on here.' \n\nNo that can't be right I've only paid half the fee.\n\n'Nope, on here it's saying all paid up!' \n\nI was trying to convince her that was a mistake whilst she was reassuring me I was paid up and in the end I just accepted it. Later on I went through all my bank statements and I definitely only paid the first \u00a33k so there must have been some kind of mistake when they delayed my second payment. Either way I'm not complaining.",

Arranged for the installer to bring it on the install date.\n\nThe cashier couldn\u2019t figure out how to apply my veterans discount, which is in their system and has never been a problem, so they eventually knock off $100, instead of the $50 or so it should have been.\n\nA few weeks later, I get notified of an install date. Guy confirms, gives me a window of noon to 5. Never shows, and at 8:30pm I get a call from some dude who can barely speak English, asking where I live, and saying he will arrive in an hour or so. I tell him no dice, I\u2019m not staying up all night, and to reschedule.\n\nCall the store the next day, they send me to another number, who send me to a 3rd number, and finally set a date. That date comes and goes with a no show. As do 4 other dates over the next few months.\n\nAt some point Lowes refunds the install charge and an additional $100, so my over $500 microwave is now down to about $250 or so.\n\nAnother date arrives, dude actually shows up, and asks me where the microwave is. Tell him he is supposed to bring it, as I don\u2019t have it. He calls the store, and they have it. He leaves, never to be seen again. \n\nAnother date is scheduled, the store calls the night before to confirm the installer will pick it up and arrive the following morning. Next morning the installer calls from the store, and no one knows where it is, so he won\u2019t be arriving. \n\nMultiple calls and emails ensue, six months have elapsed, and still no microwave. Someone from corporate calls, and refunds the entire $500+ amount, so now I am ahead well over $250. A few days later, a truck pulls up, and they deliver the microwave, but claim they aren\u2019t installers. I call Lowes, tell them I have already received a full refund and then some, and they tell me to keep it anyway. So I found a local guy, paid him $100 to install it, and ended up making over $150 and getting a free microwave.\n\nThe multiple levels of incompetence and stupidity, at all levels, was amazing.",

The catch:  you had to take them with you right then.\n\nI did not have time to go get my truck and trailer to grab them so I figured that with Thanksgiving weekend it was unlikely anyone else would too (these were \"panel ready\"  so most people would not want the added expense of buying doors).\n\nI spent Thanksgiving in anticipation of going back.\n\nTurns out I was right and when I got back they were still there.  But since I did not want to drive out there with my truck and trailer just to be disappointed I could not \"carry with\".\n\nI asked an employee if I paid for them could I run home and get my trailer (1 hr tops).  They said no.  Apparently they had been burned too many times where someone buys the clearance product and then when they come to pick it up, the employee in charge of grabbing it just gets the 'new' boxed up one out the back.

He does everything he\u2019s supposed to do for the refund but it doesn\u2019t post and it doesn\u2019t post and he calls and goes in an emails and nothing happens. So he opens a credit card dispute for the difference in price. Meanwhile, he\u2019s also doing an executive carpet bomb which is successful.

I'll let you take it back there for me.\" And walked away. \n\nAfter about 20 minutes we walked out with our new pool, then a few days later got a reminder that our order was ready to be picked up? I ignored it assuming it was an error, then a couple weeks later noticed a refund from Walmart- for the price of the pool. They canceled the order that I had already picked up and refunded me, so I got a free pool and pissed off the rude manager.",
            "An entertainment store (sells games, DVDs, comics, etc.) mismarked an entire unopened box of Magic the Gathering cards as the price of a single pack. My broke boyfriend and broke self told the cashier that the price was very wrong, but he says \"but I guess that's the price it's marked ... You want it for that price?\" ... We got a really cool Planeswalker out of that box the year when those first came out. Ahhh. Good times.",
            "Something similar happened to me about a year and a half ago. I was in the middle of the semester taking online classes and my old laptop decided it was going to start taking an hour to boot up, run slow, and shut down/restart at will. Hubby and I had been discussing a new laptop for me for a while but really didn't have it in our budget. I finally got fed up because the shut down/restart occurred in the middle of a test. (One of the test rules was if you lose internet or something during the test, it would lock you out and you couldn't complete it. Fortunately, I was allowed back in my test after this happened but I didn't want to continue to tempt fate.) Hubby and I start checking out laptops for sale that night and find the perfect one at a big box store who are known for electronics. They have a third party deal on the web that offers financing for 12 months so we agree and take the plunge. We select \"In-store pickup\" and receive the confirmation it'll be ready in 30 minutes. The store closes in 45 minutes. We high-tail it over to the store, receiving a confirmation that it's ready to pick up just before we arrive. We go to the counter, give our name and confirmation #. They pull it up in the system and, lo and behold, they can't find it on the shelf. They begin searching, still can't find it. Five minutes to store close ... they pull an employee who goes and finds another laptop in the store. They scan it, print our receipt and we leave as they're locking the doors.\n\nThe following day, I get an email that my laptop is ready for pick-up. I laugh it off, assuming I'll get another saying it was completed within the day. Same thing happens every day for about a week, each stating they'll cancel the order and return it to stock if it's not picked up within, like, 7 days. Hubby and I ignore it. Fast forward two months and we're reviewing our bank statements and it hits me ... they haven't been deducting the finance payments for the laptop. The down payment also wasn't deducted. I log in to the financing site and enter my confirmation number. It tells me my order was cancelled due to not picking up the asset.\n\nI got an $1800+ laptop for free. I have no doubt in my mind that had I picked up the laptop the following day, I'd have 2 laptops for the price of one. Kinda wish we had picked up the second laptop ..."

        "selftext": "In the sixth grade, I bore witness to a stunning example of malicious compliance.\n\nSeveral grades of classes from our elementary school were called to the gymnasium for some lessons on self-defence.  We were to be given some very rudimentary examples of how we, as children, can fight off an attacker if there are no other options. The instructor was a man who had a long martial artist title and was unbearably smug about it. Sure, he'd made some big accomplishments, but he would take every moment available to deliver his lengthy champion title verbatim. Damned if I can remember what it was; it might have been a wilful effort on my part to erase it.\n\nHe was instructing us on how to basically go belly-up like a distressed turtle and kick off an attacker. We weren't really understanding how this was feasible, and we were asking a lot of questions about it. He got tired of the questions and called up a volunteer to demonstrate the self-defence technique. He called upon Alice, a girl in my class.\n\nHe didn't just tell her how to get into position, however. He was putting his hands on her and getting her to lie belly-up on the waxed gymnasium floor in a way that was truly creepy and invasive, even to children who might not understand why. He gave her long stares and made some quiet remarks to her that we couldn't hear, but the expression on her face said, \"Yuck.\" I was only 11 years old, but I got the gist of the situation and thought to myself, \"This guy is fucking gross.\"\n\nShe had her legs up to kick, was making kicking motions but clearly swerving away from making direct hits to this man. It wasn't enough for him to just have the kids understand the technique. He needed to demonstrate his martial arts prowess. He said to her, \"No, go ahead and fight me. This works on an amateur, but I'm a (insert his lengthy and proud title here).\"\n\nHe could not have known, but my entire class knew, that Alice was a competitive swimmer. She had swimming skills beyond her years and all the medals and awards to prove it. Complete with the muscular development of someone who has spent years mastering their sport, particularly in her legs.\n\nAlice seized the opportunity to fight off a man who was already throwing up some problematic indicators of his own predatory nature. She kicked him a few times, clipping a shin or a thigh as he artfully dodged her full-on attacks with a big grin on his face.\n\nShe then triumphantly planted her sneaker directly into his crotch with a force that made both her and this man red in the face.\n\nHe let out a strangled yelp before crumpling to the ground. He dry heaved a few times, too. He was in medical distress and some adults rushed to get him help. To the children, though, we just saw a guy get kicked in the balls by a kid, and that's comedy gold in elementary school. He was helped out of the gymnasium amid the roaring, bellyaching laughter of 100+ children.\n\nAstoundingly enough (to me, at least), Alice was facing punishment for what had happened. Detention was already assigned, suspension was up in the air. Thankfully, Alice's mother rose up with the fury of a thousand women scorned after hearing Alice's testimony of events. Alice faced no suspension, and to my knowledge did not attend any after-school detention sessions. For the rest of the school year, she was recognized as the ultimate badass, and reigning queen of justice-by-testes.\n\nTL;DR: Self defence assembly was called by my school, the instructor was both smug and creepy. He called up Alice to demonstrate a self-defence technique and insisted she fight him off, she crushed his reproductive organs and chaos ensued.\n\nEdit: I understand why anyone who hasn't had the lived experiences of myself nor Alice would doubt my retelling, and it's your prerogative to feel however you want to feel. While it happened, there is little I can do to convince you of that. Please read Rule 3 of this sub before you leap to the opportunity to express as much. Thank you.",

So he asks me to help and tells me to throw a punch from my right hand. This was like the 2nd class and I didn't know karate punches yet, but i had been boxing since i was like 11 and apparently the stance is different and he wasn't expecting a right cross to the cheek and certainly wasn't expecting that level of speed or force on it. \n\nHe was super nice about it though and I felt terrible and he kinda saved it by saying \"lesson one: sometimes black belts get punched in the face\"",

Eventually the teacher sighed and had to ask me to just fall down. It wasn't dramatic, but I made the popular guys friends laugh at him and he was pretty cool about it and laughed himself.",

            "When I was 16 I started spending my Friday Night's in the back room of a bar listening to bands. The sort of place where regulars & staff aren't friends,  they're like family. Anyway,  one Saturday one of the bouncers was on TV. Because he had multiple black belts, in multiple disciplines & had won multiple titles. \n\n\nIt was clear to everyone & especially everyone who knew him he was the opposite of the professional above. He was uncomfortable with the interviewer trying to get him to say he was a registered weapon & who he had beaten. For whatever reason,  they wanted the guy who showed up at OP's school. Not someone stressing that fighting & competing aren't the same thing, that mix martial art fights are about skill not destroying their opponents. That outside of competition, using martial arts should be a last resort, used only in self-defense to disarm the opponent. Honestly, we've all joked that they wanted him to show up & be Brad Pitt from fight club. \n\n\nHe didn't tell people about how many level of black belt he was, or what titles he won. He knew it could attract trouble some drunk thinking they'd take him on. He also wasn't a walking ego. It's not the sort of thing that would naturally come up in convo much & if he did he down played it. So while we knew he win x, y & z we wouldn't know he did it multiple times.\n\n\nAfter being on TV a rumour started about him.& a school girl, she was like 13 or 14. Someone had seen her getting out of her car at the end of lunch break to go back to school. Obviously, rumours & speculation have to go worst case possible. Thankfully, his bosses didn't believe them, & the police believed him when they eventually heard it. He had secretly been teaching this girl self defense. Because he'd been made aware that dad/step dad was just a tad too friendly. Turns out it had gotten a lot further than that, he was hoping her training would protect her from being molested,  not from it continuing. Seeing how distraught he was to not have prevented it, won him my love & admiration forever. I explained that teaching her to defend herself,  stopped it continuing & that she would forever be grateful for that.\n\nThis post reminded me off it. It's been decades since it happened, she's not just grown up, her son must be by now. She named him after that bouncer, because that's the type of man she wants him to be. The rumours eventually died,  her father was charged, unfortunately people couldn't believe he'd do that to his daughter,  but they found photos of other children that he went to jail for. \n\nTrue.role models don't need to say why they're someone who deserves to be looked up to, their actions speak for themselves. It's like actual good guys don't need to say they are their words & deeds show them to be, unlike nice guys who prove they're not when bitching about how unfair nice guys like them.... or that they did whatever & how dare women not provide sex in return.",

            "I think it was 7th or 8th grade where we had some  McDojo senseI come to teach self defense to the grade. I had been taking taekwondo since I was 6 and more recently dabbling in a little judo at the time. One of the instructors at my martial arts school was a cop and he was also the patrol officer for our middle school (really nice guy but he could easily manhandle you without ever touching his weapon or taser). Anyways, as for all large assemblies, he was there to make sure everything was good. \n\nThe McDojo man did his whole thing and even I was making weird faces at some of the stuff he was suggesting and then glancing over to the officer who would also glance over at me with a look of \u201cthis dude knows nothing\u201d. He ended up calling students to the mats the demonstrate why his \u201ctechniques\u201d worked by trying to let the student overpower him and escape a hold or something and then do this technique on the student and be like \u201csee that\u2019s how you do it\u201d. Prof McDojo goes to call up another student for a demonstration and the officer interjects and goes \u201cI think this young man wants to give it a go\u201d and points at me smiling. \n\nNow my school was no McDojo. It was a very hardcore school run by a very serious 9th degree black belt Korean man who spoke just enough conversational English to get by and whom I had most heard shouting commands. He majored I\u2019m taewkondo at university in Korea (something I had no idea you could even do). Guy was ex Korean military too. All the instructors were hardcore and they would not hesitate to fail you in a belt test if you weren\u2019t ready (even if you had paid). A lot of kids got weeded out of the school at a younger age because parents had issues with how strict and disciplinarian the school was but my parents were immigrants and they loved that stuff lol. I think I had a red belt at this point (one below black) and I had earned that shit. \n\nAs I was going to the mat, the officer just winked at me and says \u201cshould be easy\u201d. McDojo proceeds to tell everyone he\u2019s going to show what to do if someone grabs your hand or wrist and won\u2019t let go. He tells me to hold out my left wrist and grabs it with his right hand and then he says \u201cnow try to make me let go, remember no hitting just yet\u201d and I could just imagine the absolute hell I\u2019d have to endure from my parents when the school called home about me flooring this guy. But the officer was smiling at me and I felt like he would have my back so instead of pulling and trying to push back at the attacker, like most kids were doing, I brought my right hand up and under his armpit, turned and connected my right hip into his right hip and then twisted right and yanked my arm and laid him out. He fucking FLEW over my shoulder and hit the mat with a huge thud. \n\nIt\u2019s one of the first throws they taught at my school because you could use it against someone bigger than you pretty easily and we were all kids.  The gym was silent and the guy was letting out a groan and the officer walked up and said, \u201cshould have warned you, this kid is pretty good himself, I\u2019ll handle him, you keep going\u201d and he took me out of the assembly and gave me a high five and went to explain everything to the admins before shit hit the fan. My parents didn\u2019t even get a call about it but they found out later when he gave a short speech along with some of my other instructors for my black belt ceremony and that was one of the things he shared. I still got in a bit of trouble for that when they heard lol.",

        "selftext": "**TL;DR** at the end\nI'm not sure if this belongs here or not, please let me know.\n\nMy ex husband  and I had a great divorce. Even though he cheated on me after 12 years and two kids under 4, I really wanted to do things differently than my parents did during their divorce. I never said anything negative about him, and tried very hard to defend him when the kids got upset with him. I extended invitations to the woman he left me for so she would not feel uncomfortable with me and we became \u2018friends\u2019. She was basically their step mom, so why not include her on everything?\n\n\nOn holidays, we all had one big dinner (he and her and me and my bf).  This made everyone comfortable and the kids never had to choose one side or the other as we were all on the same page. It was such a great relationship that when I had back surgery, I recovered at his house and she cooked for me; he and I were coaches for the kids basketball and baseball teams; and I helped at their wedding 13 years later. This was not easy for me, as he moved to another state to raise her children, leaving me to raise ours on my own. She quit her job when they got together and I had to return to work to support my kids. But I needed to keep the resentment and bitterness away from my kids.  \n\n\nAll of this sets the tone for the divorce, but when he initially left, I spoke to a lawyer and got a separation agreement that was really great (for me). He asked that I not take half of his retirement but instead he would pay X in child support and additional Y in alimony (because he was making a lot of money and I was a stay at home mom with a country club membership *Yuck - I hated saying that but it was only to set the scene*). Normally alimony ends after 5 years, but because I didn\u2019t get half of the 401K, the only condition on ending it was it would end on my re-marriage or my death (he agreed with all of it). \n\n\nThe thing is, when he left me to move down to where she lived, he left his cushy job and took this promising (but not delivering) position that really screwed him financially.  But, he never went back to the lawyer to get the child support or alimony reduced. Instead, he borrowed from his mother. \n\n\nWhen I discovered he was mooching off of her, I suggested to her that she stop paying for him when he finally got back on his feet. She never would do that and continued paying for his life and her to be a stay at home mom). Even co-signing for a second home for him when he finally moved back to raise his kids (hers had graduated and lived in his old house; ours were in HS). \n\nHe did come to me and ask if I would accept regular child support and half of the alimony, then later when he was really earning money he would pick back up on the past due amount. Not wanting to make waves in an otherwise great divorce, I said yes and kept track each month of what was owed in a shared spreadsheet with him so he could see how far in debt he was getting each month. \n\nHe ended up owing me $1,00/month x 10 years, but he said when the kids aged out of child support, he would continue to pay the same amount to make up for the alimony (which totaled $120,000).\n\n\nWhen my daughter aged out, he continued to pay the same amount, putting a small dent in what he owed for three years. Then, as soon as my son aged out, I mean two weeks after he joined the Marines, he called me and told me there was no way he was going to continue paying me for the next X years and I could take him to court if I wanted but there is \u201cNo Fucking Way\u201d he would pay me another cent.\n\n\nThis completely blew my mind as we had such a fantastic relationship and it came out of nowhere. I was completely freaked out, but I took his advice, I contacted an attorney, I sent all his calls to voicemail, per my attorney's advice and I took him to court. \n\nThe best thing was, prior to the hearing, my attorney put a lien on both homes he had so he could not change ownership to his mom or wife prior to the court hearing. I still have the phone call recording when he realized this and the horrible names he called me for doing that. \n\n\nSince I had kept such immaculate records from that day he changed payments, and he was aware of his debt rising each month, it was a slam dunk for my attorney. Instead of making small payments for a few years, he had 30 days to pay me $120,000 in full. \n\n\nUnfortunately, the kids now have to choose which parent they visit on holidays, but that was not my fault. I was willing to continue as is and not put any strain on the family relationship. \n\n*And for those who are wondering, yes he did cheat on her 2x before they got married, but she had quit her job when they got together because she found a 'sugar daddy' and had nothing to fall back on/nowhere to go, so she stayed with him. (Since we were friends, she shared this info with me, as I would understand what she was going through)*\n\n**TL;DR**\nMy ex-husband refused to make payments on back owed alimony, and told me if I wanted to get any further money I should take him to court. That's exactly what I did. Instead of making small payments for the next few years to get caught up, he was ordered to pay the entire $120,000 in 30 days.\n\nEdit* I got my money on day 29. No other payments will be made.\n\nEdit2* I think the reason he went crazy on me was his mother refused to pay anymore when my son aged out, but I explained that he owed a shit ton in back pay. That's when he said \"If you think I'm making payments to you forever, you're fucking nuts!\" \nShe had been paying his child support for 10 yrs because he never went back to a great paying job, even though he could have.\n\nYes, I went to work after separation and have a great career. But my income was still 1/4 of his when we were together because we moved every 3 yrs for his career. He wanted me to stay at home when the kids were born. \n\nEdit3* It is obvious that people do not understand that as a stay at home mom, I could not contribute to my retirement fund because I didn't have EARNED INCOME. Meaning no SS, 401k or IRA. So he maxed out his contributions so we could live comfortably in retirement. After 10 yrs of marriage I was legally entitled to half of his retirement. Since he asked me not to take half of his retirement, he offered alimony instead, then he decided not to pay what he offered and leave me with less retirement funds than I would have had in either case (slim my or half of his retirement)   This is why it was important for me to get what was due. Not to live a cushy life, but for my retirement. \n\nThanks for the awards and for the nasty DMs, I'm ok with you calling me horrible names because you don't matter to me at all.",

I also don't pay Social Security. I pay into the RRB (Railroad Retirement Board) instead. She gets a full retirement from them when she ages out regardless of our relationship status, because she has been married to me for enough years while I paid into them to be vested.

        "selftext": "A bit of context: I've been in the mortgage and related businesses for over 30 years. I know it very well. I've never like Bank of America especially their servicing division. This story happened a few years ago (just found out about this grouip).\n\nI refinanced my mortgage through a mortgage broker and, to my aggrevation, they sold the servicing rights to Bank of America (the entity that owns your lown is usally different than one that you pay to service the loan). I was miffed. I estimated that a Bank of America paid \\~$5k to service my loan as most folks at the time expect loans to stay on the books at least three years. \n\nAnother little fact: Mortgage services are paid 0.25% (fixed)-0.375% (Adjustable) of your outstand loan balance per year (it comes out of the interest you pay to the bank. If you want to know how much you servicer got any particular month using the formula ServicePay = Current Loan Balance \\* (0.25%/12) )\n\nAbout two months after the servicing switched, BoA announced they'd be charging a $5 fee for the convienence to pay the mortgage online. Truly an unwarranted money grab.\n\nI'm blessed that I can put a little extra towards my mortgage payment every month. So the following month, I took out my mortgage payment plus $400 in quarter from my local bank. I then went to my local Bank of America branch, and handed them my mortgage payment in quarters and repayment stub. I asked for a reciept of payment. I over paid my mortgage to reduce the current balance and thereby reducing Bank of America's fees.\n\nThe nice branch manager said you can write a check you don't have to pay in coins. I said I could but I would charge a $9.5 convencie fee  for the stamp, my check and ink used. The branch manager actually laughed and said ok. They counted the money and I got my receipt.\n\nNext month the charge was still there, so I went to another local Bank of America Branch which had gotten bad reviews on Yelp due to a hostile bank manager. I did the same thing. The Branch manager said \"Write a check. We don't accept quarters\". I said shall I call the local state's Banking Commissioner, the Consumer Financial Protection Board, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (US Top bank regulator) and say you won't accept legal tender? I asked to talk to the district manager. I was making a stink. After about 20 minutes, he grudgingly had the staff count the quarters and I got a reciept. I told the manager that I would be bringing dimes next time.\n\nThe next month I brought dimes. He accepted them but glared at me the whole time.\n\nAfter that payment, Bank of America resinded their convience fee.\n\nThe month after that I refinanced my mortgage at a lower rate. Bank of America only got roughly 6 months of fees for servicing they expected to last 3 years at minimum. Five years to be profitable.\n\nOne of my proudest malicious compliance momemnts.",

I take the check to the bank and get everything set up.  I get my bank statement and there's a $5 charge to open the account since that was transaction #3 inside the bank.  I call CS and ask them to explain how I was suppose to open an account other than going inside.  No problem, they agree to remove the fee.   The next month I get my statement.

That couple did not have a mortgage, having the money on hand to pay it all up front, and they had not done the transaction through a Bank of America at any point in time.

            "For anybody wondering what an MSR (mortgage servicing right) is, I currently manage a MSR valuation model and have a little over a decade experience doing this. I felt the need to pipe in because one, who doesn't like to flex their knowledge in their given field, and two, there's some confusion in the original statement. I'll try to keep this brief and simple\n\nThe process of originating a mortgage creates two assets, the loan and a mortgage servicing right. The two assets can be sold wholly or separately. Generally, the loan is pooled into a mortgage backed security and sold to investors. The MSR is either retained by the originator of the mortgage or sold to a servicer. The owner is the MSR has the right and obligation to collect your principal and interest, and if you're escrowed, your taxes and insurance. The servicer receives a service fee for their efforts. The service fee has a range, however that doesn't depend on whether the loan is Fixed or Adjustable. A conventional conforming loan (sold to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac) has a minimum service fee of 0.25%. It can be more but a vast majority are sold at 0.25%. Loans sold to Ginnie Mae can have gross service fees ranging from 0.25% to 0.75% depending on the interest rate of the loan and some other pricing decisions. OP is correct that service fees are based on current unpaid principal balances.\n\nI can't comment on the MSR value OP quoted. Given this was apparently several years ago an $8K MSR would be pricey and the original mortgage amount would have to of been pretty large, probably at the conforming limit at the time in a high priced area. \n\nThe real kicker is there's always EPO protections written into the contracts between sellers and buyers of MSR's. There's a large market for this obviously, known as co-issue flow (and bulk but I'm trying to finish here). Anyways, EPO (early payoff protections) protect the buyer of an MSR from the losses OP is describing when a loan pay offs quickly after origination. These are typically 6 months but can certainly be longer. If OP paid off in the time frame they described, they likely screwed the broker they used to originate the loan, as the broker would have to reimburse BoA for the EPO.",

So we\u2019d receive hundreds of envelopes a day from, for example, Greensboro, each with a singular check inside. Each envelope cost about $16 to ship with the corporate rate. So, 100 envelopes per day would be $1600 for 100 checks. \n\nOne day, I had a batch to process and decided to see how many checks could fit into one envelope. It was 50. So that $1600 could be cut down to $32 a day. \n\nI sent an email. Apparently, no one had ever though of that before.  The company saved $500,000 the first two months and I got nada. \n\nBut that\u2019s Bank of America.",

            "Bank of America is the worst. I dealt with these clowns years ago with a previous mortgage on a former property. Like you, they bought out the previous loan, which was part of a refinancing grab on my part.

The last loan company said that they'd send the money to BoA, and I had proof of that, but BoA refused to honor it and dinged me a late fee. So not only did I lose $1800 in a mortgage payment, but added a $450 late fee. \n\nI eventually got that sorted out, and my late fee was refunded, but I had to keep visiting a branch to remind them I didn't owe them this money, and then I finally had to get a letter from the branch manager (which kept changing every visit, like really? Four managers in less than a year?) to that effect.  They put it on my credit report anyway as a \"missed payment,\" and it's still there. \n\nI ended up refinancing with my Federal credit union, which I should have done to begin with, but now I know.",
            "I bought my first house back in the 90's when getting a mortgage rate under 7% was hard and one of the ways to get a good rate was the Adjustable Rate Mortgage.  Although payments were structured as if it was a 30-year mortgage, banks limited their exposure by making it actually only a 7-year loan, after which a \"balloon payment\" for the balance was due, which in practical terms meant refinancing or converting it to a fixed-rate mortgage.  Our 2nd child had just been born and we decided we needed a bigger house, but with the way the timing was working out we were going to have to refinance the old house before we could close on selling it and buying the next house.\n\nAs most people know, you can 'buy down' your mortgage rate by paying extra up front at closing, but you can also do the opposite, taking a higher interest rate but getting the mortgage company to pay the financing costs.  So we did that, refinancing the house at the bank's expense while taking a higher interest rate....for about 6 weeks until we sold it.",

Class C vehicles were not defined in the HOA rules either.  I assume whoever wrote that rule assumed since they had a class c license, standard cars and trucks must be class C.\n\nSo I moved in, and after stuffing 2 cars, 4 motorcycles and my camper in my garage, I placed 5 vehicles in my driveway.\n\nThe letters came.  I was quickly able to deflate them after asking them for the legal definition of a class C vehicle.  No fines paid.\n\nFast forward about a year, and the HOA proposed a rule change.  Now stating \" 3 vehicles per driveway maximum,\"  Since 3 is more than one, and people lack critical thinking skills, it was passed with over 85% support.\n\nFine.  3 vehicles it is.  I did some digging and found the streets in my HOA were turned over to the city (an effort to avoid having to foot the maintenance bill I'm sure) and as such, the HOA had no authority to stop people from parking on a public street.\n\nSo I moved 2 vehicles the my very narrow street.  One in front of my house, and one directly across the street in front of my neighbors house.\n\nNow, the only vehicles that could safely drive past my home were motorcycles and the one guy with a smart car.\n\nIt was glorious.  My street is a main artery into and out of the neighborhood. Lots of uturns and backtracking for folks to get home or to work.\n\nThey are the ones who did the rest of the work for me.  Complaints and calls to the HOA president resulted in another rule change vote.  Now my driveway is open to any amount of legally registered vehicles.\n\nIt fits 9....  I need more cars :)",

But since there really wasn't a good definition of work vehicle everyone pretty much ignored it including ignoring the van of the guy who works for cable company.  Until new neighbor.  New neighbor moves in and she thinks it's unsightly (despite fact guy has lived in neighborhood and parked that van in his driveway for 14 yrs.  She complains, new HOA management co sends the guy a fine.  \n\nSo guy moves van from driveway and starts parking it on street every night.  New neighbor likes that even less.  So she calls management company again.  Management company sends another fine.  But this time guy was prepared. He'd already researched that because our streets are publicly dedicated the HOA has no say on what is parked on them.  As long as he is parked following township parking rules (ie no parking on fire hydrant side of street) there is nothing HOA can do. \n\nFunny we happen to have another neighbor who also lives right by new neighbor who is a truck driver and she paid storage fees to park the cab of her truck there rather than at her house.  When new neighbor started an uproar with cable guy neighbor and being a real pain truck driver neighbor started parking her empty truck cab on road as well when she wasn't driving.  \n\nAll legally parked with ability for emergency vehicles to get down the street I'm just loving sitting back and laughing at the hot mess annoying new neighbor has caused herself.",

My boss was a huge douche. All he did all day long was walk around and make sure everyone had their shirt tucked in. (and generally be a negative prick who everyone hated) No customers ever saw us, and we were secluded from every other department because we were really loud (if you have ever worked in outbound sales you know what i mean) There was literally no reason to tuck in shirts, but the boss for some reason thought this would help us sell better? (I was the top salesman on night shift, and 3rd overall in the company. It didnt help at all)\n\nSo I come into work on my birthday, and my friend runs up to me and yells \"redditingwhileworkin!!! happy bday!!!\" right in front of my bosses office. He looks up and says \"redditingwhileworkin!\" I'm thinking hes going to say happy bday since he no doubt heard her, instead he said \"yeah go ahead and tuck your shirt in k?\" and he does the hand signal like he's tucking in an imaginary shirt. So I say \"ok no prob, I just have to put my stuff down real quick and I'll take care of it.\" So I walk over to my desk, which takes approx 7 seconds to get to. I go to put my stuff down, and as I am he comes up behind me again and says \"hey I said to tuck in your shirt!\" So I quickly tuck it in, and as hes walking literally right by me i say \"sorry i just had to put my stuff down first\" and he walks by like I never said a word.\n\nImmediately, I bust out my HR manual, and check out the rule on tucked in shirts. Turns out you must tuck in all shirts EXCEPT a Hawaiian shirt or a \"Guayabera\" shirt. So right after work I take my ass to walmart, and buy 10 of those fuckers, and wear the most obnoxious Hawaiian looking shirt the next day. The second I walked in, he looked me up and down, glared, turned around and walked away. When everyone asked why I was wearing such a ridiculous shirt, I told them about the loophole, and within a week half my office was wearing hawaiian shirts. It drove my boss crazy...all within the guidelines outlined by company policy =)\n\nAs an update to the story from the last time i posted it, the boss eventually got fired for getting a blowjob from one of the girls in the call center while he was in his office. I had already moved on to another company by then, but when i heard i got a nice chuckle out of it.",

I brought this up to the principle after I was sent to his office for not tucking in my shirt and I explained to him it's not only in poor taste to tuck in this style of shirts, but they don't stay tucked because they were not designed with that in mind.

I also let the 'publicity' people in Corporate know about this charity event. \n\nBoss only saw the bad taste shirts and ties were becoming endemic through his department and issued another ruling banning the practice.  \n\nSomehow Corporate publicity got to find out that our charity events had finished because 'our boss had banned them'.

I was told y'all may enjoy the story :)\n\nI'm transgender, MtF, 23, and I was born and raised in Tennessee and they're not so lgbt friendly. Neither are my neighbors. Tennessee refuses to let me change my gender. Sucks, maybe one day I'll move somewhere else. idk if that'll let me change it since I have a TN birth certificate, but that's a question for another time.\n\nTennessee also has laws prohibiting women from going topless. Now, first off I will not post pictures for science. Second off I definitely have boobs. For all intents and purposes, when I go out jogging I pass as a woman. Someone recently outed me to my neighbors, and they have replied with several nasty letters and other such stuff, calling me a gay man and other bigoted garbage.\n\nSo my revenge was to jog around the neighborhood, topless. I don't see the problem- they're calling me a man, the state is calling me a man, walking around topless is allowed for men. But see, I win, because now they've called the cops saying a woman is running around topless in their neighborhood, oh god cover the childrens eyes boobs are evil. Suddenly I'm a woman. Nice logic you got there.\n\nAaaannnddd then I got a call from the cops, and they wanted to talk to me. As I was so well informed due to Better Call Saul and the top of all time page from /r/legaladvice, I told them I was busy, and I hung up. I later got another call and did not answer. This whole thing was actually kinda obnoxious I prefer a sports bra to hold them in place.\n\nIn the end, I talked to a lawyer, who thought it was hysterical, and we talked to the cops, who also thought it was hysterical, and we all agreed I wouldn't do it again. Apparently it technically is against the law, somehow, though my lawyer said he was sure the charges would be dropped. I decided not to fight it, cuz honestly I didn't want to end up being held in a men's prison. A couple of my neighbors actually got my point, surprisingly, and I've made a couple friends.\n\nThe rest of those grumpy bigots probably told their kids I'm satan :)",

            "Indecent exposure laws tend to be very dumb anyway. There are women who have argued that, because they had breast cancer, mastectomies, and surgically removed nipples, the law implicitly allows them to go topless because it only specifies the nipple and skin in relation to it. If the law considers you a man and only specifies laws against toplessness for women, there is no reason this should apply to you. If it applies to everybody it\u2019s fair game, though in that case I suspect transwomen would be disproportionately targeted among all people the law calls male.\n\nWhat a world.",

Delivered laptop 4 months later\n\nIn the early 90s I worked for an international airline company in the IT department as desktop support. \nI was the first woman in IT for that company ( and most companies in my country back then)\nThe company was located at an international airport and the company was housed in many buildings and airplane hangars spread across and around the airport.\n\nThe buildings I serviced where mainly the hangars meant for airplane maintenance.\nEvery 6 weeks we would order all the IT equipment that was requested,  stuff like specialised printers,  computers,  terminals etc.  My job was to take the equipment,  set it up and have the person responsible for said equipment to sign off on it.  If it wasnt signed off for whatever reason,  the equipment came back with me,  would be returned to the vendor and had to be reordered by the department.\n\nBeing a woman in her early twenties,  in a male oriented profession and dealing mostly with airplane maintenance men,  I had to deal with a lot of shit and mysoginy.\nFrom snickering men having set up their computers I was supposed to service, with hardcore porn screensavers to men refusing to let me touch their computers and demanding I get a male colleague to do it.\n\nMost if the time I just pretended not to have seen or heard what was going on,  finish setting up their hardware,  have it signed if and leave.  Until that one day I just had enough of their bullshit.\n\nThat day I had a trolly with me stacked with a bunch of printers and one laptop. Back then only management got a laptop and if one was delivered is was kind of a big deal.  Remember,  I'm talking about the windows 3.11 era.\n\nI walked into the airplane hangar with my stacked cart, setting up printers throughout while a team of airplane maintenance dudes where servicing a cargo plane.\nThe minute I walked in there was catcalling,  whistling and \"hey baby,  where you going with  all that heavy equipment.  As usual I ignored them and just ploughed on so I could get tf out of there.\n\nWhen I was done with the printers I had to go find this manager who had ordered the laptop and set it up for him.  Airplane hangars are weird places.  It seem to be one giant space with some glass offices just off the side,  but it does have all these nooks and crannies that seem to be nothing,  but are actually small offices or storage spaces.  It's hard to find the right place to be sometimes.\nSo I walk up to a bunch of maintenance guys that are just about to take a break and ask them where I can find Mr.  Manager dude when one of them goes \" hey baby,  you done with all the heavy stuff?  I'd like a black coffee with sugar and my colleague here wants an espresso\".  To the 5 or 6 other guys this was hilarious and they started shooting off how they wanted their coffees.  One of them actually brought out a tray and handed it to me telling me to be quick about it.\n\nI'd about had enough and a thundercloud must've been forming around my head because Mr.  Manager guy ( I asumed,  because he was, wearing a suit),  who just walked around the corner snickers goes \" aww,  what's up sweety,  got your period ?\".  Ofcourse this was heartily laughed at by all the other guys.\n\nI asked Mr manager guy if he wanted coffee too and which kind.  I can't remember what kind it was,  but I took my cart with the laptop on it,  drive it to the coffee machine,  made all the coffees,  drive it back over  and handed everyone their coffee order.\nWhen I handed Mr.  Manager guy his coffee he said \" OK honey,  let's go i'll show you my office so you can set up my new laptop.\"\nI looked him in the eye,  smiled and told him \"I can't, as I'm late for my next appointment with all the coffee orders, I really have to run.  Unfortunately your laptop will have to be returned and you will have to reorder one.  So I will see you in 6 weeks.  Bye!\n\nOfcourse he tried to tell me he reaaaaaally needed that laptop now,  and the coffee thing was all in good fun and I shouldn't be so sensitive blahblah blah.  When I just kept on walking with my cart it turned ugly pretty soon. I was a b*tch and he was going to have me fired.  Did I have any idea who he was etc. I just silently chucked everything in the car and drive off with him screaming after me. \n\nHe did try to get me fired,  but my manager had my back and made sure his reorder was \"delayed\" a few times to teach him a lesson.\nWhen I finally delivered his laptop 4 months later he was very respectfull though.\n\nUnfortunately it wasn't the last time I had to deal with this kind of shit. \n\n\nEdit: grammar\n\nEdit to the edit: Holy shirtballs this is cool :)  I posted at 2am,  went to bed and all you amazing ppl are here with my morning coffee :)  Thank you all for the kind words,  its so much appreciated. You rock! \nOoh and my first reddit gold And plat!!! Thank you very much kind strangers!\n\nAlso,  not a native speaker,  so forgive my grammar. Also,  I hate apostrophies, I let autocorrect handle that shit and it doesnt do a very good job.",

            "> Being a woman in her early twenties, in a male oriented profession and dealing mostly with airplane maintenance men, I had to deal with a lot of shit and mysoginy. From snickering men having set up their computers I was supposed to service, with hardcore porn screensavers to men refusing to let me touch their computers and demanding I get a male colleague to do it.\n\nsome years back in another sub there was a post asking why there should be programs that support women getting in the IT. I chipped in, saying the only way to break the whole 'I asked for an IT professional, not some girl' attitudes was just to have more women in the field. I was met with a lot of opinions, saying nothing prevented us going there. I told some anecdotes of my own career, where I'm the most senior around and a sexist customer rather has the male trainee to answer questions than ask me. But apparently I'm just 'too sensitive' about it all. I just wished I could take everything I've experienced over the years and somehow transmit all that into someone's brain after such argument and see how it feels like to always fight the uphill battle.",

            "Here's a little tip for one use of apostrophes that autocorrect will probably never be able to figure out: when to use \"its\" vs. \"it's\".\n\n\"It's\", with an apostrophe, is a contraction for \"it is\". The apostrophe in a contraction represents that letters have been removed from one of the words that combined to form the contraction, and the apostrophe goes in the place where those letters had been. As a rule to help remember this, **contractions always have an apostrophe.**\n\n\"Its\", without an apostrophe, is a possessive pronoun meaning \"belonging to it\". A lot of people get confused because they think that possessives always have an apostrophe, but that's not true - think about other possessive pronouns: his, hers, ours, theirs. None of them use apostrophes, either. As a rule to help remember this, **possessive pronouns never have an apostrophe.**",

Until she got to one bank account that was only in Bill's name, not a joint account with both of them.\n\nDespite having the death certificate, will, and other documentation required, the bank absolutely would not let Frankie close Bill's account. But for whatever reason, they would allow her to withdraw money.\n\nBeing the type to not suffer fools, Frankie withdrew all but $0.01 from the account. The next day, she got a call from the bank's branch manager explaining there were minimum balance requirements, and the bank account would be subject to a service fee if it didn't have a certain amount of money in it at the end of each month.\n\n\"No problem,\" Frankie tells the manager, \"just let me close the account.\"\n\n\"We can't let you close an account in someone else's name,\" the manager says.\n\nAt this point, Frankie realizes that it doesn't affect her if a bank account in someone else's name goes negative because of service fees. The manager won't budge and neither will she, so the next month, the account goes negative after the bank assesses a $2 service fee.\n\nThat was 17 years ago. The bank still calls her from time to time to ask her to bring the account back into the black, but when she asks about closing the account and they tell her only Bill can close it, she promptly hangs up on them and goes back to playing bridge with her friends.",

            "Do you live in the USA? I have 2 laws for you.\n\nFirst one is, a bank fee cannot be the reason a bank account goes negative. A bank fee can take you to 0, NOT negative. However, once it is negative, they can make it go further negative. That very first bank fee that took it negative was illegal. Wells Fargo tried that crap with me and a lawyer took my case for free, because he said all he had to do was print up 1 paper and sign it, that I could pay for the stamp if I wanted because that's all it cost him. Wells Fargo KNEW they were breaking the law and dropped my case instantly when I got a lawyer.\n\nThe second one is, debtors privacy laws. A debt collector cannot TELL a person that another person has a debt. It's a federal crime to do so. Get a call recorder and INFORM the debt collector that you are recording the call. Let them say \"Bob owes us money\" on the recording and BAM interrupt them and inform them they just broke federal law, you are not Bob, and you are sending this recording to the FTC.

            "a few years ago i got a call from the cemetery where mother is resting, its the family plot, she was the owner of the plot, when she died years ago i arranged all the services and funeral, so i went to the cemetery to do all the arrangements for the burial and also change the owner of the plot to my name, since i was the only beneficiary of everything my mother owned, i had all the documentation for it, but they didn't change it why? don't know, at least when i requested it all that they said they had changed it.\n\nwell time passes by and i get a call from the cemetery services requesting the anual maintenance fee for the plot, its not expensive at all, its like $30 us dollars, everything was ok for a few years but one year the cemetery contacted me asking to speak with my mother, she has been dead for 6 or 7 years at that point.\n\nso in a completely calm voice i answer, \"its going to be hard to speak to her, maybe you can try but i cant guarantee an answer, she is probably in the plot right now as we speak,  since she has been buried there for 6 years.\"\n\nthe girl on the call only said \" am sorry\" and hang up, i did end up paying the maintenance fee a few days later, but that morning i had a good laugh because of this.",

He went to close it and they wanted him to jump through a bunch of hoops. So he just said screw it and let it sit. \n\nThat was well over 20 years ago and to my knowledge he still gets statements for that account mailed to him regularly. It has undoubtedly cost the bank more in postage than the account is worth. Obviously not making any difference to the bank, but it is so ridiculous.",

            "I'm having a hard time with this story. I feel like there has to be more to it... or less. They keep calling her? I think, as previously stated, they wouldn't allow her to close it because she didn't provide the short certificate naming her as executor or set up a formal estate account. The withdrawals are super shady and sound illegal, but calling off and on for 17 years? The account is charged off after a certain amount of time, meaning that the negative balance (which would only be in fees) would likely be less than $10. I know that sometimes banks can be heartless jerks, but they still have a lot of laws and regulations they have to follow.",

            "I work at a bank.  (Locally owned and operated, so nothing as hellish as Fells Wargo.)\n\nMy advice to Frankie?  Find out the negative balance, make a deposit for EXACTLY that amount, and just wait.  In many places, a zero-dollar balance after a certain amount of time (sometimes 24 hours, sometimes overnight) will automatically close the account in their teller system.  If she takes it to a teller or mails it in (using a check/money order, because you shouldn't mail cash), they should make the deposit without a second thought.\n\nIn fact... if mobile deposit is an option, it'll get past the radar of any human until it's Too Late.\n\nOnce it's closed on the teller system, it won't pop up as an issue.  And they can't gather fees on it, because it'll just bounce back.  And if they force re-open it, they'll have to answer to auditors.\n\nIt may cost her a couple of bucks, but it's a neat little workaround.",
            "This is definitely not true. Banks that comply with US law (which means almost all banks) are required to close dormant accounts after a specific time. I can tell you that 17 years is definitely not within those \u201cspecific times\u201d.",

            "Hmmm - ex-banker here.  There are rules in place to protect things when someone dies.  Unless the account had a POD on it no one should have access to that money unless it goes through the courts.  While this may seem inconvenient imagine if someone was in a will to inherit that money and someone else went it and accessed the funds (think ATM card, Debit card, etc) and that person who was set to inherit was left with an empty account.

            "In order to successfully transfer/manage/close a bank account, several letters and certificates are required. (This is for Texas)\n\nFirst is the deceased's death certificate. Second is the successor's birth certificate stating who they are. \n\nThe third, in which I don't see in the posting, is a Letter of Testamentary. This is a document granted to the Executor of an estate by the probate court.  The letter will enable the Executor (your grandmother) to take full control of any and all of her late husband's estate, including bank accounts.  Some states may require a letter of probate instead or in conjunction to the aforementioned document.\n\nFor the insurance, retirement funds, and other investments, other documents that are specialized to those fields will be required, needing the assistance of your bank, stock broker, or financial advisor.\n\nThis bank manager is not being very helpful in this matter.\n\nIf this happened to me, I'd smile and ask politely for the bank president or their lawyer to discuss what is required to take control of the accounts.  Fortunatly, father was an Prudential Insurance Agent and a good one. So I got taught the ways and means of insurance and financial matters at the investor level.",
