        "selftext": "For background, this took place in the 1990\u2019s when a T1 (1.5 Mbps data connection) would run you over $500 a month and only the phone company and a few very large, data-centric companies would even dream of having a T3 (43 Mbps)\n\nI was working for one of those telephone companies in the central office where we provisioned and trouble-shot those very lucrative services. There were 4 people in my department, making it one of the larger such office in the state. One day there was one person on vacation, and another one out of the office for some other reason, tech #3 called in sick. I was alone for 8 hours with the workload of 4 technicians. Well, as a good employee, I prioritized and got all the trouble tickets done, and all of the most urgent new services installed. Everything due that day was done. But in the process I missed my two 15- minute breaks, and worked through lunch. \n\nMy supervisor came down at the end of the day to congratulate me for my good work, and he was watching me fill out my timesheet for 9 hours. He started to get a little panicky, and said he couldn\u2019t approve overtime. He would get in trouble. I reminded him that I had just spent 9 hours doing the work of 4 people (32 hours worth of work) But he said it wasn\u2019t approved. I said, what can we do then? I worked it, I need to get paid. He suggested I leave an hour early on Friday. So I agreed. \n\nCome Friday, I decided to take full advantage and only take a half hour lunch so I could leave at 3:30 instead of 4:00. We\u2019ll guess what? The vacationer and the sick person had not returned so it was just two of us. The other person disappeared at 1:30 or so. I found out later she was interviewing for a management position. \n\nAt 3:00 I got paged for a ticket on one of those very expensive T3\u2019s \u201cdown hard\u201d I was to join a conference bridge to assist in troubleshooting. I joined the call, then at 3:25 I said, sorry, I have to drop off. I\u2019m not approved for any overtime. The night shift person will be here in a half hour to help.\u201d  I dropped off, knowing the night person on duty had never worked on a T3 before. \n\nI hadn\u2019t even reached my car when the pager started blowing up. Overtime is approved, please stay on.  But I had already clocked out and so I just smiled and got into my car. Drove home and took my wife out for a long overdue date night.\n\nEdit: for those of you who followed me based on the strength of this one post, thanks but you\u2019re sure to be disappointed.

            "I worked a factory job in the shipping department during the 90s. We came across this \"no overtime\" policy so 42 hours and 30 minutes was deemed the max. I was moved to a hybrid shift 9:30 to 6 with a 30 minute lunch. It was supposed to be a promotion to an assistant shipping manager but more a punishment.  I had been getting over 50 hours a week with overtime so this was a cut. Worked well for me cause I could take my son to school, run a few errands, stuff like that.  After a few weeks I was being called in earlier or having to stay later since trucks were late. It got to the point I was hitting 40 hours by noon Thursday then clocking out by 230. Management started .Essington with my schedule  - start later Thursday and Friday, longer lunch, adding a Monday off then working a base 4-10. After a few months the company decided a night shift was better. I went back to me 7AM to 4PM and got transferred to another department. Few months later they wanted me to move back since Shipping Manager and night shift were caught stealing product by the pallet load.",

I'm sure over the years the story has been embellished a bit, but the core of the story is told exactly as it happened.\n\nI've worked in K-12 Education technology most of my 20+ years in my professional career.  When I first started I was the only technician for a small/medium school district (2500 or so students).  During the time of this event, the Director of Special Education (SPED) was married to the Superintendent.  I reported to the business manager who used to teach technology but was not a technical person.  For the most part I was left to do my work and was not overly micro-managed.  So I got into a habit of taking my lunch whenever I felt like it or even not at all.  If I didn't take lunch and there was no pressing work I would just leave a little early at the end of the day.  Of course I made sure all the schools were out before I left.\n\nAs time goes on I got in trouble for leaving early.  So I would take my lunch whenever time permitted - sometimes it was when there was only an hour left from work, sometimes not.  But I would chill at my desk and just screw off.  The others in the office where my desk was reported me for screwing off every afternoon.  When I tried to explain to the business manager that I was taking my lunch she says something to effect of \"You can longer take you lunch whenever you want, your lunch is from 12:00 to 1:00.\"  I say, no problem, message received.  So starting that day no matter what I was doing, at 12:00 I would stop what I was doing and take my lunch.  If I was at my desk I would screw off, if I was at a school site, I would go sit in my car.\n\nFast forward a month or two latter, at about 11:30 the Director of SPED calls and says his computer is not working and I need to come fix it right away.  I say sure thing, on my way.  When I get to his office, he says please fix it and heads off to a meeting.  So I start in on removing all spyware he has managed to collect (at this time all employees were local admins on their desktops).  About 1/3 of the way through 12:00 hits.  I stand up and walk out of his office and tell his secretary I'll be back in an hour.\n\nOut to my car I go; expecting a phone call any minute and sure enough about 15 minutes in I get a phone call from the business manager.  Here's about how the call goes:\n\n(BM: Business manager, my boss; and Me)\n\nBM:  I hear you walked out of the SPED Directors Office without fixing his computer\n\nME: Correct, it is my lunch time.\n\nBM: What do you mean, you couldn't fix his computer first?\n\nME: I could have, but you told me that I could not decide when my lunch break was, that I had to take lunch from 12:00 to 1:00.\n\nBM: Wait, that's not what I meant.\n\nME: But that is what you said.  If I stayed and worked on the computer and took my lunch at 1:00 or 1:30, I did not want to get in trouble for screwing off when I was supposed to be working.\n\nBM: OK, I'll call you back.\n\nShe calls back about 15 minutes later asking if I can please go back in and finish his computer and from now on I can decide when the best time to take my lunch.  And it was never talked about again.  It was nice being able to go home early when I didn't my lunch again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR:  I am told exactly when I am to take my lunch.  Until a director (who is married to the Superintendent) wants his computer fixed during my lunch time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit2:  Thank you kind redditor(s) for my very first awards, Silver and Gold!.",

            "Working walmart, especially cashier or electronics, this would happen a lot. Per walmart, and state policy, must take a lunch after working 6 hours. When I was a cashier, I would try to tell them but depending on the cms, they would ignore me. So I started not reminding them. When I got called in for breaking the 6 hour rule, I pointed out that I cant leave my spot unless told so. The csm never released me. Last argument we had on that.\n\n\nWhen I move to electronics, it was very much the same thing especially as I was the only worker in the department. At first, again, I would call CSM or a manager to watch the department but I was told to just go when I needed or they wouldn't respond at all.  Again, when I got called in for leaving the department empty, I would tell them no one would respond or I was told to just go. They ended up deciding that it would be best if i just go but i had to respond to calls. Which started the third malicious compliance. \n\nPer policy, if you are interrupted at any point during your break, you start your break over. Doesn't matter if you were at minute 1 or 14, if you were bothered by work related items, restart break. So of course, they called me out for not working, taking too many breaks or too long of breaks. I pointed out that I would get called mid break, sometimes by management, to work so I started my break all over again. They eventually just left me alone. \n\nNot malicious compliance but I would tell new managers that once you've been here a year, then I'll remember your name. They of course didn't like it but I had more years of experience with Walmart then most of them and it was like a revolving door with management\n\nEdit-spelling errors and making it easier to read.",

We soon stopped being flexible with our time, the give and take arrangement and good will having been destroyed.

I had to speak to him in a rather frank tone about how I would love to take my lunch at a more practical time and asked him if he was okay with me leaving a customer hanging for an hour. Our business was IT repair so usually when we were responding to a call it was because something was broken and they needed it working yesterday.

When I first joined the company, I noticed that there was an inbuilt timer in the software which you can start/stop to get accurate logs, but I asked my bosses and other employees around, and everyone told me that no one uses it, and everyone fills in the log EOD or first thing in the morning next day. I was cool with that.\n\nSo I started logging my time just like everyone else. Things were fine for quite a while, till I started putting in more and more hours to get work done. Fast forward to that fateful day, I get called by management. They tell me that my logging seems \"dishonest\" and \"deliberately misleading\". I got told off saying they rely on these numbers to plan deadlines for the future (only on paper, not in practice) and that I'm cheating the company. They instructed me to only use the timer next day on, and nothing else. \n\nI should probably mention that the way I logged time till then was rounded down to 30 minute increments, just out of personal preference. For example, if a meeting lasted 45 minutes, I'd more often than not log 30 mins. On top of that, I used to remove an hour off the top just as an eyeball figure for lunch and smoke breaks, because on avg that's how long it took. And I should add that everyone, including my bosses, used to log time similarly. The company had trusted us to not be dishonest with it, and generally it worked out fine. \n\nAnyway, that day on, I started using the timer for everything. 10 minute briefing? Going in the log. 5 minute company call? Logged. Started eating in 15 mins instead of 30, cut down smoke breaks from two to one, etc. Basically, I made sure almost every minute between my in and out times would be accounted for. They also maintained a timestamp of all the times someone enters and exits the office, which they combined with the log to check. I made sure I was not being dishonest in any way, and just logging my actual work times.\n\nAs you can guess, all the 11 hour overtime days piled up pretty quick, and at the end of the month, I got called by management again. My boss and his boss were both there. My boss was furious, demanding to know how my overtime hours had nearly doubled from previous months. I just said I don't know, I'm using the timer just like I was instructed to. I told them to go through my in and out times, my breaks, my deliverables, and when the timer was started and stopped to check if I was being dishonest or not. They sent me away after yelling at me a bit more, threatening termination if I was wrong. \n\nNext day, my boss told me to stop using the timer again, and apologised for calling me dishonest. I stopped using it, but I told him that now I knew more accurately how long my stuff takes, so I'll be logging accordingly even if I do so manually. \n\n**TL;DR: Comapny assumes I am being dishonest with my time logging because of long working hours, ask me to use inbuilt timer, which actually ends up showing more hours than I was logging before.**\n\n**EDIT:** Wow I've read almost every reply. Thanks to everyone who started a discussion about fair pay, ethics of working hours and how to manage projects. I'd just like to add a couple things, because I don't think I made them clear. I don't work there anymore first of all, and I'm salaried. Hourly pay doesn't happen in these parts at all, unless to you're freelancing, sometimes not even then. The logging was more for getting leaves based on x hours you put in over your usual time.\n\nAlso, i found out later why they were this mad at me was because they knew after I'd tell people, everyone's leaves would go up, and us being understaffed at the time it wouldn't have been great for the company.

Then I would get bitched at because my projects were not getting done quick enough.  So I started documenting all my tasks using the old Outlook journaling feature, and the next time he bitched about my projects, I sent the logs and went over them with him...\"Today you pulled me to work on help calls for six hours\"...etc.  I also asked if I should start sending the logs to his superiors as well.    \n\n\nNever heard anything about it again.",

I work at an automotive repair shop/small used car dealership as the only real mechanic and we log our time on paper with start time, finish time, projects, etc. \n\nI\u2019d usually just round to the nearest hour or 30 minute increments but eventually my boss (who unfortunately lives in a house on the lot property) tried to accuse me of showing up 3 minutes late and telling me that I was essentially stealing from him. I work Monday through Friday from 6am to 2pm and if I showed up at, lets say 5:53am, I\u2019d write down 6am, it wasn\u2019t a big deal to me. If I left at 2:13pm, I\u2019d just write 2pm as the time that I left.\n\nAfter his bogus accusation I started logging my time down to the minute. It turned out that I was cheating my self from 2 to 4 hours of overtime each week! For a couple of weeks my boss was suspicious of when I\u2019d arrive and I could see him standing in his front window watching when I pulled into the lot. After I caught on to this I would shine my flash light at him when I\u2019d get out of my car to indicate that I knew where he was and what he was doing. At the end of the day I got to his office and tell him, \u201cIt\u2019s 2:17 and I\u2019m leaving for the day\u201d.\n\nHe finally got annoyed and didn\u2019t want to hear what time it was every day when I left and shortly after I didn\u2019t see him watching the lot every morning.

I should mention at this point they were fairly strict that we do no overtime, so once we hit ~40 hours we went home. It just so happened that the week the dev team logged, was the most meetings we'd had since they started dragging the devs into them.\n\nI personally spent 30 hours that week in meetings.\n\nLiterally the next week they stopped all developers going to meetings unless it was critical we were there.

            "I worked for a small appliance repair company way back when. The owner thought the tech guys were cheating him out of hours (they were.) I was the office manager. I suggested an actual punch time clock. He asked me to find us a time clock online so I did. It arrived about a week later. Yay eBay (my boss was super impressed, this was back in '04.) The boss said I could clock in and out using the time clock too if I wanted because he knew I wasn't logging all of my hours. So I did. Turns out I was working 20 plus overtime each and every week! We had no idea. I wasn't being paid for it. I would mentally clock myself (on the honor system) out but then stay there at the shop doing whatever. I'd also do work from home ALOT and on my days off. Once we got the time clock, it made myself and the owner aware. I made so much money those last few weeks we were open. Unfortunately my boss, the owner of the appliance repair shop had no business owning any type of business. The reason I was working 60+ plus hours a week at 20 years old is because I was running his business. Which I wasn't really qualified to do. It flunked. I loved that job though. I loved my technicians. I loved that boss. ",

            "Working in IT, I have dealt with this once or twice in help desk environments. This one place I worked briefly was especially heavy handed with their time logging requirements. If I fell even a few minutes short of 8 hours on my time log in the ticketing system, I would get called into the boss' office and basically have to sing for my dinner. They would actually ask me shit like, \"We're paying you for 8 hours, why does your time sheet say 7 hours and 45 minutes?\" At first, I really tried to account for all of my time as accurately as I could, but logging time for a walk to the water cooler, or to grab a snack, or just a 2-minute sanity break between phone calls was actually causing me mental distress, so I just let it be. At the end of the day, as long as I felt like I worked hard and was productive, I wasn't going to beat myself up over 15 minutes of undocumented time. Still, the daily bombardment from management continued.\n\nI got so pissed off by about the third week that I started answering their bullshit questions with questions like, \"Have you ever had to poop in the middle of the day?\" \"Do you really want me to log time in your system for a bowel movement?\" \"If I was talking to Billy about his weekend plans for 5 minutes, do you want a detailed play-by-play of the conversation?\" What's worse is that most of the other guys on the help desk would often go into the back room and play ping-pong (yes, they had a ping-pong table, and I was amazed at the irony of them presenting a culture of fun and games, but then getting uppity about 15 minutes). So, either a)  these guys were held to a different standard, b) they were lying on their time logs to absorb their \"ping-pong\" time, or c) they were actually logging time for ping-pong, which was somehow more acceptable than nothing at all.\n\nNeedless to say,  I quit after 4 weeks.

Complained to her management had me start logging all hours, and met with me to discuss the drop in clients.\n\nAt this point I made clear that although the number of clients in the database was down from 200 to around 170, that 60 of those clients had already left when I started the role, in the period my manager had been doing the job I had. So in reality I had grown the client base by 20% in around 6 months. I also started logging every hour of work done and the quickly realised I didn\u2019t have enough hours in the contract to meet the requirements as stuff was going unfinished. Senior management ended up very unimpressed with my line manager and then my line manager was very unimpressed with me as a result.\n\nIn the end I left when I had booked a holiday off months in advanced.

            "I get frustrated when people put in overtime without claiming it.  I also get frustrated when people claim overtime without approval. \n\nThe thing is I want my staff to have a reasonable work schedule, this makes them healthier and more productive. I don't think it's healthy to be putting in 11 hour days. \n\nIf people are working unclaimed overtime, it messes with my expectations of what can be done in a day. If you're the only person in the office that's not putting in 11 hour days and everyone else is unknown to me, I might look at how much work you're getting through and say that you need to step it up, pressuring you to work overtime.  This might not be a matter of productivity either, it might be a scheduling issue.  You might be more productive than the other people who work 11 hours, but maybe I have been asking you to do 3 hours of work at the end of the day which is impossible to do because you're being interrupted during work hours, so the only way to get that 3 hours of work done daily is to do it after. \n\nBut the answer to that isn't to work 11 hours and get paid 3 hours of overtime daily. For every 2 people working 3 hours overtime I could hire a whole additional person. 3 people working 8 hours days are going to be more productive than 2 people working 11 hour days, unless I've made things impossible for the schedule provided.\n\nLike if I'm running, say, a coffee shop, and I put a strict requirement to clean the espresso machine thoroughly every day and that takes 2 hours and I schedule you for an 8 hour shift from 2PM to 10PM, and the store closes at 10PM, and I say that anyone can buy a latte at 10PM, I've made it impossible for you to not work overtime if I make you responsible for cleaning the machine because sometimes people will order a latte at 10PM.\n\nIf everyone before you just does that and leaves at midnight and clocks out at 10PM, and you are a new employee and argue for overtime pay from 10 till 12, I'll be surprised because nobody else does that. \n\nBut if everyone argues for overtime pay, or if I'm made aware that nobody cleans the machine or finishes correct closing procedures because their shift is over, then I realize that I have made a mistake in scheduling. \n\nThe problem that often comes up is that too often people think they're doing something good by not accounting for their time.  But they're not.  OP acts like they were too.  OP acts like they were doing some noble service by not properly billing for his time.\n\nBut OP and probably other employees were actually working OT and not claiming it completely. Management wasn't aware of it. When they see OP's partial OT claim, they want him to prove it. This is evidence that they're unaware that the OT is taking place.  The accurate reporting requirements show that this is the case.\n\nThe thing is, management should expect that you are reporting accurately. You weren't reporting accurately.  It's reasonable to take offense to the fact that your OT amounts doubled when you started using the timer, because this makes 2 situations likely.  Either you have been consistently lying about your times by underreporting, or you took offense to the request to properly report your times so you have been padding it since then.   \n\nIt's likely they figured you were padding your numbers, because often times people with authority are not afraid to demand what they are owed or more, so they have an expectation that other people feel the same way.  It doesn't really make sense to them that you would work OT without claiming it accurately.  It's more likely to them that you might start rounding up when you take offense. \n\nThe next day your boss had an opportunity to find out that you weren't padding the numbers.  This might be the first time he became really aware that you or your co-workers were working overtime. He maybe had you stop using the tool not entirely because of the additional time you accrued when you used it, but because the amount of detail you provided with so much start and stop times was a bit annoying to manage. He would expect you to continue to submit accurate times. And with more accurate time reporting, he might be eager to consider or able to justify changes to scheduling or expectations to minimize overtime. \n\nIt's your responsibility to report accurately. It's also generally your responsibility to get approval or direction to work overtime, rather than have it be at your discretion. This idea of not claiming the OT you worked hurts your fellow co-workers, and it hurts the business generally, as it potentially creates liability if they are required to pay you that they may be unaware of.  It sets expectations and fails to encourage action to change the situation. \n\nYou were being dishonest with your time logging. Your boss was angry not because you had overtime, but because you had more overtime than normal when you timed it accurately, because previously you had been dishonest with your time logging. \n\nIt's probably also worthwhile to have a discussion with him about how you can reduce the amount of overtime that you're doing. Maybe there's after hour meetings that don't need to be called, maybe there are activities you should be turning down, maybe they should be able to finance another position when not having to pay so many people OT rates.

            "Similar thing happened to my wife years ago. She was working at a post secondary residential school for young adults with developmental disabilities. Her position was a live in position so she was on campus pretty much around the clock.\n\nThe other side to this was if she was at work and needed to get something from home, she could just shoot over to her apartment and grab it. Management didn't like this, so they clamped down on them. Said any time they needed to go to their apartment, they needed to document it as a 30 minute break (in reality, should have handled it as a \"hey can we stop doing this so much\" conversation instead of making a whole thing of it).\n\nSo of course my wife, and her then roommate, we're incredibly annoyed with how the situation was handled. So, as their manager requested, they began documenting their time totally accurately. \n\nWhat management didn't account for, is that being on campus, students were going to them for all kinds of things around campus (got locked out, can't get the dryer to work, my toilet is clogged, etc.), and they were just doing these odd jobs essentially as a favor (social services people. Not there for the money, they're there to help people). After they started clocking these hours, they realized they were shorting themselves nearly 10 hours a week (the policy was any time you have to clock in, even for a minute, it goes down as 30 minutes worked). Needless to say, not long after they implemented an \"on call\" designation for the students to get ahold of.",
            "Similar thing happened to me.\n\nI was a salaried employee, and it was customary to take an occasional day off as compensatory time in exchange for the occasional necessary extra days worked.  As the company was notoriously slow in filling vacancies, and our position was necessary for regulatory compliance, we tended to work many more days than we were allowed to take off.  Our position had a lot of responsibility and we were compensated with generous salaries.  I loved the job, and the extra time didn't really bother me that much.\n\nSome penny-pinching, bean counting idiot decided that we were taking advantage of the system by taking too many days off and made up an Excel sheet that we were expected to use to log our time. We were insulted, but we logged our time religiously.  There were emergencies that required extra time, unfilled vacation time that required us to work our days off, etc.  For a couple of years, it was almost impossible to get time off, but we kept the Excel sheets up as the uncompensated days built up.\n\nFast forward to the company being sold.  The new owners were concerned about our accumulated extra days.  Our legal department called, asking for copies of our Excel sheets, which showed most of us with hundreds of hours of uncompensated time (we were salaried, so we never really expected to be paid.)\n\nWe were all issued checks (at straight time) for the accumulated extra days worked.  Woo hoo!    Uncle Sam and the state took the lion's share, but it was still unexpected money in five figures for each of us, thanks to some bean counter that didn't trust us when we took an occasional day off for a dentist appointment.

My\nMother lives state side and is a manager aver about 50 employees in Germany. They all worked us style schedules (meaning long days when needed, short days when opportunity allowed and nights/weekends if something arose). Well she fought so hard to ban those from the computers because she knew productivity was down and the company was about no overtime to cut costs. Lo behold her employees productivity dropped 40% because they weren\u2019t able to work when they needed to and their projects would get cut short most days.

            "I have a story. When I started my masters program with full scholarship, one of the scholarship terms said we needed to have \"full-time dedication\", which is equivalent to 40 hours/week. Scholarship students had this monthly report in which we wrote the time we clocked in and out everyday, as well as what we did in one or two lines. At the end of the month, we handed it to our supervisor, they'd sign it and send it to the secretary.\n\nIt turns out masters and PhD students don't work like usual employees. Sometimes, things can be even worse. There were days I'd clock 14 hours between 2 projects I participated on campus, or I could work mornings and afternoons and have classes in the evenings, which would easily count as at least 10 hours.\n\nSince I was scared shitless of losing my scholarship, I made sure I got clear instructions on what counted as work hours and all of that counted as work hours. I also made sure to never lie, thinking they could try to find excuses to screw with me. In my first month, my advisor called me telling me the school found my report unacceptable, because I was only allowed to clock a maximum of 10 hours a day and a total of 44 hours/week. They told me I should \"fix\" my report. I asked him if I was supposed to lie to get my report accepted. He said yes.\n\nFrom that point on I filled every single day in the exact same way: clock in at 1 pm, clock out at 10 pm. In six months they deemed the report was unnecessary and students were no longer needed to fill it.",

It also wasn't really worth nickle-and-diming the time, since the system was a hassle to use.\n\nMy manager poorly worded an email to me (accusatory tone, *actually* not intentional on his part) about how he thought it seemed inaccurate because he arrived after I'd left one morning, but before I had logged as gone. Now I log every minute, *and* take a lunch, and it turns out I work more than I'm \"supposed\" to. I work a 12-hour shift, time-and-a-half over 8 hours, double time over 12. I make double time every day. And I stare at a wall in a random dark office for 30 minutes of it.\n\nMy manager doesn't bring up time recording, anymore.",

Hats were restricted but scarves weren't.\n\nOne of our coworkers had cancer and that woman never missed a shift with six months of chemotherapy. When she started losing her hair she began wearing hats. The whole department began wearing hats in solidarity. Supervisors supported all of us, some donning hats as well.

        "selftext": "This incident took place in India, in the early 90s.\n\nThe School where my sister & I had studied was in my hometown. We knew almost all the teachers since they were practically our neighbours.\n\nWhen it came to the time I graduated from school, the Principal had retired and the Vice Principal took over as the principal.\n\nThe Vice-Principal was also from the same town and for some unknown reason had some sort of grudge against my father. In local gatherings etc he would always try to belittle my father at all chances he could get. My father would normally let it pass since he knows that getting into silly arguments with such a bully is totally unproductive.\n\nWhen my sister and I had joined the school, my father was required to pay a refundable deposit of 5,000 per child, which would be returned back at the time each child graduated from the school. \n\n**10,000 Rupees of 90s was a large amount then and is equivalent to 95,000 Rupees of the present time.** \n\nI graduated in 1989. When my father enquired about the refund, the VP had informed him that since my sister would be graduating in 1 year's time, both the deposits would be returned together. \n\nSo, when my sister graduated from school, my father requested the school to refund both the deposits. There was no response even after two weeks and my father personally went to the school to demand the refund. The VP, being the egotistical bully, started arguing with my father stating that the school cant refunds the deposits. The Argument became very heated and he outright refused point blank and said\n\n**\"We are not returning the deposits. Do what you can. You can take us to court if you want!\"**\n\nMy father went silent, got up and left the school, came home, sat down with mom, went through all the school-related documents she had kept (my mom had a very meticulous documentation system. she used to save every receipt, bill, stub etc)\n\nHe found the receipts for the deposits. he took them to his Lawyer friend. My dad informed his friends (whose children were in the same school) about the issue.\n\nThe Lawyer filed the case and took the school to court. The school couldn't provide any reason for withholding the deposits and fighting with the parent.   \nMy dad won.  \n**The school was instructed to pay back the deposits with interest and the court dues.**\n\nMy father's friends who were in the PTA took up the issue in the subsequent PTA meeting and got the school's trustee board to ensure that such issues won't be dealt with in the same manner and all deposits will be refunded in time and strictly warned the VP not to bring personal grudges into school business. Other parents who were owed deposits but had forgotten about it, starts claiming them. Cost the school a lot, to pay back the deposits.\n\nTLDR: VP of school informs that they won't refund the \"refundable\" Security deposits and challenges my dad to do what he can, that he can ever take them to court. My dad does take them to court, wins the dues with interest. VP gets reprimanded by the trustee board and PTA. Other parents start claiming the deposits too.",

But my job was very low paying, so I was putting out feelers for something better, and a couple opportunities turned up in Boston. When I discussed this with my friends, one of them, \"Dave\" (nhrn) said, \"You can't do that; it'll be like you're dead!\"\n\nWe were taken aback by that, so he explained, \"If you move six hours away, you'll make new friends, and we'll never hang out all the time like we do now. We might see each other once in a while, but otherwise you'll be totally gone from our lives!\"\n\nI didn't end up moving, but we ribbed him about it sometimes, saying that he could hold seances (i.e., use the phone or write) to contact us once we had passed. So ... guess which one of us DID move, to a city five hours away, two years after graduation!\n\nWe had a going away party scheduled. I consulted with my other friends, then went to a masonry shop I knew of near my dad's work, and commissioned their smallest marble marker for $75, with a simple \"Here lies Dave Jones, 1963-1986.\" They asked when we needed it; I said, no hurry, he's still alive. I was afraid they wouldn't do it, but they seemed very amused by the whole idea.\n\nCome party time, after dinner and toasts, we present him with our main gift, a medium sized rectangular box festively wrapped. He was intrigued by how much it weighed, and laughed hysterically when he opened it!\n\nLast time I saw him, thirty years ago, he still had his tombstone, which he found very useful as a base for leather work. Fell out of contact since then (as he predicted), but he was still kicking around social media a couple years ago; so he'll have to chisel in a new date when the time comes.",

I mean the hoop is mounted in the trunk, trunk lid removed, and is standing vertically at regulation height. \n\nYesterday, I finally asked him the story. A local dad had put up a basketball hoop on the street (it's an undeveloped dead end street) do his kids could shoot some hoops, safely, since there was 0 traffic on this road. At the end of the dead end, is a fence, bordering a trailer park. The man in the trailer on the other side of the fence reported it and the police had to get the dad to take it down. \n\nAnnoyed that this guy was preventing his kids from playing basketball, the dad bought a car for a few hundred dollars, and had the shop down the road wild the basketball hoop into the trunk. There aren't any parking rules for that street, except a vehicle cant remain in one place for more than 14 days. So every 14 days, the dad moves the car to the other side of the street.\n\nMany folks in the neighborhood now come to shoot hoops nightly. The police have left a handful of towing notices on the car, but have since stopped responding to complaints about its presence. So it seems the basketball car is here to stay!\n\nPhotos of the hoop: http://imgur.com/gallery/H104vnA\n\nEdit: holy shit this blew up.. \n\nEdit 2: car still runs, barely.

        "selftext": "While I was putting myself through university (this was in the mid 2000s), I was working at a bicycle shop. I can honestly say it\u2019s the best place I have ever worked; the owners treated their staff very well and so this shop retained loyal, highly-capable employees that made loads of high-end sales. But what was somewhat unusual (for a male-dominated industry in the mid 2000s) was that there was an equal number of male and female employees. And these women were definitely the most qualified people for the job. One was an engineer for a bike company, one was a highly successful triathlete and XC racer, and even one of the owners was a woman. *Almost* having an unrelated university degree meant that I was BY FAR the least impressive woman working at this place. I just liked bikes.\n\nOne day, a man (maybe 50-60ish) came in to the shop. I was first on the scene. He said he was looking to buy a bike and so I started going through the usual probing questions to determine what kind of bike he was looking for. Simple questions like: did he ride on the road or trails? Even the most incapable salesperson could use the answers to these questions to point this guy in the right direction. But he seemed HIGHLY resistant to talking to me or answering my questions. He finally said, \u201cis there someone else I could talk to?\u201d \n\nMaybe he just didn\u2019t like my sales approach or maybe I seemed too young to be knowledgeable. But since he didn\u2019t even give me a chance to prove myself, and seemed to be staring longingly at my busy male colleagues, I had a hunch that he didn\u2019t think a woman was capable of selling him a bike. So I smiled and said, \u201cof course!\u201d Lucky for me, there weren\u2019t any idle male employees in sight. So I grabbed one of the other women that I worked with, quietly letting her know my suspicions about this guy. Before I was even out of earshot, I hear this man agitatedly say, \u201cI need someone ELSE\u201d. Suspicions CONFIRMED. So we purposely seek out yet another extremely capable female employee to help this man. When he sees her approach, he shouts, \u201cJUST LET ME SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER!!!!\u201d \n\nSo in struts the owner, who is *very* eager to join our malicious compliance stunt, with a beaming smile on HER face. \u201cI\u2019m the owner. What can I do to help you today, sir?\u201d The utter defeat on his face is something I will never forget.\n\n\n\n**Edit: Thank you for all of the awards! \n\nFor those of you asking if he bought a bike: he half-heartedly let the owner help him for a few minutes but was very abrasive and left without purchasing anything. She didn\u2019t deem it a loss for the business.\n\nAnd to everyone suggesting he was looking for a solution for his sore nether regions: I doubt it. Embarrassed people simply aren\u2019t as immediately rude and dismissive as this fella was and we, as a high-end shop, offered professional bike fitting with every sale, including replacement stems and saddles if modifying position wasn\u2019t enough (and it could all be done without discussing genitals). People are treated as incompetent for no reason A LOT in historically gendered jobs/hobbies (MANY stories were shared in the comments) and so you develop a sixth sense for this kind of thing. That being said, if you\u2019re a cyclist and feeling discomfort or numbness, just say so. It has happened to all of us. And it\u2019s ok to want the opinion of someone who has lived similar experiences. But, at minimum, don\u2019t be a jerk about it.",

It was a horrible experience. Ever since, I just can't relax around a male dentist.

They demanded we replace the fence because they need a secure boundary for the dogs but made it very clear they were not contributing to the costs. It\u2019s not unreasonable but the way they demanded rubbed me up the wrong way. \n\nGenerally in the U.K, There are no HOA rules on old builds so I can replace the wooden fence with anything we like as long as it\u2019s on our land and is no more than 2m high. \n\nSo last month we got a quote and arranged for a firm to replace the fencing. I informed the neighbours and picked a day they would be at work so not to ruin the \u2018surprise\u2019.  \n\nWhen they got home they found the wooden fence and wooden posts have been replaced with 6ft concrete posts and a wall of concrete panels. Now they look out of their kitchen onto what resembles the Berlin Wall.  I also made sure the smooth face of the concrete panels are pointing towards us.  (We have bushes along our side so wouldn\u2019t see it anyway, but their side is right next to their patio area). \n\nThey haven\u2019t approached us about it yet but my husband told me he could see the wife in her garden from his office window and she had a face like thunder.\n\nEdited for clarify.\n\u2022 We got the materials cheap because hubby got a very competitive staff discount as part of contract for his new job. We couldn\u2019t afforded to replace the fence in until now. \n\n\u2022The neighbours have been nagging for years but we have just been patching up the holes, so decided to finally get it done after one of her dogs got in my garden and wife ranted at me about it. \n\n\u2022concrete fence was cheaper than bespoke fence sizes but more expensive (and less destructive on the gardens) than standard fencing as it would require repositioning the posts and having more holes dug for more posts.",

The fence was a little sketchy and had some holes towards the bottom on the one side and his neighbor was yelling about it because they didn't want their dogs being able to get out of the yard.  (Their yard was fenced in by the people surrounding them, they had only had to put up the front part of the fence.) Grandfather asked to split the cost of replacing it and they said no that it was their fence and they had to replace it.\n\nEventually the neighbor called zoning on the fence saying it was unsafe.  So my grandfather got a citation saying he had to fix the fence or take it down.\n\nSo he took it down.  Neighbor went irate saying that he has to put it back up because it ruined his fence because now he doesn't have a completely fenced in yard.  My grandfather explained that it was his property and it was cheaper to just tear it down than replace it. \n\nEventually the neighbor paid to have the fence installed themselves, my grandfather slipped the contractors $50 and had them tie his front fence into it (like the neighbor had previously done to his)\n\nI loved when he shared these stories, I learned later in life that when he was young, my grandfather was a cheeky bastard that lived for this shit.",

If it doesn't suit *their* purpose then they can feel free to build their own fence on their own property to suit themselves.  Demanding you foot the bill and the land for a fence for their benefit is ridiculous.  I don't know UK law but here in Canada you have to give a small gap between your fence and the property line (something like 3-6\"), so by putting up a fence only on your side, you would be losing land to them in essence.

She refused.  So, I hired a surveyor and found out the fence was 3 feet from the property line (frankly farther than I thought) and when I replaced it, I had it moved to the property line and flipped so the less attractive side faced her yard. My neighbor is a big gardener, and she had plantings all up next to the fence and to say she was furious does not come close.  She actually threatened to kill my dog and she was out throwing rocks at the fence people from the post holes they dug. The fence guy even took pictures of all the posts after the first day because he wanted proof in case she knocked them over while the concrete was setting up overnight.

She had setup a curse-jar in the room, and the funds were used to pay for supplies. .25 cents if you swore, but $1 if you dropped an F-Bomb. \n\nOne day, we were doing some group work in tables (the ones with the Bunsen burner and the sink in the middle). Behind me was a kid that was particularly annoying and pretty talkative. Patrick was probably the type of kid who later went on to cure cancer, or create Minecraft. Smart kid, but he was basically a 17 year old \u201cMartin\u201d from The Simpson\u2019s. \n\nAnyhoo... we\u2019re all trying to do our work and Patrick is getting on my nerves. He keeps making loud, bad jokes and poking his head in on our project, telling us what we were doing wrong. I asked him twice to just worry about his own table. But the third time I lost it. \n\nI walked up to the front of the class, pulled out my wallet, grabbed $1 and put it on the teacher\u2019s desk. Turned around and said quite loudly... \u201cPatrick!  Shut the FUCK up!!!\u201d\n\nI walked back to my table and sat down. The entire class was silent and was staring at me and then the teacher. She looked down at the dollar bill on her desk and started laughing out loud!  The rest of the class joined in and Patrick shrunk into his seat. \n\nThe teacher then said \u201cWell, he paid his dollar!\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s the story of how I told a kid to STFU in class without getting into trouble.",

Maybe not top it, but definitely match it.\n\nSo I was a pretty nerdy kid, and my parents both spoke German, so I did really well in my high school's German language classes.  But i was still a nerd in the 80's, so as you can see in every movie of that time, the bullying was intense.\n\nSo I was in my third year German class, and it was nearing the end of te year, so I had had all the tormenting I could take for a lifetime.  In class, we were working on passive voice + subjunctive mood sentences (the grammar for saying stuff like, \"If I had been given a million dollars, I could have done X.\")  We're given a sentence in English and had to write out, on the blackboard, what the German translation would be.\n\nWhile I'm standing up there, doing my nerdy thing, this jerk (Randall the Jerk) was sitting at the back calling out to me.  Saying really uncool, crude things.  The teacher called him down the first time, and again a minute later.\n\nThe third time he shouted out, I lost it.  Before the teacher even had a chance to call him out, I turned and Went.  Off.  I don't recall exactly what I said, but it started with, \"Fuck you, Randall,  and your whore mother, and I hope she catches AIDS from one of her tricks and gives it to you.\" (sorry, it was the 80's)  And it went downhill from there.  Thirty seconds I went on, saying things that would have gotten me expelled ten times over.\n\nProblem:  I had been in \"German Mode,\" for the exercise, so what I said came out in German.\n\nEverybody in class understood me juuuuust fine, so when I finally ran out of nasty things to say, I was greeted with silence, and a lot of gape-mouthed students wondering if the teacher was gonna kill me now or wait until after class.  Frankly, I was kinda wondering the same thing.\n\nRandall the Jerk was as gobsmacked as the rest, but was the first to recover.  He turned around to the teacher and said, \"Mrs. T, did you hear what she said?\"\n\nMrs. T says, \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, what are you going to do about it?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"What?  Why?\"\n\nAnd the teacher said, \"She got all the German right.\"\n\nETA:  Mrs. T was cool, she knew that Randall the Jerk was a jerk, and sat there with a nasty smirk on her face for the rest of exercise.  She was defending me in her way, not being obtuse.",
