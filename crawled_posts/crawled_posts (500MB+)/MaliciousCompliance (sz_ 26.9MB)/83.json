        "selftext": "I was telling this story in another forum and thought I\u2019d share here.\n\nThis was a year or two ago when Amazon fresh were opening up new stores in London. For anyone not familiar with they, you just walk in, take what you want, then walk out. Your Amazon account gets billed as they use cameras and sensors.\n\nSo I used the one in white city after it had just opened, I went in just for the novelty factor and got a few things. I found a couple of pricing errors, in my favour, a couple really big pricing errors. \n\nI done the decent thing and told Amazon, expecting a thank you, but got a call from an irate call handler insisting I got and was charged the correct amount and I wasn\u2019t over charged and wasn\u2019t due anything back, I repeatedly tried in vain to say no, you\u2019ve undercharged me, but she was having none of it, so I gave up.\n\nNaturally, after the call, I changed my tube commute for an 5 minute longer route and I went in each day and bought only those items priced wrong. \n\nSuffice to say I have enough toiletries for a few years\u2026 also I am now sickened by a pricey cheesecake brand and have gone off haloumi cheese .\n\nTLDR . Got treated like a dick by Amazon customer service on the phone when trying to be honest because undercharged a lot on a few item in there fresh store. So went back each day and only bought they wrongly priced items to the point where I wiped them out daily of those items.\n\n\n\nEdit : for a bit more clarity on the prices, The cheesecakes and haloumi cheese were pennies in the pound I paid about 2% of the actual price, so about 8p per \u00a35 fancy small artisan cheesecake, and about 9p for the block of haloumi.\n\nThe toiletries I paid about 6 or 7% of the actual price, so about 50 to 60p per item instead off \u00a39 to \u00a311 each plus it\u2019s toiletries I\u2019d have been buying anyway, only thing now is I had to get a few big boxes in the garage to store them.\n\nGoing via this store cost me nothing extra in travel as in London you get charged a fixed fee for unlimited travel within zones, it only cost me 5 min extra commute each day.",

This is of course to encourage supermarkets to keep expired products off the shelves.\n\nA couple I know noticed there was a huge, very expensive cheese wheel about to expire. They went to the supermarket every day to check if it was still there. Sure enough, it expired and wasn't removed. They called it out and were given like R$500 worth of cheese.",

Not a great guitar, but like a $300 guitar, so not a toy guitar, either. My husband ordered it for me and asked that it be delivered to his work address. But it didn't come on that Thursday when they said it would, and he was going on xmas vacation after Friday, so he called the company and asked them to deliver it to our house instead. \n\nThe following Monday morning, the sound system and guitar were delivered to our house. Later that afternoon, my husband's boss called to let him know a sound system and guitar had been delivered to the office. My husband went and picked it up before the office closed for the holidays. \n\nI called the company and explained what happened and she told me it was impossible. I told her that i was literally standing in my kitchen looking at  two sound systems and two guitars, and she told me again that it wasn't possible. \n\n\"There's only one bill of lading, and it's to your house. There can be no item of there is no bill of lading.\"\n\nI argued with her for a couple more minutes and offered to send her a photo, but she refused to believe me. Or... maybe... it was the end of the year and she didn't want to have to reconcile whatever had gone wrong. \n\nI made out pretty good on that one.",

Had to get assurance that A) return was free and B) that it would be picked up since no way was I going to be able to carry the thing to a drop off location.\n\nOrdered new one, UPS picked it up (had to take two tries) still in box where they left it two days previous, and get the refund.

            "When I worked at my second Walmart store, I had a similar experience. I usually bought my lunch from the store itself, and happened to notice one day that a flavor of a certain smoothie brand was marked incorrectly; all the other flavors were like $5.25, I think, and this one was marked $2.55, and wasn't marked for discount, so I went to my manager about it.\n\nNo one was working in that department that night, so she said she'd leave a note for morning shift to do something about it. Morning shift did nothing about it, nor did second shift, and the managers on our shift I guess thought they were above it because when I brought it up with her again, she said, \"It's been taken care of,\" in a really curt tone.\n\nIt did not get taken care of for a whole month, until the store manager deigned to visit one day and happened to notice. I don't know how much money they lost for it during that time (but hey, that kind of thing doesn't actually bother anyone there from my experience working at three separate Walmart stores with two of them working two different shifts per store at different times, so...) but for every shift until then I got that flavor to go with my lunch.",

            "Many years ago, back when the cost of a gallon of gas was not much more than a dollar, a new gas station opened in town. They were advertising 10 cents off each gallon and there were lines to fill up. This was before credit card readers at the pumps, back when you had to walk inside and pay once you were done filling up.\n\nI filled up, did the mental math and figured out how much I owed, and walked inside to pay. The store manager was working the register personally and he said I owed him about a dollar less than I figured.\n\nI knew I was right. Math is my thing - I used to teach algebra and first semester calculus at the local community college. The manager was giving me 10 cents off per dollar, not per gallon. I explained it to him but he just didn't get it. His little desk calculator said I owed him a certain amount after subtracting 10% and that's what he was charging people.\n\nSo I paid what he said and walked away, but being a math nerd I did some more mental arithmetic on the way out. 20 gallons per average fill up, eight pumps, four minutes per fill up, and a loss near 5% on each sale by putting the wrong number in the calculator - this manager was losing about $120 per hour because he was mathing wrong.",

            "Hubby worked at one of the food warehouses in the States. They would get deliveries and if the scanning sticker was missing, they would toss the product. Nights he worked, he brought it to the dumpster, but left it outside of it. People would just collect what they could carry to their cars when the shift was over. They knew on warmer days to keep coolers in their cars and on break, they went out to \"smoke\" and loaded the coolers. Hubby and a few others would text some soup kitchens/pantries to pop over. That was the only area that didn't have cameras or security. Almost nothing was ever trashed. 1 day 100 gallons of milk, a coworker/teacher loaded it up for a school to use. Amazon really doesn't care about waste, and they do donate a lot of stuff close to expiring to homeless shelters.",

        "selftext": "I'm a truck driver.  More specifically, I drive a concrete mixer.  That means a large part of my job is dealing with people who know nothing about the material, nothing about my equipment, but still think they know better than me, since I'm obviously just an evil-smelling, gap-toothed hillbilly who didn't graduate high school.  In short, concrete is what happens when Malicious Compliance goes for a drunken joyride down the Dunning-Kruger Parkway.  \n  \nSo, on this particular day, I was pouring at a school out in the middle of nowhere.  Our plant was the closest one to the jobsite, but it was still a half-hour away.  It was also over 110 degrees (schools usually do their renovation and repair work in summer).  The order indicated that they were going to use a concrete pump, and the manager (we will call him Bob) told me to throw in some fiber.  There are a few different kinds of fiber we use, but the only one that works with a trailer pump consists of small squares woven out of a cotton-like material that come apart in the mix.  I throw that in, because it's a pump job.\n  \nSo we get onto the jobsite, and start pumping.  Everything is going well for the first couple yards.  Then the pump's reducer (a pipe running across the front of the pump) snaps, swing out and slams into my foot.  I wasn't hurt, but it turned out the pumper knew the pipe was getting thin and ran with it anyways.  Now I'm pissed; those pumps operate at massive pressures, and I have seen them blow concrete hard enough to knock a man over 20 feet away.  If I hadn't been wearing steel toes, it very well might have broken something.  \n  \nEventually, the customer comes over, to see what the problem is.  He looks down at the pile of concrete dripping out the broken pipe, prods it with his foot, and asks, \"Where is the fiber we ordered?\"  I explain that the buckeye fiber can't be seen after it mixes into the concrete, but assure him that I added it personally.  He then starts yelling at me.  He didn't order buckeye fiber, he ordered plastic fibers.  He pulls out his paperwork, and sure enough, that is what he ordered.  I admit it was a mistake, but also tell him that the fibers he ordered won't work with the pump he is using.  The inspector tries to explain that what he got is as good or better than what he ordered, and he is willing to sign off on the change.  Customer isn't hearing any of it.  We finish the load, and the customer orders another ten yards.  I call it in, adding the bit about the broken pipe and that the customer was upset that the first load had buckeye in it instead of plastic fiber; Bob can hear the guy swearing at me over the radio.  \n  \nNow Bob tends to be very protective of his drivers.  He is also more than willing to let customers hang themselves with their own lack of knowledge.  I once watched him batch about $1,400 of liquid stupid, because a customer ordered concrete with both an accelerator and a retardant in it.  Bob could have loaded another truck right there and then, and shipped it out.  Instead, he noted that only one truck was scheduled for that job, and waited for me to drive the half-hour back to the plant.  Then he batched the load (with plastic fibers) and brought the ticket down personally.  As he handed me the ticket, he said, \"Don't forget, they ordered at a 4-inch slump.\"  \n  \nConcrete slump is a measure of how wet it is.  It's measured by packing it into a 12-inch tall cone, setting it on the ground, pulling the cone off and checking how far the pile of concrete dropped (slumped).  4-inch is something of a default order, but the only things you pour that dry are footings and curbs, and you don't put it that dry into a trailer pump.  \n  \nSo I load up and drive back to the job.  By now, they have been sitting out there for over an hour in 110-degree heat.  The pumper is panicking, because the concrete is setting inside his pump, and the patch of sidewalk they are doing is going to have a great big cold joint (fresh concrete poured against set concrete makes a weak joint that is more likely to crack) down the middle of it.  As soon as the concrete reaches the back of the drum, the pumper tells me to stop and add a bunch of water.  The inspector authorizes 10 gallons.  It's still dryer than the pumper wants, but the inspector won't allow more.  Then the concrete hits the pump's grate.  Everything is fine for a couple seconds, then it just starts piling up without going through.  All those plastic fibers were getting caught on the grating and clogging it up.  The gravel can't get through with the fiber blocking things up, so all that is getting pumped is cement and water.  \n  \nCustomer comes out furious.  He accuses Bob of spiking the load with extra fiber and tries to reject the load.  I point out that we warned him the load would not be pumpable, and besides that, by having me add water to the load, they have already bought it.  So now we are pumping a few seconds, clearing the grate, then pumping a little more.  It took about three hours (which translated to about $300 of standby charges).  Most of the fiber didn't go through the pump (the pumper didn't want me throwing the giant clots of plastic in his hopper), along with quite a bit of the gravel.  The inspector ended up taking a couple samples from the pump hose (normally they only sample at the truck chute), because he knew what was going into the form wasn't what was coming out of my truck.  A month later, when those extra samples failed their 28-day test, the school had to tear out that sidewalk and redo the whole thing.  This time, they ordered it with buckeye fibers.  \n  \nTL/DR: Customer started swearing because I accidentally gave him what the job needed instead of what he asked for.  Brought back a second load the way he ordered it, and it made the entire job fail inspection.  Also made a pumper whose poorly maintained equipment nearly injured me stand out in 110 degree heat for several hours.",

            "As a former concrete tester, they really effed up that batch. Not only does adding water weaken the concrete, but so does excessive heat.  We were required to document anything that ran over 90 minutes from being mixed to being placed as a non compliance.  Over time the concrete heats up due to the chemical reaction and begins to set.\n\nI once had a project where they weren't moving fast enough and the concrete trucks started to back up.  At one point they had like 15 trucks waiting, and a large number of them were already over batch-to-placement just sitting there.  This was for a big elevated slab pour, so I called my office and they told me that any truck that gets used over its 90-minute mark, we should make an extra set of six 6x12 strength test cylinders (around 30 lbs of concrete each) - normally we'd make one set every 10 trucks.  I had to send a coworker to pick up more plastic cylinders (used as molds) and call in help to keep casting them.\n\nI'm a 5'2\"/120lb woman.  My muscles were killing me after that day.  I was so glad when I got promoted into the office.",

I offered to extend the rental to a full 7 days to take advantage of our weekly rate, and then she went on to tell me that she doesn\u2019t need it for 7 days, but only for 6, and that I better give her the daily rate instead of the weekly rate, or she will never do business with us again.

Nogales? Florence? Hayden? Winkelman? Dudleyville? Show Low? Bagdad?\n\nOf course I could keep going on; the entire state is littered with these small back-of-nowhere towns with little to nothing to recommend them, who's only source of jobs is either an open-pit mine operation or some other break-back industry (I'm not saying this is bad work - indeed, some of these guys make boatloads of money - but it'll age you prematurely, and what good is a ton of money if you have nothing or nowhere to spend it? I guess it'll make for a good early retirement if nothing else).\n\nMost people in this state either want to live in the Phoenix area, or if they want scenery and a slower pace, somewhere up north (Flagstaff or Sedona are two popular spots). Tuscon is nothing but a giant brown patch, but it does have some interesting scenery (and some great hiking/camping areas around it - some beautiful mountains - and skiing on Mt Lemon I guess) - still, I put it in there because unless you're there for the University, it's not the greatest place on the map of Arizona.\n\nAny place else is almost virtually a tiny \"oasis\" in the middle of unforgiving nature. Some people would call it a \"wasteland\" - I don't, I like the high desert and other areas of Arizona just like they are. I also love the fact that you can transition through 3-4 different climate zones inside of a few hours of driving your car.\n\nBut those out-in-the-middle areas are only for the toughest of Arizonan's to live in, where your nearest neighbor might be miles away, where if you get injured or sick, it's hours to the nearest hospital (and sometimes that's even by helicopter). So those places are, by the definition of most people, \"the less desirable parts\" - because of the lack of infrastructure and such (if they were more desirable, more people would be living there - basically a tautology).\n\nSo I'm curious - what part of Arizona is this \"less desirable part\" that you are working at a car rental place?",

I worked evenings, so this meant that I was essentially in charge of the checkouts as there were no managers in. I wore a headset and if the cashiers needed assistance, they would buzz me and I would go help. It wouldn't say what help was needed on the headset, just which number checkout. \n\nOne night, I am in the middle of the store putting away some abandoned items. My headset tells me checkout 4 needs help. On it. \n\nAs I am walking over, checkout 8 also buzzes in. Fine, I will go there next. It takes a good couple of minutes before I get to checkout 4. Some discounted items weren't going through and I needed to authorise something. It took about 3 minutes to put through all the items that the customer wanted and then I make my way over to checkout 8.\n\nAs I approach, I can hear this guy causing a scene. He is moaning about how long I am taking and how incompetent we clearly are. As I get closer I see this middle aged man with his arms in the air in a \"come on!\" gesture, complaining at the cashier that he has been on his feet all day and all he fucking wants is another box of eggs. \n\nI am super polite and ask how I can help. He turns with the biggest frown and I fully expect him to rip me a new one, but alas... he suddenly looks sheepish, and his body visibly shrinks in with shame. You see, redditors, I was 8 months pregnant at the time and as big as a house. \n\nThe cashier explains that the eggs the man chose are broken and he needs a new box. Immediately, he says, \"Oh... um... I can go get them?\" There isn't even a queue behind him; he could have gotten them at any point.\n\nI say, \"No, that's OK sir; you've been on your feet all day.

The customers would take eggs from the 100-tray and fill an empty dozen-box. I don't know what subsequently happened to the trays that held a few stuck or broken eggs, but each customer got a personally-checked dozen of unbroken eggs."

        "selftext": "So a few years ago my dad was moving out of his house and in with his parents due to some health problems with my grandma. This was iver summer break and i was just out of high school at the time, about to go into college so i had absolutely nothing to do all summer as i waited to move out of state.\n\nMy dad never was and still isnt super organized, where as I am *alphabetize my own bookshelf with a full system* Type-A about keeping things in order. Call me weird but i really enjoy reorganizing things/cleaning, it just hits that button for me. \n\nSo being that he had about 2 months until he closed on the house, i just start to pack up some of the house for him (basement was a DISASTER and i had wanted to tear it up for years). So within the first day i had made a significant dent in the basement, which ended up being a very involved process. I didn't realize when we had moved in that a lot of the stuff from our old house was still packed haphazardly because my brother and i were too young to really help. So i went through the process of unpacking the still packed boxes from house 1, labeling the boxes the way i wanted to and then repacking those boxes appropriately. After about 3 days of this i get about 50% done, including cleaning/packing my room and some of the garage. \n\nHeres the buildup to the MC\n\nMy dad comes down to help me, all good with me. I start explaining where things go and my dad wants to change it. I resist, explaining that i already have the system and that i have been doing the bulk of the packing so he should probably just go with me on this one which is when he hits me with the namesake of this post.\n\nSo i relent, because i know what will happen. \n\nAnyone thats really type A will agree with me that the only thing more frustrating then things being chaotic and out of order, is things that are *slightly* out of order. Which is what i KNEW would happen. Regardless of the fight dad and I had, he ended up almost following the system. Mostly things that belong in the labeled boxes went where they were supposed to, except for a few VERY important odds and ends that got put... well... not where they were supposed to. I noticed this but because of \"my house my rules\" CLEARLY he has a plan so i dont say anything -.-\n\nI knew the payoff was going to be a slow burn, and it came several months later when i was in school across the country and unable to help.\n\nDad calls me one day very flustered because he cant find something he NEEDED. He had been in the storage unit he rented in my hometown for the better part of three hours looking. \n\nNow the storage unit got packed HORRIBLY by the moving crew, i have been in there a few times after this story and i feared for my safety, its a legitimate labyrinth/jungle gym and a nightmare to get through, not to mention this was mid summer and there was no AC.\n\nSo dad is mad on the phone asking me where it is and i ask him if its in the box I labeled in big red sharpie IMPORTANT SHIT. He says no, and i smile a bit. Then he says, well you were in charge of packing all of this stuff and now I can't find it. That's when I calmly reminded him of the blowout fight we had over this exact issue and how he commandeered my operation afterwords. I told them that if I was actually in charge it would be in the box labeled important shit. He hung up on me after that.\n\nI love my dad and I had no problem helping him out, we laugh about it today but I can't say I didn't get a good chuckle at the thought of him sweating and cursing climbing around in that fucking storage unit death trap. He recently found another place to live now that my grandparents have more in-home assistance and I've already worked out that I'm gonna come help him move. \n\nWe already agreed I'm in charge this time.",

I was hired to replace someone who was full-time, so my responsibilities were much greater than the time that I was allotted to work, which was 29 hours a week. Basically, my bosses kept piling work on me and since this was my first job out of college, I finished it but was basically working full-time for about a week and a half. I had flagged the issue with them and they told me to reflect the time on my timesheet.\n\nFast forward to pay-day, my bosses are livid that I worked too much, saying that I had to stay at exactly 29 hours to be a part-time employee. Cue the malicious compliance.\n\nI started vehemently tracking my hours. I would plan my weeks in advance so I knew the maximum amount of hours I could work each day to stay at 29 hours. I basically worked from 9:30 to 3:30, but obviously there were days that I had to work longer. When my bosses would give me tasks on Thursday and Fridays, I would say to them, well I have to leave at 2 pm today so I'm under 29 hours this week and go home and relax. This obviously made my bosses frustrated since they needed to offload work, but I was just following exactly what they had told me to do. After about 3 weeks of this, and multiple tasks not being able to get done because of my strict 29 hour work week, they finally offered me a full-time job.\n\nEDIT: Wow this blew up! I had 14 karma when I posted this so I was not expecting this at all. Thank you to everyone who has commented. It's been great to read all of the support and solidarity to everyone whose employers are attempting to take advantage of them.

            "This mentality of keeping employees under a certain number of hours a week is, I think, one of the biggest problems with a lot of the jobs young people are in these days.  (I say \"young people,\" because I had a big birthday this year, and don't feel too young anymore). I managed at two national retailers (two big names), and they will not let people go full-time, because they don't want to pay out benefits like paid time off, dental or health or life insurance. So, a lot of the hardworking employees  I hired had two jobs, just so they could pay their bills, because 25 hours a week at just above minimum wage is not enough for someone to live on. There are so many people in the states who are working 50-60 hours a week at TWO jobs, but because neither will give them full-time hours, they're killing themselves working and have no benefits to show for it. But at least the stockholders are happy. Please know that if your workplace is like this, it's not because your manager doesn't want to give you hours. Strict orders come from corporate to have as few full-time employees as possible. The people at the top don't care about you. You are expendable and replaceable. It's just the worst.",
            "I worked at a major big box retailer that in theory budgeted enough hours to have enough employees on the floor.  There were just a few problems with that; they refused to allow anyone to ever work over 40 hours, they hired some 16 year olds that couldn't work late, the store always needed cleaned at the end of the day and this wasn't budgeted for, and a few times a week a truck would come in and they'd assign some of us older people to unload it (which often took until around 1 AM). \n\nAll of this often led to several of us cutting our weeks short, taking off mid rush on Thursday or Friday, and even skipping shifts on the weekends when we tried to warn our managers ahead of time we were getting close to 40 hours.\n\n---\n\nGlad to be out of there, irregular schedules and never knowing if when it said you'd be off at 9 PM if you'd get home before 2 AM was not pleasant.",
            "An old job of mine, a full timer on 38 hours a week. Contract makes provision for \u201cunpaid reasonable overtime\u201d - whatever. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the boss asked me to work a 6th day in the week, that I said well hang on it\u2019s Friday, I\u2019ve already done extra this week, and you want me to do a whole Saturday? I couldn\u2019t do it anyway with pre existing plans, and refused. I started to track my hours, and discovered my average work week was sitting at around the 50 hour mark. Though questionably legal both under general employment standards and our own industrial regulations I didn\u2019t really care too much, I liked the work and it was a good stepping stone in my career path. \n\nBut I was yelled at on the Monday when the owner decided to come in, for costing him money when paying clients had to be turned away on Saturday. He was only angry because I was literally doing nothing on the Monday, I had cancellations galore so I spent my day cleaning. A very rare occurrence, honestly.\n\nSo from that point on, I kept my own spreadsheet of hours worked in addition to the companies time clock in the office. After a month that was busier than usual , I was owed 5 whole days off. \n\nTried to claim them back as time in lieu, got approved, and then payroll took those days out of my annual leave instead. \n\nCue messy drama with the union, threats to my career, and me quitting in the same week as 2 other key employees. \n\nThe business closed its doors permanently 3 months later.",

Since we were allowed to stay as late as we wanted I'd put in a 12'er on Monday/Tuesday if I wanted a long weekend.  \n  \nOften I'd resort to cleaning duties on Thursday just by nature of not having to spread a single test over two work days.

If you work slower you can take more breaks and come in on more Fridays to keep upper management happy.\"  \n  \nWe got bought out maybe 3 weeks after this convo and EVERYONE quit.

        "selftext": "I used to work in a pawn shop as both a sales associate and a pawn broker. I have so many stories I could probably fill this subreddit, but this one always makes me smile because of how smug the man was. \n\nWhen I was a sales associate, I sold a lot of jewelry. I often had to tell people that we couldn't hold items because A) someone might come in and want it and have the money right there and B) we had a layaway program. So, unless you put some money down, 20%, holding it wasn't an option.\n\nSo, one day this man comes in and is looking for a very specific type of ring: diamond channel set anniversary ring set in white gold size 5. The pawn shop I worked at had a VAST collection of these types of things in many sizes and with many different carat weights. He needed a specific size and a specific carat weight and he was very much in luck, because we HAPPENED to have it. Most pawn shops are you get what you see and you can see what you get. Basically, we don't have inventory/stock of any specific item and our jewelers are for sizing and dipping purposes only. So, I show him my ring that I have in the case.\n\nMe: here you go. Exactly the size you need and just over the carat weight.\n\nMan, pulls out a loupe, looks at diamonds: okay, they're not AS clear as I normally like them.\n\nMe: yeah, I understand, but the price is only $350 and at a regular jewelry store, this would easily run around $1500, so while the clarity isn't as nice, it's still a really good deal and I don't know if you'll find another this size with the same carat weight.\n\nMan, sighing: okay. Well, I know your sister store also has some rings, right? Do you think they might have a better one with better quality?\n\nAt this time, there is a woman looking at rings and clearly listening to our conversation, but I'm positive he hasn't noticed her. She sees the ring in my hand and I see her eyebrow go up.\n\nMe: Im not sure, but they are a smaller store, so their inventory is smaller. If they do have one, there isn't a guarantee the ring will be the correct size or the same carat weight.\n\nMan: hmm. Okay, well can you hold the ring for me? I want to go see their inventory.\n\nMe: I'm sorry, we can't. Company policy is that all items held must be put on layaway for holding. If someone wants to buy an item and it isn't in layaway, we don't want to stop them.\n\nMan: Hmph, well, I'm gonna hold off and go check that store. IF someone comes in and sees THIS specific ring, yeah, go ahead and sell it, but I doubt that's gonna happen. \n\nHe walked away with a kind of smug look on his face. Just as he left, the woman who was listening to our conversation walks up. \n\nWoman: can I see that ring he didn't want?\n\nI hand it over to her. She slips it on her finger and smiles.\n\nWoman: I'll take it.\n\nShe didn't even hesitate. She straight up bought this ring after wearing it for 5 second's. During ring out I asked her why and she said she had been searching for a channel set ring for a few years at the pawn shops, but none had caught her eye like that one and it was her size, which can be hard to find. I told her have a nice day and cleaned it before she left.\n\n45 minutes later, the man walked back in.\n\nMan: okay, they didn't have anything, so I guess I'll take that one I was looking at.\n\nMe: I'm sorry, sir, but just after you left a woman came up, tried on the ring and bought it. I don't have anymore in the carat weight you're looking for. I have some in the higher carat weights, if you're interested!\n\nMan: are you fucking serious? You knew I'd probably be back! Why did you sell it?\n\nMe: well, you did say I should if someone came in and saw it. Just because you doubt something is going to happen doesn't mean it can't.\n\nEdit: some of y'all are saying I didn't say the last line. Let me make something clear: the pawn industry is  incredibly different than normal retail stores. I have actually told customers to straight up \"Get the fuck out of my store\" and had 0 consequences. I promise I said this line. If you're wondering what happened after, he demanded to speak to my manager who shouted through the window: \"we don't hold shit for assholes unless you put it in layaway. Don't assume shit here, buddy!\" That manager also looked exactly like the BTK serial killer, so.....",

            "I used to sell at flea markets. One year, I was helping out my father in law who made decorative lawn art. His main seller was a Dutch style, wooden windmill. Season was basically over to sell this, but he needed working capital. I loaded up the truck and took it to the best flea market in the area. Mind you, the season was over, but I decided the gamble was good enough. I had something like 50 of those things in the truck.\n\nShortly after noon,  I was down to the last three. One guy asked me to hold on to the one he bought (yeah, he paid cash) so he could shop around a bit more. I told him I'd stick around til 1, even if I sold out. \n\nDown to my last two, and I have a tourist trying to haggle me down on the price. Normal price was $30, I was selling them close out for $25. She wanted both for $35. She wasn't budging. I had agreed to let her have both for $40, but she never said she'd buy. Meanwhile, the guy That bought the other windmill came back to pick it up, I excused myself, telling her I'd be right back, turned around, handed him his windmill, and went to see about closing the sale. She was gone. Oh well. \n\nAlmost immediately, a guy steps up and asks how much. I told him $25 each, both for $45. He whipped out the cash, paid for them and walked away with a smile. \n\nOkay, I sold all of my inventory, didn't have much in the way of clean-up, and the guy I would have waited on picked up his product. All done. I go to get in the truck and the woman came back and said, \"Okay, I've thought it over and I'll buy those two for the $40 you said.\"\n\n\"Sorry, Ma'am, but I already sold them for $45. \"\n\n\"But you knew I wanted them.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but you never said you'd buy them, so when I didn't see you, I sold them to the next person. And he didn't haggle. He headed that way,\" pointing east, \"I don't think he'll sell them, though, because he bought them as Christmas gifts.\"\n\n\"Don't you have any more?\" \n\n\"Nope, I brought 50, I sold 50.\"\n\nTook the truck back to the shop, handed Dad the money and told him I sold out. It always surprised him when I did this. I did this every week for a month and a half, kept his business afloat, then headed out of state. He turned the sales over to my brother in law. BIL was lucky to sell one.",

She was the type of teacher that if she saw you with your cell phone out, even during lunch or in between classes, that she would take it, give it to the principal, and give you a detention.\n\nI decided to fuck with her one day because she was quite clearly in a pissed off mood and the opportunity was perfect. I was standing in line for lunch and I got my pump out (I was diagnosed with diabetes at age 8 and I have had a pump since 9). It looks a whole lot like a cell phone other than the tube running from it to my body. Without really looking closely it can easily be confused with a cell phone. She sees me playing with my pump and comes over to me. This is obviously not exact words used. I more than likely was a little disrespectful but I definitely knew the boundaries and would never be so blatantly rude or disrespectful that it would deem necessary to get a detention.\n\nTeacher: Give it to me now and follow me to the principles office.\n\nMe: Um no, I need this to live.\n\nTeacher: Give it to me now, I will not ask again.\n\nMe: No, leave me alone I just want to eat my lunch.\n\nShe then grabs my arm and drags me to the principal's office. I was very close to the principal as I was the class president so I spent a lot of time with her planning school events and such.\n\nTeacher: This student had their phone out during lunch, refused to give it to me, and was rude and back talked me.\n\nPrincipal: Is this true (Me)?\n\nMe: No ma'am, my cell phone is currently in my locker.\n\nTeacher: I saw you playing with it in line!\n\nPrincipal: (Me), please give us your cell phone.\n\nMe: Okay, follow me to my locker then.\n\nTeacher: No, give it to us now, it is in your pocket.\n\nMe: No it's not.\n\nTeacher: Then empty your pockets.\n\nI proceed to empty my pockets which was a pack of gum and then I have my pump in my hand because it's connected to me so I can't put it on the table.\n\nTeacher: Why would you lie to me when you obviously have it in your hand?\n\nMe: This is my diabetes pump.\n\nTeacher: Why didn't you tell me?\n\nMe: You never asked if it was a cell phone, you just tried taking it away from me.\n\nTeacher: This is ridiculous, you need to show more respect.\n\nPrincipal: I think we are done here, Teacher you can leave I will talk with (Me).\n\nTeacher leaves and is quite obviously pissed off about the situation. I tell Principal the truth about the trap I set for Teacher and that I hope she isn't pissed at me and I won't do it again. She chuckles a little bit, tells me to go eat lunch and she will see me later for a school fundraiser event. I never had another encounter with Teacher and during class she made it a point to try not to talk to me.",

            "Before I started reading I had this horrible feeling of dread that she\u2019d try to snatch your pump away from you not realizing what it was. Smh, why people like that choose teaching as a career I will never know",
            "Sounds a lot like this Malicious Compliance story shared last year!\n https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/b264gn/you_want_my_insulin_pump_you_got_it/\n\nYou'd think they'd do some training for the educators so it wasn't such a common mistake?",
            "I\u2019m a teacher with a pump. I tend to have a light-hearted relationship with my kids (high school aged) and they tease me. One day, I made an adjustment on my pump and one kid just says \u201cooooooooh, Miss, no phones! You\u2019re in trouble!\u201d \n\nSo I show them the pump, do a mini-lesson on it and what it\u2019s for, and unhook it from my body to show them how it works. One girl literally screamed like I\u2019d just stabbed myself in the hand \u201cPUT IT BACK ON OR YOU\u2019LL DIE!\u201d\n\nHaving a pump usually sucks, but sometimes it can be fun :)",
            "I once got told off for testing my blood sugar in class (T1D) when I was feeling low. She tried telling me I should do it in my own time (ie break time). \n\nI just got up and walked the hell out, almost collapsed on my way to reception.",
            "I've never had something like this happen to me, but a friend of mine use the insulin pump as an excuse not to get robbed. \n\nShe was on the train on a shitty line that links the suburbs to Paris, and two dudes approached her and asked her to give them her phone.\n\nHer : \"I can't\" \n\nOne dude : \"Come on we see it in your pocket give it\" \n\nHer : \"It's my insulin pump. Without it I die. You can't take it !\"\n\nI guess they thought it wasn't worth the trouble (or she started making too much noise) and they moved on. Sometimes ignorance is good, these dudes probably had never seen an actual pump.\n\nSo you know, next time someone's trying to rob you, tell them it's your life-needed insulin pump. Maybe they'll go away.",
            "My dad has a pump, obviously he\u2019s not in grade school. He\u2019s very much retired. \n\nBut the amount of times that damn thing goes off. \n\nTeachers would go nuts. \n\nBut he also can\u2019t hear it now. The frequencies are outside of what he can hear at his age.

Hopefully the pumps get better at communicating with cell phones and he can view it without having to see it. \n\nDo you have any problems with driving and getting in trouble with texting and driving when it\u2019s just your pump? \n\nI fuss at him all the time for driving and looking at his pump",

Eventually I wouldn\u2019t even stop and would just yell back \u201cinsulin pump!\u201d and keep walking.",
            "Also a type one here. In 9th grade our rules changed to phones must be in locker mid year due to an incident. A day or so after this rule took place the principal of the school saw mine on my hip and it went a little like this:\n\nPrincipal: Excuse me Xxgougaxx but you can't have phones on you during the school day\n\nMe: yes maam I know the new rules. \n\nP: well u need to take yours and put it in your locker\n\nM: it is\n\nP: I see it right there put it away now\n\nM: oh that's my pump.

            "How childish of that teacher. Going out of your way to mess with people, and then going out of your way to avoid those who put you in an uncomfortable situation. It\u2019s sounds like her students have a higher level of maturity than her. She should not be in a profession where she may be viewed as a child\u2019s role model.",

            "Reminds me of the time I checked my blood sugar in class at my desk, which I had every right to do, and a student teacher tried to tell me I couldn\u2019t do that there. I told her she better check on that before she goes around saying things like that or she\u2019s going to end up on the wrong side of a lawsuit against the district. I spoke to the school nurse later that day, cause you know us diabetic kids tend to be close to the school nurse, and she had a whole fit and took it up the chain. The next day I was called into the principals office to be apologized to by the teacher and the principal on behalf of the district.",
            "Hi fellow T1D! I'm so glad she didn't yank your pump away from you! I've had that happen and it really hurts!\n\nWas it a Medtronic pump, those things definitely look like cell phones/pagers!",
            "This sort of happened to me. I jumped all over a student whose phone beeped in his backpack before testing started. All phones must be turned off and turned in! This is a testing violation!  ...turned out his phone was actually his heart monitor that beeped when it was out of range. Of course I apologized profusely. I also brought it up at the next faculty meeting.",
            "There is a story on here of a woman tearing a girls pump out of her stomach thinking it was a video game she wanted for her kid. The results were horrifying",
            "I got suspended because of my pump. I graduated in 1999 and this happened my sophomore or junior year. I was walking down the hall and had my pump clipped in my pocket. The PE teacher saw it and told me to remove my pager (cell phones were not as popular then, most people still had pagers). I calmly said I was sorry but I could not remove it as it was attached to me. He called me a liar, i further explained it was an insulin pump. He told me he had never heard such a lie and I was taken to the office. I was suspended for \"insubordination\" since I talked back and didn't just remove my pump.",
            "Not exactly the same but in 8th grade, my teacher told me to put my phone away in front of the class.\n\nI didn't have a phone back then. I picked it up what she thought was a phone and showed that it was in fact, a simple calculator and there was no trouble.\n\nIn hindsight though, I cannot remember why I even had the calculator out. It was Language Arts class.",
            "My daughter is 6, has had a pump since she was 6mo. This is easily my biggest concern and I will destroy every teacher that tries it. My kid won't suffer cause some ass face thinks they rule over children like royalty.",
            "God, something similar happened to my mother about 15 years ago, and she's still endlessly embarrassed about it. \n\nShe was a substitute teacher and phones were only recently becoming an issue in classrooms. She saw someone fiddling with something under their desk during class, so she went up and asked them to please put it away during class. They turned and pulled out their blood sugar tester, and just told her what it was and that it couldn't wait. She was mortified and apologized over and over, she didn't know anyone in the class required it. \n\nIt's still one of those stories that embarrasses the hell out of her lol.",

There's actually several such stories on there. (shakes head sadly)",
            "I never thought of this possibly happening to my 6 year old. The last few years, everyone has been very informed and attentive, besides a lunch monitor who made him toss his food before he was done on the first day, causing a low. That was just a lack of communication so I wasn't upset.\n\nHowever, I WILL encourage my child to have a little fun messing with a teacher if he ever does have an encounter like yours, especially out of ignorance.",
            "When we were taking a test one of the teachers said nothing could be on the desk or in pockets.  One girl with a pump obviously couldn't comply and the teacher humiliated her trying to find a way she could \"put it on the floor or something\".  Ugggg",
            "I had a teacher once tell us about his first year of teaching. He said in one of his classes there was always a beeping noise. One day it was happening again as usual so he said \u201cwhoever has there phone out turn it off right now\u201d all the kids looked horrified and a boy near the back said \u201cuuum, I can\u2019t turn it off\u201d the item making the beeping noise was this kids heart monitor.",
            "DUDE I am diabetic and I did this exact same thing except it was during class. This power hungry teacher who was always trying to get people in trouble saw me using my insulin pump. I knew she would try and come take it so I kept fiddling with the buttons after I had given myself insulin that I had forgotten to take earlier. She walked up and said \u201cgive it to me. Phones aren\u2019t allowed in class\u201d and I simply replied \u201cthis is my insulin pump\u201d and she turned white as a sheet and kind of apologized before going back to her lesson.

            "This reminds me of when I was in elementary school. There was this epic bitch who was basically a glorified hall monitor. Everyone hated her because she was anxiously nasty. One day I was standing in the lunch line and I was turned around talking to my friends behind me. I think she and I were singing a little song we did in youth group that had an accompanying dance, and at a point in the song you're supposed to wave your hands and wiggle your body downward (hard to describe, but the point is I wiggled my bum). This bitch SHRIEKED at me from down the hallway and demanded I stand against the time-out wall (if you got put on the wall you had to wait silently in front of everyone and then get your food last). I was like \"what did I do??\" She said \"you know exactly what you did! You were rubbing your butt on that little boy!!\" I was completely flabbergasted because 1. I didn't know who she was talking about (the friend I'd been singing literal church songs with was a girl. Turns out she was referring to the kid in front of me in line) and 2. I was like 10 years old and had no idea why anyone would rub their butt on someone else. I tried to explain myself but she didn't let me say anything. I had to just stand on the wall and cry silently, completely mortified and embarrassed. \n\nI hope she's rotting in hell right now. People like that shouldn't be allowed anywhere near children. Unfortunately she adopted a family of 5 or so sibling foster kids, and they were the only black kids in our school. So not only were they singled out in school because of their skin and hair, but she was incredibly strict and mean to them and wouldn't let them go to any friend's houses or birthday parties.",

            "Did we go to the same school!?! I had an AP English teacher who would watch the halls like a hawk between classes. She LOVED to catch kids breaking dress code (usually something ridiculously tiny like a top shirt button undone or wearing short socks). As it was a private school, we had uniforms and girls mostly wore skirts. In the winter, it was VERY cold if you wore a skirt to school because you were only allowed panty hose (or at best some short shorts) underneath your skirt. Many girls wore warm leggings that they pulled up to hide under their skirt. One day, I was walking past her in the hall and she yelled out to me to, \"Come here, now!\" It was absolutely bone-chilling whenever she directed her attention at you, even during class. She struck fear into the hearts of all students. Truly. I had no clue why she'd stopped me. She said I was getting written up immediately. I still had no clue why. She pointed at my knee and said that's against the dress code. I pulled up my skirt slightly and she saw I was wearing a cloth knee brace because I'd dislocated my knee cap earlier in the week. Felt pretty damn good to see it suddenly dawn on her and the \"egg on her face\" look she gave me (even though there was not malicious on my side).",

Very engaging and passionate about what he did: a great class to have first period.\n\nWell, the class is all seniors, and it was the end of the year and finals were coming up, you know how that goes. Our school's schedule for finals was 2 periods/classes per day for 3 days. \n\nThe administration, wary of senioritis and kids skipping class, warned the teachers that they must hold class on the day of their scheduled final and that they cannot tell the students that they do not need to show up.\n\nSo my teacher, the week before finals gets up in front of the whole class and says,\n\n\"For our final, we will be watching a movie. Now, the administration has told me that I am not allowed to tell you that you do not have to show up to this final...\"\n\nHe stares at us and pauses for a few seconds.\n\n\"...so I will not do so.\"\n\nNeedless to say, I got some extra zzz's that finals week.",

            "Reminds me of a teacher I had once, but this would be malicious non-compliance, so sadly I can't post it here.\n\nI was in grade 12 chemistry class, with one of the best teachers in existence. This guy made everything fun, interesting, and accessible. He was clear, concise, didn't ramble, had multiple ways of explaining the same concept for people whose minds worked differently than others, etc.\n\nOne day we come into class, and he shows us a letter that he's been sent about how he needs to \"stop having explosions\" in his class, and to stop letting kids out of class early (we'd sometimes get out up to 5 minutes early if we'd finished the material for the day).\n\nSo the lesson for the day begins. He teaches us about electrolysis by running electricity through hydrogen peroxide (IIRC, may have just been H2O and not H2O2). He then demonstrates how explosive hydrogen is by igniting the collected hydrogen. He then shows us how the explosion has produced water.\n\nHe then goes away for a moment to fill up a large can (roughly a 1 gallon tin can) with methane gas. He had to go to another room, because the gas had been turned off in his room.\n\nHe promptly punched a hole in the can, lit the escaping gas on fire, and then demanded that we study it closely and write down what we observe about the fire as it burns.\n\nIt burns steadily for a few minutes, and then starts to weaken and sputter, sometimes nearly going out, sometimes coming back just as strong if not stronger than before.\n\nFinally, it seems like the flame is about to extinguish entirely, when suddenly, *BANG*, the can rockets about 3 feet into the air.\n\nHe's demonstrated to us how you can have a consistent and controlled burn of natural gas (methane), but as soon as the flame dips *inside* the container of gas, it will cause an explosion.\n\nAfter the class had settled down, he dismissed us.\n\nAll of this took about 20 minutes of the 55 minutes of class.\n\nMr. Licht, you taught me more in your classes than I learned in the rest of high school combined.",
            "Junior year of HS (1996).  \n\nLast week of school every year nearly everyone in the school brought in squirt guns and it was like a game of \"Gotcha\".  (Look it up ya damn kids and get off my lawn!!!)  The school was adamantly against squirt guns and teachers would confiscate them if you got caught.  I had an older lady for Lit who was as strict and by the books as could be.  Rumor was that she spent that week confiscating everything from everyone.  Lo and behold it was last class for the day on the last day of class, when someone got caught with a cheap clear plastic squirt gun trying to spray another kid without her seeing.  Ol Eagle Eye caught him and called him out...  And before anyone knew what was up, she pulls out two confiscated Super Soakers from under her desk and drenches the offender.  From that moment everyone pulled out their concealed squirt guns and it was a Battle Royale in the American Lit class.  As she emptied one, she picked up another and wreaked havoc on the class...  she had about 20 various sized squirt guns.  No one left that class dry.\n\nGreat time.",

So he stopped the bus on the side of the road with the lights flashing so the cars stop while someone runs across the road and into the store then the lights go off. When they come out driver turns the flashing lights on again so the doughnut getter can cross the busy road, and off we go.

He usually didn't care if we showed up a little late occasionally as long as it wasn't an ongoing issue and you actually did the work in the class.    \n\n\nOne day quite a few of the students were off on a trip to view colleges so the class attendance was very low.

            "When I was in high school, senior ditch day was taken very seriously and seniors would ditch after their first period. My first period was music class and I was the only freshman with everyone else being seniors. I didn\u2019t know that this class was usually saved for senior year because it was an easy A. So the day before senior ditch day my  music teacher says \u201cI know you\u2019re all seniors and are looking forward to tomorrow for reasons I cannot say nor encourage but I will say that I may or may not have plans tomorrow so enjoy yourselves.\u201d I thought he was joking and I didn\u2019t really think people really ditched on senior ditch day. I had always showed up for school, never ditched, and freshman year I didn\u2019t really make friends so I didn\u2019t pay any mind to it. I show up the next day, let myself into class and realize I\u2019m the first one to show up, even before the teacher. I take my seat and wait. 15 minutes pass and still no one shows and I think it\u2019s a bit odd but wait anyways. I\u2019ll add that back then I had a flip phone so I didn\u2019t have a real way to entertain myself. I start reading a book and the bell rings and yet there\u2019s no teacher or students. I\u2019m starting to wonder if I got the wrong classroom even though I know I\u2019m not. 10 minutes after the bell rings I go out to check the hallway and there\u2019s no one there. I\u2019m literally the only one in the room. As a naive freshman, I remember that it\u2019s senior ditch day but think surely the teacher will show up and maybe some other kids. 15 minutes into class, I hear the door open and I\u2019m like thank god! I\u2019ve been waiting for a good hour and see the teacher wit his coat on he seems really surprised to see me, so much so he had jumped when I spoke because he didn\u2019t see me right away. He says \u201cwhat are you doing here? It\u2019s senior ditch day\u201d and I say sheepishly that I\u2019m a freshman and he completely forgot that I wasn\u2019t a senior and we just stand there for 30 seconds until he says that he had already made plans for the day and was just coming to get his bag. I didn\u2019t know what to say and he says well you can leave if you want and I said I don\u2019t have anywhere to go really and he\u2019s stumped but then takes pity on me and says ok you can stay in the room and he put on the movie Fish Tales for me on the tv.

            "I signed up to be an aid my senior year for the math teacher I had for my sophomore year and also my freshman basketball coach. I would usually show up, grade papers for maybe 5 minutes and then he would just let me leave to work on homework. I could also just show up as late as I wanted and he generally never really gave me any work to do even if I was on time haha. One of my favorite teachers/coaches!",

            "Senior year of college, I still needed 8 math/science credits to graduate. Luckily for me, the state had *increased* the requirements to get certified as a teacher the year before (it either went into effect for new teachers that year, or was going to the next year), so the college had to scramble to create 2 new classes: \"Math For Education Majors I & II\".\n\nTo give an example of how bad the situation was (and the kind of teachers I had *before* college), the year before I had a roommate in a similar situation who the school allowed to skip the first semester class and go right into Part II his last semester. The first night, he came home with a homework assignment that went like this:\n\n* Put these numbers into ascending numerical order: 4, 9, 32, 17, 6, 13\n\nand I got to spend a whole semester learning math that was *pre-that*.\n\nNeedless to say, the old saw about those who can't held true, and by the spring everyone else in the class (I was the only non-ed-major) was struggling to pass a class that never got beyond multiplying proper fractions. The professor, who had a Ph.D in actual math, was being leaned on by the college brass to pass these kids though, so around April she came up with a compromise -- the final grade for the class was being determined by an equal-20%-weighted 4 regular exams and a final, so she announced that everyone could just drop their lowest and she'd only average the other 4. Having aced all 4 up to that point, I asked \"What if someone doesn't take the final?\" and was told that would result in getting a 0 for that test, so I made sure to get her to clarify that the final was also droppable like the other 4, which it was.\n\nThose are the people who've been teaching everyone else I know's kids for the last 2 decades.",

            "During my time teaching at universities the administration required that the students be given makeup classes on several occasions, I made clear that attendance for both periods would be taken at the beginning of the first period and that being marked present or sick was the only grade qualifier for that makeup period. I had to be present during both periods. There were between 5 and 30 students in each class. Only once in 15 years did any student come to the makeup class & that became an extremely interesting one to one tutorial on phone, tablet and computer security, incidentally the class was a foreign language speech and debate one, so technically it could be argued that it was on topic and was certainly beneficial. \n\nI was constantly amazed at the lack of security knowledge of my students.",

            "We had a similar thing in High School, classmates asked if we could have a look at blood under the microscope.

            "I just remembered that I don\u2019t think I took a single final senior year. \n\nI got all A\u2019s (not a flex. I grew up to regret my wasted youth) and anyone with an A in the class didn\u2019t have to take the final. It was a senior perk I think they called it. It was intended to get kids to actually do work their senior year. Most kids knew they were or weren\u2019t going to college and so it was for the college bound kids to work hard to try and get a reprieve while the non-college bound kids finally got their comeuppance for wasting their time. \n\nWe can argue the ethics of the situation, but idc honestly. \n\nNo finals. Fucking awesome.",
            "My high school Spanish teacher, day before the final went over how the final would count for 5% of our grade and then very specifically went over the entire class and whose grade the final would actually make a difference for. I had a solid B. If I got 100% on the final I\u2019d end up with a solid B. If I got 0% I\u2019d still end up with a solid B. \n\nWe still had to show up (boarding school) but it sure made that final go by a lot fasfer",

If you had that as an honors classes you got a 3 point curve/bonus so only had to have an 86.5 or better. Ap classes had a 5 pt curve so an 84.5 or better would mean no finals. Senior year was the first year I had no finals at all.",
