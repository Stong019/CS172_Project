        "selftext": "This happened back in 2009. I was working part time at a doctor\u2019s office while I was in nursing school. I was one of the receptionists and did all the filing and cataloguing and such. It was boring work, but the doctor (my boss) guaranteed me a job after nursing school so that\u2019s why I did it. \n\nThis particular doctor was an orthopedic surgeon. We had lots of patients coming in for MRIs, CT scans, and X-rays. This one particular patient, Frank, was scheduled to have surgery in a couple days and he needed to come and pick up his MRIs and X-rays from our office and bring them with him to his procedure (yes, looking back at how ass-backwards things used to be is so frustrating... all these things are 100% electronic now, and even back then they were too, but my boss was old-school). So anyway, I called Frank to tell him to come pick up his images but he didn\u2019t answer. I called him again during lunch, but still no answer, so I left him a message. The following day I called him again, but still no answer.\n\nIt was imperative that Frank got his images or else he wouldn\u2019t be able to have his surgery. So I looked in his file to see if he had any other contact information. He listed his home phone number, as well as his wife\u2019s cell. I called his house and left a message, and I also called his wife, Amy, but she didn\u2019t answer either so I left her a message as well. The office manager, Diane, told me to just call whoever was listed in his emergency contacts because if Frank didn\u2019t get his images and missed his surgery, then she would have to do a whole new stack of paperwork to reschedule him and she didn\u2019t want to be bothered. I looked to see if there was an emergency contact, and Frank listed a woman named Helen. Relation to patient?: girlfriend.\n\nI told Diane I didn\u2019t want to call Helen when I had already left a message for Amy, as it would put me in an awkward position. Diane said that as long as the patient listed them as an emergency contact, I could call them. She also said that it\u2019s not uncommon for couples to be separated but still legally married for insurance reasons, and that this could possibly be the case for Frank and Amy, which I guess made sense. I really wanted to believe that no one would be stupid enough to put their secret lover as their emergency contact. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to get fired for being insubordinate, so I called Helen and she actually answered her phone (I was secretly hoping she wouldn\u2019t) and told her Frank\u2019s images needed to be picked up prior to his surgery. She came by during lunch, got the images, and then left. I immediately called Frank again to let him know that Helen picked up his images and to not worry about it, but this fool wasn\u2019t answering his phone, so I left him another message.\n\nA couple hours later, Amy called back and said she wasn\u2019t able to answer before because she was teaching, but she got our message and was coming to pick up Frank\u2019s images now that school was done for the day. I told her that the images had already been picked up. I tried to be as vague as possible.\n\nAmy: Who picked them up? I know Frank is still busy at his office and hasn\u2019t had the chance to come get them.\n\nMe: [again, trying really hard to be vague] We called someone from his emergency contact list.\n\nAmy: Was it his brother, Steve? \n\nMe: [at this point I\u2019m really nervous] No, not his brother.\n\nAmy: Well then who?\n\nMe: Helen.\n\nAmy: Who is Helen? I don\u2019t know anyone named Helen.\n\nMe: I\u2019m not sure, but since she was on Frank\u2019s emergency contact list and no one else was answering their phone, we called her and she already came and got the images. \n\nConfused, Amy hung up. \n\nThe following day was Frank\u2019s surgery. The day after Frank\u2019s surgery, my boss jokingly asked me \u201cWhat the hell did you do to that guy?? He came in all pissed at me saying that my secretary told his wife about his other girlfriend.\u201d I told my boss what happened and that Diane told me to call the girlfriend, and he understood. Diane tried to throw me under the bus by saying I didn\u2019t tell her that Helen was Frank\u2019s girlfriend, and that I had told her Helen was \u201cjust a friend,\u201d and that she never would have given me the green light to call a patient\u2019s mistress, but I reminded her in front of my boss that she had said it was possible for Frank and Amy to be married but separated. This bitch was trying to cover her ass because she probably thought it was some kind of HIPAA violation, but nothing ever happened. I was 18 years old at the time and just did whatever my superiors told me because I was really thirsty for job security after college, but I ended up not working there and went to work at a hospital instead.",

That was impossible since they were still together and it wasn\u2019t open enrollment. He ended up just adding the baby after it was born.

She said she was his girlfriend. Thing is, we insured this man's wife and kids, their family homes, etc. When the girlfriend was signing her new client form, it said at the top \"Referred by: Wife & Husband LastName\". She asked why his ex wife's name was listed and my assistant simply told her the form fills itself in when we associate a referral to the account that refers them, and left it at that. \n\nSo now comes time to send the thank you cards, which are always worded \"Thank you for referring your friend/brother/mother/boyfriend etc. NAME...\" and a personal note. Well I told my assistant not to send this one out, but apparently the owner didn't see the issue and made her send it out anyway.\n\nCue 3 months later and we are having to split up and rewrite all their insurance cause the wife threw his ass out and was keeping their house. Girlfriend dumped him too, since apparently he had told her they were already divorced. He actually had the stones to blame us and threaten to sue. Obviously that got shut down swiftly, but it was a wild scene to watch unfolding.",

Normally the company only allows relatives to work in different departments, but exceptions have been made. The bad bit was I outed him as having an affair with a subordinate which was a big no-no. He got fired for it a couple of days later.",

            "In the early 90\u2019s I used to run the Security Department at a busy DT hotel, we also handled the lost & found. One day a very expensive Patel Phillipe wrist watch was found in the bathroom of a guest room by the maid after the guest checked out. This was in the days before cellphones and email, but our department also had a non contact policy for L&F items to preserve the privacy of our guests.\n\nValuable items in the L&F required an incident report and then they were locked in the safe of the general cashier. The Junior Comptroller did some research and found this watch was worth more than $96 000.00 USD so he decided, all by himself, to contact the guy, perhaps expecting a reward. He looked up the info on the guest folio, called the guest but left a message.\n\nWhen the guest called back his call was directed to me and he was livid. The name on the folio, Adrian, was somewhat gender ambiguous, it turned out that was his secretaries name, but the number listed was his home phone. So the Jr Comp left a message on his answering machine identifying the hotel but using his Mistress\u2019 name, which his wife heard. He had told her he was on a solo business trip to an entirely different city. He was threatening a lawsuit.\n\nEventually he calmed down and didn\u2019t sue us. We shipped the watch back to him via special courier that cost the hotel $2500 and the Junior Comptroller is prolly flipping burgers in Nebraska. Who leaves a watch worth a house behind? Who wears one in the first place?",

While cleaning a room a housekeeper found a man\u2019s wedding ring that was left behind, so she reported it to her superior right away. Obviously our head housekeeper wanted to return the ring to its owner as soon as possible so she called the number on his file. Well apparently he had put his home number down and his wife answered the phone, who had no idea that her husband had spent the previous night at a local hotel. Although it was never our intention and everyone acted as per policy, I\u2019m really happy we were able to expose the truth to this poor woman.",

            "When I was a young dude\u2014like 22, 23, 24\u2014I was the managing editor of a magazine. I was pretty much in charge of the day-to-day operation of the business and the lives of about 14 editors and designers. Among my non-editorial duties was to file HR paperwork with corporate since we didn't have an HR person in our office (they were all in the larger offices in New York). \n\nHR paperwork included PTO for employees, but I never filed so much as a sick day for anyone on my team. \n\nSee, we were working in a high-stress, high-demand occupation. Deadlines in print media are real, and it wasn't uncommon for my guys to work multiple 18-hour days to make an issue. Hell, I slept under my desk during my tenure more times than I could count, and I could guarantee losing at least one full weekend a month to deadline responsibilities. \n\nThe company gave us \"comp\" time after deadlines, but that was unofficial. If you worked through the weekend to make an issue, you were allowed to take two days off during the week. The idea was ok, I guess, but you can't bank comp time. It was use it or lose it, and since we liked our jobs and wanted to be good at them, hardly anybody took advantage of comp time. \n\nThe company gave us about 10 days a year (you got 15 after five years with the firm) in vacation. There may have been another 5 in sick and personal time. Nobody could ever take a proper vacation\u2014going away for a full week straight\u2014because the job made it impossible. When people took time, it was like a day or two here and there to bridge a holiday like Thanksgiving or to extend a weekend for a short trip back home.\n\nWe were all young guys back then (hardly anybody was older than mid-20s), and most of us were single, but we did have a few married guys on the team. One of them, the lead designer, wanted to take a proper, two-week vacation to an exotic location during a slower time of the year. We were excited for him and envious. He worked hard, and he did everything you could ask a guy do to pave the way for being out of the office for two weeks straight. He had everything in order, including his pre-filled out PTO paperwork. \n\nI could have easily slipped his form into the inter-office mail envelope so he could be square with HR, but I didn't. As far as I was concerned, he earned the time and the cushion if something were to happen to his job.\n\nAnd something did happen to his job. Two weeks after he returned from vacation, management closed the office and moved the magazine to the other side of the country. Some of our guys took relocation packages. Some, like the designer, couldn't. Fortunately, all the guys on my team who watched their jobs move away were paid out with 15 full days of unclaimed PTO upon severance with the company.",

It would save them a little cash, but ALMOST any correction from me was treated with belligerence and immediate hostility. They KNEW what they wanted. How dare I ...\n\nI was there for maybe a month before I completely gave up. I got to the point where as soon as I heard \"turkey bagel\" I'd reply quickly \"Great! A Tasty Turkey? What bagel would you like that on?\" \n\nId deliberately stage that as a question.

My brother, being stoic and nonconfrontational, just walked away and let her rant to the bartender, who was the one that took her order originally. Not sure what ended up happening because it wasn't my brother's problem.\n\nIt's just ridiculous though how people are so insistent on things being done \"their way\".

As my next shift started in less than 12 hours and we were short staffed as it is, I didn't want to call in sick, but I knew there was no way I'd be able to stand/walk on it for a whole day. I called my manager to explain and to ask if I could a) switch to the register for a few days, which involved much less walking than my regular role, and b) borrow one of the bar stools to sit on behind the counter so I wasn't putting too much weight on it.\n\nI figured this wouldn't be a problem as we had other staff who could cover the floor and there's no issues with access around the register that the chair could get in the way of: I was wrong. Manager insisted that he wouldn't sign off on me having a chair without a signed doctors note verifying my injury, even after I sent him photos of my wrecked ankle.\n\nAs my GP was already closed, I headed to the 24 hour walk in clinic. An x-ray and a lot of poking and prodding later, the doctor told me I had to ice it every few hours until the swelling went down (which took almost a week) and keep all weight off it for at least a week, and wear a brace for another 2 weeks after that. When I explained what I did for a living, the doctor presented me with a lovely note explaining that I shouldn't be at work at all for at least 7 days.\n\nI wish I could have seen my managers face when I called to explain that I didn't need the chair after all as actually I wouldn't be in work for the rest of the week and most of next week, doctors orders. Funnily enough I was never asked to produce a doctors note again for the rest of the time I worked there.\n\nEDIT: not to be *that* person but this is my first time getting gold so thanks guys! You'll be pleased to hear that several years later my ankle heeled with zero longterm affects and I'm now in management myself, hopefully treating staff a lot better than I was treated. Also as SO MANY of you have pointed out, please go to the doctor if you injure yourself regardless of whether or not a dickhead manager demands it or not.\n",

The note was to allow for a partial remote work schedule until I could get my injury and nerve pain under control. Still never called out sick throughout the entire ordeal, and I even stayed hours past when I was supposed to so I could make sure everything still got done that needed to in a certain timeframe. No explanation why there was such a delay in the process, or why my needs were nowhere near met based on the doctor\u2019s note. \n\nLets fast forward 8 months when I have my manager\u2019s inbox (after he left the company) with all of the correspondence between various colleagues and teammates describing  \u201cserious reservations\u201d about allowing the WFH schedule.

            "Perhaps your manager is still a jerk but I would have told you the same thing.  As a manager in a very by-the-book company in America, we are expected to get a doctor's note for every accommodation (must sit, can only lift so much, etc) which also includes the duration.  This protects both the company and the individual.  The company can't be said to be showing favoritism by allowing accommodations for one person but not another, and doesn't have a bogus issue milked by a lying employee (normally).  The individual makes sure they are following the most appropriate treatment to heal as fast as possible and may be able to work a different position temporarily to still earn full pay and not burn time off.  The size of business may play a part here (mine's on the bigger side), but I think it would be a smart policy for a smaller business to follow as well.",

        "selftext": "TLDR: >!Call centre removes limits on calls in order to raise customer satisfaction. I spend a month stretching my calls to be 4 hours long and make off like a bandit in the process!<\n\nA brief story from my time in a telecoms contact centre. I worked for a rather large Australian provider that everyone knows and actively hates, mostly because its fun to hate them. In this story we were doing outbound calls to transition people onto the new NBN network. (for those of you unfamiliar with Australia's internet, it was 3rd world, literally, we were slower than Nigeria until we rolled out the NBN and upgraded to slightly faster 3rd world speeds...) Also worth mentioning, much like the company I worked for, the NBN was universally hated. Cause it was shit. Nuff said.\n\nAnyway like all call centres we had a bunch of miserable hoops to jump through in order to bring our paycheck up to a level that could be considered humane. Our capitalist overlords refer to these hoops as KPI's. (Key Performance Indicators for the blissfully ignorant)\n\nAnyway with the new campaign came a new set of KPI's. Conversion rate, active call time, after call time and customer satisfaction were the KPI's of the day.\n\nNow these KPI's were normally all fucking bullshit. You needed to meet some fucking god teir numbers in order to collect a half decent paycheck. However in this particular case there was loophole. See due to the controversial nature of the NBN we were told to focus on quality over quantity. They wanted \"An excellent customer experience\" and the new KPI's were a reflection of that. As such quantity of conversions was not a KPI and when I questioned if we had time limits on calls I was told \"We don't care what you do but long calls means a good experience so keep them on the line and get them switched over\"\n\nAnd so began the best work month I had at that soul trap. See before entering coms I was a salesman in aged care, and a pretty good one at that. And you know that stereo type of old people talking for eternity and beyond? Its a stereotype for a reason. Each morning I would log in, volunteer for the aged clientele campaign (which was easy because they were normally the hardest people to convert, fearful of scams, technology and such, so not many people wanted to do it) And then I would start to chat.\n\nSee when speaking with the elderly all it takes is a well placed poke or 2 and you can literally have them speak for hours. So for the next month, I took 2 - 4 calls a day (down from 20-30), had almost zero after call time (the calls were so long i didn't need it), had an 80% conversion rate and 90% customer satisfaction (turns out people tend to like you after you take the time to listen to them). Each phone call (assuming I wasn't told to fuck off upon introducing myself) would last 2 to 3 hours minimum, with my record being a 7 hour call to a lovely bloke named Stan. (he told some great war stories)\n\nI ended up doubling my normal paycheck. And my managers, while not being entirely happy with my nonsense, put up with it because at the end of the day... those were the rules and KPI's we were given. I got my paycheck, the oldies got a good chat and my employer got to pay through the nose. Happy endings for all.\n\nI proceeded to hand in my resignation once KPI's went back to normal. Which I, to this day, regard as one of the best decisions I ever made.\n\nEdit: Obligatory edit to thank yall for the awards. Much Love <3\n\nEdit: Obligatory edit number 2, so yall have showered me in more awards than I have received in my entire time on Reddit. Which honestly isn't saying much given I haven't been here too long, but hey, its the thought that counts. Big preesh all yall. ",

All it really did was piss off customers. \n\n\nAnyways I hated asking for donations. We were supposed to ask everyone but most people would get pissed either saying \u201cI already donated or it\u2019s already so expensive.\u201d \nSo I never asked.  I did everything else perfectly and customers loved me. There were customers that would wait in line to see me rather that go to my coworkers with no line. Eventually it got to the point where my bosses would talk to me everyday about not asking for donations. One day my boss stood and bagged for me just so she could force me to ask people. Well this one customer who always chose my line saw that my boss was forcing me to ask people. Right before I got to the dreaded question he put up his hand and said \u201cI\u2019m gonna donate to the drive your the only cashier that hasn\u2019t asked me a hundred fucking times,\u201d he then pulled out a couple hundred dollars and handed it to me. I smiled so fucking hard and looked at my boss who was PISSED. The next customer said something similar and gave me a $20. It ended up putting me in second place for the donation drive and my bosses stopped bugging me after that. \n\n\nThe next donation drive the new tactic was to ask for one week and then to stop and make it a silent drive. Surprise it worked just as well. The charitable people who wanted to donate every time would ask if we were still doing the donation drive and the people who didn\u2019t want to be bugged opted to donate one big time and never be asked again. Despite being threatened with a lower raise when I first got in trouble I got my full raise at the end of the year. My bosses hated me for being right though so they denied every application I put in for promotion.",

There was so much fucking incompetence at the management level, especially around KPIs. \n\nI could tell you some horror stories about the outright criminality that caused me to quit, but more relevant to KPIs: one day I had to explain to our acting centre manager how averages worked. We were a 24/7 division, so the guys on the graveyard shift would understandably only take single-digit calls on a quiet night, where the day shift was bombarded - often with transfers and wholesalers who were in-and-out, refer to specialist. \n\nProblem was, our centre manager was holding all shifts to the same standard. Same expectations on volumes and handling time. \n\nIt took me a few minutes drawing up a hypothetical day of calls to show exactly what a 45min call can do to an average when you only have six other calls in the day, and the light of understanding fiiiiinally dawned on her face... and she must have then dusted off her ill-used imagination to figure how she would present that to the directors, because that expression of enlightenment turned to brief panic and then shit down into robotic neutrality as she muttered, \u201cWell be that as it may, it\u2019s still unacceptable and we\u2019re not wearing it.\u201d\n\nI think that\u2019s the moment I decided the entire place was irredeemable and starting seriously thinking about quitting. \n\nNot long after that, this same fucking genius declares via ultimatum that no software troubleshooting will extend beyond a certain time. Anything longer than that would require a truck roll. Of course, this meant that people with more time-consuming solutions (often uninstalling Norton\u2019s and upgrading WinXP service packs) were days later sent a tech who knew how to do none of it, and required to call in and start a new ticket. Management considered this win:win because tech visits didn\u2019t come out of our department\u2019s budget. \n\nI was vindicated to hear that a few years after I left that call centre was shut down due to incompetence.",

I can 100% say you are right regarding older people wanting to chat and it improving the experience.\n\nI\u2019ve been in my role for over 10+ years and my talk time has always been high, but for two important reasons:\n\n1.) Customers want to feel heard, so actively listening to the customers issues, using genuine empathy and relating it to what they have told you gains their trust and even if it doesn\u2019t result in say a monetary gain for the company, at least the customer feels heard by the company (or someone at it) and the positive experience is the difference between a customer bad mouthing the company or not which impacts future customer potential.\n\n2.) Listening and asking open ended questions can resolve 95% of issues. I cannot count how many times listening and taking the time to review a customers needs can dramatically improve the experience and reduce callbacks since the majority of people rarely call for every issue or grievance so it piles up.\n\nIt\u2019s especially important since most customers are going through so much already so if you can make them feel heard and recognize their time is valuable it goes a long way.",

        "selftext": "Worked for a shitty airline company. Let\u2019s just make up a name... United Blairlines. At this company they started a smaller company that could hire and train people to run the planes, but pay them way less at certain airports. Where my colleagues at other airports were making over $20/hr, I was getting paid $10.25 for the same- and sometimes more- work. It honestly would scare you to know how little the people who are the ones that make sure your plane takes off safely are paid. All of us had two to three jobs to be able to pay rent, and we were all in the job for the benefits- free flights to anywhere in the country- on standby. Anyway I had a boss, we\u2019ll call him Jim. I could tell many stories on how terrible of a boss he was, but this one has actual malicious compliance. \n\nI had to go to the hospital from the airport because of intense pain in my stomach. It turns out that because of stress caused by that job, my intestines decided to stop functioning. Anyway I spend the day in the hospital and then they gave me a note saying that I didn\u2019t have to work the next two days. I told Jim\u2019s boss that (since I hated talking to Jim) When I went back into work three days later. We had five people total to load all luggage, load the water, and push out five planes in a little over an hour. Already an incredible amount of work for so few people. We had our morning work meeting to discuss how fucked we were, then Jim asked me into his office. \u201cYour attendance is unacceptable.\u201d He said. Dumbfounded, I asked what he meant. \u201cYou\u2019ve been late a couple of times, and now missing the past three days...\u201d I said \u201cJim, I have the note from the hospital. According to work policy, that shouldn\u2019t affect my attendance.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care what work policy says. I\u2019m going to fire you.\u201d Again I cited work policy since we were \u201cprotected\u201d by a union. I said \u201cJim you have to give me an attendance warning before you\u2019re allowed to fire me for attendance. This is the first time I\u2019m hearing about attendance, so you can\u2019t fire me right now.\u201d Jim said \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter, I\u2019m going to give you a warning right now, and when I get back from vacation next week, you\u2019re going to be fired, now go back to work, my decision is final.\u201d So, I told my coworkers what happened. Then I decided alright well if next week he\u2019s firing me, I\u2019ll just leave now. Even though their day was about to be fucked since now four people were working five planes, they all said fuck this place, get out of here! So I left and went to get breakfast (this all happened at 4am.) \n\nAs I\u2019m enjoying my meal, Jim calls me. I happily ignore. He calls three more times and then texts me, asking where I was at. I told him \u201cyou fired me, why would I keep working for you?\u201d No response. I try to soak in the sight of Jim running between planes like a chicken with his head cutoff. I don\u2019t imagine any plane took off on time that morning. I get a call from HR, and the union rep, and the General manager, who is Jim\u2019s boss. They all said Jim was wrong and asked me if I could come back to work it out. But quitting felt so good, and I felt such weight lifted off my shoulders thinking about not working there anymore, so I never went back.\n\nSome more info. Although this isn\u2019t so satisfying, it\u2019s more a testament of United Blairlines complete lack of ethics... Jim got in really big trouble when he\nhad a guy who had a shoulder injury and had a note and told Jim several times he couldn\u2019t do super heavy labor. Jim sent him to the bag room by himself anyway. Imagine having to lift 300-700 50-70 pound bags over your head per hour all while running between bag carts and the belt. Needless to say the guy tore his shoulder and had to get surgery on it. They still didn\u2019t fire Jim. Instead they \u201cpromoted\u201d him to manage the workers who did ticketing and no manual labor. As far as I know, Jim still works for United. My coworker still cannot move the way he used to two years later.",

        "selftext": "tldr: HR reject holiday request despite it being within the rules so I now maliciously push the rules to take a ridiculous number of days leave.\n\nI work in a UK company that has a very good leave policy. I get 27 days annual leave and I can also build up flexitime and take up to 2 flexi days off per month. In addition, due to a screw up in HR, I am allowed to float all my public holidays; I was moved to a joint venture company for tax and legal purposes and when they took me back into the parent company they just adopted my contract from that company instead of getting me to sign a new one.\n\nOne day I put in a leave request for 3 leave days and 2 flexi days. HR person denied it as, she said, it was against the rules to mix flexi and normal leave days. The rules had changed some time ago to allow mixing but HR person told me that it was against the rules.\n\nI took it higher and her decision was overturned but she did not like it one little bit. Thereafter, whenever I submitted a request with mixed leave she rejected it out of spite claiming that it was not in the spirit of the rules. It is an interesting view into her mindset that she refused instead of asking how she could do it too. She was all about stopping me so the fight began.\n\nEaster was coming up and I was due to take 2 weeks off. The middle Friday of my holiday was also the end of my leave month and the Monday started a new month so I put in for 2 public holidays carried over from Christmas, 2 flexi days and a good Friday public holiday  and since the second week was a new leave month I used another 2 days of flexi, plus the public holiday Easter Monday and 1 day of public holiday from the start of the year. So my 14 days holiday in the sun cost me a single Friday which is 5 hours of leave time. She went ballistic but could do nothing despite trying to find any way to stop the request.\n\nAs a direct result of her trying to stop me I now make a point of building up and using as much flexi leave as I can just to see her pretending to smile as I hand in my request to her directly every single time. She grits her teeth so much I expect her to break a jaw. In 2019 I peaked and managed almost 60 days of leave all thanks to her. Maybe I should thank her.  \n\n\nUpdate: Wow thanks for the response and awards. Still new to Reddit so this is a bit overwhelming. It is always nice to hear different views from people around the world but I am amazed at the responses from the US regarding how few days leave you guys get. That's truly shocking that some of you get no time off at all.\n\nThanks all.",

            "Worked for the US government.  When I was hired decades ago they revised the civil service system.  We used to be able to add unused sick leave to our working time for retirement calculation (let's say you worked 30 years and had 1 year unused sick leave so you worked 31 years for your pension calculation).  They did away with this for new hires.  Decades later they were wondering why people were using up their sick leave (duh) and brought back the old calculation (the actual cost to the government turned out to be 25% of the cost of paying out the sick leave).  This was reinstated 4 years before I retired.  We use the local HR to do the paperwork though the agency HR (in another state) does the approval (we could skip the local HR in the process but it is somewhat easier to go through them).  Anyway, I go to the local HR office to find out my estimated pension and the person excludes my sick leave.  I told them about the reinstatement but they didn't believe me.  I made them look it up on-line at the Federal retirement site and they finally accepted it.  Morons!

She insisted it didn't work that way, I pointed out her way meant that nobody could have a week off until half way through the year leading to everyone having to fight for time off the last half, still wouldn't budge or check with someone higher up. I checked my legal position and I was told I was correct, she disputed that too.\n\nI happened to go to another town to visit my parents and there was a manpower office on the high street, so I went in there and asked them what the deal was with accruing leave.

Not to mention that it was way cheaper than flying there: compare maybe 100 euro in gas/parking with \\~2000 euro + a few cabs.\n\nThey got actually mad at me, that no special behavior would be tolerated, and I should do like anyone else.\n\nKicker of the story: I had to eventually stay there for 6 days, after the return flight had to be rescheduled 2 times. I remember I had 800 euro for cab fares in my expense note.\n\nThat was the day I decided I'd be my own boss and no longer deal with the stupidity, and have been freelancing ever since.",

            "Sounds like a similar boneheaded policy at one of my previous employers. When I got hired, they just paid per diem for travel and we didn't have to provide any receipts unless it was an extraordinary expense -- if you spent a night somewhere, you got paid per diem for that location. The company merged with another company and my region ended up under new managers. One of the first things they changed was no more per diem -- we had to provide credit card receipts for everything we wanted to get paid for.  I asked the VP in our area why they changed it: \"I'm sure you guys like banking that extra money from per diem, eh?\" came his response. Yes, all of us engineers who are getting paid near or over 6 figures are squirreling away an extra $20/day by eating cup o' soup instead of real food.\n\nThe best part? The expense limits for meals were $15/$25/$45 for breakfast, lunch, dinner, which is much higher than per diem in pretty much all of the areas that we worked in ($45-$55/day). Since we only needed to provide credit card receipts and not itemized receipts, I started eating a lot better when I traveled. Chili's or Applebee's instead of Whataburger for lunch. Instead of Panera for dinner, I'd hit Texas Roadhouse and get a nice steak with a couple of beers. On top of my extra nice meals, they had to pay someone to sort through the piles of receipts that I had to provide for those meals.",

Normally if you get day or week passes you can get a receipt, or if you go up to a staffed booth in a metro or something. All things considered the $500 probably wasn't too expensive a lesson for them for a week long trip.

            "Doctors of Nova Scotia came up with a pretty great letter for physicians to use:\n\n\u201cRequest for medical/sick note: Letter to employer\n \nNote: The below content can be cut and pasted, and modified to suit the individual physician.\n \nDear Employer,\n \nOne of your employees visited me to obtain a medical or sick note to satisfy your company\u2019s absenteeism policy. Employers with a sick note policy for missed time put an added burden on the health-care system.\n \nPeople seeking sick notes \u2013 who otherwise wouldn\u2019t see a doctor \u2013 end up in physicians\u2019 offices, walk-in clinics and emergency department waiting rooms. There, they may spread germs to pregnant women, frail elderly people, cancer patients and babies \u2013 all of whom are vulnerable to communicable diseases.\n \nIn most cases, the best remedy for a patient with an isolated illness (such as a gastrointestinal virus, influenza or a common cold) is to stay home, rest and drink fluids. Visiting a doctor\u2019s office or an emergency room for a medical note does not support their recovery. Sometimes, employees seek a sick note after they have recovered from their illness, so I have to issue a note based on trust.\n \nEmployees seeking sick notes reduce access for those patients who really need to see me, and increase the three to four hours per day of paperwork that I do already. Both have a direct impact on patient care. In addition, providing medical notes is a non-insured service, not funded by Medical Services Insurance. I find it difficult to charge my patients for a requirement demanded by their employer.\n \nIf you continue to require a physician to authorize your employees\u2019 absenteeism, your employees must submit a written request from your organization for the medical note. Upon providing the service I will invoice your company $_____ per medical note. This is standard practice to fulfill non-medically necessary services for third-party organizations.\n \nAs Canadians we are lucky to have our health-care system, but citizens\u2019 inability to access the system\u2019s services in a timely fashion is a growing problem. Health-care providers, business operators, governments and individuals must work together to ensure its sustainability.  \n \nI hope you will consider changing your current absenteeism policy to help reduce the unnecessary burden on our health-care system and improve access for all Nova Scotians.\n \nSincerely,\n \n \nPHYSICIAN SIGNATURE\u201d\n\nBam, peanut butter and jam!",

I got the flu last year and only had 1 sick day left. I was out for a week with a doctors note... I had to apply for FMLA leave, then short term disability, and got denied for it like 2 weeks after I had returned.

He did it.\n\nI walked back to the shopping center, while on the phone to my at the time gf, laughing about it. As I was walking in, the almighty CEO (of 4 small coffee shops, including a kiosk) walked out. \n\n\"Hey, you don't look sick at all!\"\n\n*exaggarated fake cough* \"Yeah, heres my certificate that you demanded.\"\n\nShe takes a look at it, starts fuming, but walks away cause she can't do shit. I quit about a week later, mid shift, when the chef deliberately sprayed me with water from the hose at the sink for absolutely no reason.\n\n",
            "Reminds me of when I was a manager at a movie theater. If you were sick, you had to get someone to cover your shift and if you didn't get your shift covered a doctor's note was required. If you didn't get a doctor's note, then you would be fired. Yeah it sucks, but that's the job.",

            "Y'all are acting like its ridiculous to require a doctor's note. But you obviously haven't manged people who will try to get away with lies. I had someone who told me they had to work from home, doctor's orders. So we went through the proper procedures to get the doctor to write out what accommodations they needed, we would work with them to figure out how to make it work. Nope, once the doctor saw how legit we were, he didn't fill out anything. Evidently, he never said \"you're required to work from home.\" \n\nNow my friend has someone who told her they were exposed to whooping cough so they had to be at home for 5 days. Nope, that's not how it works. If you're actually sick, sure, you can stay home. But we don't serve children so there's no real danger from someone who has simply been exposed to it. \n\nBut without a written policy, you can't call these fakers on their shenanigans. You have to treat everyone equally under the policy.",

            "Good on you and your doctor!  My doctor wrote a similar note to my boss once:  I worked in a grocery store as a cashier, and came down with pinkeye.  The doctor told me that I was one hundred percent not allowed to go to work because that would be a serious health code violation.  He prescribed me antibiotic eyedrops and said I should be fine to work my next shift in a couple days, but today's shift was out of the question.  Since I'd only be missing one shift and my employer didn't require a note unless I was missing three shifts in a row, I didn't ask for one.\n\nAs soon as I got home I called the store and told the assistant store manager (who was the manager on duty at the time) that I wouldn't be able to work my shift that evening because I had pinkeye.  She insisted that I come in anyway because they needed me.  I refused, saying that I wasn't going to be responsible for the store being fined or shut down, and she told me if I didn't have a doctor's note when I came in for my next shift I'd be fired.\n\nI asked my doctor to write a note, and he requested that I come pick it up at the clinic, if possible.  Turns out he had some very choice words for her.  He pointed out that she was knowingly ordering someone with a highly contagious infection to handle other peoples' food, and getting through the checkout line a little bit faster wasn't worth bacterial conjunctivitis or food poisoning so no one would thank her for it.  Said he was well aware of the company's policy on doctor's notes since many of his patients worked there, and she was way out of line requiring me to get one for a single day's absence.  Capped it off by saying that if she ever again demanded that someone under his care come to work after he explicitly told them not to, he'd report her to the relevant authorities himself.  Then he CC'd the store manager--actually wrote a CC: line on the note--and I agreed to deliver that copy as well.\n\nThe story doesn't really have a happy ending, though.  She continued to give me crap until I left for greener pastures, eventually got promoted to store manager herself, and as far as I know still works there."
