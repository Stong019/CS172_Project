Since neither my wife and I get to spend much time with them, we decided to rent a house for a couple of days in a nearby wine region. You know: hang out, drink some wine, eat some cheese and have some quality family time. It had been 3 years since we last saw them.\n\nA month or so before my parents and sister came over I got an email from the owners of the vacation house saying that they had sold the property, but the new owners were going to continue to rent out the house and they were going to honour the booking, so not to worry. All good. Two weeks later I got an email from the new owners saying the booking was still okay, but they were going over their records and said I still owed them $100 for the booking. I replied back with the receipt and booking confirmation that I was all paid up. Turns out the new owners unilaterally decided to increase the price of the accommodation, and I had to pay up. But they were gracious enough to say I could cancel at no cost but they'd rather we'd keep the booking and pay that little extra.\n\nNo cost for cancelling the booking you say? Within 5 minutes I had found another vacation house in the same region, there's literally dozens of them. I sent a quick email back to please cancel my booking and process the refund.\n\n\"We'd like you to keep the booking. Can we split the difference?\"\n\n\"No thanks. Please cancel the booking.\"\n\n\"If you keep the booking, we'll throw in a bottle of wine!\"\n\n\"No thanks. Please cancel the booking.\"\n\nGood thing the refund came back with days.\n\nTheir reviews have been less than stellar on tripadvisor. I wonder why...",

            "I had a similar experience. My wife and I booked an AirBnB and a month after booking, 1 week before the trip, the owner said they had increased rates and wanted us to pay more. I said no so they asked me to cancel, I once again said no. Airbnb charges a penalty of $50 to bnb owners for cancelling on guests and if they do it enough times Airbnb will delist them. I also think that if they cancel on a guest they can't rent to another person during the same timeframe. They were trying to get me to cancel to avoid any negative repercussions.\n\nThey then offered me $40 to cancel the booking. I replied I would cancel the booking for $100. They said I was being unfair so I explained that they were in fact the one being unfair and that I knew they were trying to circumvent Airbnb rules. They cancelled within minutes of my reply.",
            "Idiots... It's not honoring a booking if you change the price post facto!",
            "Definitely better to cancel even if they came back and said ignore the request. I did an Airbnb where I booked a room with a shared common area for a semester of school, they accepted. The next morning I had a message from the person saying her husband accepted the booking but since it was long term I needed to pay a higher cleaning fee - there\u2019s a $15 cleaning fee for the booking but they need to get that every week and I\u2019d only be paying it once (previous guest stayed for a weekend or whatever). (The wife would come over and clean allegedly)\n\nI said I don\u2019t understand. The cost of the listing should incorporate any maintenance the common areas required and I didn\u2019t need her coming in and cleaning my room while I was there.\nThey dropped it.\n\nEnded up being a booking from hell. Both I and another guest canceled before the end of our bookings and received refunds (for the time we didn\u2019t stay). I had to get Airbnb involved to get anyone over to clean the common areas (I cleaned up after myself but there was serious dirt and dust everywhere it was disgusting). Eventually my king size bed broke - they tried to blame it on me, I said I weigh 150 soaking weight and it\u2019s a king size bed. They said they didn\u2019t know what I \u201cgot up to with all my porn stuff.\u201d Apparently they went through my things and found my vibrator. They also took some of my school notes (which I discovered in the dumpster as I moved out)\n\nAirbnb did not refund me for any of the drama I endured.

        "selftext": "TLDR: surgeons wants us to come to a lab scheduled for 12 and hour early at 11. As a class, we decided to come at 12. Got reprimanded, then the dean backed us up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m a second year veterinary student. This is the time when we start our live surgery labs. We work in teams of three students (a surgeon, an assistant, an anesthetist), and are obviously overseen by certified specialists (anesthesiologists and surgeons) and many experienced vet nurses as well.\n\nWe have lectures 7am to 11am. Lunch is 11-12. Our lab begins at 12pm sharp. However, we were told we have the \u201coption\u201d to come to lab early and begin. It became VERY clear after the first week this is an expectation (not an \u201coption\u201d) that we will skip lunch, or eat during lecture, and come straight to the OR.\n\nDuring one lab, at 11:50am the anesthesiologist yelled at a student for a few minutes in the pharmacy area, while getting drugs for lab, for not having his patient ready and waiting in the induction room\u2026 10 minutes for lab even begins. And this group was set to induce during the last wave (normally 1 to 1.5+ hours into lab). There\u2019s no reason to be an hour early when your group is final wave, being on time is sufficient, and they were actually still early.\n\nOur class has been getting berated by this anesthesiologist as well as some of the surgeons in this lab. Just as one example, a student surgeon asked for help. A surgical resident came over from another patient to help, and she was now not sterile. The resident told the student she was holding her forceps wrong, proceeded to grab them from her hands, and then made the student leave her patient on the table to re-scrub, re-gown, and re-glove, and open a new instrument pack. All because she wanted to ask a question. This is a common technique they will use on us when we\u2019ve done something incorrect to \u201cget us to remember it next time.\u201d\n\nWell, the entire class is fed up with this. Our class called a meeting about it, and we all decided we are all going to start showing up to lab at 11:50 to 11:55am. Only 5 to 10 minutes early. Not for petty reasons either, but it\u2019s a matter of patient safety as well. Several students have fainted from skipping lunch to go and operate instead. We were given 11-12 for lunch and we\u2019re going to take all of our time.\n\nSo, that\u2019s what we did. At 11:40am one of the surgeons came to our lecture hall, where the majority of us stay and eat lunch, and asked us why we\u2019re not in lab yet. A student at the front of the room said simply, \u201clab begins at 12 noon.\u201d The surgeon gave us a long spell about professionalism and how we are being inappropriate and putting our patients at risk, and she left. The OR is a 2 minute walk from the lecture hall, so we finished lunch and all showed up around 11:55.\n\nThe clinicians were very mad about it, and reported our class to the dean, and so the dean called a school wide meeting about it. Some of our classmates spoke eloquently about our reasons and our actual patient safety concern, turning it right back on the clinicians citing patient safety. And, the school claims to care immensely about student mental health, since this profession has one of the highest suicide rates and our own class even suffered a loss, and cutting our break/lunch is no way to support us. Beyond that, the schedule says we begin at 12, and we are still showing up a few minutes early to ensure we can begin right at 12.\n\nUltimately, the dean just released a statement saying they cannot force us to begin lab an hour early, and we will start at 12 when the deans office scheduled lab to begin. It\u2019s a small win for us, certainly we will face backlash, but we have a break to eat at least. Our class is known for not putting up with bs from the school, we got a dinosaur of a professor fired for racist comments she made to a student in the middle of lecture, after she had terrorized students at this school for decades, she forgot out lectures were automatically recorded on zoom during COVID. We\u2019re hated by the clinicians, but at least the classes behind us are having a slightly better time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit**. About the fainting thing. Yes, from skipping a single meal most healthy adults shouldn't faint. Add on top of that the mental stress of operating for the first few times, the heat from the surgical lights, being covered head to toe in a non-breathable sterile barrier which traps in your body heat, a mask putting that heat back on you face, having to stand relatively still in one place for hours, no access to water for hours, you can't move your arms out of the sterile field so limited/no stretching, plus the sight of blood being a common trigger of vasovagal syncope, and you have plenty of lightheaded or fainting students. Skipping food is added insult to injury, when you last ate at 6am, its now 4pm, you haven't had water since noon, and you're overheating, and stressed.\n\nNot to mention vet school is a concentration of type A high achieving perfectionists with chronic stress from constant high stakes exams (fail you're out of the program) some of which are right before you go off into operating or maybe occurring the next day, rampant anxiety and depression, sleep deprivation from our schedule and/or insomnia, I know several classmates with disordered eating or full blown ED's. It's not merely an isolated incident of skipping lunch one time.",

That Dean's term ended a year later and to the best of my knowledge that petition never ended up accomplishing more than feeding the Dean's secretary's shredder.  \n\n  Veterinary medicine has work-life balance issues across the board, but nowhere worse than academia - which unfortunately is where most of us have our sense of \"normal\" shaped, further perpetuating that toxic culture.",

            "\nIn human medical care, it\u2019s most common to have the trainees show up hours before everyone else to pre-round on patients prior to procedures, review their relevant history, update paperwork for legal compliance, and identify concerns. \n\nIn the real practice of medical care, you don\u2019t just show up to surgeries as they are happening. There is a process to be followed and a coordinated set of actions to ensure safety, right patient, right procedure, right side, right site, and emergent factors that might postpone or cancel the procedure or require interventions, considerations, or additional monitoring beforehand, and that process has to be learned. There are also interpersonal\nInteractions with the patient, family, or in the case of animals owners in all likelihood. \n\nIf you all are obstinate about missing this part of the training, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s fine as long as none of the class plans to be a veterinary surgeon.

I wasn't a pilot, but I flew in a support role in the backseat. We were lucky enough to each have our own little private rooms (called a CHU). With an air conditioner in each room, and blackened-out windows, it was easy to sleep all day, then wake up at 16:00 or 17:00 and head to work.\n\nWe had big signs on our doors: \"DAY SLEEPER. DO NOT DISTURB. COME BACK AFTER 17:00.\"\n\nThe contractor in charge of safety and maintenance of the CHUs (it was KBR, I think) decided one day they needed to inspect the smoke alarms and fire extinguishers in every room. It's a reasonable request. My boss gave KBR a list of rooms not to disturb until after 17:00. Of course, they ignored the list, and we were all awakened to workers banging on our doors and letting themselves in (\"just doing my job, sir\").\n\nAircrews are required by civil and military law to have adequate crew rest. It's more than, \"hey, get some sleep\". It's a strict number of hours before flying that should be undisturbed. It can become a very big deal, legally, if there's an accident, and it's later revealed the pilot or aircrew member wasn't given a chance to properly rest.\n\nAs inefficient as the military can sometimes be, it's amazing what a single well-placed phone call can do. My boss shamelessly cancelled the evening's flights, and called Colonel Head Honcho to tell him why.\n\nWe never saw KBR again. They avoided us like the plague.",

They checked the cameras, turns out it was an unknown game of cat and mouse and we just never crossed paths.

I started to get there and sign on the EPOS at 7:44, and when we opened at 8 I still had to finish putting all the forms up etc. The DOM (District manager) wasn't happy with this and tried to make me get there earlier, but after asking him if there was a law regarding forcing people to work without pay he soon shut up and asked that I focus on getting all the forms up first so it looks presentable for when we open. I only lasted another 4 or 5 months after that, as the hours were ridiculous (sometimes I was working nearly 60 hours a week, 5 days a week because we were short staffed), the pay was terrible (so even though I was doing all these hours I was salaried at 37.5 hours so wasn't getting paid for them), and some of the customers would really kick off if the amount they got paid differed from what they had worked out (I once spent 35 mins with an elderly gentlemen explaining that he only received \u00a38.70 instead \u00a39.10 because the odds were in face 6/4 and not 7/4 on his last horse in his lucky 15).",

        "selftext": "**TL;DR is available at the bottom of this post.**\n\nI work at a hotel as a night auditor, and this malicious compliance begins with a small bit of information I was told when I was initially hired for this position. When I interviewed for the position, and this is very important later on, I was told by the HR lady that the hotel paid a bonus ($100) for each foreign language I spoke well enough to serve our guests. Management cleared my $100 for speaking english after I passed through their evaluation period (my main language is portuguese).\n\nAt first, I was glad to be working in the night shift, mostly because my colleague then, Mr. Castillo was from Guatemala, so whenever any guests that spoke spanis showed up, he handled it and in turn, I handled any english speaking foreigners. Naturally, he did a lot more work since the amount of spanish speaking guests we receive is significantly larger than our english speaking ones. Meanwhile, Mr. Castillo was in the process of learning english and I had taken an interest in spanish so we helped each other out.\n\nNot long after, Mr. Castillo got himself a job paying several times over what the hotel did and sadly, left me. My new colleague, a newly promoted bellboy didn't speak english (though he could understand some) and didn't speak spanish at all. In fact, he didn't even try to improve any of his language skills while I slowly kept improving my spanish, trying to use more and more of it everyday to serve our dear guests. As of the start of this month, I spoke to our frontdesk manager and asked him in plain spanish, what did I have to do exactly to receive the $100 bonus for speaking spanish. He was surprised but said nothing more since the front desk got busy with check-outs and my shift was up, but a few days later he mentioned he spoke to HR and informed them I was speaking spanish well enough to receive my bonus, and now he was just waiting to hear back from them.\n\nA few days later, the HR lady asked me what size shirt I wore since they were going to be ordering new uniforms in the coming weeks, and took the opportunity to ask her about my bonus for spanish and she mentioned they were talking with our director about it. A day later she informed me they wouldn't be paying me the bonus for a foreign language since it was on file that I was already receiving it. I replied I was receiving a bonus for english, not spanish and she said she would speak to the director again and within a few days, all would be made well. Now I'm not really in a hurry to get my bonus, but it would be nice if they had cleared it already, as it would show up in my next paycheck, but guess what? They didn't. Our director talked to HR again, and my boss and told them that, even though I am serving our dear spanish speaking guests, in spanish, I don't in fact, speak spanish.\n\nI'm far from fluent, but I can explain how the hotel works, direct guests to where they need to be and assist them with what they need, be it finding a pharmacy at 3am, getting a cab to go out and get drinks, or even hire an escort (yep), but apparently it isn't good enough for our director and my manager said he can't really afford to fight him on it. Okay, no biggie I guess, maybe we'll try again next year when I can speak a little better I thought. However, the cruel and unforgiving gods of the hotel industry gave me the perfect opportunity to strike back...\n\nEarlier last week we received a large group of 30+ spanish speaking tourists, which in addition to our normal occupancy, meant we were effectively sold out for the week. Big groups are usually a minor incovenience when you're checking them in, but an even bigger problem when checking them out. Especially if they're 1 person per room, which means you basically have a huge load of rooms to check-out, one by one, while an endless line forms in front of the front desk. 80+ checkouts aren't unsual for our hotel on friday mornings, but 110+ is a problem. Normally when the morning shift has a workload this big, our front desk manager comes in early to help, but he couldn't this time since he took a personal day since his mother fell ill. That left our director with only one choice, to ask the night audit to stay late and help until our reservations people clocked in and could then replace us at the front desk.\n\nSee, my colleague doesn't like staying late, especially since he works at a second job with his father in the afternoon, meaning he only has the morning and early afternoon to sleep. I don't like staying late on fridays because of the amount of check-outs, which means it'll be forever before you can take a breath and even more so before you can leave. However this time our director didn't even ask my colleague and instead told me to stay late because we would have a sizeable workload and about a third of it would require someone that spoke spanish, or it would slow down everything to a crawl. I told him I would not be staying late that morning and before I could get another word him, he started yammering about how I'm wrong and I should be more of a teamplayer and the he would be very grateful for it. Wanting to get back to my sleep, I told him to ask my colleague and he said he couldn't, that they needed me and when I asked him why, he clearly stated \"We need 2 spanish speakers that morning to make sure everything goes OK with the checkouts.\" Not one for missing an opportunity to get payback, I replied \"Sorry boss, I don't speak spanish\", turned off my phone and went back to sleep.\n\nUPDATE: Sorry for holding out on the aftermath. I wrote this during my shift and as I was putting on the finishing touches, we had a server crash and I spent the next hour and a half trying to restore our backups and get the camera system up again.\n\nUPDATE - Aftermath: After I woke up and turned my cellphone back on, I had several missing calls from the hotel and two missing calls from our frontdesk manager (good guy). I called back the hotel but the afternoon shift picked up and they didn't know anything so I called my manager's phone. He answered and asked me what was going on because the director was furious about me \"hanging up on him\" and that I was \"refusing to work\". I explained to him the situation in regards to my bonus for speaking spanish, and since the hotel was trying to hold out on me, I was going to withhold performance. Anyone who's ever worked costumer service know how much damage withholding performance can do, even if it just a little. In the end, my manager begged me to stay until our reservations people came in at 8AM (my shift ends at 07:20AM). I agreed on the condition that I would not check out anyone who spoke spanish. He reluctantly accepeted and said he would back me up in the following shitstorm that would happen.\n\nWhat happened was that the group came down for breakfast precisely at 6:40AM, finished at 07:10AM give or take and went back to their room to collect their belongings. At this time, the two front desk attendants of the morning shift had arrived, as well as our bellboy, plus, there was me and my colleague waiting to punch out and go. We had already started checking people out and this day was particularly busy, we had 3 or 4 people waiting to be checked out, and it doesn't help that we only have 3 computers for 4 people to work with, with another computer for us to check the cameras. When 07:20AM came up, my colleague quickly picked up his things and left and I took over his spot. At this time the first few people in the group started coming down and they already had to wait since we were all checking out other people. A few minutes later I got the first one but I told them I couldn't check them out since I don't speak spanish and asked them to wait for my colleagues to become available. In the end I ended up refusing service to 10 or so people, which started forming a line right in front of the front desk, which only grew since other guests assumed they were all in line to be checked out. My colleagues on the morning shift were not happy at all, the guests were less than satisfied, and when the first of our reservations people showed up at 8AM, I logged out, punched out and went home. By that time, there was a 20+ line of people waiting to be checked out by 2 overworked recepcionists, only one of which spoke spanish.\n\nIn the ensuing shitstorm that happened, the hotel's director arrived at 8:30AM in an attempt to minimize the anger of the human centipede who formed in the front desk, started chatted with the guests and otherwise trying to distract them so they would be less angry and avoid giving the hotel a poor review. I got a mild chewing out by my manager for \"poor work ethic\" instead of being written up. True to his word, he backed me up when the director called him and HR for a meeting regarding my actions (you can't demand someone speak a language that you know they don't right?). I still haven't got my bonus for speaking spanish, and I let my manager know that I will not be speaking any spanish while on the job until they give in and give me my hard earned bonus.\n\nUPDATE 2 - TL;DR: Management denies my bonus for speaking spanish, demands stay I late  to help check out spanish speaking guests. I agree, but refuse to speak  spanish since management themselves said I don't speak spanish so they  wouldn't have to pay me a bonus for speaking spanish. I refuse service to lots of guests, chaos ensues in  the front desk, I clock out before the hotel implodes.\n\nUPDATE 3 - So due to the number of comments asking about how the bonus works, I'll just post it here. It is a monthly bonus, and the way to hotel pays it out is by adding it into the base salary, instead of specifically outlining it on a separate item on our pay stub. This means that it is straight up a pay raise, and as such it interacts with other things that go into our paycheck that use our base salary to be calculated. This means that the $100 bonus easily snowballs into being $150 - $160 when you take into account the +20% we get paid for working nights, +10% for handling live money, + overtime, + paid time off, + vacations.",

Anyway, I had a decent amount of annual leave hours under my belt, so I decided to take a vacation in a city down the coast, visiting a friend. The understanding was that while I was on vacation, my annual leave hours would pay out as if I were still working (but with 17% leave loading, woo).\n\nSo, about halfway through my vacation, the day after I'm due to get paid, I casually check my account, and the number is nowhere near what it should be. I go okay, maybe they're a day late.\n\nFour days later, after I get home, no improvement. So I ring up work and ask them what's the deal. \n\nWhat I get back is that when I'm on vacation, annual leave pays out on my regular roster hours. But I wasn't getting regular roster hours, so they were paying me for about one hour a day, instead of eight. I said, \"Uh, I went on vacation to use up annual leave.\"\n\nThey said, \"Well, that's what the rules are.\"\n\nSo I stopped taking vacations. My annual leave hours built up. And built up.\n\nThe company doesn't like anyone holding a huge number of annual leave hours, because if someone decided to quit out of the blue, the payout would be AMAZING. (Saw one guy do this; he had enough hours to take the *year* off. Then he retired).\n\nSo about six months later they came to me and said, \"Why aren't you taking vacations?\"\n\nI said, \"I can't afford to. You guys don't pay out my annual leave hours while I'm off.\"\n\nSilence on the other end. Then, \"We'll see about that.\"\n\nAll of a sudden, the policy changed. I took a nice long vacation.",

            "Worked for the government.  Policy up to the 70s was that you can accumulate unlimited annual leave.  People were saving over a year's worth then either retiring with a huge paycheck or taking the last year off (this was before my time).  Anyway, they changed it to 30 days; anything over was lost the next year.  Which is why they have \"use or lose\" in December when people used up the excess leave.\n\nSick leave accumulation was unlimited.  When you retired, any unused sick leave as added to your years of service (in monthly amount) used to calculate your retirement benefits.  They changed the civil service program in '84 and eliminated adding it to years of service.  A decade or so later the government was wondering why people were using up their sick leave.  Turned out people didn't want to leave any on the table before they retired as they wouldn't get anything for it.  Sick pay was your current pay; the retirement calculation turned out to be around a quarter of this amount.  It thus cost the government more money for the change.  They changed it back.  So when I retired I had a year of sick leave which increased my service years by one year.",

            "Semi-related story.  I was assigned to a US base in South Korea in early 80's.  There had a fire which destroyed the base Command and Control Bunker and they were in the process of repairing/upgrading the facility.  We had a technician who excelled and had been performing the vast majority of critical installations/documentation of the new facility.  He came due for rotation back to the US when the command suddenly \"involuntarily\" extended him for his mission critical work.  The extension was for 90 days (the maximum the local command could extend personnel for \"mission essential\" duties). To say he was unhappy was an understatement.\n\nAdded into his extension was the fact the command did the extension two or three days prior to his departure.  He did not develop a \"short-timer's attitude\" and was planning to work up to the day he was flying out.  He out-processed during the day, then work in the bunker after hours.  Essentially pulling double shifts for 30 days prior to his original departure date.  He emphatically insisted that he could not be extended and should be allowed to depart.  The command was unmoved.  Bam! 90 days.\n\nQueue Malicious Compliance:  He did nothing, but work on the bunker.  He had turned in his TA-50 field gear and refused to get it reissued.  Morning formation? Nope, he needed to go to work.  Physical Training?  Nope.  Range Qualification, PT test, odd ball house mouse training and briefings?  Nope, they need him to work in the bunker and that was all he was going to do.  He worked eight hours and that was it.  At the end of 90 days, they ~~screwed!~ extended him for a second 90 day period.\n\n\"But Farstone, where is the Malicious Compliance?\", you ask.\n\nTwo days into his second extension, he disappeared.  Gone from the Unit; gone from the base; gone back to the Great USA.  The command failed to understand the Service Member's Situation.  He had been the Winner of the Pentagon Dirty Tricks Assignment Branch.  He was assigned to Korea, just prior to his retirement.  In fact, he had to extend in the Army to complete the assignement or else he would have been discharged 60 days short of his retirement.  His original plan was to complete the assignment and then transition out of the Army, directly into retirement (he got retirement orders as part of his original out-processing).  Turns out you can extend a Service Member's Overseas assignment for \"Mission Essential/Critical\" reason.  You can, almost, extend a Service Member's contract to keep him in the service past the end of the contract for, you guessed, \"Mission Essential/Critical\" reasons.  However, you cannot extend a Service Member's service period once they have their retirement orders.  Mission Essential/Critial not withstanding, it took an Act of Congress or Declaration of War to stop his retirement.  On the effective date of his retirement, he went from Active Duty to Retired.  His 90 day extension?  He was declared a \"contractor\" for payment purposes.  He was awarded his full pay, Overseas Service Pay, and a daily rate as a special \"contractor\".  The Bureaucracy \"discovered\" something was wrong when he didn't arrive at his transition point.  The Bureaucracy automatically assigned him the \"contractor\" status, while they attempted to \"find\" him.  Finance changed his pay-status and it was automatically approved.  On day 91, The Bureaucracy \"found\" him, working at his \"Mission Essential/Critical\" job.  Day 92, he was flown out of country and into retirement.  During his 91 day period as a special contractor, he earn the equivalent of two years pay.  Special Contractor + Overseas Service Pay + Contract Extension Penalty.",

If you worked 11 months and took a 4 week holiday, would you not accrue your full leave that yer?\n\nNo. Because you still accrue annual leave WHILE ON ANNUAL LEAVE.\n\nSo a guy who saves up 12 months of leave and then takes it all at once....cheats himself out of 1 month of annual leave.\n\nThere's another problem. The tax office does not \"care\" what year the annual leave is from.\n\nSo if at some stage you take a year of annual leave as a cash payout...your tax will be high. Because to them, you got paid for 52 weeks + 52 weeks of annual leave...yet for the rest of the year you were only taxed as if you were earning 52 weeks of pay. So your tax was too low for 52 weeks...and they make up for it by taking it out of your leave cash payment.\n\nThe fact that the leave is from previous years ..even from yen years ago..is irrelevant to them.\n\nDisclaimer: I used to work in payroll, but it was 20 years ago now. I think this is still correct though.",

Now most days Brenda and I got along just fine  besides when she would get on her religious high horse. (She is a staunch Mormon and I am EX Mormon) \n\nOn this particular day we had a rough go of things and to put a cherry on top I knocked a stack 100-150 plastic cups on the floor. (For reference our local health code requires them to be thrown out or washed before use after touching the ground) upon doing this I exclaimed \u201coh my lord!\u201d Out loud. Brenda instantly snapped at me with \u201cdon\u2019t take the lords name in vein!\u201d I will admit I can be caddy at times and said back to her that Lord is his title and God his his name, so therefore I wasn\u2019t taking his name in vein. This of course offended her even more so she ran to our manager. Our manager is cool as hell but she pulled me aside and explained that Brenda is super sensitive about religion and asked if I could find an alternative to oh my lord to avoid the ensuing drama that Brenda would to cause if I continued using the phrase. \n\nNow I am first to admit I\u2019m a petty person and I wasn\u2019t about to let Brenda fully get her way with this. I decided to further drive the point that lord is a title. So from that day forward every time a situation called for an oh my lord I would say  \u201coh lord Voldemort\u201d or whatever lord I could think of that day.

        "selftext": "This story begins when I was 13 (F). I am now 18F. We had recently moved to a new house at this point and my door no longer had a lock on it. Because of this, I requested my Mom and my Step Dad knock before entering to avoid any awkward scenes. No dice. My Step Dad's words were \"I'm your parent so I don't NEED to knock. What are you hiding?\" This made 13 year old me very angry as I cared about my privacy a lot. I went to my Dad's the weekend after and he said this to me, that sparked inspiration. \"If you don't want your Step Dad to enter your room, make him never want to enter your room without knocking again.\" Cue the MC. When 13 year old me got home from school one day, I proceeded to strip. I sat on my bed playing my 3DS and waited for the moment to come. Of course, about 30 minutes into Pokemon Super Mystery Dungeon, my Step Dad barges in. \"Hey I need you to take out the- WHAT THE FUCK.\" He slammed the door at that point. \"WHY THE FUCK AREN'T YOU WEARING CLOTHES?\" 13 year old me, being a smartass, decided to say \"Well, it is very hot in here.\" (I'd like to point out at this point that I live in a southern state of the US and it gets VERY hot during most months) \"And I did ask that you knock.\" \n\nObviously, knocking was a frequent thing for every single room in the house at that point. And oh yeah, my Mom bought me a hook lock for my door after that. Sorry if this was short, I have more stories but I figured my first should be something i'm sure we've all gone through at some point.\n\nEdit: Wow I did not expect this many people to see this. I don't know whether to feel embarrassed or proud, lol. To clarify because someone asked and I realise it could have caused confusion, No it wasn't the original Pokemon Stadium, it was called something and then Pokemon Stadium. Maybe Ultra Pokemon Stadium? Something along those lines. And also, no, my Step Father never had any sexual reasons for this, my entire life he just enjoyed being a controlling manipulative ass.\n\nEdit 2: It was Pokemon Super Mystery Dungeon, not Stadium\n\nEdit 3: Obligatory Thank you for the rewards edit!\n\nEdit 4: I've seen a few people doubt the validity of my post or compare it to PH content. Granted, there is nothing I can do to prove I did this, I do have to say if you didn't go through this with your parents, I envy you. Being a teenager for me was quite the battle with privacy! And of course when you first hit puberty, privacy is of the upmost importance.\n\nAnd also, because i'm still getting comments about it after my edit, i'm going to go ahead my mistake in saying \"Pokemon Stadium\" to the correct game. In the five years after this story I stopped playing Pokemon, and there are so many titles out there sometimes they tend to run together. And also, yes my Step Dad really did cuss like that. He prided himself on being a parent that \"Didn't give a rats ass\" about cussing. Oh but if I were to cuss back then i'd be in big trouble. It's just one of those cases of \"Do what I say, not what I do\". \nAlso grammar fixes\n\nUPDATE: My Mother saw this post. She was upset I would post this on Reddit. Lmfao! Hi Mom, I guess.",

This room is part of the house that *I* pay for, so this is not *your* room, it's *mine*, along with everything in it! I will enter my room as I see fit, and you will leave your door open at all times!\"\n\nAnd that, boys and girls, is how you force your kid to devise every method possible to hide their life from you and desperately cling to whatever shred of privacy and dignity they think they can find. Suffice it to say, my teenage years went downhill pretty fast. If your kid is figuring out at 14 that they can hide their stuff by creating a secret compartment inside of their boxspring, you dun' fucked up. I didn't even use it for contraband at first, just regular books and CDs; hiding everything basically became an instinct, and \"trust\" remains an alien concept decades later.",

They didn't fix them cause the doors shut solid, so who cared.   \n\n\nThey frequently took my door off my hinges as a punishment for everything from reading bad books (highly conservative and religions and they were \"Your body and puberty\" kind of books, but they were graphic), to mouthing off. I liked to poke the bear too. Untreated ADHD didn't help, but I didn't know that's what it was at the time. Once, they left if off for a long time; six months plus if memory serves, but it was a long time ago. I think I was about 16 at the time so it was nearly 20 years ago.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy room was right across the hall from my parents' room. The door doesn't face theirs, but it's easy to look into my room, even if by accident. There had been some awkward, hurried look aways when I'm getting changed and my dad is leaving the room. Nothing pervy, but a lot of \"Keep your head and eyes down and walk quickly\" moments. My bed was a former bunk bed that they'd taken apart for 2 individual beds for me and my sister. It was high-sided and had long bunk framed sides. If you were putting on pantyhose for church, you just couldn't get the angle you needed. So I often went to the living room and put them on on the loveseat. My dad was usually right there in his recliner, complaining that I was hiking my skirt up too high and that I wasn't being modest. I knew what I was doing when I said, \"Does it matter? You can see right into my room and watch me get dressed after I shower at any point!\" It didn't occur to me until I wrote this, but I am a sexual...*something* survivor. I don't have a word for what it was but it made me hate being naked in my house for long. It went away when I moved out on my own for school. Context.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt took some convincing from my mom, who heard but wasn't present for the situation, but I had my door back in 2 weeks. Given how stubborn and absolutely pigheaded my dad was and still is, that was fast.",

After 3 years, they were unusable.  I brought in two of my personal laptops, loaded all the diagnostic programs, interfaced them with the network, updated their routers with some of my old routers.  The only way we could diagnose anything new, or program these cars was with my tech.  The service department was down for weeks because of a dispute over coffee, before work even started.

When I started..there was no physical manual on everything we did and were in charge of..including ordering the stock, procedures, etc.. So after having to train new people (we had a high turn over rate) I ended up making one so that new personnel had something to refer to when I wasn't there. A simple notebook containing an extremely detailed description of everything that the job entailed.Then the owner hired someone to take over running the company and he decided to make a head of the department and gave the position to a person ( the Pain) who was the reason many people either quit or transferred to other departments even though I had several years seniority over her..so I went to HR that same day and demanded to be transferred to another department, which was granted. 2 days later, I moved positions and took my notebook with me. Not many days later the Pain did the supply order for that week and let's just say she overshot it by quite a bit and then tried to blame the new girl who had been there just a few weeks.  The owner came to me asking about the screw up..I told him the truth and he said the Pain blamed it on the work manual being missing..He was beyond pissed..this was no small loss for a business this size because it couldn't be returned.  He asked me to return the manual..nope, it was my own note book, not company property and when asked if I would come back to my old job..nope..I liked where I was now.

When my boss was walking me out he saw the painting on my wall and asked \"aren't you going to take your painting with you?\"  I started to say \"No, because it belongs to the company\" but he cut me off and said \"Don't worry, I'll carry it for you\" (it's pretty large).

Your employer had to buy stuff they would\u2019ve have to buy anyway, just 3 years later, which actually saves them money.",
