        "selftext": "This happened 2 decades ago.\n\nSome background: My first job was at a fast food chain. I worked hard, impressed the store manager and got myself promoted. At the time, I was still 17. So, I was promoted to \u201cTeam Leader\u201d, with implication that I would get promoted further when I was older. I was still in high school, so I worked the evening shift which started at 4 and ended at 12. The evening manager was a good guy who also worked hard and as a result had gotten promoted to a store manager position at a different location. Since they needed a manager (and I wasn\u2019t old enough) they hired a new manager who I\u2019ll call Karen. So Karen is hired and starts shadowing the current night manager learning the ropes. After 2 weeks, he departs and she is now set take over. That\u2019s where this story really starts.\n\nI normally get in around 30 minutes early. One of my responsibilities is to make a position chart (which tells the workers where they are working that night). I need to hand it off to the manager for approval before posting it. As I arrive, I notice one of our night shift workers is already there. We\u2019ll call her Jen. She is sitting in the lobby crying and being consoled by other employees. I always found her to be a bit manic, but she was a nice girl. She had a rough home life, so I didn\u2019t hold it against her. Come to find out she had just had a large fight with her mother, which ended with her getting kicked out. So, she is effectively homeless. Good reason to be upset. I ask her if she needs the night off. She says no, she needs the money. I can\u2019t disagree and head off to get started.\n\nFor the night shift, the night manager typically runs the drive through register after day shift leaves. There are a few reasons for this. First, this means that the manager has control of the drawer (and money) for the entire night. This eliminates the possibility of employees having short drawers. Second, this also puts the manager as the person interacting with the customers. I lived in a college town so drunken guys drive through all the time and just want to chat up the pretty face behind the register. Third, it gives the manager the least amount of responsibilities as far as clean up.\n\nSo, given what I now know, I make up a position chart and place Karen on the register and Jen on a fryer where she can get help if she can\u2019t focus. I walk to the office to hand off the chart to night manager and was surprised that he wasn\u2019t there. He normally is in at least an hour before shift to make sure everything is ready. That\u2019s when I remembered, this will be Karen\u2019s first night alone. I groan inwardly. This is gonna be a \u201ctrial by fire\u201d kind of night. The day manager is there but no sign of Karen. It\u2019s now 10 minutes to shift and even day manager is wondering what\u2019s up. I fill day manager in about Jen, show her the chart and ask if it looks good. She agrees, and I said I\u2019ll post it for now and Karen can sign it when she gets in.\n\nI had just finished posting the position chart when Karen shows up looking frazzled. She heads for the office without a word to anyone. Meanwhile people start getting into position and ready for the shift. A few minutes later Karen walks up, pulls my position chart and replaces it with a new one. Again, she walks off without a word. According to the new position chart, Jen is working the drive through and Karen is working\u2026 nothing. Her name isn\u2019t there. She has another employee working 2 positions and the whole shift working effectively one person short. WTF? I head to the office where Karen and day manager are talking and ask for some clarification. I explain there must be a mistake.\n\nKaren: No, that\u2019s right.\n\nMe: But you\u2019re not in a position and \\*worker\\* is working 2 positions\u2026\n\nKaren: Well how am I supposed to be in charge if I\u2019m in a position?\n\nDayshift and I just stare at her blankly.\n\nDayshift: You need to be in position. You are accounted for in the labor calculations.\n\nKaren: Well, I have 6 years of management experience and I have never needed to fill a position to get the job done. Things are gonna change around here. We do things my way now.\n\nNow, she just spent the last 2 weeks shadowing a manager that walked her through every step of the job. She KNOWS she should be in position and why. This shouldn\u2019t even be a question. She just wants to spend the shift sitting in the office and everyone knows it.\n\nAt this point, dayshift manager and I are sharing horrified glances at each other. I tell Karen that she\u2019ll need to go get people moved around if that\u2019s what she wants, because it\u2019s her plan. She gives an exasperated sigh and heads that way. I turn to dayshift and plead with her to call the store manager and let her know what\u2019s going on. She agrees. I head back to the line and start working. After short time later, dayshift pulls me aside and says that the store manager said it is Karen\u2019s shift; she is in charge. She makes the decisions. Then she leaves for the night.\n\nThe shift proceeds to implode in a spectacular fashion. Less than an hour in, the employee working 2 positions is so far in the weeds that orders are taking 3 times as long to get out. The drive through is backed up and the guys stuck at the window waiting are trying to flirt with Jen, who is having none of it and getting more annoyed by the minute. As the wait gets longer and longer, the people are becoming more and more irritated as they get to the window and they are taking it out on Jen. Things are starting to get out of hand and Karen is nowhere to be seen. I go to the office to let her know we need help and find her watching a portable TV. I start to tell her what\u2019s going on and she cuts me off. She tells me get back on the line, do my job and stop bothering her. I was about to try and explain when I just thought, \u201cYou know what, screw that.\u201d Cue malicious compliance. I turned, walked back to the line and watched the situation unfold.\n\n30 minutes later, a car at the window is giving Jen an earful about how long she has been waiting. She calls her worthless and Jen goes off. She takes the large strawberry milkshake next to her, chucks it at the lady and calls her a fat ugly c\\*\\*\\*. The lady and the inside of her car are covered in pink goo. Everything went so silent you could hear a pin drop. Then the lady starts screaming. Jen closes the window on her and walks calmly to the back. The lady peels around the front and comes in the front door screaming for a manager. I go and knock on the office door. Karen appears looking pissed and annoyed. She tries to snap at me, but I tell her she has a customer at the front asking for the manager. Karen rolls her eyes and heads towards the front, oblivious to the shit storm that is waiting. I went and found Jen huddled in the back crying again. I tell her to get herself together and head back to the front when she is ready.\n\nI head to the line where the now purple faced lady is screaming at Karen about dry cleaning and upholstery cleaning and \u201cI want that girl fired.\u201d At this point, I can see that Karen has finally realized that things have gotten WAY out of control. She is trying to calm the lady down, but she is having none of it. Eventually, Jen comes back to the line and lady starts in on her again, calling her all kinds of nasty things. Karen just stood there and let the woman berate her. Jen just kinda deflated in front of us. Watching her crumble like that just broke something in me. I walked over to Jen and said, \u201cJust quit. You\u2019re better than this job. And you can do better.\u201d She looked up at me for a moment, then smiled. She lifted her chin, walked to Karen said \u201cI quit\u201d, handed her name tag to her and walked out.\n\nKaren started apologizing to the lady who now seemed slightly mollified. Then, Karen started bad mouthing Jen to her. Saying how she was a terrible employee and how we were all happy she was gone. That\u2019s when I decided I was better than that job, too. I looked at Karen and said, \u201cThe only terrible employee here is you.\u201d And I walked out. 2 other employees walked out right behind me. We all met with Jen in the parking lot and went to an IHOP where we sat and speculated on how Karen was getting along. Jen told me that was the first time in her life anyone had ever stood up for her.\n\nThe next day, I got a call from the store manager asking for an explanation. Apparently, Karen had struggled the entire night with service. Afterwards, she had been there most of the night trying to clean and prep for day shift and had done a piss poor job. The story she had given the store manager was that Jen and I had planned everything with the intent to set her up because we didn\u2019t like her and wanted to see her fail. Karen had basically blamed the whole incident on Jen and I. The store manager told me she was investigating to get all sides of the story. So I told her. A few hours later, she called again and informed me that Karen was no longer employed and asked if I would be coming in that night. I asked if Jen was getting her job back. She said no. The whole shake debacle wasn\u2019t something she could overlook. I said then my answer is no. She was surprised. She tried to negotiate with me. I told her my price was Jen getting her job back. She said she couldn\u2019t do that. And that was that.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering how Jen turned out, I married her. We are very happy and have 4 children.\n\nTLDR; A new manager tries to change things to give herself an easy do nothing job. When I tell her it will backfire, she tells me to go back to work. I do and everything goes down in flames. She tries to blame me and gets fired anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Wow! Just wow. I wrote this while I was on break at work. Saw a few upvotes then drove home. And now it's just gone crazy. I tried to thank as many people as I could but I know I missed some. I showed it to my wife when I got home. I thought she might cry but she didn't. She says it was one of her darkest days, but it ended up being one of the best of her life.  ",

I looked at Karen and said, \u201cThe only terrible employee here is you.\u201d And I walked out. 2 other employees walked out right behind me. We all met with Jen in the parking lot and went to an IHOP where we sat and speculated on how Karen was getting along. Jen told me that was the first time in her life anyone had ever stood up for her.\n\nThe next day, I got a call from the store manager asking for an explanation. Apparently, Karen had struggled the entire night with service. Afterwards, she had been there most of the night trying to clean and prep for day shift and had done a piss poor job. The story she had given the store manager was that Jen and I had planned everything with the intent to set her up because we didn\u2019t like her and wanted to see her fail. Karen had basically blamed the whole incident on Jen and I. The store manager told me she was investigating to get all sides of the story. So I told her. A few hours later, she called again and informed me that Karen was no longer employed and asked if I would be coming in that night. I asked if Jen was getting her job back. She said no. The whole shake debacle wasn\u2019t something she could overlook. I said then my answer is no. She was surprised. She tried to negotiate with me. I told her my price was Jen getting her job back. She said she couldn\u2019t do that. And that was that.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering how Jen turned out, I married her. We are very happy and have 4 children.\n\nTLDR; A new manager tries to change things to give herself an easy do nothing job. When I tell her it will backfire, she tells me to go back to work. I do and everything goes down in flames. She tries to blame me and gets fired anyway.\n\n\u200b\n\nEDIT: Wow! Just wow. I wrote this while I was on break at work. Saw a few upvotes then drove home. And now it's just gone crazy. I tried to thank as many people as I could but I know I missed some. I showed it to my wife when I got home. I thought she might cry but she didn't. She says it was one of her darkest days, but it ended up being one of the best of her life.",

And even though that\u2019s about as old as stories get, this one is completely relevant to your life and how you can live in the future.\n\nIt\u2019s a story of a farmer and his horse. One day his horse runs away. And his neighbor comes over and says, to commiserate, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about your horse.\u201d And the farmer says \u201cWho Knows What\u2019s Good or Bad?\u201d The neighbor is confused because this is clearly terrible. The horse is the most valuable thing he owns.\n\nBut the horse comes back the next day and he brings with him 12 feral horses. The neighbor comes back over to celebrate, \u201cCongratulations on your great fortune!\u201d And the farmer replies again: \u201cWho Knows What\u2019s Good or Bad?\u201d\n\nAnd the next day the farmer\u2019s son is taming one of the wild horses and he\u2019s thrown and breaks his leg. The neighbor comes back over, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about your son.\u201d The farmer repeats: \u201cWho Knows What\u2019s Good or Bad?\u201d\n\nSure enough, the next day the army comes through their village and is conscripting able-bodied young men to go and fight in war, but the son is spared because of his broken leg.",

            "I don't have a daughter (two sons) but I am pretty sure that if a young man did what you did for my daughter (someone you were not dating and had no personal/romantic interest in I assume) and later dated/decided to get married I would wholeheartedly give you my blessing.\n\nLet this be a lesson to young men (and women) and fathers/mothers: love involves sacrifice but also requires someone who will be willing to sacrifice when there is NO personal gain and/or no possibly of self benefit.  Not that a marriage/romantic relationship always involves self-sacrificial love.  However, it may be required sometime in the relationship and it should be a characteristic of anyone that wants to pursue long term relationships and be successful in it.  Such a person should have this characteristic already but just as important they should look for it in a potential mate.\n\nI don't want to sound all preachy but the book of Job has some excellent insight on this subject.

One thing that we started to notice was the next day when we would come in the manager would tell us that your drawer was short, which is funny because when we counted our drawers they were fine. This seemed to only happen when the new assistant manager was closing, so I called the franchise office and left a message saying every time (assistant manager) closed that our drawers were short, but never when the other manager closed. Well, the next day we come in and get our assignments, and as I was heading to my spot, the district manager pulled me aside and said that he and (franchise owner)got my message and did some investigating and discovered what I was saying was the case and they even had found more issues. Shortly after that time, the new assistant manager 'quit'...",

I'm lead for my department, 17, on like my 60th hour for the week. Terrible home life stressed to breaking. The restaurant is *packed,* but new assistant manager is chilling in the back because \"she didn't earn two degrees to bus tables.\" Customers are freaking out about the long wait times, demanding a manager. I go to the back once and let her know customers up front want a manager. She's still on the phone and gives me the one finger just a minute sign so I go back to my post and continue firing out orders. Unfortunately my side is open to the front so the customers are death glaring and ranting at me for 5 solid minutes as I work. I go back to her a second time, and again return to my post after. By the time she wanders up to the front of house, the angry customers have stormed off and she starts laying into me about how she was busy and I should never interrupt her and then she drops \"YOU DONT KNOW YOUR *PLACE.* \n\nWell, being condescended to is/was probably my biggest button and she pushed it. I told her why she was terrible at her job in every way, flipped her a double bird with a \"fuck you\" I'm sure the whole restaurant could hear and walked outside to calm my ass down. She followed me outside to yell at me more and I said \"you need to get out of my face right now or I'm going to break your nose.\" I was shaking. She glared and said I was fired. \n\nWell. I came in the next night expecting to be actually fired of course. You don't just pop off like that and I did feel bad about yelling because there were a lot of families in the restaurant with young kids. The GM was there that day and pulled me into the office for my side of the story, and I gave it. Well, turns out new manager didn't have the authority to fire people. She especially didn't have the authority to angrily cross my name off every day of next weeks schedule and dump all of my hours on a 16 year old who ended up with almost 90 hours as a result. The waitresses had also done some kind of wild mass complaint shitstorm to the GM about how bad this manager was. *She* was fired. I was not even given a stern talking to. It felt like getting away with murder, but it was really nice that people stood up for me, even if I didn't entirely deserve it.",

        "selftext": "Tldr; basically the title.\n\nBrief backstory: A couple years ago, I was in an apartment with my friend and younger sister. My sister was violent towards my friend and I, and I ended up having to get a restraining order against her. She brought in a dog without permission, which caused some damage to the unit. I informed my landlord of the incidences of violence and the damage and sent him pictures. He basically told me to deal with it myself, which I did by getting the protective order. After this, my roommate questioned the legality of holding us responsible for her portion of rent (I told her it was, but she asked our landlord for a copy of the lease to show her uncle anyway, which admittedly was pretty stupid). Up until this point, our landlord had not asked us to leave due to my sister's actions, but he did after the lease was brought into it. We were out by the date he specified on the notice to quit (the first step in the eviction process before the eviction actually occurs). My roommate was there until midnight making sure the place was spotless.\n\nWe moved to an apartment across the street. Two weeks had passed since he was informed that we had vacated the unit, and we had not gotten anything regarding our security deposit. In our state, a landlord is required by law to either return the remainder of a security deposit within two weeks, or provide a letter itemizing what the deposit was used for. If they don't, the tenant is owed the entire deposit. If the withholding is willful, the tenant is owed double the original deposit. The landlord had actually told me that he would be going on vacation immediately after we vacated, so I returned our keys to him and waited to see if he would send anything. He never did. After consulting with a tenant's rights group to be sure I was in the right, I sent a pre-formatted letter 16 days after we vacated, which stated the specific laws regarding security deposits, and gave him our current address to send either the deposit or receipt to.\n\nThe day after I sent this letter, I see him across the street, frantically running into the apartment for the first time since we moved out. I receive a text from him saying that he would return what's left of our deposit \"if he could get the apartment rented by the first of next month.\" I respond by telling him that, as the letter I sent explained, he forfeits the right to keep any of the deposit after the two weeks is up. He responded saying that he would \"see us in court\" and that we were \"nightmare tenants,\" and that \"this will be fun.\" He said he would also be taking us to court for the costs to re-list and rent the apartment, which he claimed exceeded the amount of our deposit.\n\nAfter about a month or two of hearing nothing back, we decided to say \"fuck it\" and file a small claims suit against him, as he clearly wasn't going to follow through on his threats. As the person who had almost all communication with him, I was the plaintiff in the case. He brought a \"letter\" that was dated for the day he texted me, where he arbitrarily wrote in what he used the deposit on, and claimed he sent us the letter. That obviously didn't add up (which I thoroughly explained to the judge), as he had texted me that day saying that we would get some of the deposit returned, and that he had no proof that he actually sent that letter. He clearly just wrote it and printed it out for the court hearing. During the court hearing he also said a lot of false and victim-blaming shit, such as implying that I participated in the violence that occurred, saying we caused damages that were definitely there when we moved in, and just attacking my character in general.\n\nThe judge ruled that the withholding of the security deposit was willful and awarded us double the deposit. But of course that wasn't the end of it, and a few days before his deadline to pay us the money, he sends me a text just \"letting me know that the decision has been appealed.\" I didn't answer and showed up to court again, and lo and behold, it's more mud-slinging and arguing about things that we already established in the first hearing.\n\nThe judge upheld the original decision, and he eventually mailed me the check for double the deposit. In the memo line on the check where you can write the reason for the payment, he wrote, \"for gaining twenty pounds.\" But hey, I cashed that check and spent my half on a new gaming laptop, so I'd say I got the last laugh. I desperately wanted to text him and ask him if it was as fun as he thought it would be, but resisted the urge.\n\nEdit: Apparently I didn't make this clear enough, but yes, violence occurred towards me as well. I could do without the victim-blaming. And the dog that she brought in without permission chewed a tiny chunk off of the window sill. In court, the falsified deposit receipt letter was mostly comprised of \"cleaning fees\" and damages that were there when we moved in.\n\nEdit 2: I'd encourage you to refrain from passing negative judgement unless you have all of the details of what was said and done by the landlord in this case, which are too lengthy for me to provide here. If you would like more details regarding the landlord's behavior leading up to the case, PM me and I'd be happy to provide these details as well as screenshots of our correspondence. If you are unwilling to know the whole story, the dirty details, and the trauma and re-victimization I was subjected to, your opinion is meaningless and I will not defend my actions to you. ",

If I do not promptly receive payment will need to once again rely on the court to settle the matter.\n\n\n \nIt'll at least make him think you might be coming after him again. If it weren't a waste of the court's time, it would be fun to see him explain himself to the judge, who would probably not be amused.",

            "Woof. What a dick. I *almost* had to do this to one of my landlords, after specifically having him do a last walkthrough with me the day I was moving out to make sure everything was in order and he didn\u2019t see any issues. I had asked him twice if he wanted to keep a little fence I had put in too, for any future tenants with dogs. I wanted to do this walkthrough because he was very old and didn\u2019t have great health. In that state, he had 30 days to return deposit to me. Of course, it didn\u2019t happen. I had to send multiple letters citing rental law to his adult children. At some point it was a little ugly and I did feel bad about it because he ended up getting ill. At the same time, it was my money and I had tried to prevent that exact scenario by having him do a walkthrough with me. I didn\u2019t pursue the additional money I legally could have, but it was not pleasant. Still, your experience was more grueling! I\u2019m glad you got what you were owed!",
            "Makes me glad that moving out of my own apartment was so painless. I rented in an overpriced University area with terrible water quality. I spent a couple bucks on a new showerhead because the old one was calcified to fuck and I refused to use it like that. I told the landlord he could keep it, but I left the old one over there in case he cared. I didn't want to take it with me because it was already starting to become clogged from the water, and back home, I had zero issues with that. He actually seemed super thankful that I'd just replace something myself and let him keep it, and didn't raise any complaints at all about the state of the apartment (which was basically the same as I got it). \n\nI guess sometimes, fixing a tiny bit pays off in the long run!",

            "One of the most important things to do is understand the landlord tenet rights laws in your state.\n\nFor example, if the building has 4 or more units - in the state of NJ different rules apply - less then 4 units, its more what ever goes.\n\nThats why sometimes it is (1) MUCH better to rent in a complex, then from random people.\n\n(2) You want to know that the office staff (preferably the manager) lives on site. \n\n(3) You also want to know if the mantiance team has on site, or offsite people.\n\nWhy? Because when shit happens in the middle of the night, the weekend, and other places and things.\n\nIf that person is ON SITE they get called for extreme situations. They can let you into an empty unit - and you can at least sleep on the floor, or in a unit that has the heat turned on.\n\nIf they do not live there, can\u2019t do anything until they get there. \n\nAnd in the middle of a snow storm, that might be hours away, or maybe tomorrow.",

I genuinely believe most landlords were formed in the bottom pits of hell, if such a place exists. \n\nIn the country I live in, laws are slightly different to what you\u2019re describing and the landlord won most of my deposit because he presented me with a second contract (second year of tenancy) and told me it was exactly the same. I skimmed through it and didn\u2019t notice one tiny clause had been added, which wasn\u2019t present in the previous contract. It was that if I broke the contract earlier even with a 30 day notice I would have to pay a letting agent fee. The worst part is that I was really helpful because I didn\u2019t want to leave on any bad terms and I told him I would communicate with the estate agents. They were useless. I told him that they were useless, they never picked up the phone and when they did they failed to turn up to multiple viewings after arranging them with me. He went with another estate agency. \n\nHe charged me for both the fees for both letting agencies. After the initial appeals process was decided, I decided to let it go and not take any further action. \n\nUnrelated: the lady who lived in a different apartment in the same house helped to make our time there hell so every few months I send her samples of free adult diapers.

        "selftext": "So not so fun story, but I've always wanted to share this one. \n\nI'm not going to drag this out too long, but to get right to the point. My father is very religious to the point we couldn't do a lot of things that would be considered normal. Christmas, dating, ect.\n\nI didn't hate my dad by any means, he taught me a lot. However, he was very abusive. As a black man, he seemed to think the only way to discipline a child was to knock that sense into them. \nHe would constantly get angry at minor things and punch my brother in the soft part of his stomach. \n\nI suppose we both just normalized that abuse. And as I got older, I learned to not take the punches and actually block. The first time I did it, shocked my dad. It was so satisfying not to cry when my dad hit me and just look at him with this blank expression.\n\nDoing this definitely made him more angry as he would try to make me cry. I feel like it gave him some sick satisfaction. \n\nYou'd think all of this would make me hate him? Nope. \nMy idiotic self just didn't seem to register how bad this was. I'd try to justify it as him teaching me a lesson. But eventually, the last straw would come. \n\nSo I was 16 at the time, and my father gave me this ultimatum. Continue school or get a job and pay a majority of the bills. He wasn't working at the time and I hated school. While my grades were average to high, I just didn't want to be apart of that environment anymore. \n\nOur overall bill was about \u00a31300 and I'd have to give \u00a3600 of my pay check,with my brother paying the other half. \nI decided to just go with it and look for a job. \n\nNow, a week into my job search my father started shouting at me. Saying I was taking way too long, (keep in mind, when my brother left school. He gave him over 2 months to find something). He ended up putting me Infront of a computer and made me apply to things all day and night. I ended up going to bed at 6am the next morning. I got so desperate, I applied for McDonald's and within a day got the job... Unfortunately. \nIt was one of the worst experiences of my life. A lot of inappropriate touching and horrible acquaintances. \n\nAnyway, a year into working. A new girl joined the team and as clich\u00e9 as it sounds. I fell for her instantly. \nI went out of my comfort zone and just decided to flirt with her. Within that day we were dating. It was amazing. \n\nObviously, I couldn't tell me dad about this. So we hid it for another year as we dated. Within that time, we ended up having sex. Sex before marriage would be a big no no. \n\nMy father later found out. \nNow this part is pretty invasive. But he had connected to my WhatsApp messages and was reading them on his laptop while I slept. \nI believe he actually opened my phone while I slept, using my thumb recognition. \n\nI was chewed out the next morning and told to break up with her (which I didn't). Because she was a whore and didn't really love me. \n\nHe then told me to get out of the house and never come back. I will give some context for this. My dad likes to use this line when we're in trouble. He'll make us go outside our flat and then a minute later call us back inside. \n\nHe had never really gotten to that point with me. But my brother experienced it all the time. \nI'd always told him that if our father ever did that to me, I'd just leave. \n\nSo as you can imagine, I left. I walked for hours while my dad was blowing up my phone to come home. If you thought this was because he cared and wanted me to be safe? You'd be wrong. \n\nHe would later send texts telling me not to tell anyone what was happening. It's none of their business and I'm not ruining his reputation.\nI wasn't planning on telling people anyway. But the fact he said that shows he only cares for others opinions. \n\nBecause I had left so quickly, I hadn't had time to grab anything. I had a phone and the clothes on my back. \nI had to call my girlfriend for moral support, and after talking. She straight away booked a hotel. I was so thankful. Lucky for me, I was getting paid the next day. So I'd be able to get my money and hopefully rent a place. \n\nTo this day I haven't spoken to my father and I completely blocked him. And while I struggle to pay my rent every month, it's still way better than my situation prior. \n\nThe story does have a happy ending. Remember how I wasn't able to get my stuff? \nWell, my father had gone on holiday ( one of my friends tipped me to this). So my girlfriend and I went back to the house and broke in using a credit card. \n\nMy dad never locked his door, so if you just swiped a card through the door with enough pressure, you could eventually make it turn and get in. \nI was actually struggling to do this, until the neighbor came by and actually did it for me. He was such a good guy! \nI know he just assumed we were locked out, but he really saved my life more than he knows. \n\nI took everything I wanted, including stuff like the TV. Since it was my money that paid for all of that. \n\nI can only imagine how shocked my dad was when he came home and found all my stuff gone. He was probably going to sell it to cover the rent.",

            "I had a similar situation. When I was 16, my mother decided I was a drug addict. While I in reality, I really only smoked a little weed, and had a few drinks. Thing was, my father was an alcoholic, so she was particularly sensitive (she had left him when I was around two years old, so I was an only child with a single mother)\n\nGranted, I was a little wild, preferring to stay out with friends and 'run away' for days at a time to avoid the accusations and yelling.  \n\nAt 16, my mother told me to get out. I did. I got a job at a bike shop in a neighboring city that paid enough to rent a room in a roommate situation (this was totally doable back in the 1980's)\n\nI didn't look back for several years. Eventually, we reconnected, but to this day she feels as though it was the right move and that I was an addict*.\n\n*(Side note) I was born with both clubbed feet, so I live in chronic pain. I have been on and off of opiates for many of my adult years. I go through cycles where I'd rather be high and pain free, and other times I'd rather have my head and deal with pain.  When it's time to stop, I just stop. There's never withdrawals, psychological cravings, 'backsliding'... I simply stop. Therefore, I am fairly certain that I am not genetically predisposed to addiction.",

He always worked, but extra money went to booze. \nWhen I was 14, 100 lbs, 5 feet tall (f) got in an argument with him. He was really strong, came at me, I grabbed a mirror off the wall and smashed it across his head. Then, I ran like crazy. I had on shoes, he didn't so I figured if I ran on the rocks, it would slow him down. \nWRONG, I pushed a ladder over to stop him, didn't work. He caught me as I ran up the stairs, grabbed me by my ankle and flipped me upside down. I bit him in the calf and drew blood, as he stomped up the stairs. Apparently, he beat the crap out of me. I don't remember being hit. I do remember everything else, I won because I fought back. He never hit any of us after that! \nHappened almost 55 years ago. My siblings and I actually laugh about it, I know, odd reaction.

            "I\u2019m 62f white woman and my mother was very similar.  Didn\u2019t punch my stomach but slapped me. A lot. Lots of punishments, verbal abuse. I got out when I was 18. It affected my life for years and I know it still does. Im very glad you got away and wish you the best moving forward. I say it\u2019s like the rings of a tree, the people in the first ring, closest to her, get the most abuse. It was her sisters when she was young and me as she got older.  The outer rings think she\u2019s a wonderful person and never understood why I rarely wanted anything to do with her. The abuse is bad but when you have people around say/tell/think YOU are the bad one it feels impossible to ever speak your truth. It meant a lot to me when other people said THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT. Even though I knew that, just having other people acknowledge it validated it for me. So, OP, this is not your fault. In no way did you deserve this.

She would throw some of my clothes in a trash bag, throw it out the front door and push me out after it, locking the door behind me. Obviously, as a young child i would scream and cry and bang on the door, promising anything to be let back inside. It was a terrifying experience, and the worst part was, half the time it was either due to a very minor transgression, or due to my brother (golden child) lying to get me into trouble. \n\nIt continued happening until, at the age of 17, i said \u201cFine. Let me help you pack\u201d. I called my aunt to come get me and my mum went postal. Absolutely lost her shit, screaming, tantrum style meltdown. Aunt saw this behaviour in action and agreed to take me home with her. \n\nIn the space of 4 days, Mum called the cops and reported me kidnapped, threw everything from my room (including the bed, mattes and chest of draws) out onto the front lawn, called my school and reported me as a runaway, called everybody she knew and told them my nan had died (she didn\u2019t. Just wouldn\u2019t take mums side) and that was all in between calling my phone hundreds of times and screaming obscenities at me if i answered. \n\nAunt told me a few months later that she only meant to give me somewhere to stay for the night while mum cooled down. But after the tantrum continued, she knew i couldnt go back and just let me stay. I never went home again. And the fight that started it all? I tried to tell mum that i was so tired from working 2 jobs, babysitting her 3 other kids 6 nights a week and studying for school, that i just needed to take 1 day off and not go to my brothers soccer game that day.",

We had no where else to go and ended up turning to my dad for help. Thinking this was a win win for us both we moved in.\n\nA week and a half later, I caught him lying to my uncle about us not doing anything around the house. Mind u we cleaned out two rooms, a back porch, front porch and front yard, all parts of the place he hasn't touched for over 5 years save for the lawn. My fiancee was hurt to learn this, especially when he was distraught over thinking that he wouldn't be able to help my dad fix up the disaster he called a house.\n\nI asked my dad why I'm hearing that we were being lazy from his boss, and man, did he freak out. Started cursing me out and eventually told me he lies cos he could do whatever he wanted. Next thing I knew he called the cops on us and threatens to have us kicked out \n\nI know it was an idol threat, and part of me knew he had no real intention of kicking me out, he just wanted to bully me and my fiancee into kissing his ass and accepting that if we don't he'll call the cops and try to have us arrested (he even told the cops we were waiting on his boss to sell us weed which is decriminalized in NC, but still illegal for recreational use). I could not accept that and set about finding another place to go.\n\nLucky, my fiancees parents offered us a place to stay ... In another state... So, with that, my fiancee and I packed our sedan with as much as it could fit, called his dad, and moved to another state without my dad's knowledge.

I called the county, asked for their story, and they said he claimed to have \u201chis social \u201c written on a small piece of paper, and a bunch of other details\u2026 no problem, so I informed them, there has been a mistake, they\u2019ve allowed someone to put this property in my name and if they didn\u2019t take it back I had more than adequate representation and was willing to go that route but it wasn\u2019t my first choice.\nNow you can understand how this would happen to a small county, why would anyone expect someone was hiding assets under someone else\u2019s name, without any solid idea of how to get them back. \nBut what this basically meant for them is, they\u2019ve Received payment for this and now get it back, \nSo they mail me deeds to sign over and have notarized, which I do, and they take the property back. \nHe was living in the building on the property!!!

Just a day before I flew out I must've eaten something dodgy because I got the infamous \"Delhi Belly\" (diarrhoea).\n\n As someone who likes to think ahead, I decided to book aisle seats for all my flights, knowing I'd probably be taking multiple trips to the bathroom. The compliance begins on a 4h connecting flight:\n\nAs I made my way to my seat, I realised an older woman had taken it for herself. I pointed at the number above but instead of moving to her middle seat, she got up and motioned for me to sit in it. At this point I thought about telling her what the deal was with my colonic calamity but decided to just let my actions speak for me.\n\nAs soon as the seatbelt sign went off after takeoff I got up to take the first of many dumps. She had actually fallen asleep at this point so I had to wake her up so she could get up (grumpily). \n\n20 minutes later I had to go again.\n\nA total of 4 shits later and we're still 1.5 hours from landing, she's getting irate. Finally, after my 5th and final defecation she offers to swap seats. \nCherry on the top - I didn't even get up again until we landed.\n\nTL;DR Rude woman takes my seat, pays the price in poop trips.\n\nEdit: to everyone who is saying I was being an asshole - hell yeah I was being an asshole! Why should I have to explain myself because she can't follow the rules? It was clear she knew what she was doing from the beginning.",

The customer noticed that we had missed several of these hourly checks after the day shift left for the day.

I told them to leave voicemails, which they did for the remaining year that I worked there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you are curious, we only had one guy in the area where these machines were located that took the readings at night.

Green for running, red for down, blue for scrapping and white for maintenance. They were changed by pressing a button mounted on the wall next to the machine that was independent from everything else. ( pressing the button only changed the light color and did nothing to the machine) well they guy that had them set up was known around the shop for being a huge dick about production numbers and downtime. After a meeting headed by him telling us how bad we've been doing, he told us he had all the buttons set up so they would send him an email EVERY TIME one of the status lights changed. So needless to say that entire 12 hour night shift after that meeting every operator in the plant pressed the buttons repeatedly all night.

        "selftext": "Edit:  MC stands for Malicious Compliance. This has nothing to do with Minecraft. \n\n\nStory starts now:\n\nAbout five years ago I was the office guy for a small lumber mill. My direct supervisor was the general manager, but the owner was also pretty hands on. \n\nThe mill wasn't generating as much profit as the owner believed it could (he was probably right, the guy was smart as a whip with 60+ years of experience). \n\nOne of the things the owner tried to do was hire an outside consultant to try and find ways we could safely increase productivity or cut expenses. The guy had owned and operated his own mill and also had a ludicrous amount of experience. \n\nOne of the things the consultant had been pushing for was running the mill into overtime. He thought we could increase productivity without incurring more expense than we gained. \n\nMy boss asked me to run an analysis of how much we would gain/lose if we ran overtime. I did the math and gave him the results, even in the best case every minute of overtime would result in a net loss to the company. This report had taken me several hours as I wanted to be sure I gave him the right answer. My boss took it, nodded, and the next day announced we would be running the mill in overtime. \n\nTwo weeks later when I prepared the end of month financial statements it showed a large loss. I was quietly seething, since I felt like I had been asked a pointless question, my time wasted, and my input ignored. \n\nBut, looking back on it with significantly more experience, I think I know what happened. I think my boss was bothered by the consultant who had come in to tell him how to do his job and then given him bad advice. The owner wouldn't listen to my boss telling him he didn't need a consultant, so he did exactly what the consultant suggested and let the owner judge for himself. \n\nAs far as my report went? I think he just wanted to be sure it wouldn't cost us too much when he pulled the trigger. \n\nTom, if you're reading this, I'm sorry I was resentful about the whole affair for the past five years, my bad. \n\nEdit: Please stop asking me where/who. I'm not doxxing them. \n\nTLDR: My boss needed a consultant off his back, so he had me check to see how much it would cost us to just follow his advice. We followed his advice, lost some money and got rid of the consultant.",

No better to work those already on staff into the ground to the point they started quitting for other more reasonable jobs.

            "No offense to any consultants on here but the easiest way I found to work with companies to make them more profitable is really just listening to the ideas from lower level managers (the grinders specifically) and regurgitate them to upper level management (after sitting on the info for 2 weeks and articulating it into a humble sales pitch) so the bottom half of the company becomes more efficient. Most of the time there is no way to an outsider can actually give rock solid advise off the bat and if they can, it makes you ask the question why the F dont you have a successful company already established in this sector. And usually the issue with most companies is that their upper level management or ownership just doesn't want to be proven wrong or shown up by a lower level employee because it is their job to be the problem solver. This is why companies with a healthy culture and healthy minded owner only require technical or trade specific advice to tackle a specific problem.",

        "selftext": "This happened my freshman year of college about 20 years ago. My university had just invested in a big new dining hall, and to help pay for their investment, required all new students to buy a 150 meal plan both semesters. This was a big financial burden being from a lower middle class family, but my parents pooled funds to help me out and make it happen. \n\nShortly in to my first semester I found out from friends that the meals you didn't use didn't roll over. Since I lived off campus I knew I wouldn't be able to use them all. Heading into November I realized I would end up with 60-75 meals leftover, and I complained about this a lot to family and friends because it seemed like such a waste. \n\nIn comes the plan. My freshman year of college was also my cousin's senior year and we hung out pretty often. He was the biggest trickster / prankster type you ever met. One night while we were drinking he says, \"What if you brought a bunch of homeless people to use up your meals! How much would that piss off those self righteous bast****!\" We laughed all night, but the more I thought about the idea, the more I really started to like it. We talked all weekend about it and hatched a plan. \n\nOn Monday morning we went down to the local salvation army around the corner. I have grown to really despise this organization, but in the early 2000s in small town USA its what we had. We told the lady at the desk I would like to feed people in need with my meal plan. She was hesitant at first but said she was working with people that this would be a huge blessing to, especially during the holiday season. She helped me organize 2 days the following week where around 30 people would meet me to eat at the dining hall. I would wear a certain hat so they could find me, and we would go eat. \n\nThe day finally arrived and all kinds of people were there. There were homeless people in tattered clothes. There were families with kids that seemed excited to eat out. There was even one family I will always remember that seemed embarrassed to take a handout, but I made an effort to talk to everybody and make them feel welcomed. \n\nAt noon we headed into the dining hall. I walked up to the lady at the entrance and said, \"These people are with me. They are my friends. I would like to swipe them in.\" She looked confused but reluctantly said okay. \n\nTo say we got every reaction humanly possible would be an understatement. There were staff that were obviously annoyed with the influx of diners. There were students that were laughing. There were students that were giving me the silent clap. There were snobbish faculty members that seemed to be disgusted at the type of people coming into the dining hall. I didn't care at all. Eventually, a head staff member came up and said they knew what I was doing and they didn't like it. I said, \"These are my friends eating with me. I paid for these meals. Am I doing anything wrong?\" She was stumped. \n\nThe next day the same situation happened with the same reactions. It seemed that I had caused quite a stir on campus, and it just so happened that the university president was eating there that day. She came up to me and said even though she would ask that I not tell me friends to do the same thing with their meals as the staff couldn't handle the influx of diners, she was proud that her students had the heart to do something for others like that. \n\nThe following semester I did the exact same thing. I even used my meals sparingly so I could bring more people. The one memory that will always stick out in my head is the family with the little kids so excited to go to the pizza bar and soft serve ice cream machine giggling the whole time. To this day it's still one of the proudest moments of my life. Me and my friends and family still have a drink and chuckle over the story and the snoody, angry reactions I got.",

I was living in the Little Five Points district of Atlanta, with a large homeless population (I'd spent eight weeks as one of them, and wasn't doing much better myself then, living in the basement of a flea market).  We also had a nearby Kroger store, back when they had a freshness guarantee (find anything out of date, get the fresh one free), so it wasn't uncommon to diligently hunt for any expired item just for free food, even if it had to be as exact a match as possible so one wasn't given much selection.  I once scored a three-liter Coke, which genuinely confused the manager who handled guarantee freebies, since that stuff lasts so long it really should have been bought or noticed first.  Well, one lucky night (for me; someone else may have lost a job over it) I found that the chef section (sandwiches, heat-and-serve entres, salads, etc.) had been missed in the nightly cleanup; it was just past midnight, and there were over a dozen things that had just expired.  A somewhat annoyed manager rang me out for \\~$110 in pre-2k dollars of fresh food that didn't need a kitchen, which of course I couldn't keep, so that night I fed pretty much the entire homeless population of Little Five Points instead.  One fellow who was slightly better off even gave me $5 for a couple sandwiches he could take to work as lunches, so I bought a Mtn. Dew to go with my share of the bounty.  It was a good night.",

            "I went to a top 30 US university though it is a public school. I also had a situation where I lived on campus and had a ton of meal swipes at the end of the term that didn\u2019t roll over. Most people were trading their swipes in for bottles of water or other lame items. My friends and I came up with the same idea after finals to try to give the meals away to homeless people. I wish I would have thought a few days ahead and/or reached out to an organization that could have helped organize. Instead I walked down to the village just off campus and approached homeless people about a free buffet meal. The first 3 I asked had zero interest (side note\u2026 over the years I saw all 3 of them picking half eaten food out of garbage cans). Finally I found 2 who were interested. It was quite the ordeal to keep them focused and to not bail out. Stopping to pick up cigarette butts. One dropped their vodka bottle and it broke which caused a panic that was only resolved by my promise to give them $20 to replace it after the meal. One\u2019s pants kept falling down and the other made a makeshift belt by tying the front 2 belt loops together with a rag. I could really tell that they were afraid both to leave their small areas where they slept/hung out and also to come onto campus. When I finally got them there one ran away just before I could swipe them in and the other ran after him. One came back eventually and I sat with him and talked as we ate. He packed away as much food as he could for later even through you aren\u2019t supposed to do takeaways. Anyway\u2026 it was definitely an experience and I learned a lot about the homeless and people in general. One thing that stuck out to me though was that I was completely wrong about the reaction of the dining staff. I assumed they would be so upset about it but they actually really appreciated it. Looking back on it, it makes sense as they were probably not making much move than minimum wage and understood the struggle. An eye opener for sure.",

I am a social media manager for a large university, and am considered \u201cessential staff\u201d for some instances (if there\u2019s a snow day, I can work from home but need to monitor social channels for questions, problems etc). \n\nWeeks before the virus got as widespread as it is now in the US, I asked my supervisor to consider remote options as my husband and I had been keeping a close look at its progression abroad, and he has an autoimmune disease, but I was literally laughed at and told it would never happen.\n\nLast week, our university announced that they\u2019d be shifting to online learning for three weeks. I again asked if we\u2019d be given remote options at this time as well to help flatten the curve, and given that my job can be done literally anywhere, it shouldn\u2019t be a problem. I again was told nope, as \u201cessential staff\u201d I\u2019d absolutely have to come in, and more details would be given in an HR email later that day.\n\nHR email comes in and affirms that ALL staff were expected to come in as normal (about 4,000 employees) and if you wanted to take time at home, you\u2019d need to take personal, vacation or sick time. Staff could call/email HR and make individual cases to request remote work, but I\u2019m in the state with the fourth-highest cases of COVID19 right now, and we all know college campuses are cesspools for disease, so staff is livid. \n\nThe next day, I emailed my supervisor again and told them that I called/emailed HR saying that if I don\u2019t get approval for remote work, I\u2019m going to follow email protocol and take sick leave for the foreseeable future. Luckily, I am in a union and can request up to 26 weeks of 100% paid sick leave for myself or caring for family, and I knew it would get approved. I said the ball was in their court, and they could either have me at home actually working, or have me at home and be down an essential staff member. Silence.\n\nIn the meantime, I got a phone call back from HR from a frantic employee who said they received literally thousands of emails/phone calls similar to the one I sent and I could expect an update by end of day. Turned out I was not the only one threatening their bosses with time off.\n\nAt 5 pm, we got an email that all staff and classes are remote until further notice. I know it\u2019s likely they would have eventually made this call anyway, but I\u2019d like to think the THOUSANDS of employees threatening malicious compliance made it happen sooner.",

Basically, we have a few out of state people who were hired to work exclusively from home, a few people who live an hour or so from campus so WFH 2-3 days a week, then people like me who live near campus and come to the office almost every day WFH maybe 1-2 times a month under special circumstances. \n\nThe new policies started with phrasing \u201cWorking from home is a *privilege*.\u201d We had to stop management right there, because it isn\u2019t really a privilege when people on the team work exclusively FH or WFH more often because they made the personal choice to live far from the office. \n\nOur county just mandated no gatherings of people in excess of 50+, although offices are excluded.

We spent today unlocking all of our old Canvas assignments and setting them up so students can review old curriculum, because we were told not to try and teach anything new during closure. They then presented us with a daily schedule that amounted to being available to respond promptly to parent/student e-mails, creating new online curricula should we go beyond 2 weeks, and then self-guided PD and team/dept meetings. Every day. For two weeks. And we were expected to be in the building, despite us being a 1:1 school with Canvas and all the bells and whistles it can come with, and every teacher being provided with at least one device we can take home.

We had an agreement with the different party bus operators that if they brought their groups to our bar they would get in for free.  (lively crowds are good for business)\n\nSo one night I'm working and a guy comes in with his girlfriend and I tell him its 2 bucks a head.  He grumbles about it and I give him the same line I tell anyone who complains: \"A $2 cover is the cheapest thing you will buy here tonight, if you can't afford it you might want to go somewhere else.\"   He doesn't want to look cheap in front of his lady, so of course he pays.  \n\nA couple minutes later he's back saying he just talked to some people who didn't have to pay, and wants to know why he got singled out.  I tell him about the party bus rule and say those people must have come in on a bus.  He motions towards some people sitting with his girlfriend and tells me, \"You didn't charge my friends, and they didn't come on a bus.\"   I recognized the people and when they came in I asked them if they were from the bus, and they had said yes.  So they lied to me, It happens and normally I wouldn't worry about it.\n\nI tell him, well it sounds like I made a mistake, I guess its their lucky night.  (That's my hint to him that he should let it go) That's not good enough for him.  He gets louder and keeps demanding I refund his $4 \"to keep things fair\".   I've had it with him.  I tell him, \"You're right. Its not fair.  Let me fix it for you.\" He smirks because he thinks he's getting a refund, but he doesn't realize all I'm giving is some sweet MC. \n\nHe smirk disappeared when I stepped away from the cash drawer and walked over to where his friends were sitting.  In my most polite voice I said, \"Hey, sorry to bother you guys, but there's a $2 cover tonight and your friend here told me you didn't pay. I must have misheard you when I asked if you were with the party bus, but I need to collect the cover from you now.\"  \n\nThe looks of betrayal they gave him were priceless.

A senior executive who had worked there successfully for years was caught with a falsification on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. He was fired immediately, and a new policy was instituted requiring all employees to sign a form giving the company permission to query the college or university with their highest claimed degree for verification.\n\nI have a doctorate from an old prestigious European university, an institution that I was quite sure would have no interest in such a query. But whatever... I signed the permission form and attached a note warning the company that the university would probably ignore the request. Which it did.\n\nAfter a month or two with no response, HR called me in and said that the university had not responded (as I warned) but that corporate would accept a photocopy of my degree. Fine, I'm good with that.\n\nRemember the \"old, prestigious European university\" part? My degree is a piece of actual parchment about the size of a throw rug, with a wax seal about a centimeter thick, and written entirely in Latin.\n\nSo I bring it into the office and photocopy it a bit at a time by sliding it around on the photocopier window. Takes like 12 pages to get it all. I staple them into a pile and give it to HR, who reluctantly pass it on to corporate.\n\nAnother month passes. HR calls me in again. \"Corporate is complaining that your degree is written in a foreign language.\"\n\n\"Yep,\" I say. It's in Latin. \"Tell them to find a priest to translate it.\" And walked out. \n\nNever heard from them again about it.\n\n_______________\n\nEDIT FOR CLARIFICATION. (1) This took place well over 20 years when stuff like this did not all happen on the web... snailmail and paper were the standard.  \n\n(2) Commenters are taking the \"throw rug\" simile a little too literally. It's quite large but would make a rather measly throw rug.\n\n(3) My work was in the civilian sector and did not require a clearance.

It is considered an official document but it is not issued by the state unless it\u2019s a public university\n\nMy US university insisted that it had to be in a closed envelope addressed to the university.\n\nThe process of obtaining a copy of the transcript is reserved for extreme cases like the original being burned lost or stolen, is very expensive and takes months to complete as they have to manually verify the grades for every class I took. It is literally re-issuing the transcript as opposed to obtaining a copy.\n\nThey do not mail it as mail service is notorious for losing stuff, it is only available in person\n\nI explained this to several staff members, who were treating me like they\u2019d finally caught the elusive criminal mastermind that had somehow neglected to account for their administrative genius or something. I had classmates and professors from all over the world so it surely couldn\u2019t have been that hard to understand that there is no such thing as a whole office dedicated to mailing official transcripts to other schools in other countries but fine, whatever.\n\nThey agreed to accept it if I could get it in a sealed envelope bearing the university\u2019s logo, then place it inside a courier\u2019s envelope and mail it to them myself. Which would add almost another hundred on top of the couple of hundred it cost to get the transcript re-issued in the first place.\n\nSo I had to time the request to be completed by the time I\u2019d visit my home country, then beg for it in a closed envelope then fork over more money for the international shipping.\n\nWhen I get back I check in with the office and they said sorry we can\u2019t accept this: the UPS envelope had been sliced open by customs for a random check and taped shut, with a small notification slip left inside.\n\nThey wanted me to do it all again. I asked them if customs opened it again would they rejected again and they said yes.\n\nI has a nervous breakdown as they were giving me no options and my student visa would fall through if they booted me from the program, endangering any future visa / residence applications.\n\nThe head of my department said there was nothing he could do (he was from India) and the head of the office involved wouldn\u2019t even talk to me.\n\nIn the end out of sheer luck one of my classmates actually worked at this office and was assistant to the head of the office. She was from Russia. Said she would talk to her boss who said it was fine since the inner envelope had not been opened. Classmate said the other ladies that worked in the office were lifers who just couldn\u2019t be bothered.",

            "I do not have a degree. I worked for a community college for 5 years and one day they decided that people in my position were required to have a bachelor's degree. I told them no thank you and asked how long I had to find another job. They dissolved the requirement because they couldn't find anyone to fill my position.",

            "Back in the mid 90s my mom was denied taking the nursing board exam because they couldn't verify her HIGH SCHOOL. She argued that since they did recognize her college degree(she got a nursing college degree in the Soviet union) that surely they don't need her high school diploma? They still denied her.\n\nShe's fine. She got her PhD and now does just fine for herself. But yea, lack of flexibility robbed the community of her expertise and wildly changed her life's trajectory. It's sad because I'm sure similar stories have happened for the - NOT better",

            "Not quite the same, but I once took a job with a big consulting corporation who outsourced \u201cemployment verification\u201d to some third party that wanted payslips and employment verification going back ten plus years. In that time, I worked for one big company that was acquired by another big company, and three failed startups. I tried to explain this to them but they were insistent on getting phone numbers to call these places. Then they threatened (on behalf of my new employer) to rescind my offer because nobody answered the phone at the office of these defunct dot-com era companies.",
            "I've had a similar problem but with my birth certificate. For some reason everyone wants a freshly issued one (like something has changed between my birth and now, i dunno, maybe i've decided to be born in a different city or something). The problem is, this is not a common practice in the ex URSS world, you get a nice embossed birth certificate ONCE, which is valid all your life. The state can reissue one only in case of loss or destruction through a lenghty procedure you have to do in person (or bribe some official if you want it faster). Long story short they wanted me to travel 3000km to my birth city.",

            "To add an alternate story to this - my wife finished her degree program, walked at graduation and had 10 years of experience in the field out of college had her degree checked on by an employer and found out the University never recorded her graduation and she did not in fact graduate. She applied for graduation and everything but the file got stuck in a cabinet and never processed. \n\nShe had to get an exemption from the Dean as the curriculum had changed slightly so that she would not have to return to take additional classes. To top off the story the university said they could not backdate the degree and her degree is now dated 10 years after she finished college. Also HR was going to fire her if the university didn\u2019t issue a degree (although she had been doing the job for years). \n\nIt was a serious concern that the university would make her take additional 1-2 100 level courses to meet the current degree program requirements.",

            "I'm preparing for the downvotes, but this does not seem like an unreasonable request.  \n\nDoing an audit is a reasonable response to a major case of fraud.  Expecting a validation to a reference query is a reasonable request.  Expecting a photocopy of a degree is reasonable.  Needing an (English) translation is a reasonable request.  \n\nThe poor guys who're doing the audit are probably complaining about the a-hole who didn't just give a small simple document and made life 10x more uncomfortable for them.",
