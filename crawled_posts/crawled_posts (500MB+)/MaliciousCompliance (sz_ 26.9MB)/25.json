        "selftext": "So my first job I ever worked at for a few years was a grocery retail store, with several different departments, including a deli for lunch meat and cheese, which is where I worked. \n\nOne night I was working 1pm - 9pm, 9pm is when the deli and other special departments closed and we're expected to be done and clocked out, but the rest of the store remained open 24/7 for general groceries. \n\nIt was me and one other guy, we had an especially busy night, and we were a little behind on our cleaning as a result but we had our meat slicing machines already coated with sanitizer after working for 15 minutes to get all the little meat chunks and shavings out of every corner, as we were pretty serious about making sure those things were clean as can be. \n\nIt's about 8:55 at this point, we're almost late to leave and the store we worked for did NOT like overtime, if you were getting any amount of overtime you would get chewed out the next day for it, even for a little amount. A woman walks up to the counter and starts looking through the product, as we had a glass case filled with a bunch of types of our lunch meats pre-sliced and ready to go for bagging up. She looks at one and says \"I want this turkey right here, but I want it freshly sliced.\" I of course look to my coworker and we both can see the 2 slicers we have are still covered in the sanitizer we use and are drying, as per the food safety protocol written on the bottle that says to allow 20-30 minutes MINIMUM for the sanitizer to dry after application.\n\nI tell her \"Well ma'am we really can't do that right now, our slicers are both being cleaned at the moment as the department is closed in 5 minutes but i'd be glad to get you something here from our cold case\".\n\n\"So you're not gonna slice it fresh for me, thats what you're saying?\" I replied, \"Thats correct, I apologize\".\n\nWithout another word she walks away and myself and my coworker go back to what we were doing, and we finish cleaning and go home after about 5 more minutes, narrowly clocking out on time.\n\nFast forward 2 days later, me and the same coworker come in and start getting to work like a normal day. About 3pm (two hours into my shift) I personally get called into the head honchos office. The \"Store Director\" as they're titled. I think nothing of it and head on upstairs and go inside the office and sit down, the Store Director hands me a piece of paper and says \"tell me what caused this\". I look at the paper and its a printed out screenshot of a Google review for our store, 1 star out of 5, and a full paragraph from that lady of 2 nights before complaining that she didn't get her freshly sliced meat from \"the rude employee\" and then described specifically me.\n\nI explained exactly what happened two nights prior, as clearly as i'm typing it out here. The director is getting *heated* and begins to cut me off while im speaking, asking \"Why would slicers be covered in sanitizer at 8:55? You're scheduled to work until 9pm.\" I said yes I am, but seeing as im constantly being reminded not to get any overtime so I usually start cleaning them around 8:30pm.\n\nThe director gets even more upset and raises her voice, \"I don't CARE, thats not how it works! If you have a customer you SERVE them. And you'd better start making sure those shelves are FILLED before you leave or you won't be working here anymore, now get out\".\n\nI'm pretty salty at this point, I go back down to the dept and my coworker asked what happened, and I told him. He says, so they want *everything* done before we leave? I said yep! And without another word he knew what we needed to do. \n\n9pm hits as usual and our shelves are at the usual standard of half full, but seeing as we've been given a new standard, we decided to stay and make sure we did what I was instructed to do. We spent next next several hours past closing time slicing, and slicing, and slicing until every single tray of meat and cheese was FULL. \n\nWe had plastic totes in the big fridge full of cheese that we sliced that were wrapped up in half pound blocks for ease of sale, so we decided to fill that tub over the brim with every single type of cheese we had available. We cut up around 70lbs of cheese and wrapped it up in the fridge.\n\nWe also had a Subway style sandwich counter, where we made sandwiches to-order and also pre made on the shelves for sale. We made double the usual amount of sandwiches and filled the shelves, as per requested. Not a single shelf had a single empty spot on it by the time we were done.\n\nAfter every single possible item and shelf was as full as it could be, we finally started to clean and close. \n\nIt was around 3AM when we finally left. The department opens at 5am. We were exhausted but our spiteful overtime venture made us feel pretty good. We got about 6 hours overtime in. They hated anyone getting even 5 to 10 minutes of overtime.\n\nWe both came in the next day at 1pm as usual, expecting complete retaliation. But nope, instead, our dept manager of the Deli kinda saunters over to us and says \"Hey uh...you should be good to start cleaning up at 8:30 like usual.. I think she (The Director) got the point you made.\"\n\nNormally overtime would be asked to be taken care of by clocking out for lunches or coming in later than usual, but they let us keep all 6 hours of that overtime. They never said anything to us about overtime again after that. I accepted a job that paid almost double about 6 months after this incident, and never ever went back to retail hell.",

            "I've posted this story before but here is my story about working in a deli. Like you, I didn't keep all of our shelves full because I was the one who kept track of what we were throwing away and started making an amount much closer to what we actually sell. After doing that with zero issues for a month or so we were getting some big wigs to come into the store, I learned a long time ago to not care about them.\n\nWell they told the store manager and co-store manager that they didn't like that the hot cases weren't full to the brim, and specifically there weren't enough chickens out. I was told by the co-store manager that I needed more chickens out, so I asked how many more he wanted. \"I don't want you to stop cooking chickens.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n6 hours later and I am done with my shift and there isn't a piece of fried or rotisserie chicken left in the entire store to cook. I never stopped cooking chickens and even had both of the ovens running because that is exactly what I was told to do. People were a little pissed the rest of the week when none of it was made at all but hey maybe they should order 8x the amount of food they need so that big wigs can feel like they do something useful.",
            "> They let us keep all 6 hours of that overtime.\n\nProbably because it\u2019d be a crime if they didn\u2019t\u2014just as (depending on where you were working) it would have been legally questionable to have you on the clock for 14 hours.\n\nBut, all that said, I applaud your resolve, there.",
            "Good on you for this. I've been put into this exact squeeze many times myself - got fired over it once when someone came in 5 minutes before closing and wanted to order EIGHTEEN sandwiches, I was alone and it was more bread than we had in the store at the moment. There was no way I could've handled that situation that would've made both the boss and the customer happy, so, shrug. \\[She wanted to get rid of me to hire her friends anyway. Last I heard that shop closed down within a year of them getting rid of me lol\\]",
            "Ah the deli counter... How I ^don't miss the days of \"You need to put more chickens out.\" Followed by \"Why are we throwing out so much chicken!?\"",
            "Thats how my current job is. Overtime is VERY frowned upon, but yet we have a VERY specific list of cleaning that HAS to be done, but yet if a customer comes we HAVE to serve them despite the department being closed 45 minutes ago. It's stressful and I hate it but the money is the best around. Cleaning takes 1.5-2 hours for 2 people.",

            "oh my god, i think i witnessed someone do almost this exact thing in person at the deli counter at my store.  \n\ni worked at a walmart like store as a cashier.  they had just cut the hours at the deli counter.  most of those people were.....not slow, but evenly paced individuals.  not rushing, but careful people compared to other departments.  probably because they worked around more knives than other people in the store so they just seemed more careful.  more careful than the butcher department.  \n\nanyways, i digress.  so they cut the amount of staff working in the deli.  normally the close at 9, like you.  but because they reduced the headcount, and not the amount of work needing to be done.  so closed by 9, maybe clocked out by 10 was the normal pace.  but not today.  \n\non this first day, i think i saw the nice old lady clock out at 2 or 3am.  because she was the only one left to do all the closing tasks.  i think normall they'd have 2 people to close.  1 person left to help customers, and 1 person to do all the closing tasks as the night wound down.  but now with only 1 person around, she had to help customers until 9pm when the counter closed service.  so she had to BEGIN \"daily closing tasks\" after 9pm.\n\ni think i only saw her close one or two times that late.  they must have adjusted the staff back up to handle all the required tasks.",
            "Absolute worst job I ever had was a deli clerk attached to a grocery store (safeway deli).\n\nWorking in food service sucks. Working in food service and answering to the management of a grocery store SUCKS.\n\nWe had secret shoppers. If they asked you where something was, you had to take them to the item and TOUCH it. Kept getting dinged for it. So finally started leaving the deli during lunch rush to take people to items if they happened to ask where anything was while I made their sandwich. Long line and I'm the only one working? Fucking tough.",
            "I had almost the exact same story at a kroger! I worked 2-10p, deli closes at 9p so we have time to clean. Ifa busy, I begin closing mildly earlier, like 5m. A lady comes in at 9:01, tries to order, gives me a sob story, I decline. My store manager comes over and tells me from now on I have to serve any customer that comes by (she seemed frustrated by the lady too tbf). I agree. The next day this witch comes in at 9:58p. All the slicers are cleaned. I take her order anyways. Corned beef, ham, and cheese. Due to in house restrictions these all use different slicers. I do her job and reclean the slicers. After a is said and so s its nearly midnight (I was going to be over by sometime regardless). She does this shit two more times. I get dressed down by my manager, she tells me to forget what my store manager said. I tell her to get her down here to tell me. After she learns I got 4h unapproved OT she tells u that we are now allowed to enforce the strict closing time. Witch tries to come in 1 more time, she sees the new notice saying the deli closes at 9p no exceptions. She tries to tell our manager again, and this time she's told to kick rocks. The witch starts coming by at 8:59p for the next month",
            "I'm still trying to figure out how this idiot expected you to leave at 9 if you waited until 9 to start cleaning the meat slicer...",
            "Some customers are never satisfied. I had a similar one back in the day. Wanted fresh shucked corn and we had just run out. Told her we were out I'd have to go make some more and it would be a few minutes. Wasn't good enough, she Karen'd (before the term existed) off to the manager who came steaming in about it.\n\nI had gone to start making more but in all the time she wasted going to the manager she could have had her corn and left. I guess Karen's exist in a separate plain of existence where time works differently.",
            "Wait a minute, take lunches or come in later to deal with the overtime? The fuck is this? You put in the extra work to help the business and they have the gall to punish you by depriving you of those potential wages? That hellhole doesn't deserve to remain in business",

            "Don't you love it when managers don't fucking listen to their employees",
            "I worked in a deli when younger and at least the cleaning portion sounds familiar. We generally closed at 9 but we started the cleaning by 8 (hated cleaning the rotisserie chicken machine). We'd clean one slicer early and keep one going until 8:30 or so. But since we were a private business and anyone in charge still there by closing, more often than not one of the owners, also worked the machines and weren't going to restart for a late customer because it just wasn't worth it in time, energy and payroll. After 8:30 you were basically getting scraps, anything cold or anything that could be warmed up quickly.\n\nOne memorable exception. We were the closest kosher deli near JFK Airport and I guess there was an El Al flight delayed because we got a takeout order for well over 100 sandwiches near closing. That was screw it, let's make some money (we all got extra for staying) and we'll clean again (I didn't take the order but I imagine whoever did made sure the CC went through first)!",

The losses on this had to be substantial, but it's not my store, and not my problem, so whatever...  It became my problem one day when I hooked up a cute girl I had been flirting with up with a tart for $0.99.  We normally sold these things for $2.99 so a whopping $2 off.  I know, I'm a maniac... Well this girl took the tart, and I took my break.  I guess she decided that she didn't want the tart and returned it to the deli counter.  My manager saw that I had discounted the tart while I was on break, and when I returned she proceeded to lay into me talking about how the department was $40K off or some wild number like that.  She blamed me for her losses and fired me on the spot.  I wish I could say that I had some smart ass remark, but alas I did not.  Frankly, school was about to start again, and I was going to leave that job within a few weeks.  I have always looked back and just chuckled how a middle aged woman blamed her mismanagement on a college kid for discounting an item $2.",

My manager was on break when it was time for me to go home. I called the manager in the next department over (purses) to let her know my shift was over. This was during Christmas time, we were short staffed and the store was busy. She told me I couldn\u2019t leave my register until the next person got there (who was apparently running late). I told her I was exhausted, dehydrated and had already worked an extra 2 hours and was ready to go home. She refused to let me go and proceeded to ignore all my calls.

Next thing I know I\u2019m helping this nice elderly couple and then I\u2019m on the floor staring at the ceiling to a lot of concerned faces and an EMT unit. Apparently I FAINTED from dehydration.

But they could see I repeatedly called and she didn\u2019t answer, she never did speak to me again.",
            " It really is all in how you ask. Old, old manager from way long time ago, as soon as she knew she'd need someone to stay a little later would pull you aside and ask nicely. \"I'm sorry to ask you this but would you be willing to stay 45 minutes extra tonight? So and so can't be in tonight and other so and so was willing to cover but needs extra time to get here.\" It was usually transmission problem, illness, what not. We had a full time employee that had some agreement with HR and all that, really nice lady, who had some nerve thing where it felt like lightning would shoot through a limb, almost on heartbeat or just feel really hot and burning. There was at least two times I drove her to the doctor or walk-in area of the hospital. Not quite ER but definitely needed to be seen ahead of others type deal.\n\nHell, 45 minutes to help cover for a nice coworker and was asked real politely? Sure, not an issue.\n\nI remember one time, due to a couple planned for events, a wedding, meant we were a couple short. A coworker getting married and their best friend was also a coworker. Another was on vacation. That left us a few down, but there were still backup if needed. Until they had an unexpected death of a close family member and wasn't able to work. I know what this means.\n\nWas feeling resigned but not mad. Two events were planned for and we'd had backup until an unexpected event. Can't plan for everything. Now, I was near the end of a 13 day straight deal. It was Thurs, the previous Sunday was just my once every two months turn to work Sunday, and someone had been really sick the Saturday too. Shit luck, it happens. After the coworker with the sudden death left to go home, I'm asked to go see the manager. Tomorrow was the last day of a two week long streak. And I was asked to come in Saturday. If it had been another place, I mighta said I had plans, but it wasn't anyone's fault. And, one huge thing, was my manager only asked you stuff she was willing to do herself. And I really fucking appreciated that. None of that managing from home or hiding in the office when we're swamped. So I agreed. I was already well over 40hrs that week anyway so OT, since after the first hour past 40, even salary got OT. (At the end I just hated that place so much, but for most of the time we had good benefits, just shit pay).\n\nWell, right after my lunch which was a half-hour nap haha, apparently two part time college students who knew we were in a bind decided to call and offer to come in to make some extra $$$. Hell yes. My manager, she sent me home almost 3 hours early, still paid hours too. And HR called me later in the evening to talk about compensation. I'm always wary of the person who can legally fire me for literally no reason. Since we were a government entity, county level but operated in city limits. There was some sort of snarl or something between city, county, and state. State ended up winning and had decided that I was getting too much OT pay. HR basically offered me three days off for having to work three unpaid hours. I know it was partly a political thing but didn't matter to me!\n\nGet 99% of my OT and around four and 1/3 days off with regular pay? Then two days work, Thurs and Fri, then two days off for the weekend? Fuck yeeaaaaah! And all this because my manager wasn't some sort of petty tyrant, but was just a nice person. Was so sad when she left. We threw her a party.",

At midnight when the midnight big boss comes in I ask her how much more overtime they want me to do, since I\u2019m starting to feel tired. She told me to go home and asked who approved my overtime. No one did! I wasn\u2019t allowed to leave until released. The next day the big boss put out a new email that you are not to work overtime unless instructed to by a supervisor. \n\nNow we can\u2019t leave without permission AND we can\u2019t not leave without permission. \n\nBig boss got fired recently for other management failures.

            "I had a similar experience while working in warehouse. One night I was making a cardboard bale before leaving for the night, 10 or so minutes before my shift was up, and we had to take them outside whenever they were made. Only the managers had keys for the doors though, so I called and waited for one until I'd already stayed 15 minutes past my shift and since we weren't allowed overtime, I parked the bale out of the way and where they would clearly be able to see it once someone finally got back there. Next day, I get pulled into the office and told that they reviewed the cameras and saw that I just left it there and said that I would be wrote up if I didn't finish the task again. So later on that night a around the same time, another bale needs to be made, I did that, called for a manager, and I sat by the back door for the next hour and a half before one finally shows up, asks me what I'm doing there so late and finally opens the door for me. Got pulled into the office again the next day and asked why I sat there on my phone for that long instead of just leaving it out of the way and when I calmly explained that I had just gotten in trouble for doing that exact thing the day before, they just shook their heads and asked me which manager had told me that.

            "I worked for a place that was pretty unforgiving about minor lateness and put you in positions where you had to stay up to an hour after your shift ended.\n\nGot written up for my latenesses so I started dropping everything I was doing at the time I was scheduled to leave. This lasted like 3 days and then they made an effort to prepare me for the end of my shift. Like, if I was in the middle of a sale with someone I would hand them off to someone else. \n\nThey three customers complain that I just walked out on them.",
            "A while back I worked the grill at a fast food place. The standing rule was to ask if anything needed to be done before heading home and we should check in about a half hour before the end of shift.\n\nThis was mostly to ensure continuity between shifts and make sure the transition would be as smooth as possible.\n\nI worked days and a newer manager responsible for writing the schedules started working nights. We got along well, so the compliance wasn't malicious, just compliance.\n\nA half hour before end of shift, I stared asking if she needed me to do anything. Most of the requests were pretty standard: make sure they were properly stocked and the area was tidy.\n\nAfter about 2 hours, when I came back she said, \"Tavrock, what is with you today? Normally you do a great job and you're an independent worker. Why are you constantly asking me what to do?\"\n\nWhen I reminded her I was scheduled off 90 minutes ago but had to ask her what needed to be done before I could leave, she about had a heart attack.\n\nYou see, overtime was a terminal offense. Because I was staying late at a manager's discretion, she could be fired.\n\nShe juggled my hours and covered opening the store the next day.",
            "This reminds, I worked as a Duty Manager for a large petrol station on the M4 Motorway Services.\n\nStarted shift at 1400, 8 hours later there's no Duty Manager to replace me. So here I go on a second dose running the night shift. Eight hours after that, there's nobody to run the morning shift. We need one manager and 4 staff to run this busy stampede, we have 2 and me. I'm livid at this point.\n\nWouldn't you have guessed it? At 1400, when my shift is ending there's nobody to replace me. I called the main services and told them they have a problem and as I'll be going home. Someone phone's me back and they ask me to stay, to which I said tell the site manager the petrol station will be closed in the next 10 minutes. There's a huge fine if that happens as the site must have a 24 hour petrol station. I told them I wasn't doing a fourth shift in a row after being awake for over 30 hours, and hung up.\n\nAlmost 10 minutes later, the site manager shows with 2 staff members. It became someone else's problem after that. No thank you, no apology. I handed the keys and left.",

Payroll will skyrocket and the manager will have to both course correct and explain why to their supervisors. \n\nI'm a retail store manager and my DM constantly tells me that the whole team needs to \"stay until the store is 100%\". And I'm like yeah sure, but then let everyone go when their shift is over. Why? Because it's the law and idk I actually care about my employees and would never abuse them. You can't keep employees past their posted scheduled shifts unless they agree to it. No one can be forced to stay. I know a manager who used to lock the exit doors and since they could only exit with the key, would make everyone stay until 1am or later making things perfect, including minors (can't work past 10pm in Colorado). That's literally holding people against their will. If anyone ever does this to you at work CALL THE COPS (ACAB but also get that manager is huge trouble).  \n\nAnd if your company requires a bag check before you leave, that bag check better be done ON THE CLOCK. I don't care if you've gotta stand at the place to clock out waiting for a manager for hours, you do not clock out. And if you've ever stood around waiting for a bag check after clocking out, request that time. Review video footage. SUE. THEIR. ASSES. Call the labor board. \nWe have to support our teams, stand up for ourselves, and not let these huge companies get away with treating people this way. \n\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk.",

You clearly don't like that company or helping them survive. Without people working at a business, the business fails and won't survive which means everyone who works there will lose their jobs. It should be a win-win where a business gives you a job and a way to make money to pay bills etc (as long as they don't mistreat you and they do everything you both agreed upon when signing up) and you work for them and help them survive in an evermore challenging environment for businesses to survive. \n\nEveryone in America seems to be so evil nowadays. It's an \"us vs them\" mentality everywhere you look. Toxicity and hatred are flowing through us instead of collaboration and compromising for the benefit of everyone. This is not how America became the hegemon of the world. This is how nation-states fall and empires crumble. United we stand, divided we fall. We are certainly on the decline which I'm sure everyone can see. \n\nAll in all, find a new job where you actually like the job or people instead of taking pleasure in hurting your company and the people around you.

Same disclaimer - I'm not your lawyer and none of this is legal advice (don't take legal advice from internet randos).\n\nClient comes in with a seemingly simple auto collision. Client was hit, other driver got out and said something like \"Ohmygod are you ok? I'm so sorry, I dropped my phone and reached to get it...\". Client had a dashcam which recorded the whole thing including the admission of guilt. Easy client right? \n\nTurns out the admission was really important, because the type of accident didn't make a 'determination of fault' easy (imagine a rear end collision at a red light as an easy determination, but a collision at a four way stop sign as a hard determination). When the cops showed up, the police report found both drivers at fault *AND* did not mention any statements from the other driver.\n\nBut we have our admission and my client's damages were above the other guy's policy limit. So I send a demand to the insurance company for policy limits. Note that the insurance company has an obligation to negotiate in good faith, which becomes important later.\n\nLawyer from insurance reaches out and says (basically) - \"Look, my client says they were driving safely, and the police report says shared fault.\" The initial offer is like 10 grand. I replied \"Yeah but my client had a dashcam and it recorded your client admitting fault.\"\n\nIts important to understand that this was before dashcams were common. It wasn't my first case with a dashcam, but it might have been my third or fourth. No mention of the dashcam was made on the police report.\n\nInsurance attorney says (I *imagine* while twirling a dumb mustache) \"Interesting, can you send me a copy of the video?\" I say sure and send it over. He replies \"I can't open this!\" So I send him a link to vlc media player \"It's a weird extension, and windows media player won't play it. But VLC will, just follow the installer instructions and it should play no problem.\"\n\nHe says \"I'm not installing something to watch your alleged dash cam video. Send me a file I can play if you want me to consider it.\"\n\nThis makes me unhappy, but I tried again \"It will take less than a few minutes to install, you can watch the video and listen to your client admit fault.\" He say \"We are done here until you send something I can play.\"\n\n*Cue malicious compliance music - Country Grammar*\n\n*Start super cool montage of me going through other client files*\n\n*Stop montage as I open a file and my face is bathed in a golden light radiating from an old memorex CD*\n\nSo I found a DIFFERENT dashcam video (which did not contain any sound) BUT it could be played with windows media player AND it was close enough to my current client's facts that if you weren't paying attention it could pass. Other attorney just asked for *a file* he could play, right?\n\nI sent it over. He says \"Wow no sound. Guess you're done buddy.\" So I sued. During discovery I sent a CD over which included the ORIGINAL video AND a copy of VLC. He must have ignored it because he didn't say anything about it.\n\nDuring a pretrial motion hearing, I played the video for the judge. The judge might have heard the other lawyer's jaw hit his desk. The insurance attorney says \"Your honor this is not the video he sent to me!\" In my mind's eye I see the malicious compliance death star preparing to fire.\n\n\"Judge I thought he might say that. Here is a copy of our emails where I described the video, provided the video, and sent instructions on how to play it. Here is a copy of the CD I sent with discovery which ALSO has the video and a copy of VLC. Finally, here is a copy of the unrelated video which I sent to fulfill his request of *something he could play*\".\n\nOther attorney asks for a recess. Because he refused the initial demand of policy limits I told him I would argue he did not negotiate in good faith. We settled for well above policy limits. Client was very happy.\n\nP.S. don't go to law school #notworth.",

The judge probably grew tired of it but it was his way of showing he was in charge.\n\nMy lawyer knew another thing too about the lawyer and that he had a habbit of asking a question in a way that he wasn\u2019t asking a question. Something like, \u201cyou agreed to this contract...\u201d and leave it at that. That wasn\u2019t a question technically but it was said in a way that was meant to be a question.\n\nMy lawyer told me that if he tried the only answer the questions I asked crap, to go ahead and not answer anything where he doesn\u2019t use an actual question.\n\nSo it went like this:\n\nL: You had an inspection done at your house to make sure it is suitable for children...\n\nMe: I did and she told me my house was well suited.\n\nL: I didn\u2019t ask you what she said, I asked if you had an inspection. Please try to answer only the questions I ask.\n\nMe: Yes sir. *my attorney gives me a head nod*\n\nL: The inspection revealed that your son\u2019s room did not have a baby monitor in it...\n\nMe: ...\n\nL: ...\n\nWe must have sat there for a minute before he said\n\nL: Will you answer the question?\n\nMe: You didn\u2019t ask a question.\n\nI could see my lawyer smile and the judge shake his head. He made sure to actually ask the rest of the time.",

        "selftext": "When I was a senior in high school, I started working as a cashier at a grocery store. While this was not my first job, it was my first one where I was part of a union and learned about some of the pros and cons of unions (mostly pros like regular raises, breaks, holiday pay, etc.). We had a woman there who was basically our human resources person and we did not get along from even before I worked there. I will call her Sally.\n\nI came in for my interview and Sally was not there and had left work for the day. I remember apologizing and saying, \"I must have mixed up the days. Is there anyway you can find out which is the correct day for my interview?\" but the manager on duty advised me that I was correct as they had checked the calendar in her office and she had written it down and so he, the front end supervisor, and the other manager who came in to start his shift all interviewed and hired me instead. I later heard from the group vine that she was working two locations and really wanted to be hired full time at a larger store which would have been a promotion for her but instead she was placed full time at our location only and didn't get promoted and that her missing my interview was the final nail in the coffin for her as this was just one of a long list of mistakes she made. She was always making excuses for why I couldn't put in to be transferred to another department when they were hiring people for those departments like bakery or deli and kept me as cashier even though it was lower pay. Even so, I came back to work there over my winter break for college (I had gone away to college instead of commuting) and also summer break.\n\nHere is where my malicious compliance comes in: our union states that after a waiting period (I believe it was 3 months) we get \"holiday pay\" for working Sundays and holidays. (It was time and half). We also are entitled to a raise every 6 months and being away at college is not suppose to effect that since we join the union before leaving and come back on our breaks and still owe our dues during those times when are still part of the union but away at school. I got my first pay check stub for the summer and noticed I did not get my holiday for working that Sunday nor my raise! I spoke with a coworker who advised me to speak with the store manager (He was one of the ones that interviewed me and always looked after his staff) since we were between union reps at the time. He was a born problem solver and told me right away he can fix the payroll error for me and make sure that I got not only the proper wage from now on but that I would get the back for the time I should have gotten the raise but didn't. As far as the holiday pay though that had to be taken care of by Sally since she was in HR and he suggested we go see if she was free and speak with her.\n\nShe just spoke to the both of us in a condescending tone about how this was union policy that I had to start all over again with seniority and that I had to earn that holiday pay again by being there for 3 months. He pointed out, as did I, that I was getting this holiday before leaving for college and even over the winter break that I had worked but she just kept saying to me, \"It's union policy.\"  My manager calmly tried to negotiate with her and get her to correct and even stated that other employees had not had to go through this. I finally just raised my hand to silence them both.\n\n\"Okay so you are saying that I can't get my holiday pay even though I was before I left to go back to college at the end of January, due to union policy, correct?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said with a long dramatic sigh that was meant to say, \"Like I have been telling you.\"\n\nI nodded, grinned and stated, \"But union policy also states that I don't have to work holidays or Sundays and that I can't be penalized for refusing to do so, correct?\"\n\nMy manager grinned at me like he was very proud of me as he saw exactly where this was going.\n\n\"Well, um yes that is true,\" Sally said looking a bit nervous.\n\n\"Okay well then, here is the compromise: since union policy states that I can't get the holiday pay for working Sundays and holidays, for the rest of the summer, I will not work any Sundays or holidays and per union policy, I am allowed to do this,\" I said with a shrug.\n\nShe immediately starting laying on the charm about how I am such a \"great worker\" and that they \"really need me to be there to help out with Sundays and holidays\" but I pointed out that they had plenty of other employees who were getting the holiday pay that they count on and I would be glad to return to working holidays and Sundays once I got my holiday for doing so.\n\nMy manager commented that he and I needed to change the schedule and casually mentioned how this was going to be hard as he now had to take me off for next Sunday and Monday (as that Monday was Memorial day) and it was a Thursday but that the store would just have to make it work if they couldn't find anyone willing to come in.\n\nOnce she had left for the day he called me upstairs to his office to help with the schedule since I had to work so many days each week. I walked in to find him and another manager there grinning ear to ear and telling me how proud they were of me for how  I handled that situation.\n\nOn Memorial day and the Fourth of July,  I got a call asking if I can come in because they had other people call out sick who were scheduled. I just calmly explained that I was no longer working Sundays or holidays and that Sally could explain why. Before the end of the summer she found a new position and quit and the new hr person was much nicer. One of the first things she did was make sure I and a few other college students who had similar issues with the holiday got our holiday pay reinstated and when I requested about a transfer to another department she gladly asked around and had me put in the health and beauty aides department that same week.\n\nUpdate: Wow now over 4k likes and all kinds of awards!

Grandma led us to the room with the queen and stuck MIL and FIL with the two twins. After this, the whole story MIL was telling us turned out to be a ploy to try to get me to not come on the trip.

            "This post reminded me of two family stories that you all might appreciate. \n\nMy parents got engaged after dating for five months (this timeline is relevant later). When they visited my dad's parents as an engaged couple, they were surprised to see that my grandparents had set up only one bed for the both of them. My dad got very flustered and assured his parents that they wouldn't *do anything* to which my grandmother cheerfully replied, \"okay. We might.\" \n\nI'm the oldest (and aro-ace, so I have no stories of my own to share) with one sister, Kitty, two years my junior and another, Puppy, ten years younger. Kitty dated the same man in college for about three years. Every time he visited, our parents put him on an air mattress in the living room while Kitty slept alone in a queen-size bed. \n\nWhen Puppy was a junior in college, she and her boyfriend were planning to visit our parents for a week. Puppy and her BF had been living together in a one-bedroom apartment for about nine months at that time (and been dating two years longer). Puppy called me worried that our parents would put her boyfriend on the floor even though a) they were already openly sharing a bed all the time and b) each had medical conditions aggravated by sleeping on the floor. She asked me for advice with dealing with our parents. I suggested she very firmly inform them that she and BF intended to share a bed as they do at home and go from there.\n\nA couple days later I got a call from Puppy that she had followed my advice and our parents agreed to let them share a room. This was shortly followed by a call from my Mom saying, in a very perplexed/side-swept manner that she had just had just gotten off the phone with Puppy who informed her in no uncertain terms that she and her boyfriend would be sharing a bed on their upcoming visit. Mom said that she initially tried to think of an objection but couldn't come up with anything, so she agreed. Mom asked if I knew where Puppy had got such strength and such an idea. I chickened out, said I had no clue, and wished all of them a lovely visit. \n\nAbout a year later Kitty and her then-boyfriend of four months, now husband, visited our parents and shared a bed with no one batting an eyelash. Good job setting a precedent, Puppy.",

Never really paid any attention to it. Never really caused any issues. Until it did of course. \n\nThe mistake was simple. Think 'Rod William' instead of 'Rod Williams' type simple. \n\nOne day we moved states and put in for mail redirection. Now, where I am from, mail redirections have to be EXACT, so the bill never got forwarded. And in all that goes along with moving, it didn't even cross our minds that the bill hadn't arrived or been paid. And then inevitably the phone got cut off. Once we realised, we were all set to fix it up. Pay the bill. Change our address etc. But no, can't be that simple. You see, to change the spelling mistake, we needed to provide proof of my husbands correct name. But for any name change, they need name change documents such as a wedding certificate or other official name change document, which he doesn't have as it is not a name change - just a spelling mistake. For some reason, his licence or passport was not good enough evidence. We ask what we can do to get this fixed up and they offer no help or resolution. Just stonewalling that there is no possible way to fix the incorrect spelling. \n\nOk, cool. At this point we were cranky. Not going to help us with what should be a simple fix? We won't pay the bill we told them. \n\nThey respond with details of the contract and our obligations, debt collectors etc. We simply replied, but who are you going to go after? They replied, 'you of course'. My husband, looking comically confused, said 'But my name is not Rod William and I am not going to pay HIS bill. Good luck finding him. If you happen to send me my own bill though, I would be happy to pay that.' \n\nShocked face and oh look, spelling mistake gets corrected immediately.",

AND they ran my credit with my social so they knew my name. I called to have it changed when I got my first bill cause it was wrong.  I got the next bill with an incorrect first AND last name. Called back and the following bill was reverted to incorrect last name. Fourth bill was incorrect first name correct last name. Fifth bill was back to correct first name incorrect last name but this time wildly wrong. Fine. 6 months and countless calls I want to cancel. I have my choice of providers and clearly made the wrong one.  They wouldnt cancel unless i had an alternate number. Which i did not at the time. Fought for a month. Finally just said \"ok fine. I just won't pay\".  They tried collections for the 42$ i owed them. Served me notice. Went to court (yeah they sued me for 42$ cause it's Bell). Got the court to subpoena the call records to customer service in which I requested the name changes. Judge asked me how much time i missed from work to attend court and told him I was a waitress so hourly was minimal but it was high tourist time and I averaged 200$ a shift in tips (this is like early 2000s so my servers wage was like 5$) and could prove the average credit/debit tips as I always kept copies of them for taxes but not the cash obviously.  Bell Canada had to strike the collections actions from my record because of the record of change requests and my being perfectly clear on spellings and the sheer amount of times i had to call and pay me 260$ for the missed income.",

            "My story is different but it applies to a company that can\u2019t fix a situation. It did get fixed but it took 2-3 weeks and the person that fixed it was so removed from the normal support chain. This was three years ago when xfinity mobile came to our city. My coworker had got it and was very happy with it. So I decided to go with them as a lower cost alternative than Verizon which my wife and I had. We also needed two additional lines for other family members. So we went to the new local xfinity store and got set up. They are trying to process the transaction and they are having a problem with their computer system. There is a problem trying to verify me and I remembered having to answer some identity verification questions. I say why should there be a problem, I\u2019ve been a Comcast customer for twenty years. His reply is Comcast and xfinity are two separate companies, two separate computer systems and they can\u2019t do it. So we left there with no phones while we waited for them to sort this out. For the record, my wife and I have very high credit scores, no mortgage and no credit card debt, the card is paid off monthly. So later on in the week I either went there or called and basically I can\u2019t get phones because they can\u2019t verify my identity. There is nothing more they can do. I tell them to talk to somebody at Comcast to verify who I am and they couldn\u2019t do that. My blood pressure is rising because nobody can give me an actual answer to what the actual problem is. For the record, all through this whole situation I had been nothing but patient dealing with everybody. I get home and figure I\u2019ll just order the phones online because I know what everybody wants. I order the phones and the order won\u2019t go through, there is a problem. I call to place the order and the person I\u2019m dealing with (off shore support) makes it sound like no problem. Still can\u2019t get phones. I spoke to managers and their bosses and to supervisors. I spoke to people here in the US who spoke English. This went on for a while. What I learned was this, when I was placing the order with someone they would ask three verification questions. You had to answer all three correctly. The questions were provided by one of the three credit companies. The persons I\u2019ve spoke with were not allowed to tell me if I had them right or wrong or which ones. The problem was some of these questions were ambiguous and some would have required me to research an answer from a tax return for a particular year. One question was how many people live in your household. I don\u2019t know if they really know. I said four the first time, another time I said two because that situation has changed through the years. One of these people I spoke with said this process to to prevent phones from going to the wrong address. I said look at my Comcast address. On and on it went. Finally I spoke with somebody in their fraud department and pleaded my case. He put me in contact with somebody that got the problem resolved. It was this simple, he said could you please get me some numbers off the bottom of your Comcast modem. I did that, he was satisfied and I got my phones.",

        "selftext": "So recently a customer at my work told us that they were no longer going to use us to manufacture their products for them - we felt this was quite out of the blue, as they had used us for 40 years without any problems. We got over this, however they then asked us to give them the recipe for their product so they could take it to a competitor to make. \n\nNow for context, when they started using us in the 70/80\u2019s the provided us with their recipe to make their product the right texture, firmness, and look just how they wanted it. Over the years we\u2019ve spent time and money finding new chemicals when certain ones have been discontinued, altering the mix of chemicals so that the products are still how they want them, and developing the recipe further to make it more efficient and provide better results. The way we were making their products now is completely different to how we were at the start. \n\nBecause of this, my boss was unhappy with what they were asking of us. But, complying with their request, he gave them the recipe to their products\u2026 the original recipe that is. It\u2019s fair to say they\u2019re not that happy that they\u2019re going to have to spend their time and money to update it as we have over the last 40 years.\n\nEdit: it\u2019s not food lol (but I\u2019m loving the guesses)\n\nEdit: man you guys really like your dildos don\u2019t you\u2026\n\nEdit to be clearer: \nWe make X. We\u2019ve made X for over 100 years and, expect for small orders, it\u2019s always to customers specification. For example, a matt blue colour, with a soft texture. We don\u2019t have contracts to supply X to customers, they just order it like you would order something online. This, ex, customer had come to us 40 years ago and asked to get X from us, and had given a recipe for how they had gotten it previously from someone else. \n\nOver the years they kept coming back to us for X, but this recipe was no longer used. We still made X to their specification, but with different chemicals, dyes, pigments, and processes. Everyone was happy. \n\nNow that they\u2019re going to another business, they wanted to know exactly how we make X for them. We didn\u2019t want to give this up, and instead gave them back the recipe they gave us 40 years ago and said that was all they\u2019d get, as everything after was us. Because X is our main product, if we\u2019d told the ex customer how we made X for them they could give it to a competitor who could figure out how we make all of our X, and run us out of business.\n\nEdit: I did not know X meant MDMA lol",

Your profits will increase because you will be bringing in the same amount of revenue, but now do not have the costs of materials and manufacturing.  Of course, your license will have guaranteed minimums for number of units produced under the license / minimum revenue / etc.\n\nOnce this license is in place, go forth and produce your product as usual and sell it in competition with theirs in the marketplace.  Their price will be higher because their costs will be higher from having to license the recipe on top of purchasing raw materials and manufacturing.  Your lower price will enable you to obtain market share.   It won't matter to you whether they actually sell units or not because of the guaranteed minimums in the license (so long as the company remains solvent and can pay the license fees).\n\nTo sum up:\n\n1.

I always volunteered to do the closing shift because the owner let me take home all the leftover food, it basically kept me and my housemates alive and we were very grateful. \n\n\nThe problem was, on a 5 hour or longer shift, you had to take a 30 minute break. I\u2019d always ask when mine was but she\u2019d always say later, we\u2019re too busy. I\u2019d usually end up just working the whole 5 hours. \n\n\nI didn\u2019t mind until I realised she was only paying me for 4.5! I asked her about it and she said if I didn\u2019t take my breaks that wasn\u2019t her problem. Cue malicious compliance. \n\n\nMy next closing shift was 4.5 hours of opening hours and finished 30 minutes after closing. Everyone else went at 7 and I stayed back by myself to clean everything in 30 minutes. It was a big job but I had it down pat. The entire shift I kept asking her if I could take my break and she kept saying no. So, at 7, I took my apron off and walked out, saying I\u2019ll be taking my break now since we were too busy before. I sat in the cafeteria and watched her clean that entire place. It took her well over an hour. \n\nThe next day she had a break schedule up!",

            "OP figured out one way to get this corrected, but I know there will be a hundred readers here that won't have figured it out yet.  If you keep time via electronic timekeeping, I'm almost certain there is a way to 'cancel meal deduction'.  If you didn't take a break, cancel the deduction.  If your timekeeping is done on paper, you ask the supervisor or manager to put in exactly what times you went to break and sign it.  If they refuse, you have a different problem.  OP was basically given a 10% wage deduction.  A standard 8.5 hour day with missed break is like a 6%.  \n\nDon't skip your breaks, ESPECIALLY if they are being deducted.  And to answer the next question before it's asked- it isn't the law to have to take breaks after a certain time period, it's the law to *offer* them after those certain time periods, **and it's the law to give breaks if you deduct them, or otherwise give paid hours if an uninterrupted break is not achievable**.  This language will vary by state, mine allows the offer of an unpaid 30 minute to be declined, but we still always have to be able to leave long enough to use the restroom.\n\nhttps://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/state/meal-breaks\n\nhttps://www.dol.gov/general/topic/workhours/breaks",

        "selftext": "Do not share without permission, please, especially outside of Reddit.\n\nMany years ago I worked in back-office support in a large office with lots of departments. Generally speaking, we had core hours, especially for lunch. Core lunch hours were between 12-2, meaning you had to take your lunch sometime between 12-2.\n\nDifferent departments had different rules for lunch depending on their needs. For example, the call centre had a strict rota for when people could take their lunch since they needed constant phone cover. However, I was in back-office support. Things were a lot more relaxed because we rarely took phone calls. Most of our work came in the form of tickets and tasks logged through our system, and emails from other departments with general queries. The only requirement was that at least one manager and 2 members of staff had to be there at all times in case a colleague from another department needed to see us, or in an emergency, call us.\n\nSo, generally, we could take our lunch anytime we wanted as long as it was between 12-2. There was no policy telling us when to take our lunch aside from the one I already mentioned. I would always take my lunch at 12:28. The reason was I actually wanted to take it at 12:30, but one of our call centres was the floor above us and they stampeded down the stairs at 12:30. I had been in an accident some years ago that gave me issues with my back and hips, so I could be a little unsteady on the stairs so I left at 12:28 so I could avoid the call centre stampede. I suppose I could have gone at 12, but the staff canteen was never set up and never had food ready at 12, hence why I left at 12:28.\n\nNow, I always restarted work at exactly 1:28, sometimes a few minutes earlier. An hour was far too long for me so I was often back at my desk nursing a coffee while scrolling through my phone (which we were allowed to do as long as we were on break) by around 1pm as well. However, if a colleague came to me and asked for help, I always helped and just added the time I was helping them to my lunch. So if I spent 10 minutes helping a colleague, I'd come back at 1:38. All this would be logged in our timesheet. I wasn't doing anything outside of policy - we were allowed to do this.\n\nAnyway, one of my colleagues had obviously noticed. Let's call her Mindy. Mindy considered herself the queen bee of the office. Everything had to be done her way, she was perfect, and she always tattled on people for petty stuff. Like that one of our colleagues used too many staples, or that colleagues were literally a few minutes late, or took too many pee breaks (she literally had a tally of how many drinks and pee breaks everyone took so she could tattle). She even once tried to tattle and say one of my colleagues came in drunk and she could smell it on her breath. What she could smell was Lemsip and cold meds - the colleague she was tattling on had a cold. Unfortunately, Mindy was also our manager's favourite employee, so she got away with a lot.\n\nSo she tattles to our manager about how I'm always leaving for lunch 2 minutes early and yet often come back late. My manager tears me a new one for this. I explain to him that the times I come back late are when I've helped a colleague and he should see it logged on the sheet. I also explain why I leave at 12:28. He then says 'Yes, well, whether it's two minutes or not, we have core hours in this office'. I say, yeah, 12-2. I can take my lunch any time between 12-2. 12:28 is within those core hours. So he then tried to say no, in our department, we have a policy of 12:30-1:30 to make sure enough people are in the department.\n\nI say I've never heard of this policy, this has never been the case, but he brushes me off and says, 'You take your lunch at 12:30, and come back at 1:30. You don't deal with any queries or anything that will delay you. Just take your lunch on time, and come back on time. No exceptions.'\n\nOkay, then. That's exactly what I'll do. No matter what I am doing, even if I'm in the middle of a task, I get up and go to lunch. Even if I am at my desk and a colleague comes to me, I tell them I am on lunch and to come back later. Then surprise, surprise, Mindy comes along with an 'urgent' query at 1:10.\n\nI look her dead in the eye and say 'Sorry, I'm on lunch.'\n\nShe storms off to our manager to tattle on me. I get called into his office because she had lodged a complaint against me for 'bullying' her and being 'uncooperative'. Mindy is in the office, with my manager acting as a mediator. He asks why I refused to help her. She's grinning maliciously with her trademark 'You're going to get it' face.\n\n'She spoke to me at 1:10. I had 20 minutes left of lunch. You said the policy is lunch 12:30-1:30, no exceptions.\" I said, smiling.\n\nMindy looked like she wanted to slap me and my manager was furious but knew he couldn't do or say anything because that was what he said.\n\nEventually, the manager ended up being promoted and moved to another department. Our new manager had no patience for Mindy's excessive tattling and at one point shouted at her 'This isn't primary school and I'm not your teacher, go back to your desk and focus on your own work instead of everyone else!'\n\nThe new manager also rescinded the 'no exceptions' bs policy my manager had made on the spot and as long as we came back on time and didn't leave the department understaffed, she couldn't care less when we took our lunch.\n\nEdited: For clarity as there was a sentence that was poorly worded and confusing! Sorry guys.",

            "When I worked as a dishwasher, my supervisor was very chill and understanding if I came in late, no big deal, she understood that I rode a bicycle and used the city bus to get to work. I was left alone and I knew what was expected and I knew how the dish machine worked (or rather didn't, but that was an MC story I posted a while ago). So fast forward 5 years or so and my supervisor hired her boyfriend  (rather she did not directly hire him, but arranged for him to be hired and then placed in the kitchen) and he thought he was the shit. He made up policies and procedures claiming the supervisor told him to tell me, that kind of petty BS.  One day I come in around 1030-1100 the function was going on and the food was going out, and with the exception of pots and pans, there were no dishes. \n\nOne of the first things I always did when coming on was to remove the wash arms, remove the end caps from the arms, and flush water through them to dislodge any food that may be stuck in there, I also used a wooded stir stick to clean each of the holes that the water came out of. This generally took 2 to 3 mins per arm, and there were 4 arms, so maybe  10 mins for everything. Well, I start to do that and boy toy comes up and tells me that we don't have time for that, it will be fine, etc. I had finally had enough of his shit, and I looked at him and asked \"How long have you worked here?\" he responded with a number, I then told him 'I have been here (x), I think that I know what the hell I am doing!' he sulked off and went to complain to his GF that I had yelled at him. \n\nShe comes over and asked what it was all about, and I informed her that if the wash arms are not cleaned, then the machine does not work, and taking a few mins to clean everything out ahead of time would make things go much better. She sided with me and from that point on boy toy just ignored me and when he did talk to me, he was careful not to try and boss me around. I was so tempted to tell him \"Just because you are fucking the boss, does not mean you are the boss!\" but I never did.",

            "I had something very similar to this when I was first out of college. I got a job at a company where I happened to be related to an Executive VP. I'll admit he got me the job but after that I had to prove myself on my own. If I got in trouble it was on me and he definitely didn't help me get any promotions. (Except for the occasional advice)\n\nBut he did help me one time. We had our own office tattle tale who was the department manager's pet. Our Mindy rarely got her work quota done and kept tabs on everyone else, exact same thing actually with making little notes and going to the boss. Everyone hated her and while the boss was OK she always took Mindy's side which was frustrating. One day I had to leave early so I worked it out with the manager that I would come in earlier, I had an agreement in writing that we both signed.\n\nWell, I left early (and had been at work since 5 am, normally 9) and Mindy went to tattle that I \"snuck\" out. I was really sneaky as I walked right out in front of everyone. The next day the boss calls me in for leaving early without authorization. I whipped out the agreement we had and my timeshare showing I had worked my whole day and this woman had the balls to say I forged it! I couldn't control my reaction when I said, \"Is this a fucking joke?\" So I just walked out of the meeting. \n\nThat weekend I saw the cousin at a family BBQ. We usually don't talk about work but he had heard about me getting in trouble and \"cussing out\" my manager. I was a little drunk so I told my side. He just nodded his head and we went on drinking. \n\nI honestly didn't expect anything to happen but on Monday a bunch of managers, including mine got moved around. I'm fairly certain cousin personally picked the one they put in my department. He was a no bullshit type but took good care of everyone as long as you did your work. This dude and I clicked right away and he taught me so much. But my favorite thing was when Mindy tried to start her tattle routine with him and his booming voice was heard all over the office. Not really shouting but loud enough for everyone to hear, \"I DON'T CARE WHEN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO THE BATHROOM. IT'S GROSS AND WEIRD THAT YOU ARE TRACKING THIS. GET BACK TO YOUR DESK YOU ARE ALREADY WAY BEHIND AND I AM DISGUSTED TO KNOW WHY!\" \n\nMindy came out very red in the face. Not helped by the fact that many of us were laughing out loud.",
            "I love seeing office busybodies being taken down a peg. In an office I worked in we had one person who considered themselves to be our manager's personal assistant - no such role existed, but she was certain it was her job. \n\nLike in your case, we got a new manager, and she tried her same crap with her. Well, after the third time the manager said something to the effect of, \"This minutiae of tracking other people's work, efficiency, and timing is not part of your job and is a waste of company time.\"\n\nBut she figured this woman would just ignore her like she had the first two times. So this time she used her management QA system to double the busybody's screen on her second monitor, and she spent the afternoon spot-checking and keeping a rough tab on how much time she wasted. \n\nWhen she came to the boss a 4th time trying to tattle on someone else, claiming they were wasting time, the boss shared how much time she'd wasted and docked her for it. \n\nThere wasn't a 5th time.",

A few years back one of my supervisors decided we shouldn't be \"quiting early\" and stood outside the charging area blocking us from getting in. When the bell rang we all jumped off our tuggers and forktrucks and left them sitting in the isle for the batteries to die between shifts, she tried writing all of us up but we fought it and won.

According to his tracker she worked 30 hours a week, so this was outrageous! He would try to tell others but of course hide that he tracked what they did.

            "Where I used to work I would almost always start 10-15 minutes early and stay 10-20 minutes late and would often be in the office an hour early to get everything done if I needed to leave bang on 5pm. I was salaried, so no overtime. One time I was half an hour late.

Eventually my boss noticed, or someone told him, and he asked me what I was playing at and I said that I was doing exactly what he said I should do - working 8.30am-5pm and there was no flexitime. He said that I was 'obliged to be flexible' and that due to the nature if the job my working hours were 'changeable' depending on whatever the work load was at at the time.

            "I understand your pain\n\nBefore COVID, I worked at an aircraft hanger in the parts department, I was a parts clerk. My duties consisted of getting parts for mechanics when they came to our window, issuing out tools to mechanics, attending to gate calls (which could be letting in trucks that have our materials on it which could need forklifted off, or escorting in visitors / vendors and it being on airport property I have to escort them the entire time, If we're having to forklift something off of a truck or whatever that's extra time, a single gate call could last 20 to 30 minutes) tracking shipments from our aircraft hangar to our other company hangers, and putting away stock either freshly received or returned by from mechanics who didn't need the parts that we issued earlier. It was real simple work but it kept you busy. \n\nPurchasers for all the parts and aircraft that are getting worked on in the hangar also worked in the parts room with us, they work in the back, and they were probably 10 or 12 long massive shelves full of  tens of millions of dollars worth of parts between us and the front desk and the purchasers, so from where we were sitting we can't see them and they can't see us, our boss's office was also back by the purchasers.\n\nAt the start of 2019 my boss for whatever reason I thought it was a good idea to introduce the purchase requisition forms. What this was is the purchasers would create a list of parts and the quantity needed and they would give up that to the front desk parts clerk and their job was to find all of the parts on that list separate them into the individual baggies and then put them on a special shelf in the back for a specific aircraft that the purchaser has to purchase parts for and mechanics would work on at a later date.\n\nFor context, a lot of these parts might be washers screws or bushings or whatever but our job was to check to see if we still had it in our inventory and if we didn't we would put an x by that part number return that to the purchaser who would then check to see if we had that part we said we didn't have. And if it was found out we had that part and either myself or the other clerk said he didn't have it we would be reprimanded for whatever reason.\n\nNow this doesn't sound like a hard task,  really the job wasn't strenuous but it was very time-consuming, this being an airline and it being FAA regulated for us to take any amount of parts put them in a bag and put them in another box we have to make sure those parts have the correct paperwork that certifies what part it actually is, nothing a copier couldn't do but again If you have 40 parts you have to make 40 separate copies of something. It's the whole point of us finding these parts was number one to prevent over ordering stuff if we already have it, and number two we would label each part or set of parts with a work order associated for needing those parts so that when the time comes to work on that aircraft the mechanics can just come to the parts clerk ask for the parts given the work order and we can just hand it to them with no problem. On paper it is a good idea but in practice it was garbage.\n\n\nThe reason having only myself and the other parts clerk work on finding the parts that the purchasers want us to find is that it is time consuming, our parts room had millions of dollars worth of parts, we did not have a good stock system nothing digital to keep track of exactly where the parts were, everything was alphanumeric but not every part had its own box, each box might share 5 to 10 different part numbers in the same box. \n\nSo we would have to go through several different boxes, we would have to create copies of the paperwork and if the paperwork wasn't in there we would have to go find paperwork in the receiving office, and in the receiving office the paperwork isn't sorted by alpha numerically it's sorted by the date in which the parts were received (which is smart because many part numbers while the same may have different vendors) and that may just be for one part number, You may go to the next part number and find out the same thing. \n\n\nNow there were four different purchasers, Three of them were cool they knew how busy being a parts clerk was already so if they gave us a purchase requisition form it might be one sheet which would contain at most 10 or 12 parts. That might take us 20 to 30 minutes each, nothing too bad.\n\nThen what there was the butthole purchaser who I'll call G.\n\nG was really chummy with the boss, He was in his ear and almost every little thing he wanted. G would give us, the clerks, a packet, 10 or 12 pages full of parts. Now the thing to know is the hanger was a 24-hour operation parts clerks work 12-hour shifts 7:00 to 7:00 meanwhile the purchasers work 8-hour shifts Monday through Friday 7:00 to 3:30 or 8:00 to 4: 30, and purchasers have a desk job whereas the clerk had a combination of desk work and having to walk around doing physical whatever.\n\nG would give us his packet full of parts at 8:00 and we would be busy the entire day looking for his parts on top of our regular duties, and he would want us to find all of his parts before he went home for the day. When we noticed we were starting to really struggle with balancing all the work we went to our boss and tried to explain our side and all he did was send out an email saying essentially that's part of our job and we need to suck it up. So we did. I personally just tried to grin and bear it but the straw that broke the camel's back was one day when we were at lunch which is from 12:00 to 1:00 G walked past us saw that we were sitting down, eating our lunch, having a break, and he went and complained to our boss that we weren't working on his packet full of parts, and our boss came in and lectured us. That one hour we have out of our day is meant for us to have a break it's meant for us to take it easy and actually get a moment's rest, and neither G or our boss gave a shit.\n\nThe biggest problem that arose out of all of this was, whereas before, when mechanics would come to our window we might have one or two waiting for a free clerk to come give them a hand whereas after there would be a line of 10 or 15 people. When there was a line this long our boss would go tell the purchasers to come help us reduce the amount of people in that line. \n\nWhat ended the purchase requisition form bullshit was when the director came and worked in the parts room with us for about three or four months on a special project in the hangar and he just saw day in and day out that there was a constant line of 10 or 15 mechanics, he just couldn't figure out why, but one of the expediters who work up front with us ended up telling him it was because of the purchase requisition form nonsense, He put an end to it that day.\n\nI personally find it very sad that it took my boss's boss physically seeing what we're dealing with or rather the consequences thereof for their actually to be a change. \n\nNow you might be thinking maybe the purchasers are busy therefore the clerks had to do their job for them, that wasn't the case, G is a classic example, He's very good at his job very knowledgeable, but to a fault. I was promoted to a purchaser before the director came into the parts room and I would see G on his phone, bullshitting with coworkers, and at one point watching Netflix on his laptop. That had to be the most insulting part about that, people are doing his work for him struggling to even do their own and he's just in the back watching a movie.\n\nI don't work there anymore lol",

            "Sorry for the long post. \n\nAbout 20 years ago I worked at the local chip factory. My final position was as the chip machine setup operator. I worked 3rd shift and would set up the machines for the 1st shift crew. I basically got everything in the chip department set up for 1st shift. \n\nI had to work around the cleaning crew blowing chip dust down on me.   I usually had to clean the bag formers because the lazy operators on the last shift didn\u2019t clean them ( this was especially nasty coming in on a Sunday night/Monday morning shift as they had been sitting over the weekend ).  For those who don\u2019t understand the seasoning we used was a powder style and once it dries is really difficult to clean off the metal formers. Add to that the water hose had insufficient insulation near the sprayer and regulating the temperature was near impossible. Once it got hot it was boiling hot I usually had to wrap 3 or 4 towels around it so I could hold it to clean the formers. My complaints went unanswered, at least I thought they did.  \n\nI didn\u2019t really have a manager on duty that I had to answer too, but I quickly made friends with the 3rd shift manager and the corn department machine setup operator. Now the the manager was constantly trying to get the company to improve things quality wise and product wise and apparently was pissing off upper management. A couple months before I was fired he came up to me and me that upper management has a list of employees that they want gone because they are making too much money. Since I was coming up on my 3rd year there and would soon qualify for 3 weeks paid vacation and my salary would bump up to 20.00 an hour from the 15.00 I was already getting I was on the list, I also hadn\u2019t made many fans by requesting that the other operators make sure to clean the formers before they leave. He told me to watch my back because they were looking for a legitimate reason to fire me so they wouldn\u2019t have to pay someone so much. It\u2019s a relatively small town and the turn over was relatively high. They employed a lot of Hispanic people, I didn\u2019t care most of them were cool. \nSide note: I remember one time INS was coming through on a sweep for undocumented workers and about 20 people were suddenly gone. About a month later this one guy was back but going by a different name a few of us recognized him, and within a couple days he was no longer on the same shift. \n\nAnyway the cleaning crew was annoying to work around because they kept constantly sweeping debris down on me, the manager was pretty cool and he said if I want I could take all my breaks together as long as I had my work done, even though it wasn\u2019t really company policy. Everyone got two 15 minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch. So I\u2019d work on the machines while the cleaning crew was on break. I\u2019d get the machines ready and do other prep stuff like inventory and setting up rolls carts while they cleaned the machine area. Then when I had every thing was done I\u2019d go on break taking my breaks all at once I usually did that around 2.5 hours before end of shift. It left me with plenty of time to go back over things and make sure everything was ready. \n\nAll was good until the manager comes up to me one day and said that he was leaving and reminded me to watch my back and be careful.  So I went back to taking my breaks at the normal intervals, because I didn\u2019t want to risk it. \n\nSo about a month later I get called to the front office a few minutes before my shift was to end. They said the new 3rd shift manager has reported that I had been taking too long of breaks that she had timed me as having spent 45 minutes for lunch several times. I said that under the previous supervisor he had okayed me taking my all of breaks at the same time as long as I had gotten all my work done, I explained the reason why he let me do that. But that I hadn\u2019t done that since he left. And that there\u2019s no way she could have timed me taking 45 minutes because I always made sure I clocked back in at the end of my 30 minute lunch.  That as long as I had all my work done I don\u2019t see why it really mattered. They claimed that I had received several complaints about the machines being set up wrong and that other things had not been done. I told them I was well aware that they wanted me gone and if they wanted to use that as the reason to get rid of me whatever go ahead and fire me.  I hated that job., and I hate that place.

She complained that he doesn't know his job and must be slow.  I told him she said that and to stop helping her out.  He then made minimal breakfast (meaning she had to do it by herself when she got in) and left at exactly 6AM whether he had anything left or not.  So then she tattled on that.",

Basically means that staff can be doing other things when there aren't enough customers to justify having 2/3/4 tills open. I'm sure you can guess where this is going already.\n\nOver the last week or so, it's been absolutely baking by UK standards and to top it off, our till area is what used to be the main greenhouse before the site got expanded. Old greenhouse, little air flow, scorching weather, it was hot as balls in there. This was causing a combination of angry customers and exausted staff and to top it off, our uniform is more what you'd call \"guidelines\" than an actual uniform. Navy polo, toe capped boots and you're good to go. So when I get the call for a second till, there's about 3 or 4 groups in the queue and I go to walk past the queue with some sweets (to keep me sweet) and my water bottle, to go to the tills. Until a 6' rugby player looking type at the back of the queue puts his arm to stop me. What follows went something a little like this:\n\nHim: \"Oi mate! Don't you know what a queue is?\"\n\nMe: \"But I'm...\"\n\nHim: \"No buts! You don't get to skip!\"\n\nMe: \"I'm just going...\"\n\nHim: \"I don't care! You wait like the rest of us!\"\n\nAt this point, with this guy getting pretty angry and turning a very deep shade of crimson, I look at the till with an exasperated look, catch my colleague's eye and just go \"fine then!\" and wait. It was too hot to argue over this and I wasn't going to risk this getting physical. My colleague with a knowing smile picks up her radio and says \"Can I have another till please? I don't think Caridor can make it\". No one arrives, probably due to a combination of radio issues, breaks colliding and \"not my problem\". So we wait. Only takes about 5 minutes to get to the front but angry dude is getting redder by the second. So he goes up to be served with a loud \"Finally!\". I'm now in the front of the queue, go up to my till, log in and call out \"Can I help anyone on this side?\". There was a loud \"Are you fucking with me?!\" from angry dude but my colleague was quick to loudly point out that I did try and explain several times, that he got very aggressive with me for doing so and was honestly lucky we were serving him at all. He decided to just leave rather than embarress himself any further. Left his purchases on the desk and just left. \n\nI'm glad I didn't get in trouble for that one but it was a fun bit of MC.",
