        "selftext": "I originally posted this in as a comment in an askreddit thread but it was removed, so I'll repost it here because it's a pretty cute form of malicious compliance by a police officer.\n\nI was a physicist at an engineering school and the older faculty liked to tell the story of a long-gone graduate student who tried to get cute with a police officer. He was speeding (going some 20 over the limit on I-95) and gets pulled over, and the cop asks him why he was speeding, etc. etc. Being a physicist, he explains that the sudden cold snap overnight caused his tire pressure to fall and he was speeding because the faster rotation of the wheels increases the heat and pressure within the tire and it was safer to be driving slightly faster on pressurized tires than at the speed limit on underinflated tires.\n\nThe cop, amused, asked if what he said about tire pressures and speeding was true, and the young grad student replies \"yes, absolutely, I'm a physicist at MIT.\" The cop then goes back to his vehicle and returns with two tickets: one for speeding and one for knowingly driving with underinflated tires (\"driving an impaired vehicle\" or something like that).\n\nNeedless to say this poor fellow became a very good example of times when intelligence is not a substitute for wisdom, and why it's poor form to flaunt your education to get out of being an asshat in traffic or otherwise.",

It was the only register open so there wasn't much of another option to get my 12 pack of Mountain Dew for a party I was heading to. I was wondering why the line was going nowhere when I decided to poke my head up front to see what the holdup was. It was a little old lady who didn't have enough for her groceries and she was trying to talk the cashier into letting her get away with being short. This struck me as odd until I found out she was a mere $0.21 short of her purchase. Now all these families were just staring and there was even two making fun of her. I walked up and handed my soda to the cashier, handed him a $5 and told her to keep the change. One of the middle aged women (I knew these people, so I also knew that they all make over 6 digits) grabbed her kid and yelled very loudly, \"See that man? He's acting just like Jesus wants us to.\" For some reason this set me off, so I turned around. I haven't shaved in awhile so I'm rocking some nice scruff, a Slayer shirt, and gym shorts, so it must have been a nice sight. Very loudly, I said \"Like Jesus? Ma'am I'm an atheist who makes minimum wage and I was the one who stepped up to help her? Your hypocritical Christianity is an inspiration to us all.\" As I stormed out, a couple of the cart boys started to whistle and cheer, soon shoppers joined in and even the cashier.

I was thinking about her this weekend, and remembered a story that I believe fits here.\n\nWhen we were kids, we had chores that we had to do around the house. The oldest two, Judy and Pat, had to do the dinner dishes (this was back when dishwashers were a luxury item most families couldn't even dream of).\n\nJudy, being the oldest, would try to manipulate things so she got off light. Generally, this meant Pat would have to wash and rinse, while Judy would dry and put away. The washing, and particularly scrubbing of pre-Teflon pots and pans, was a real task, and finally Pat complained enough that Mom and Dad stepped in, and said the work needed to be equally divided. If one washed and rinsed one night, the other would the next night.\n\nWell, Judy didn't like that, so she offered an alternative: each of them would wash, dry and put away half of the dishes. That was deemed acceptable, so the first night Judy went first, doing barely enough to qualify as \"half\", and leaving all the heavy scrubbing to Pat.\n\nThe next night, Pat went first, and the malicious compliance began. With Mom watching, Pat carefully washed and dried exactly half of the dishes: the bottoms of all the plates, the handles of all the utensils, and the outsides of all the bowls, glasses, pots and pans. When she finished, Mom smiled and agreed that she'd done her half, and sent for Judy, who had to wash all the tops and insides. And if some soap and water got on the part Pat had cleaned, well, that was Judy's fault; she had to clean what she messed up.\n\nAfter that, they did the dishes together, and alternated who washed and who dried.\n\ntl,dr: Oh come on, this is really short. Take a minute. Sheesh.\n\nEdit: Holy crap, never expected this to blow up like this. Thank you all for the awards, comments and kind wishes. We lost Pat to breast cancer at 70; the best thing you can do in your life is see your doctor regularly, and take good care of yourself.",

            "Ah yes, sibling squabbling!  \n\nWhen I was 10, my sister, cousins and I all  shared a room on a vacation. My sister and one cousin were older (both around 14) and my other cousin was closer (11) to my age. Of course we quickly formed age-based alliances, with the older ones trying to boss us younger ones around. When they complained about the state of our shared room and insisted that we at least clean up our half, the malicious compliance was cued. After tidying up our own things, we  carefully swept only our exact half, leaving a clear demarcation line of dirt down the middle. The best part  (to my 10 yo devious mind) was that we took the hand-hooked round rug in the middle of the room, straightened the folds and wrinkles out of our side, and added a few to their side for good measure. \n\nActually, the best part of it was that those alliances still hold, although we are all now in our sixties.

My older sister would wash and my younger sister would just wait for everything to air dry and just put them away. This annoyed my older sister so she would pour cold water over the dishes in the drying rack to make her little sister have to actually dry them. Gotta love petty sibling behavior.",
            "This is exactly the type of petty sibling tomfoolery that permeated my childhood with my brother. We are so much better now but it makes me laugh to think back on it.",
            "This was a great read. Glad your mom was on Pat's side. And hard agree on the tldr, why are you even in subs like this if you're not going to actually read the posts? Seems pretty silly to me.",
            "I may have a dishes story myself, not sure it's malicious compliance, but it's definitely karma and petty\n\nWashing dishes was my chore growing up, it took like a few hours daily since there was Six of us. Also at the time we didn't have a dishwasher. After my Fiance now wife started living with me at my parents house while we looked for an apartment, for several months waiting for the keys to our apartment, we would keep the kitchen clean. I would even run the dishwasher just to be nice and courteous, my father would complain he was the only one who ever cleaned up anywhere and that people should stop putting dishing in the sink and in the dishwasher. He even said if the dishes are clean in the dishwasher, to just empty it and put dirty dishes in it. That's the general bases of where this story takes place. \n\nNow my mother left to visit my Grammy(mom's mother) and took my sister and fiance with her. I don't remember if both my brothers were there or not, but they are irrelevant to the story. However I had loaded the dishwasher and ran it as my mother was finishing getting ready, she even thanked me for cleaning the kitchen while she was getting ready to go. You see a little context, my Pop Pop(mom's father) had died months back from where this story took place, but she would constantly go up to visit Grammy to make sure she's alright and everything. It was hard on everyone really. Literally the next day my dad complained that the kitchen was dirty...\n\nMe:I literally cleaned it yesterday and the dishes I washed had not been unloaded yet\n\nDad: doesn't matter, besides I've done it almost every day\n\nMe: you didn't do it yesterday and my fiance and I have been cleaning the kitchen like four times a week. If not at least a third of the time still living here. \n\nDad: I highly doubt that's true\n\nMe: in that case it shouldn't matter if I don't do any cleaning in the kitchen all week\n\nDad: yeah it won't, I'll just end up doing it\n\nAfter the dishwasher finished doing it's thing, I took a picture of the inside and left the door to it shut. Now a little bit more context, at this point I was still working and I don't eat a lot. I just snacked and did my own thing the whole week. To even make my point across, I didn't use a single dish. \n\nWhen my mother finally came back, I was calling into the kitchen, so I went from the bedroom I was sleeping in to the kitchen where my mother was. For this next part, I should mention we had two houses on the property. One with a functional kitchen and bathroom, the other without one. I was living in the one without the functional kitchen and bathroom.\n\nMom: I want you to do the dishes\n\nMe: has the dishwasher been emptied\n\nMom: no, but I need you to clean your dishes\n\nMe: I haven't used dishes all week, so they aren't mine\n\nMom: they were from the other house, from your room\n\nMe: they were definitely not, who told you that?\n\nMom: your father\n\nI then open the dishwasher and chuckled slightly. I pulled out my phone and showed her the photo and the date. The dishwasher had not been emptied since I did it a week ago. Funny how my Dad complained about it yet, didn't do dishes all week. And before you comment about my Dad, we are still on good terms, but putting a one up on him was a pretty nice feeling.",

            "Reminds me of when my sister and I were kids.  We had about 1.5 acres.  Dad would mow weekly and wanted us to rake up and put the cuttings into the compost bin. \n\nThe property had the house positioned near the front corner--so large backyard and one larger side yard with the \"front\" yard and smaller side yard making up less than 25%.   Only the front and smaller side yard had trees.   \n\nMy sister was amazing at crying her way out of chores and things not being \"fair\".   So after weeks of trying different ways to divide things up,  I volunteered to do the larger side yard and the whole back yard.   All she would have to do was the little bit in the front and the little bit on that side of the house.  She quite smugly agreed that was a good plan.  \n\nDealing with the trees involved picking up sticks before dad mowed which wasn't a lot of additional work--esp. since there was less to rake up due to the trees.  Unfortunately for her, that was also the only part of the yard that the neighbor's dog used as a potty.  She wasn't so smug once she realized that...",

            "We had a policy that whatever kid had the worst grades, did dishes until the next grade card.  This meant you might even get stuck doing them all summer.  Well, in 10th grade that was me.  I did those damn dishes almost every night for a year. \n\n (I later figured out how get better grades and that put an end to that.  Also, my mom said I was the only one that didn\u2019t do a halfassed job of it, so when it became my brothers and sisters turn came about, they did such a shitty job, my mom did them.  Crap. ). \n\nAnyway, I did the dishes for a year.  The local AM rock station (this was a long time ago), played the same songs at the same time of day.  I\u2019d learn what time a song came on and would go tune in for 3 minutes.  Every night, when I was doing dishes that winter for several weeks, Come Together by The Beatles played.  To this day, when I hear that song, I hark back to having my arms up to my elbows in dirty dishes and hot soapy water.  In fact, today, I\u2019ll sometimes have Alexa play it while I\u2019m doing dishes nowadays.",

I never understood why the handles and bottoms of everything felt greasy.\n\nThey let the dishes soak in a full sink until they get washed; it was full of food floating in it etc. When they did wash them, they would literally only wash the part that they 'dirtied' while cooking - the inside of the pan, top of the plate, end of the fork. Everything else that had been in the kitchen cesspool just gets a rinse with water.\n\n\nI always washed the dishes before I used them after that.",

        "selftext": "This was about 20 years ago.\n\nI was working as an hourly manager at a popular american fast food place (franchise, not corporate).  I had been there several years and had accrued some vacation time. I requested a week off (months in advance) to go on a hunting trip a few states away with my dad (who taught me to shoot and hunt). the vacation time was approved by the general manager of the store and I booked the trip (non-refundable).\n\nA week before I was due to go on vacation, the head office decided to replace my general manager with one from a different store they owned. The new general manager decided he had to assert his dominance by rejecting my vacation time and stated that he didn't have enough managers available to cover the shifts. I argued that the trip was already booked but he wasn't hearing any of it.\n\nI liked my job and didn't want to leave but there was no way I was going to miss this trip. I tried everything to get him to approve the time off but he scheduled me to work that week anyway.  He said if I didn't work, I'd be fired. I told him I was going.\n\nI liked my coworkers and didn't want to screw anyone over by having shifts that needed covered so I got them all covered a few days before I left. The general manager wouldn't approve them working for me and still said I had to work. I was working the day before the trip (friday) and he knew I was leaving the next day no matter what. Part of my job was to schedule the crews shifts. It typically needed to be done by sunday for the following week, but on this day he said I had to  have it done that day.\n\ncue the malicious compliance:\n\none additional thing to note, this was about 15 years after the most popular girls name was Ashley and the most popular boys name was Michael. that means we had 8 Ashleys and 6 Michaels working there. It was normally trouble to keep from having more than 2 of them there at the same time because of labor laws.\n\nThat saturday, from 11am-2pm (lunch rush) on the general managers shift, **Every Single One** of them was scheduled at the same time. I can only imagine the chaos when he wanted one of them to do something.\n\nWhen I picked up my last check, another shift manager confirmed that it was as glorious as i had imagined.\n\nEdit: labor laws had nothing to do with 'making me' schedule them together. It restricts their availability due to school and what time they cant work before or after so its hard to schedule them all at different times.",

So during spring break I took a week off to go back home, I had planned it 4 months in advance cause I taught dog classes and set them up 3 months at a time. I had no classes going that week, he signed off on my leave, all was in order the other trainer had to work one hour on Saturday just in case we had a walk in potty class which I offered to cancel but he said no. So I work my shift Friday 1-10 and then drive 10 hours to my grandpa's in another time zone arriving around 9 am. I go to bed and get a call at 12 pm and he is screaming at me, \"where are you? You need to get here right now for this potty class\" \"um im in Michigan, it's 10 hours away, call S she was scheduled not me I'm on vacation, which you approved\" so he hangs up. I get a call from a second manager saying he was sorry I got yelled at and it wasn't my fault and he'll talk to the store manager, I get a text the next day (Sunday) and it's my hours for the week I'm a full time employee and that mother effer reduced my hours to 4 hours just the hours I was teaching, the other managers freaked out cause this means their departments were now short as they depended on my floating abilities as I was the only employee who was store wide cross trained but he was petty and said deal with it and it was a shit show lol. So my petty ass who sets the training calendar maxed out my hours so I had somewhere around 15-20 classes I was teaching classes with 2 dogs in them and he hated it and the other managers were like bro you did her dirty your not technically her boss so you just screwed us all for 8 weeks and now we have to hire another part time in three locations just to cover her.

I should note she called in all the time or would just not show up  and I would get a call to cover her on my day off. Shoot one time he called me at my other job and my boss there was like \"hold up, you know she's working and you called her to cover for someone else, so who am I going to call to cover her shift here if she leaves?\" He did let me leave under the rule if I did I couldn't change out of my work clothes, and I laughed and went into work in pin stripped pants, high heels, a tank top with a blazer over it, to a pet store where they all wore kakies and a polo my boss was so mad \"Oh it sounded urgent so I didn't change and rushed right over\" and then at 9 on the dot \"oh I can't do facing in heels I could get stuck on the ladder, I did you a solid and now I'm leaving\" clocked out and left him to clean his own store.",

        "selftext": "My father has been a lawyer here in BC, Canada for more than 30 years. When he was starting out in his 30's he was hustling hard to support a stay at home wife and me, his young son. \n\nAs he was very much a type \"a\" personality with not much patience he sped on the highways, often. And he got speeding tickets, often. However, he took every single one to court and had every single one overturned. The reason was quite simple. At the time Canada was in the process of switching over from Imperial MPH to Metric KPH and all of the road signs had to be replaced. \n\nNow the BC legal code specified that a \"road sign\" was legally comprised of two signs on a pole. SEE BELOW FOR A BETTER EXPLANATION OF THE WAY THE SIGNS LOOKED\n\nApparently at some point someone in charge of replacing all the signs with the new metric ones decided that they could save a considerable amount of money by printing all the information on ONE sign. But this no longer complied with the specifics of the legal code. So he would go back to the exact sign that he was ticketed because of and take a picture of it, and then bring the picture to court along with a copy of the laws in question. \n\nHis defense was very simple. He would allow the arresting officer to take the stand and give his testimony regarding the issue of the ticket, and then show the officer the picture he took and ask them to identify whether that was the sign that he had sped past. They always agreed saying that it was in fact the very same sign. He thanked them and then dismissed them with no further questions. \n\nHe would then bring the picture to the judge along with the bookmarked page of the BC Highway Act and present the judge with the exact wording of the law, followed by his factual argument that since there was only a single sign posted, it did not constitute a legal \"road sign\" as defined in the Highway Act. As I said before, every single ticket was dismissed and all my dad lost was a half an hour of his time.\n\nThis worked for almost a decade, with him overturning literally thousands of dollars of speeding tickets until the law was changed.\n\nHe still speeds btw.\n\nTL;DR - bureaucrat cuts costs on road signs but they no longer fit the legal definition so my dad sped like a fucking madman for years with 0 consequences.\n\nEDIT: an explanation from a friendly Redditor as my telling of this story was from a recollection of several years ago:\n\nI'm old enough to remember when Ontario put the new signs up. At that time, they were a white sign with black lettering that said \"MAXIMUM\" up top, the speed in (obviously) giant font below that, and then, on a separate piece of metal below that, same width as the above sign but 1/4 the height, with black background and white text, \"km/h\". Maybe that's where the \"two signs\" part comes from. Over the years, the two signs were merged to become one piece of metal, and appeared to be two because the sign shop drew outlines around both parts of it as it had been when it was two. - from u/Jay911",

            "I got a friend who works as a traffic investigator for a county.  That's literally the subject of his job.  \"Is the sign lawful?\"\n\nThings like is it the proper distance from the last sign?  If it's a speed change does it give proper warning?  If it's a stop light is it visible for a certain distance approaching the intersection.\n\nHe said if I ever got a ticket to ask as part of a discovery motion to have the road investigated.  He said there's almost always something wrong with the signs versus what's required.",
            "One time they were switching the road signs around here because they had lowered the speed limit for a considerable chunk of the highway. Apparently they weren't paying very close attention because one side of the road was 55 mph and the other side was 45 mph. The kicker was that on the 45 mph side there was still a yellow caution sign advising you to \"slow down\" to 50 mph for the turn.. After calling the traffic department and complaining about this I was told that a whole bunch of speeding tickets had to be tossed out because even the officers couldn't figure out what the speed limit was supposed to be, and they assured me it absolutely wasn't supposed to be different on each side of the road. About a week later they fixed the signs after months of it being this way. I assume I wasn't the only one that called and the state police complaining added a bit of \"oh shit we better fix this\" to the equation.",
            "My dad got out of speeding tickets for years in the same area all because tree branches were somewhat blocking the sign. The sign was still absolutely readable but there was a law stating that the sign had to be 100% unobstructed. When the city decided they were over his shenanigans and cut back the tree, he did what any reasonable person would do. Took a latter out there and took a picture of the sign from above so it *looked* like it was still obstructed. The judge asked him how he could possibly not be aware of the speed limit after being stopped there so many times. My dad's reply was that was hardly the point, the law was very clear. Got out of that ticket too.",
            "There was an issue like this in the US with construction zones a decade or so ago. They made a shit ton of orange speed limit signs for use in construction zones.  Then someone pointed out in court that the MUTCD specifically says that speed limit signs must be black numbers on a white background. A bunch of tickets for speeding in construction zones got thrown out. \n\nNow the speed limit signs are big orange signs, with white rectangle in the middle with the speed limit. So it's both an orange construction sign, and a speed limit sign that's black on white.",
            "This is pretty clever, but theres no way the time he saved speeding outweighed the thousands of trips he had to take to the sign and then to court. He probably wasted days of his life doing this",
            "That is brilliant.  The only hole I can see in this is if the jurisdiction had a default speed limit for unmarked roads -- many do, even if they're not often enforced.",
            "I'm a lawyer.

            "The bureaucrat was not lazy. He did his job and save taxpayer dollars.

I had full responsibility, worked all hours, and my numbers showed that my class was making great progress. I just had some bad luck, that caused me to not finish teaching college at that time.\n\nBecause I didn't had my license, my boss came to me one day and talked about how I was actually 'too uneducated and inexperienced' to teach and that I 'must have had someone telling me what to do' behind me. I told her I didn't, but she didn't believe me and told me she'll be watching me like an eagle to see if I was fraudulent (changing grades and stuff).\n\nI never did anything to my students, I'm not a cruel person and I didn't want anyone implying that I wasn't  doing my job as expected (they all got to the next year with scores higher than we would've expected beforehand).\n\nBut. I started to behave like a beginner student teacher, to my boss only! Asked really stupid questions like 'how can I make my class quiet? I'm really too uneducated to know so can you please help this teacher out by showing it?' (knowing fully well that my formerly disruptive class wouldn't ever listen to her). I called her for everything; a parent wanting to talk to me, a kid who fell down and needed a bandaid; anything. I made sure to tell her I was too uneducated and inexperienced to handle such a task and I needed to observe a true pro work. My colleagues got in on it too. They started pointing out everything I wasn't allowed to do, but expected to do and told my boss that she was being very fraudulent by expecting me to do so.\n\nIn the meantime I was discussing gamification, the need for programming and English in primary school, showing older colleagues new teaching methods and digital assistance... All the goodies.\n\nAfter 6 weeks; she was done. She called me to her office and apologized to me for saying that I was too uneducated and inexperienced. And how she was renewing my contract and got some budget to pay for half of my studies.\n\nI was happy to tell her I got a new job that would pay everything to get me my license and I would get full creative freedom, without being watched like an eagle. \n\nThis was two years ago. I almost have my license and I still work at that awesome school that hired me, after the allegations of being 'uneducated and inexperienced' at my old job. I even got a reward and a trophy from the board for doing exceptional work and obtaining goals with my students.",

A person can be wholly \u201cunqualified\u201d and be an amazing teacher. I am a teacher educator now and many of my teacher candidate students are better teachers than so many of their counterparts, because they have the compassion and ability to connect with kids. To be discounted in your skills simply because you didn\u2019t yet have the state paperwork is bullshit. I am glad that administrator came around.

I mean, I was just filling in for teacher's sick days, and generally wasn't given a lesson plan, so it was hard to want to try to be good at my job and I was depressed, barely treading water, and being a teacher wasn't my end goal, just a way to get some cash during the 2008 recession.  Sounds like you were in a position that required much more responsibility than me, and you excelled at it.  Sorry for being part of the lazy group that makes administrators suspicious!",

Like back when cell phone plans had minutes. \n\nI was working as a contractor in a hospital for a medical supply company. I was in a \"team lead\" kind of role in a small department, supervising about 20 people total. Part of my job description was to carry around a departmental cell phone at all times, even though I was an hourly employee. Kind of a bogus deal, but whatever. Employees would call me whenever, 24/7 for troubleshooting or if they were calling in sick. I never got paid for these phone calls, but to me at the time it wasn't a big deal. \n\nThis particular area was also in the mountains, and I didn't always get the greatest reception with my Tmobile phone. I got great reception with my work phone, so every once in awhile I'd use it for personal use. \n\nAfter about a year of this I get an email from my boss's boss's secretary asking me to pay for each of the calls I made. I said \"Sure, send me the phone records.\" After that, I went through the phone records over the past year and saw I'd used it maybe 10% of the time for personal calls. After adding everything up, I emailed her back. \n\n\"I added everything up, and turns out I owe you guys x amount of dollars for my personal calls. Technically, I'm an hourly employee, so I should be getting overtime each time I pick up the phone for work purposes. Will we just subtract the difference for all those hours owed?\"\n\nI never heard back. I didn't push it and they didn't either.",

I use my company phone card, because I didn't even think about it. And we're talking about maybe $10 worth of calls.\n\nA few weeks later, penny pincher in finance calls me to bitch about it. Mind you, this is a 30-person company, so the accident was not exactly a secret. My wife's time is much more valuable to them than mine, too.\n\nI explain what the calls were...and then ask her how she knew what they were. \"I called them\".\n\nSo...you spent more company time to figure out ten bucks worth of calls?\n\nI pointed this out to comptroller and never heard another word.",

I returned a call to her about something. What was really strange is that it was a local call. I was friendly with my manager and asked if she wanted a quarter.

            "Before cell phones I was a contractor at a large company.   Once a month each contractor was handed a list of calls made from their phone.

            "Last year, we got a new manager who let the power of running a small convenience store go completely to her head.        It was Christmas time and I was still only part-time, so had taken a second seasonal job which added up to about sixty (60) hours a week.\nOfc the new manager of the store decided this was the best time to get everyone up to date on monthly training.       Granted, I was behind but that was because I was scheduled overnight graveyard shifts and weekends where I worked alone and the manager didn't come in.       One day at my other job, I got a text from that manager saying that I had to come in before she left for the day to finish my training.       I text her back that I can't- I'm at my second job.         \nThat night, I work an overnighter, and bright and early in the morning, while I'm trying to sleep - the texting telling me to come in, starts again.\nI ignore it, which offends her majesty the manager greatly and the next time I see her on my scheduled hours at the store- she tries to lecture me on 'my responsibility to the company' to come in on my day off!\nTo which I reply repeatedly, \"I want to see that in writing!\"       A few times she threatened to report me to the General Manager, to which I reply repeatedly, \"I want to see that in writing!\"       \nFinally, a few days later, I show up to the store and there's the GM calmly coming in on his day off to boot the training computer up for me.\n\nEpilogue: What I learned in that training was very interesting.     It said that we could take text messages after hours but only to a certain extent- after 15min. a month, that was considered 'working off the clock' and we could request compensation for it.\nSo, the next time the manager sent marathon messages, I texted her back that she had exceeded her 15min and I would need compensation forms ASAP please.       She left me alone on my days off after that.",

But they would all let us go without a hitch.\n\nWhen we were traveling to Cuba, the bottle was checked and given back to us on our way there, but on the way back is a completely different story.\n\nThere were tons of people flying out of Varedero (where we were) the same day as us, so there were like two hundred people waiting to check in at only 3 check in counters. When we finally checked in, it had been about 2 hours since we got there. We were pretty tired from standing so we wanted to get through to the gates as fast as we could, so we took the shortest line in security.\n\nThere were 2 people working at each bag check area, at ours there was a lady looking through the screen displaying the x ray and a guy in charge of checking suspicious bags. When we put our bags on the conveyor belt, the lady began gesturing to her partner and pointing at her screen. The guy then proceeded to grab my stuff off the belt on the other side and asked us if it was our stuff to which we replied \"yes\". He carefully shuffled through the bag, but really just went after the water bottle because that's what I assume the lady pointed at on the screen.\n\nThe following dialogue is to my best recollection:\n\nHim: \"Is this your water bottle?\"\nMe: \"yes.\"\nHim: \"okay I am going to confiscate this because it is against the rules to bring this on board.\"\nMe:\"But it's empty.\"\nHim: \"Yes, but but it is over 100mL and that is against the rules.\"\nMe: confused, but did not want to make a scene and get kicked out. \"No, that's for liquids.\"\nHim: \"no it's for the size of the bottle, and it's glass.\"\nMe: \"but we have this bottle that's also glass.\" this bottle indicates an 80mL bottle of hot sauce we brought.\nHim: \"that is under 100mL, so its allowed.\"\n\nAt this point I wasn't sure if he didn't know the rules or something because every time he answered, he sounded very unsure.\n\nMe: \"can I see where it states that I cannot bring an empty bottle over 100mL with me?\"\nHim: grabs a nearby plaque that labels prohibited items and points to a wine bottle.\nMe: \"but that's not allowed because it's alcohol.\"\nHim: \"no it's because it's over 100mL glass bottle.\"\n\nHis tone at this point indicated that his real intentions were that he wanted my water bottle because he's really just grabbing arguments out of thin air.\n\nMe: just trying to test his nerves at this point \"so if I had an 100mL GLASS bottle of alcohol, I could bring it with me?\"\nHim: \"no because it's alcohol.\"\nMe: \"so is that! (Refering to the plaque)\"\nHim: \"do you want to take the cover off the bottle before it is sent to be destroyed?\" Handing the bottle back to me for me to remove the casing.\n\nKeep in mind there was some more bantering back and forth, basically saying the same thing over and over again. I was really pissed at this point, I really like that water bottle and it was clear that the only reason he was confiscating the bottle was because he or the lady wanted it.\n\nSo I took the water bottle from his hands (he gave it willingly for me to take the casing off), but since the only problem he seems to suggest it has is the size of the glass, I can take everything else.\n\nSo I stared into his eyes as I removed the lid of the bottle and handed the rest back to him. His face instantly became red with anger and he aggressively threw the rest into the disposal bin.\n\nI have no use for the cap or the casing, but he now has no use for the bottle and that's all that matters.\n\nEDIT: wow thanks for all the likes! So I see alot of comments saying that TSA rules state that bottles over 100mL have to be in the checked baggage. That is only for bottles with liquids. As long as it's empty, TSA has no problem with it. Also I don't believe that TSA is who's in charge in Cuba (correct me if I'm wrong), so Cuba's rules are slightly different in a sense that they don't allow gels or aerosols regardless of the amount. But everything else is the same.\nAnother thing is that some people were confused as to why I thought the person wanted my bottle, but the tone he was conveying (which is hard to express over text) was that of someone who was making up rules along the way.\nMany of you also suggested that I should have smashed it on the ground, but I didn't want to seem like I posed a threat to security and get kicked off the flight lmao.

            "Some of those security staff are on a giant power trip, made more confident by the fact that we will usually cave, because we don\u2019t want to miss our flight trying to settle a dispute.\n\nA few years ago, at security in the Fort Lauderdale airport, my husband went before me with his liquid toiletries in a plastic bag.   No problem.  I was right behind him with my toiletries in the same size size bag and the agent said \u201cThat bag\u2019s too big.   Pick your favourites - the rest is going in the garbage.\u201d   I found a smaller bag and managed to put my toiletries in them, including a brand new 100ml toothpaste.

His only response was \u201cOh well, it looked bigger\u201d.   \n\nI sometimes think this whole liquid thing has gotten way out of hand.   I think if you have TSA pre-check or trusted traveller status, they should allow some larger liquids in your carry-on, or at least allow you to keep them in your toiletries bag without putting everything in a separate, small plastic bag.

            "I've known foreign security to have strange interpretations of what the TSA allows.

            "I have cochlear implants. My spares are not allowed through the x-ray machines as it can wipe my \"map,\" the program my audiologist sets that allows me to hear. The right to hear is covered by the ADA (American Disability Act). When I get to check points I have it out in a small box to be hand checked. In Charlotte I was about 5-6 people behind in line and the TSA agent yelled at me to put it in a basket. Yelled back it's medical equipment I need it hand checked. She yelled back \"medical equipment for what?!\" To which I replied \"Medical equipment that I'm not required to disclose by yelling out the reason in front of 20 people. \" (when in reality,  even to TSA, I am not required to disclose the nature of my medical or disability  needs) she went quiet real quick.  \n\nIn Atlanta another time TSA took my box with my spares to put through x-ray. Pulled the box out that he placed to be x-rayed and said no, this is medical equipment that must be hand checked. He took it and again put it in the bowl to be x-rayed. Took it back again, restating it was medical equipment requiring a hand check. He replied \"unless you have a doctors note, it's  going through  x-ray\" told him unless he was willing to violate the ADA and deny my right to hear, it will be hand checked. A manager finally came over and hand checked it, rolling her eyes at her employee. \n\nMy audiologist always loves my travel stories because so few people  understand their rights under the ADA.

            "**TL;DR:** Class trip takes a \"If we can't have you no one can\" view of alcohol in an airport.\n\n\nThis reminds me of my last trip to Mexico, as part of a language study program in college quite some thyme ago. I went with a group of other students from my school. There were about 17 of us. Most of us had been in language classes together, so we knew each other and generally got along well enough.\n\n\nAt one point in the trip we found a tequila store that sold countless different varieties of tequila. Most of my classmates were under 21, so they bought lots of tequila as they would not have been able to do so back in the states. Those of us at, or over, 21 did not really buy much as being able to buy alcohol was not really a novelty to us. The majority of it was legitimately to be brought back as gifts, but a good portion of it (and them) got drunk while we were still down there.\n\n\nWhen it was thyme to return home we got to the airport early, and when were were getting ready to check our bags we noticed that \"security\" was going through all the bags to be checked, and \"confiscating\" \"dangerous\" items. All of these \"dangerous\" items were being collected on some tables in a corner.\n\n\nWe also noticed that employees were picking through what they wanted on these tables and taking it for themselves. There was not even the vaguest effort to disguise what they were doing; going through luggage, finding what they wanted, and taking it in the name of security. For the record: This is not the security checkpoint; this is just our checking our bags and getting our boarding passes, and the \"security\" agents were the exact same people working the counter who had nothing identifying them as security like the actual security people we saw elsewhere in the airport.\n\n\nWhen the first person in our group got to the front of the line and security found a few bottles of high-end tequila, you could practically see the security personnel salivating in anticipation. They announced that all alcohol had to be surrendered. Between all of us we probably had at least two dozen bottles.\n\n\nNone of us were willing to surrender it, but none of those who had bought liquor had any other means of getting it back to the USofA. We were being clearly told that if we wanted to check our bags, and fly home, we had to surrender the alcohol.\n\n\nOne of my classmates had a terrible idea that was driven purely by spite, and that terrible idea broke the hearts of those airport employees... The whole lot of us went into the nearby bathrooms (in the appropriate ones). In there, my classmates chugged as much of the tequila as they could stand, and dumped the rest down the sinks. Not a drop was left to bring home. Maybe we should have handed over the empty bottles to the employees, but those got tossed into the trash, so the employees got nothing. All other valuables that could be were not already in people's carry-on bags was transferred over so they would not be in the checked baggage and under the scrutiny of those working the baggage check counter.\n\n\nIt should be noted that the flight was rather hellish for all parties involved. Over a dozen very, very, very drunk students got very rowdy in a small plane, and there was a 12 hour delay that held up our layover... It was unpleasant for *all* parties involved... Even so, to this day, I still think fondly of that spite-filled plan....\n\n\nEDIT: I accidentally a word.",

The owner followed up by asking me to withdraw my offer. I couldn't be bothered as she can simply refuse.

You put that price up. You go on and take the rap for lying, missy.

While passing it through a door frame the back got slightly damaged (but it wasn't visible if you put it against a wall) and I had no idea how much to price it. I figured if I gave it away for free nobody could give me grief about the damage not being visible in the pictures and since I needed it gone fast and hadn't paid anything for it anyway, I wasn't concerned about making money from the sale. \n\nI got got messaged by all the penny pinchers who wanted me to bend over backwards for them, as if letting it go for free wasn't good enough. One lady even messaged me (TWICE!) to ask if I could deliver it to her (100km away) even though the add specified I couldn't because I have no driver's licence. I mean it's free FFS, hire a crew to come pick it up if you can't do it yourself, it'll still cost you less than most other items listed on the site!!"
