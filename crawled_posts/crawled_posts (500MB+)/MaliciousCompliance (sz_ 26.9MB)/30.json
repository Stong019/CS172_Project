I woke up to their young kid screaming in my face to make him chicken nuggets at 4 am in the morning. They never make him behave, nor punish him for anything he does, so I ignored him and went back to sleep after he decided to go scream at his parents he wanted nuggets. Cut to 9 am, everyone is getting things ready for the day, cooking is beginning for the dishes that need a few hours in the oven. They didn't buy a turkey, they asked me to buy one, I decided to cook it the day before and thought we could toss it into the oven an hour before the time to eat arrived so it would be warm, however their kid started randomly coming up behind me and screaming as loudly as he could into my ear. I asked them to make him stop, seeing as I prefer my hearing intact and don't like anyone just screaming in my ear for no good reason. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was told by my Uncle, word for word 'It's our house, if you don't like it, leave.' \n\nThey where shocked when I actually did just that, I opened the fridge, took my turkey out, got into my car and drove away. Not one minute after leaving I was getting spammed by calls and texts asking, begging, or threatening me to come back with the only turkey for thanksgiving. When I got home, I called him, and told him 'You told me to leave if I didn't like it, so I left, play stupid games, win stupid prizes' then hung up, and blocked his number. I have many stories about them refusing to control their kids, then them having to deal with the consequences that result in this.",

            "I have a relative by marriage that was never taught any sort of respect or self-control in the slightest.  Now he's a preteen and he is getting bullied and absolutely annihilated by other students for his disruptive annoying behavior.  Of course his parents are blaming the school but I suggested at the last large get together that I had brought this up maybe six or seven years ago and they got mad at me.  I think my exact words were if you don't teach him some respect some big kid will.  Not advocating bullying it's just there's a certain range of acceptable behavior and if you fall outside of it most any given group of people will put your ass in check.  And if you have not had your ass put in check by your parents at some point it's going to come as a very big surprise and a difficult lesson.",

            "What did you uncle expect? He threw down and yo took it up. You left with the bird. He should have thought about that before he opened his yap.\n\nNow as far as the kid goes, I have a story of a family gathering - cousins from out of town, etc, on a big cook out. And a total brat who ran around kicking people, and his parents let him. Until brat tried to kick this one woman. Who happened be a Judo black belt. She just pivoted out of the way and he misses. Stupid kid tries to kick her again and again she dodges, and this time the kid fall one his butt, hard. Now the kid is mad and he tries it again. This time, the woman reaches under his kick and flips him onto his back and she tells him \"Don't do that again.\" Yes, he tries it again but this time she grabs him, flips him onto his stomach on the ground and she put her foot on his back so he can't get up. NOW the parents came over and the woman told them what he did. The kid is demanding him mommy beat up the woman. Daddy says,\"time to teach him a  lesson. Have at, with our permission.\" So for the next 10 minutes or so the kid kept attacking the woman, kept getting flipped, held down, etc, until the kid tired out and quit. Woman tells him, \"I went easy on you. I could have broken your arm at any time, so the next time you go to hurt somebody, they may not be so easy on you.\" At least the kid quit doing it at the gathering.",

            "I was a nanny to many children over many years, and the one question I always got from parents is \"How did you do it? I see such a difference, but how?\"\n\nI treat children pretty much like I treat adults. They aren't dumb, and I won't patronise them. That also means facing adult consequences (obviously not exactly, but the concept of it). I won't raise my voice, hit, or force them to do anything but they will have exactly none of what they want and consequences brought on by themselves which they will then deal with. Just like an adult. I also don't really use baby voice. The difference was night and day, and I maintain contact with all my kids to this day.\n\nAll this to say that \"Kids will be kids\" is a bullshit excuse. They will be kids, yes, but that just means doing silly things or making kid mistakes, like anyone else. It's not a pass to be insufferable, and certainly not a pass to be lazy as the guiding adult in their lives.",

            "That sounds like the parents do a stupid mix of \"parenting\": on one side, let the kid \"roam free\" and make their own experiences but on the other hand protecting them from any repercussions.\n\nI can accept if parents are like \"my child is a human being so I don't get involved, please don't address me but the child directly\". Ok no problem. But if those same parents are also \"don't treat my child like that\" ... well ... then it's a problem. If a child acts shitty towards me, it should learn that this will come with an appropriate reaction. If they always get shielded by their parents they of course learn that they can do all the shit they want and will always be fine in the end.\n\nI had a neighbor who treated their kid that way. However that stopped when the kid went to school. Because there were no parents there. And suddenly they had to get by with other (more dominant) kids and with teachers who didn't give a shit.",

I was 22 or 23 at the time and in shape.\n\nCalled up some friends, they wanted to go play pool in Springfield (Massachusetts).\n\nSince I had been out of the States for a bit I only had my military ID on me.\n\nThe bouncer said that the ID was bullshit, that he was going to have to confiscate it, then claiming I wasn't showing the drivers license because it showed my real age. I said give it back and we will go somewhere else... He started pushing us out, I reacted, he tried to throw a punch...\n\nWe were a few seconds from one or both of us having our asses kicked because there was no way in hell I was letting him take my ID when the owner came over shouting and asking what was going on. The bouncer tried to say I thought I was a badass and trying to start a fight with him and didn't mention the ID. \"I might get my ass kicked and end up in jail but I will get my ID back.\", he tried saying I was making up a story as my friends were shouting about the ID (they were regulars).\n\nWe finally got him to show the ID after some shoving and pushing and the owner shouting. The owner glanced at it, started shouting at the bouncer and waved us in. We never paid for a drink all night and I didn't see the bouncer the rest of the night either.\n\nI am not much of a bar person, so have only dealt with bouncers a few times in my life, and they were usually pricks.",

On the opposite end, when I did my basic training there was a bunch of pizzerias in the city.\n\nWe started out trying a few different ones, and one of them loved service guys, a real great guy. First time we went in there and ordered pizza, like 5-6 guys, we just ordered the pizzas, but he grabbed a couple two liter cokes for us, on the house.\n\nSince that day every single one of our 160 man company only ordered from that spot, if you were on guard duty and called with delivery to the front gate and ordered 2+ pizzas there was a complementary 2 liter coke with the order.\n\nHe was a good guy! Great pizza, great service!\n\nAnd I know this has nothing to do with your story but I felt like sharing.",

            "Back when Canada started making the $2 coin the mayor of Kingston (Ontario) got into a little tiff with the base about some minor shit and basically stated that the town doesn\u2019t need the military.\n\nSo the Base Commander, just to prove a point, ordered that ALL military personnel at the base be paid in $2 bills only. So for a couple of months all of the base from Pte to Col were paid in $2 bills and the town was absolutely flooded with $2. The mayor apologized and the troops went back to being paid the usual route.\n\nA bunch of years later, there was a bar that the troops loved to frequent and some college kids came in and started causing shit with those high and tight types, instead of removing both groups, or even just the instigator, the manager kicked out all of the military types. So the BComd banned that bar. It shut down less than a year later.\n\nThere are so many stories like this where a town or business learns the hard way just how much of an impact 3000-8000 decently paid people have on the local economy.",

Because of this, my body looks naturally feminine. Like it takes people awhile to catch on. My voice is softer and it hurts to deepen it. This is important information I promise. \n\nI work as a vendor for one of the major beverage companies. Basically I go to stores and stock shelves of my companies products. I\u2019m listening to music, a playlist of video game themes remixed, with one ear bud in, like allowed, when a mid 30\u2019s year old man walks over. \n\n\u201cWow, girl you are super thick. Wouldn\u2019t mind taking you home with me,\u201d he said with a bit too much confidence. I just continue working, ignoring him. He continues,\u201d Oh come on don\u2019t be like that, I\u2019m quite large under these pants if you know what I mean; something a sweet ass like yours needs.\u201d \n\nI continue to ignore, getting embarrassed and very uncomfortable. That\u2019s when the music turns to the theme from Halo and he says what I needed.\n\n\u201cCome oh cutie, say something to me.\u201d \n\nInspired by the music, I instantly had a thought. It hurts, a lot, to do a masculine voice however in that moment I took a deep breath and turned to him. I looked at him with a very enthusiastic smile and he looks like a kid in a candy store, bouncing a bit like,\u201d oh boy I actually got one.\u201d \n\nGoing back to my roots, I took a deep breath and in the most deep, masculine voice I could muster I said to him,\u201d You\u2019re cute as well, sure I wouldn\u2019t mind having my way with you.\u201d \n\nAfterwards I start coughing, my throat hurting yet it worked. The dude jumped back a good foot and yelled out,\u201d oh hell no!!! Fuck this, uh uhhhh. Nope, hell no.\u201d \n\nHe ran out of the store so fast, constantly looking over his shoulder as if I was following him. \n\nThe stores workers were laughing their asses off, mostly all the female workers. One came up to me and asked,\u201d how did you do that voice? I could never get mine to sound\u2026\u2026 oh you\u2019re trans. That makes sense.\u201d That made my day and is why I\u2019m still laughing in my car writing this.\n\n\nUpdate: Whoa\u2026. This blew up way more then I thought it would. 17K upvotes and over 1,000 comments. Thank you all so much^^\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of the same questions and comments so Im gonna add a little clarification\u2019s here. \n\nThe reason it hurt so bad is when I do a deep voice I don\u2019t just deepen my voice. I basically sound like the roach man from men in black, gargling my words. \n\nNo, not everyone clapped afterwards. That\u2019s a lot of people\u2019s comments and it confuses me why people are saying that. \n\nAgain, thank you all so much. This is absolutely incredible experience^^",

        "selftext": "A few years back, I started my first job as a mechanic and was informed of a mandatory monthly kart race in the local track which was promoted by my boss and owner of the company. \n\nHe didn\u2019t care if you enjoyed it or not, he booked the time slot and we all had to show up (after working hours and paying our own ticket to drive). It was supposed to be a team building exercise and I could see the boss really liked race cars through the various pictures and trophies in his office. \n\nDuring the week, in anticipation to the event, boss would motivate / participate in setting the mood for the upcoming race. It was the only topic that week and I was told by colleagues that this was really important. \n\nI knew that, on the evening of the race, I had to pick up my girlfriend and that would clash with the race, so a couple of days before, I told my supervisor that I would not attend the race. It was after hours and on my dime anyway so I didn\u2019t think it would be a problem. \n\nSome 20 minutes later, I\u2019m summoned to the boss\u2019 office and he\u2019s not looking happy. He tells me that building the team spirit is one of his priorities and that I\u2019m new there so I was to give a lot of focus to this monthly event if I was to keep working there, because it was part of the \u201ccore culture of the company\u201d. I really needed the job so I just said \u201cSure thing, boss\u201d. \n\nOn the evening of the event, I drive to the kart track and, upon arrival, I see my colleagues all in jeans and t-shirts and my boss in full ballerina attire. He had racing overalls, racing boots, gloves and even a custom helmet. It downed on me the reason for the event and why so much attention was given to it: kart racing was his thing. \n\nWith about 15 racers, I asked to start dead last. Boss man listens to me talking and intervenes in front of everyone that we were there to race and not to just drive around slowly. Up until that point, I wasn\u2019t really paying much attention but I decided to comply and show how much the \u201ccore corporate culture\u201d was important to me. \n\nStarting from last, I proceeded to overtake all other karts, including boss man on the outside of a fast corner (overtaking on the outside is often seen as a bold arrogant move). After just a few more laps, I reached him again and, as I was about to lap him, he went into the pits and stepped out. \n\nI duly won the race and, as I left the track into the bar (the real team building event), someone tells me that the boss had left. At the bar, the topic of the evening was how I had outraced everyone and how the boss, who had won all races since ever, was livid with my performance. \n\nToo bad for him. I guess I forgot to add to my resume that I had raced karts competitively as a kid so I knew what I was doing and shattered his \u201cRicky Bobby\u201d dreams. \n\nAfter that, I was always courteously invited but never again required to show up to his events. I went a few times but arrived late on purpose so I would just take part on the bar thing and not the race.",

            "Years ago someone came up with a \"Mini Indy\" go-cart racing deal that went from city to city. The company I worked for dived in head first as there was some charity involved and it was a good political event for the company. I was ordered to attend. I was into go-carts, but I wasn't into this as it was a stock 5 HP Briggs and Stratton engine. Top speed maybe 30 MPH. Plus the rules were are very restricting. Engine RPM was checked, no changes to the gearing was allowed and so on. I had a go-cart at home that would do well over 100 MPH so this was like driving a moped when you were used to racing bikes. I had raced cart some so I think the owner believed I was their \"ringer\".\n\nAnyway, I refused to do it and was told in no uncertain terms by the owner that I had too. It sucked that I was a salaried employee so no money in it either, no incentive for me to show up, let alone participate. A few other employees were all into it and more wanted to participate, but couldn't as only so many could be involved. The owner would not let me drop out and have someone else that wanted to take may place. \n\nThe racing had been announced daily throughout the company and everyone was encouraged to attend. The night before the race there was a large banquet we were required to attend and a bunch of stupid games the racing teams played. I participated, but didn't put any effort into it and got a bit of heat from it as it was obvious I was not trying. \n\nThe day of the race there was nobody there except the few employees that were required to be there, not even the owner of the company that was pushing this down our throats. I was one of the drivers and when it was my turn I just took a leisurely drive around the course and finished in dead last. My manager that was involved was busting my butt for not pushing harder and I just looked at him and said I needed to get paid more if I was expected to compete. A second heat I was in the cart had a minor breakdown so I DNF. I got a bit of backlash from it the following week, but it was worth it. I also reminded him I didn't want to participate and perhaps some other employee that was interested would have been a better choice.\n\nThere was other issues working for this company, but I left soon after.",
            "Our place tried to have health and wellness days. At least they were paid time.\n\nThe day was: first half talk about health issues and the second some fun activity, like an obstacle course or big inflatable joust games.\n\nThey could actually be fun for me as I like challenges and am in decent shape. The funny/sad thing was many of my coworkers are not in good shape. So\u2026 two people injured on the obstacle course. A couple on the bouncy stuff. My partner wrenched his hip just playing floor hockey. \n\nThe \u201cwellness days\u201d were accounting for most of our work injuries. Now they just give us the \u201cwellness\u201d money in reimbursement for gym memberships or running shoes. Things that promote fitness.",
            "Similar scenario, different sport. \n\nCompulsory fun, work function. Pizza and ten pin bowling. Boss was highly competitive, gym junkie type person. I wasn\u2019t on the same team as boss, couple lanes over. \n\nFirst game, I just chilled. Wasn\u2019t trying hard, but getting back into my routine. Wasn\u2019t the highest scorer, but didn\u2019t embarrass myself. And was high enough to attract a bit of attention- a few people hinted at challenging me during the second game. \n\nThat was when I found my line, and settled in. Second place was 20 pins below me. That was about when I revealed that, it may have been 25 years earlier, but state level representation at a sport leaves some skills in the memory banks.",
            "This brings a smile to my face - I've often clashed with my bosses about team building events outside work; I'm just not interested, and they often threaten my employment if I don't show up, which is such nonsense.\n\nThat being said, this strongly reminds me of a time in my late teens, so I'm going to piggyback a bit.\n\nA friend of mine was BIG into Halo multiplayer, and whenever we got together at his place that's all he wanted to do.

Knowing me, i would mess up so i was happy to pay for a professional to come fix that for me.\nThe shed has a roof with a bitumen topping, it looks like very thick sandpaper. The professional builder tacked it in place and that was that. I asked him if no glue would be needed to keep it in place, but obviously i know nothing and that was a dumb question. Lo and behold, 6 weeks later a mild storm blew off the entire bitumen topping of the roof. \nI called the company only to be told i should have known this would be a temporary roof and these need to be changed like every year. (Can you smell the BS?) I replied it has only been 6 weeks, you need to come fix this. Nope, a storm was the reason for damage, act of god, no help from them. Well ok, they promised to send a new roll of bitumen so i could replace it myself. I waited, no bitumen.\n\nI went to their facebook page to find lots of people complaining about similar stuff. I wrote a review warning people to not buy their expensive sheds as they get built wrong and any damage resulting from this does not get resolved by them what so ever. (Mind you this shed was over a 1000 euros)\n\nA half an hour later i get a phonecall from said company. They tell me they will come the next day to put on expensive shingles to make up for the damage, at their own cost. BUT i do have to change my review. I waited for them to come fix it, and they held to their promise. So did i.\n\nI wrote on their page how they came and fixed my roof, even exchanged the material for a much more expensive solution, the very next day, at THEIR OWN COST! Needless to say this caused a sh\\*tstorm of customers demanding the same solution. \nYou're welcome, assh\\*les.\n\nTLDR: company messes up their own product, refuse to solve the problem. Only want to resolve it after an angry review on their facebook page.

            "I almost had a similar experience with Frontier Communications. Frontier Communications is an internet and cable company that in my opinion, is the worst company to ever deal with. In my personal case, they offered me wifi that they promised would go for speeds of 25 MBP. I only recieved around 6-12 MBP. Download speeds for 1gb movies and game updates was about 1-3 hours. They claim on their website that you can recieve cable internet or dsl internet. When I called them they told me only locations they decide can recieve cable internet and other \"special offers\" \n\nOn the installation date they told me between 2-4 the technician would arrive, but he came around 7. It wasn't even the Technicians fault. He stated the company refuses to let him work earlier. So he has to be in by 12 or 11 but he can't work until 1pm. He also had to deal with an issue that took 1 hour. Yet the problem was the company refuses to relieve him of his route and give the other routes to other technicians. This way someone else could of came to install the internet. \n\nThe first two days were find, I didn't expect what happened next. For the next 3 days the internet kept turning on and off at random times a day. Since I am a nerd and love technology, I can easily access the router and do alot of configurations and fix issues, so I checked the router and honestly, the routers are not the problem. Every time I lost connect it was the fault of the company. From their end, the connection kept falling. However, being the young foolish man I am, I called the company. You would think it would be quick and painless, right? Nope, I spent about 3 hours on hold waiting for some one to pick up. When they did pick up, they told me to hold for another department, so I would wait for another 1-3 hours. Then they had the audacity to tell me it's a problem on my end, when I'm clearly on my routers admin page and can see it states the connect is disrupted, and it's being disrupted from its origin point, aka the company. \n\nFor others it's worse, they sign contracts and could be charged up to 200-400 for cancellation fees. They recieve only 1-2 MBP. \n\nAlso, the customer service is horrible from what I heard. In my case most were respectful, except this one lady with a disgusting attitude.\n\nWhen dealing with companies like the one you dealt with and the one I dealt with, it's best to look at reviews. Also while on the topic of companies, avoid FYE at all cost. They scam you by using your credit card without your permission to subscribe you to magazine subscriptions and a V.I.P. access pass.

If this is the case it is not designed to be the top layer of roofing. The product is popular in cold environments. You put a layer of the ice and water guard on and shingle over the top. This prevents ice build up in the edge of the roof and will protect the plywood underneath for longer than just installing shingles.

A few days after the job was complete, they got some moderate rain;  one of the skylights leaked, and there was also a steady drip from the corner of the old overhang.  The company came back and fixed the skylight installation, and discovered that the leak from the overhang was actually prexisting - a detail of the existing roof had been done incorrectly several years prior, causing water to get under the shingles and down inside the overhang, to drip at the corner.  Nobody had noticed until the sunroom was added, because no water came inside the house.

        "selftext": "My boyfriend and I broke up a few months ago, but there have been complications with the apartment because we are both on the lease, and blah blah blah. But I found a new place to live and moved out last weekend. I got the important stuff out, but there were still a few small boxes left and I didn\u2019t go through the kitchen because I didn\u2019t know what my new roommate had. My ex helped me move, and everything was going very well and we were being cordial. \n\nWell, last night, my ex asked me to come over to pick up a few of the small boxes that were in the closet, and to say hi to his dog who was sad that I was gone. So I go over there; we are hanging out. I play with his dog. Everything is good. Then I asked him if he minded if I took the dish brush because my new house didn\u2019t have one. I asked because I bought this dish brush just a couple weeks ago, and I even splurged on a nicer one (like $5 lol). \n\nSide note: I am the only person in our relationship who ever bought household items like this. I just moved into a new place where the rent is higher. I\u2019ve had to pay for a moving truck, and all the other little things associated with moving somewhere new. The last thing I want to do is go to the store and drop another $50 or so buying a bunch of little things I literally just bought a couple weeks ago. \n\nApparently asking for the dish brush triggered him, and he made the ridiculous dictate (at 8 pm on Wednesday, mind you) that I could take anything I that\u2019s mine TONIGHT, but anything that was there when I left THAT NIGHT would be his property now. \n\nI, annoyed, said no, that I don\u2019t agree to this. I immediately said the dish brush was not a big deal. I told him that I did not come prepared (with boxes, bags, etc) to get everything I wanted from the kitchen.  I said I could do this tomorrow or any other day of his choosing. I begged him to compromise. I told him I wouldn\u2019t take the dish brush or anything that he said he wanted. However, he only tripled down, and refused to budge from his ridiculous demand. \n\nSo I became very irate. I told him that if he was going to make me move all my dishes out in plastic trash bags tonight, that I was going to take every last thing that was mine. Again, I am the only person who ever bought anything like pots, spices, utensils, cleaning supplies, etc. I was planning on leaving most of it with him because my new roommate already has a lot of this stuff, but I decided that if he was going to make such a ridiculous rule, then I would take it all. I took the dish brush, the sponges (used and unused), all my spices, the soap, the utensils, all the pots, the Tupperware, the toothpicks, the toilet paper, the pillows, the wall hooks, the coat hangers...I even took the light bulbs. I took it ALL! \n\nDid I yell? Yes. Was I petty? Absolutely. But I think it is quite petty to make a demand on the spot, that everything I don\u2019t take tonight becomes his when this was not the pretense under which I came over, and I was obviously not prepared.",

I'd like to add that the reason \"everything was mine\" was that none of them had ANYTHING moving in, and came up with excuses as to why they couldn't get something, like a broom or lamp.\n\nSo I looked around and thought \"yes. yes, everything in here IS mine.\" So I moved out a month early without telling them. I paid my share of rent for the last month, and my share of the other bills was up to date, but I moved out with all my stuff while they were at work.\n\nThe dishes, living room furniture, kitchen table/chairs, cleaning supplies like broom, mop, and vacuum, the floor lamps in the living room that had no wired lights, the washer and dryer, the internet router (I canceled the internet that was in my name after all), toilet paper and paper towels, garbage bags, garbage cans, shower curtains, plunger... Basically anything that wasn't in their own bedrooms were mine, so i took them.\n\nPetty? Yes. But it sure felt good",

            "I found out an ex was cheating and moved out while he was at work.\n\nI found out he was cheating with like 3 months left on our lease. We decided he'd move into the 2nd bedroom (what we were using as an office) and his new gf wouldn't be allowed over until our lease was up. That lasted a whole week. I told him since she's not on the lease she can't stay at our place. He argued he'd just take me off the lease, as a threat, bc I have a fear of being homeless from childhood. I called his bluff and he did it the next day.\n\nUnbeknownst to him I had actually pre-emptively been looking at new places closer to my school so I could give up my car (I had been looking with some friends). We found a super affordable house that was ready sooner than I thought we needed, but I called the guy and he approved the 3 of us and we got the keys. So a couple days of being taken off the lease, I started my move. Moved all my bedroom stuff out first so he didn't notice. Then the 2nd day while he was at work my friends and I took EVERYTHING. I was actually too naive to do it - one of my friends just started packing up things I was going to leave.\n\nOne of our last arguments was that I should pay for more of the toilet paper bc I'm a girl. He made $80k/yr and I was going to community College and living on savings, and everything was 50/50 because \"I had cats\" and I was young and didn't know better... Even though all of the furniture was mine. He didn't like to clean and ate frozen meals or off paper plates, so I had to pay for 100% of cleaning supplies too (and do all of the cleaning). To not deal with arguments, I just bought all the toilet paper too. \n\nShe ripped the shower curtain down even though our new place had glass doors in the bath. Rolled the toilet paper off the wall and took it. Put the sink Sponge in a ziploc.\n\nLiterally the only thing left was his computer+desk, his clothes in a pile (I bought the hangers, the guest bed, and guess dresser) and one mug. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nAlso, the girl he cheated on me with and moved into the apartment was banging her meth dealer and using my ex as a gravy train for her + her dealer. He paid all of her bills and came over on my birthday a couple months later to \"drop off my mail\" / gloat how she cooks and cleans \"without fights.\"\n\nAbout 6 months later he calls me freaking out.

I met her through a acquaintance I previously knew. Well this girl gave me this huge sob story about how she lived with her sister but shes always kicking her out and the sister petitioned for her kids, they are fighting this, her and sister make up, she moves back in but couple days later she is kicked back out. Idk something more is going on with that. Anyways, this girl will randomly show up at my apartment crying asking for a shower and a warm place to lay down. So I let her. Well then it starts becoming more frequently and more nights. So, I have a 2 bedroom and the second room belongs to my daughter. Shes at her dads till summer and she will be coming back home with me full time. I guess I didn't notice that whole she was  coming and going she was slowly moving her things in. I dont go into the second bedroom and I don't when shes here. (I dont want her to think I'm like going through her things or anything like that, plus I don't like being all up in someone else's business). So, working and not checking on what's going on, this girl has done made herself at home here. She's starting to bring people over, leave with them, or have a couple different men coming over. Guys... I have just let a damn prostitute into my apartment. So, I tell her no, this isn't working out.

She told me that she would get out when she was good and ready and had someone to come get her and her things. My neighbor was telling me that she was always leaving after I would leave for work and she would always show up a bit before I would get home. So I got a idea. I'm done playing game with this bitch. She thinks she is going to continue to lay up in my home and try to bully me. I don't think so. So, my neighbor was right, I had \"left\" for work and instead i parked a couple buildings downs where I had full view of my front door and that. It wasn't 20 minutes later she climbed into the back of a uber and left. As soon as I saw the uber turn onto the main road I had no time to waste. I rushed back to my apartment and the FIRST thing I did was changed my locks. After I changed the locks I relaxed a little bit. I however went into my daughter's room where she had taken up the unwanted and unwelcomed residents, omg, she had trashed the room. There was burn holes all over my daughter's bedding, mattress, stuffed animals, and the carpet. She had taken a sharpie and written on the walls, scribbled on the walls. She had taken my daughter's tablet and her xbox and had it in a duffel bag under the bed. She either threw something at the tv or threw it down bc that's what it looks like when you turn it on. So, after I packed up all her shit, I sat it out the front door and proceeded to call the police and request a officer to come out so I could make a report. I pressed charges against her for destruction of my property, I found drug paraphernalia and she had left a app on my daughter's tablet that showed her actively prostituting herself. I swear it couldn't have been planned any better but just as the officer was looking at the tablet, she SHOWED UP!! She saw her stuff outside and began beating on my door telling me get my ass out there, to open the door before she comes in and beats my ass. She turned around and decided to climb through my window. Omg, I couldn't believe just how awesome this was for me. I wish I had a camera to take a picture of the look on her face when she looked up and saw that officer as she was climbing in. Apparently he had a partner who was outside looking around the complex and was walking up on her after he heard her beating and yelling. He was standing behind her when she tried to climb back out the window. It was most definitely the best \"you got what you deserved\" type of moment for me. Also taught me to NEVER be nice and let anyone sleep over and show up to do it again. So yeah, that's my story. A bit different than the other ones on here",

        "selftext": "Long story short:\n\nI was employed at a rather large factory which is one of the largest plant based companies in the world, recently bought by an investment firm not so long ago.\n\nAnyways, I developed a program which was used at the factory, it could tell whenever any machines were not running, even if it was due to a manual stop or anything else. My program knew the reason why the machine was idling. This program made it so much easier for the entire factory, workers were happy because they didn't need to do any manual work and write down every time the machine stopped.\n\nLead up to about a year ago.\n\nFactory appoints a new chief, all the old employees that were in a leader position was let go because it was time for \"new blood to come in\". There was talk a lot of talk about selling off parts of the factory, including machines and so on. This included programs that I had developed, including the program that identified whenever a machine stopped. I developed this program on my spare time, showed it to the old management and they liked it enough that they wanted to use it on every station in the factory. Every machine was to use this program, all that had to be done was for the program to be maintained weekly. This was around 5 years ago or so.\n\nWhen the newly appointed factory chief wanted to let the the old employees, me included, leave, it was not known that I was the person behind that program. Anyways, at my meeting with HR and the factory chief I said that I was willing to sell them the program and teach someone how to maintain the program. The factory chief laughed in my face and said it was company property and that it was simply \"their program\"  and not mine. I offered to show them the source code and everything but it lead up to the point where if I was to tamper with the program before my departure, they would sue me. I was officially let go, 2 month countdown began and after 2 months I was free.\n\nAfter a week or so, they noticed problems with the program, it would stop loading, stop registering stops and it would mislabel stops. I knew that this was when the fun was about to begin. After a month, I was called in to the office and was told that \"I had tampered with the program because it had suddenly stopped working.\" I let them know that someone had to maintain it. I was ordered to teach someone how to do that job and I told them \"after you pay me for the program rights\". They wouldn't budge and I was told to return to work.\n\nWhen I had a week left, I strolled around the factory floor for a while and noticed that no stations were running my program anymore. I asked some operators why that was and they told me that \"it just stopped working, now we need to fill out forms every time the machine stops manually.\" I shrugged and told them to thank the factory chief.\n\nI left after that week, got a phone call about a month after I left where they begged me to sell them the rights and teach someone how to maintain it.\n\nI never sold them that program, instead I sold an improved version to another factory nearby, where I am now employed.\n\nEdit: I see some are saying that I am in the wrong based on US law, just editing here to let you know that this did not take place in the US. I made the program during my spare time at home on my own computer. After introducing the program to the former factory chief, I was allowed to try it out on one machine and test it. The maintenance was done on my office computer. After a few months I was allowed to roll it out for the entire factory. It wasn't done overnight, lots of debugging to do. I have not heard anything from the company for nearly a year so it would be weird for them to suddenly come after me now. Just wanted to make that clear.",

Unless the company is a tech company in the business of writing software or, at the very least, a business large enough to have its own IT department, they were unlikely to have a *contract* with you that your creative work is their property.  Your creative work does *not* belong to your employer by default, but it is standard for businesses in the business of generating creative work to include explicit rights ownership in their employment contract.  If they did make you sign such a contract, as you pointed out, you did it on your own time and your own property, which would make their case very weak no matter what their employment contract says.\n\nFinally, even if your initial work was their property, you are under no obligation to maintain it unless you specifically signed a contract that you would support and maintain that software, and such a contract would be highly unusual for someone who was not employed as a software developer in the first place *and* it would need to include some sort of compensation for continued work (contracts generally can't compel an individual to work for free).",

        "selftext": "When I was 19 years old and a fresh high school (or my country's equivalent) graduate, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. The one thing I did know is that I needed money, so I started applying for all kinds of jobs. After a few weeks of writing applications, going to interviews and waiting nervously for replies, I was hired as a full-time sales assistant an international company making smartphones, TVs and other electronic gadgets. \n\n\n\nSaid company was in the process of opening their first official store in my country and I, as I was hired about 3 months before they were due to open, helped them however I could. I created one-pagers (basically posters that show all the hardware inside a device plus a picture), translated manuals, put security tags on products etc. Whatever they wanted me to do I did, sometimes until late at night, still foolishly thinking that this initiative would maybe be recognized in one shape or another.\nAlongside me they hired 4 other people: 3 more sales assistants and a store manager, all of whom were young and ambitious, just like me. The grand opening went very well, business was booming for the first 2 weeks and everything seemed fine. That's where the problems started.\n\n\n\nThe first thing we realized we didn't have were guidelines on how to handle returns and warranty cases. As the company's electronics had been available online long before the store opened, some people now started bringing in their devices to get them fixed or swapped out, none of which we knew how to handle. This annoyed a lot of customers, being given the information that only devices bought at our specific store would be handled under warranty only made things worse for us. We were getting abuse on a daily basis that ranged from curse words to death threats, once we even had to call security because a customer was threatening us. This stress caused one of my collegues to quit, understandably. \n\n\n\nThis, as it turned out was only the tip of the iceberg. Some of the other problems we had included:\n\n-Having a break room with no access to fresh water, no fridge, no microwave and of course no bathroom (all big no-nos where I live)\n\n-Resupply came in sporadically at best, sometimes we were resupplied twice a week, sometimes there were no deliveries for three weeks, making it very hard for us to tell our customers when their devices will be arriving.\n\n-The store manager was so incompetent, he couldn't even finish our schedules 3 days in advance, allthough giving the schedule two weeks in advance is mandatory.\n\n-One of my collegues thought \"fuck this\" about a month after our grand opening and went on sick leave, which where I live basically gives you immunity from getting fired, so now we where two men down.\n\n-The bosses upstairs apparantly wanted us to provide tech support over the phone, which again none of us where trained to do. We did our best, but only really ended up with more threats in addition to having our official store phone number constantly blocked by these calls. Also, we were expected to take over social media communications as well, meaning we now had to answer questions on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc., putting even more strain on our small team.\nIn the end, the manager couldn't deal with the stress anymore and broke down about 2 months after opening. He even sought psychological counseling after quitting. While I was sad to see him go, I thought that now my time had come to prove myself.\n\n\n\n\nI took over most of his duties, still only earning about half of what the manager made. Naively I worked 60 to 70 hour weeks for almost 3 months straight, still thinking that this would somehow pay off. I made sure to tell my bosses how much more I did than we agreed upon in my contract, but they didn't seem to care. That is, until our sales figures dropped. All of a sudden I had two of them come into the store unannounced, basically drag me into a back room and start lecturing me on how badly the store is performing. The conversation went something like this:\n\nBoss 1: \"So, why would you say the store's sales performance has dropped so much since (Manager) left?\"\n\nMe: \"Well, a lot of customers are unhappy with the way we h-\"\n\nBoss 2: \"Our products are very competitive, why are you still struggling to sell them?\"\n\nMe (slightly disgruntled): \"Well SIR, as I was trying to say, the customers are not happy with our service and running a store with just two employees is almost impossible. If we could hire two more assistants, maybe we could focus better on our numbers...\"\n\nBoss 1: \"The interviews for those positions are ongoing, you will have new employees soon. But you were hired for a reason, so would you just do your fucking job?\"\n\nMe:\"...yes sir.\"\n\nAfter that meeting I felt defeated. Doing all this extra work, staying late, taking responsibility for things I had no business taking responsibility for, the threats, the uncertainty, the stress, the sleep deprivation, all for nothing. And that's when it clicked in my head: \n\n\n\nFuck those guys. The wanted me to do my job? Fine. From now on, I would do exactly what my job description says, nothing more, nothing less.\n\n\n\n\nThe next day, I came in early, opened the store, everything normal. Until the first tech-support call came in. I picked up the phone and, after listening to what the caller wanted, told them that I was only a sales assistant and therefore not qualified to answer their questions. Hanging up the phone without saying goodbye, a postman came in with some special documents for the store manager, requiring a signature. I said nope, sorry, not gonna sign that, I'm not a manager. After being informed that these were court documents and need to be signed for immidiately, I just shrugged and said: \"Not my problem, just doing my job here man.\"\n\nLater that day, after my collegue had arrived, we got a delivery of new product for the store. The delivery guy handed me the manifest, asking for a signature. Again I declined, stating that I was just \"doing my job\" and the manager would have to sign that. After making it clear to him there wasn't a manager on site, he left, taking all of the new product with him, product which we desperately needed. But I was beyong caring at this point. About fifteen minutes later, I got a call from Boss 1, asking me why noone had signed for the delivery. I told him that, as there was no manager on site, nobody there was allowed to sign that document. After a few choice words, he hung up the phone and I went back to work, chatting with customers and generally not caring about anything.\n\n\n\nHalf an hour later, Boss 1 and 2 descended onto me. They rushed into the store demanding an explanation for my behaviour. \nI simply replied: \"I'm just doing my job sir, just like you asked me to do.\"\n\nBoss 1: \"What the fuck do you mean? Then why has nobody accepted today's delivery or the documents we've sent you?!\"\n\nMe: \"Well, that's the managers job. I am not a manager.\"\n\nBoss 2: \"Yes you fucking are, what the hell are you talking about?\"\n\nMe: \"Uh, no, not only would my pay be pretty poor for all the work I am doing, my contract clearly states that I am a sales assistant and as such shall only fulfill duties related to that position.\"\n\nBoss 2: \"And who the hell is supposed to the managers job if not for you?\"\n\nMe: \"I don't know, but I would gladly do it, if you doubled my salary of course.\"\n\nBoss 1: \"Hahaha! (actually laughing in my face) Who the hell do you think you are? We can have you replaced with someone cheaper in a heartbeat!\"\n\nMe: \"Okay then, go ahead, I quit, effective immidiately. Bye.\"\n\nAnd then I just left. My remaining collegue, upon hearing me quit, also quit immidiately, leaving our former bosses wide-eyed with no employees to run their store. I had also taken the liberty of informing the board of health and labour about our working conditions, as well as getting myself legal counseling for some issues related to bonusses not being paid out. The store ended up having to completely shut down for about 2 weeks until they had a skeleton crew back together to run it.\n\n\n\nThe kicker? About a month after I quit and with my lawsuit for unpaid wages now pending, I got a call from Boss 1, telling me he wanted to accept my offer of doubling my salary to become the store manager. He said noone was willing to take the job now that word got around how awful things are in the store. The following conversation ensued:\n\n \nMe: \"Frankly Boss 1(I used his first name here, just to piss him off), I don't much like getting laughed at, so I'm afraid if you want me to come back, you're gonna have to quadruple my initial pay.\"\n\nBoss 1: \"What?! Are you insane?! We can't afford that, how are we supp..-\"\n\nMe: \"I don't give a fuck Boss 1, I really don't. But I've got an idea! How about you pull your head out of Boss 2s ass and just do your fucking job?\"\n\n*Click*\n\n\nEDIT: Wow, reddit gold? Thank you, kind stranger(s)",

            "Reminds me of a job I had a long time ago at a sex toy and lingerie store. There was no malicious compliance so I've never told the story here. But basically after my first two weeks, when I finished my training, every employee in the store quit. I was the only employee for about a year. I was working from open to close, managing the store, working the register, cleaning, doing inventory, all of it. And I did a goddamn good job. Sales even went up because on weekend nights working late, I started to become friends with all the people that would go to the bar next door. It was a regular biker hangout, and they would always come over and buy a bunch of random shit. Anyway, the owner finally brought somebody in for me to train. Awesome! So I trained her. A week later the owner informed me that she would be the new manager of the store. I was like what the fuck? I just trained her. Why is she the manager? He told me it was because she had previous management experience. I was like what the fuck do you think I've been doing for the last year? I have literally been working 16-hour days, every day, no days off, managing this entire store by myself for a fucking year. And you're going to make her the manager? Fuck you. I quit. And this conversation happened right in front of her. A few weeks later I was hanging out with some friends at the bar next door and noticed that the place was closed. I guess she quit too.

When he'd ask for a day off or some longer time between shifts, they would laugh at him.

Now my bf is a great person, honest, friendly, hard working, gets shit done. This store doesn\u2019t see many employees like this come through their doors often, so of course management take advantage of that. \n\nHe\u2019s worked there for over 18 months now and they get him to do EVERYTHING outside of his pay grade. When he should be either on tills or on shopfloor stacking shelves, they have him lock up the shop at night, manage everyone else, manage money in the safe, run OTHER shops in the area when they have no staff, even fucking bake bread when they run out??? These are the roles of a supervisor, not 19 year old part time staff.\n\nDespite being on a 12 hour contract there was a time he was consistently working 40 hour weeks, the highest being 51 hours. Although now he\u2019s at university abroad the hours problem has been mostly resolved and is now back to part time during the holidays (although definitely still works over 12 hours a week, but he needs the money so doesn\u2019t mind)\n\nNow of course being the protective gf i am this has always bothered me. He\u2019s always been quite a low-energy person, so this constant work takes a lot out of him, meaning he also can\u2019t enjoy free time or time with me bc he\u2019s so physically and mentally exhausted from working there. I\u2019ve pointed out numerous times how they take advantage of him at that shop, his family and friends have too. He acknowledges it too, but he never did anything about it. He\u2019s a student, he needs the money, so i kinda understood that and kept my mouth (mostly) shut.\n\nI think the final straw has come now during the christmas period. He was promised new year\u2019s eve/day off if he worked christmas eve and boxing day. He instead ended up working both shift patterns anyway. And now today they expect him to run the shop and lock up after everyone\u2019s gone. Now hes had enough. He messaged me today saying he was annoyed and if they say anything he\u2019s gonna finally have that conversation with them. Hes a part time employee. Either promote him to supervisor status so he can do all the work they expect him to, or he remains a part time employee and simply does the bare minimum. I\u2019m so glad he\u2019s finally taking a stand on this it\u2019s been over a year of this happening. I\u2019ve sent him this post as inspiration, hopefully he takes some notes.",

I recently had a business owner ask for a mildly simple design on a small window and gave her the price of 150 and did the job. The business next door wanted a very simple design on bigger windows and so I did the job for 250. After I painted they didn't like my price and wanted me to charge by square foot instead of complexity and time. I had them sign a contract stating the price per square foot regardless of design and that payment was due immediately. Then I measured the windows and the price came out to 500 dollars.
