After all,  he insisted she keep wearing skirts and dresses. (This was in the fifties).  That night,  he agreed to let her get slacks. \n\n(Side note- she would also sew shut the flaps on his long underwear when she was mad at him).",

            "My grandmother is a redhead and her father forbade her from wearing anything red. He didn't think redheads should wear red. So when she's in high school, her mother sends off for a three pack of dresses, no choice in colors/prints. \n\nThey finally arrive and one of the dresses is red. She put that dress on and strutted around the house and great-grandpa got really mad, but there was nothing he could do about it. He had paid for the dresses! I think she wore that dress until it fell apart.",
            "My grandmother had a friend of her husband decide that he could just drop off a stack of jeans to be mended. No asking, just plonking them down on the table and saying \u201csew up all of the holes.\u201d\n\nSo she did. Sewed all of the pockets shut, leg holes shut. Then she decided that the waist didn\u2019t count as a hole, so she sewed the zippers down (open.) And of course sewed or patched all of the damaged places. \n\nReportedly, after he fell over trying to put a pair on, he ripped the stitches out of the hem, and put them on, only to discover that he couldn\u2019t zip them, and he couldn\u2019t get to the stitches on the zipper pull with the pants on because she\u2019d very carefully tucked it inside the fly.",
            "I read a similar story of a Hollywood celebrity, about that same era. I think it was a little later, when women wearing pants had become more common though still unusual. \n\nAnyway, this celebrity went to some fancy restaurant in a long shirt and pants, and they refused to seat her because she was wearing pants (I'm pretty sure they would have required a suit and tie for men). So she took off her pants and went in wearing just her long shirt that was barely long enough to be considered even a \"micro miniskirt\".\n\nAnd speaking of how times have changed, remember that *I Love Lucy* episodes where she gets the vase or trophy or something stuck on her head? She and Ethel have to travel somewhere to get it taken off, and Ethel insists on going to change because, \"I'm not going to go on the subway in *blue jeans*!!\" -- completely horrified at the idea. While Lucy has her head completely inside a vase, lol!",
            "A coworker of mine years ago told me a story about her mum. Her father had been complaining about her mother being too fat constantly. So her mother took all his clothes and started amending the hems, a little bit each week to the point his clothes barely fit. He thought he was gaining weight, after a month or so he admitted he needed to lose a few pounds, he had been teased at work for his clothes and apparent weight gain. He apologised to her and she slowly let the hems out again. He never found out, but never said a word about her weight.",

He hadn't come home and she heard from one of his work mates he was at the strip club. She knew she wouldn't be able to get him to leave by asking so she devised a plan. She went in, got right on stage and took her shirt off. He grabbed her and ran out the door so fucking fast and that was the last time he snuck out to the strip club.",
            "My mother used to tell the story about her and her best friend being thrown out of Teacher's College for wearing trousers. The obvious conclusion being that they were clearly lesbians. The outrage! \n\nIt was years before she mentioned that they did indeed, at one time, have it going on.\n\nNot that it was a good reason of course, even in the 40s or 50s.",
            "I heard this as a joke, but it seems there might be some basis in fact.\n\nOn their wedding night, Grandpa took off his trousers and gave them to Grandma and said, \"Put these on.\" Grandma replied, \"They won't fit me.\" Grandpa told her, \"Exactly. Remember who wears the pants in this house.\"\n\nGrandma wriggled under her wedding dress and brought out her drawers, threw them at Grandpa and said, \"Put these on.\" Grandpa said, \"I can't get into these.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Grandma, \"and you never will until there is an attitude adjustment.\"",

So he'd tell it anyhow and grandma just side eyed him the whole time.",
            "Surprisingly, I had the reverse;\n\nGrandfather liked to wear robes. Kimono, bathrobes, night robes, not even dresses, just robes. Even though he was not very fortunate in life, it made him feel like he had power and like he was a rich person inside his small home. This irked my grandmother, who did not know men could also wear robes except priests and the likes, saw that as \"effeminate\" and did not like seeing her husband \"behave like a \\[insert slur about men displaying behaviour of the fairer sex\\]\".\n\nIn response, my grandfather said \"Good thing we are getting divorced, then.\" and, in a power move that was confirmed by children involved, flipped Grandma off, took the edges of his leopard-patterned robe and ran off flapping the damn things like he was some kind of majestic flying leopard-birb-man error of nature.\n\nThis story is being told every time a child ask why we never see my father's mother at any party.\n\nI'm also thinking of using that next time I break up with someone. I just never had a robe at the right time...\n\n(Don't misunderstand, there was PLENTY of other reasons for the break-ups, but that's none of our collective business, I was told.)",

            "My mother had been a tomboy when she was young and refused to wear skirts or dresses.  Her school had a dress code that did not allow girls to wear pants.  So my mother would get sent home from school.  My grandparents would check to make sure she was dressed properly before sending her out the door to school, but my mom would stash a change of clothes in some bushes and change on the way.  And then get sent back home again.  \n\nI think that she was violating the dress code every day, but only getting sent home occasionally.  So this went on for a long time.  I am not really sure how it all ended.",

I never met her, but apparently my Great Grandma was quite the contrarian. \n\nOne evening, she was getting ready to host a dinner party for some friends. In those days, it was expected that all the men smoked but it was considered unladylike so she had never tried it. So while she was setting out cigarettes and ash trays for her guests, she decided to try one out of curiosity. She lit up and took a puff, thought it was absolutely disgusting, and decided never to do it again. Well right at that moment, her husband walked in and saw her with the cigarette. He said, \u201cno wife of mine is going to smoke!\u201d Well, she was not about to let some man tell her what to do, so from that day on she smoked a pack a day out of pure spite. \n\nUnfortunately she died of lung cancer before I was born, but she outlived him so I\u2019d say she got the last laugh on that one. She was in her 80s so I\u2019d say she lived a pretty long full life.\n\nI loved reading everyone else\u2019s family stories, so hopefully you all enjoy this one as well!",

        "selftext": "In 2018, I lived in southern CA while I was finishing up graduate school. Uber was more popular than ever and given how spread out CA is in general was an easy side hustle to shuttle people back and forth. However, I only did it for a little while because I'm not really the most patient person and eventually got tired of people's BS and attitudes. One of the common tactics for customers looking to screw a driver was to \"cancel\" their rides in the middle of the trip to avoid paying the fare. They would often say how they did it \"accidently\" and then ask me if I could just \"finish the trip since we were basically there anyway\". This happened to me three times. The first two times, I pulled over and told them to get out of my car to which they complied (albeit they called me several names and threatened to kill me). The third time is the subject of this post...\u2026.\n\nIt was about 430 in the afternoon on a Tuesday when I decided to log on and catch some fares. Most people go into the office on Tuesdays and Thursdays and are looking to get rides home between 4-5 pm to beat the traffic. At this point, I should mention that I was living in San Diego. If you know the area, you'd know that many people work in the city and live in the outer areas (Chula Vista, Imperial Beach, Escondido, Pacific Beach) because its cheaper. The day of the event (oh yes it was an event lol), I picked up a middle aged girl who was a student at the local the community college downtown. Although she was in community college, I could tell she had money by the way she dressed and where she was going (La Jolla). She gets in my car and starts to make conversation with me. I am driving through town and as I am about to get on the highway I hear the cancellation ding. I pull over to a parking lot and let her know that she cancelled the ride and I could not drive her until she rebooked it. She gave me the \"it was an accident\" excuse. I told her not a problem and to just rebook the route. Well at this point, all those people I told you about earlier had just got off of work and we were in what I call the \"Power Hour\" of maximum surge pricing. La Jolla is like 25-40 minutes from downtown San Diego depending on traffic. I looked and the trip would have cost her $70. She told me that she wasn't going to pay that. I said fine and I asked that she exit my vehicle. SHE REFUSED and told me to take her home like I was her chauffeur. At this point, I was pissed and wouldn't have done it even if she gave me $100 cash (I didn't really need the money). I asked her politely again. She refused. I had never really gotten to this point before. The other two people were guys and I would have had no qualms about yanking their ass's out by force and beating them in the middle of the highway. However, that wouldn't have been a good look in this situation. I thought about going to the police given we were 3 blocks from the headquarters but I wanted her to feel the burn. Que Malicous Compliance.....\n\nI asked her if she wanted a \"free ride\"......she suddenly perked up and said \"I knew you'd come around, you are such a nice guy\". I said buckle up and we got on Interstate 5. Here is the part where I tell you that San Diego is 16 miles from the Mexican border. I also keep my passport in my glove compartment because I did volunteer work in Rosarito every so often. We were about 4 minutes into the ride when she asked where we were going. I turned around and told her \"I'm going to Tijuana and I'm glad you could join me. I hope you brought your passport\". At first she didn't think I was serious but by Exit 4 she started to panic, I told her she was welcome to get out at anytime but she needed to make a decision soon because after we passed exit 1 there was no turning back. I also told her that I wasn't taking her back. Well she got the message and pleaded for me to pull over. I pulled over and dropped her off at the outlet mall in San Ysidro at the border. Just for shits and giggles I checked the Uber rate from the mall to La Jolla and the cheapest rate was $87 for a pool ride. I didn't make any money that night but that was the richest experience I had while being a rideshare driver. I stopped about 1 month later and sold my car.\n\nEDIT: For those concerned that I was going to \"kidnap\" this chick.....I communicated with both Uber support and a few of my friends to let them know she would not get out my car after being asked repeatedly prior to driving towards the border. I covered my bases.\n\nEDIT 2: Wow this really blew up lol...Thanks to those who gave the post an award. I can no longer keep up with all the comments but hopefully I've answered the more popular questions in the comments I have made. Thanks Again.",

He led his company's Hydro department and was responsible for contracting supplies for his turbine project. Looking for a supplier, a good college friend of his was the Managing Director of a turbine company based in Texas and he personally invited my dad to meet and survey some products at his company there for his upcoming hydro project.\n\nNow the thing about my family (and most Malaysians in general) is that we are fluent in English (it's our second language). And with my dad studying engineering in Sunderland for 4 years, I could definitely say his English is way above others. So, my father and some of his employees took the trip from Kuala Lumpur to Houston and the first thing they faced when entering the company's lobby was this American lady at the reception. She looked at my father's Asian complexion and condescendingly tried to take on a stereotypical Asian accent to \"attempt to communicate\" with him. My dad's coworkers behind him were all like \"oh no she didn't\" and were embracing themselves for the inevitable comeback at this racist remark. Then, my dad smugly decided to play along and conversed with her in \"Asian-broken English\" for roughly 15 minutes, just to mess with her. \n\nJust as she was reaching her limit with him, the MD (her boss) came down to the lobby and enthusiastically greeted my dad from afar with \"Yo 'OP's Dad'! You made it!\". My dad dropped the Asian act and returned his greeting out loud in completely fluent English. Confused and embarrassed, she became speechless and her face turned bright red in silence at the situation. The MD invites my dad upstairs to his office for the meeting while my dad's workers were holding in their laughter as they followed him to the upstairs for the meeting. \n\nMy dad later told his MD friend about the whole situation in the lobby and the MD profusely apologized for her behavior, but my dad was a good sport and had fun messing with her. Later that month, my dad came back for another meeting and found out that the MD took no excuses from her and fired her that very same week for basically insulting their foreign customers.",

            "Ah, obnoxious receptionists. I miss them. I use to be a receptionist in college so I always knew about how hard it was behind the desk but I also was really polite to people. Well guess what bitch had her own company for 6 years? Yep, this one. I had this vendor who kept trying to woo me and bugged me for years to come to his office if I was in his area. One day, it happened and I set up a planned visit. \n\nFirst, the lucky thing about me is that I always have looked about 10 years younger than my age. Thanks genetics! But, to some people I always looked too young. So when I walked in to beautiful lobby in a skyscraper and told the receptionist who I was and who I was there to see, I got some eyeball scanning me glares and the look of the snobby \"who you?\" that I ignored. She couldn't get ahold of his admin so she rudely told me to go sit down \"over there\" and just pointed. After about 10 minutes of sitting there and the receptionist not doing anything to see if the admin came back, I walked up to ask her to check again. She told me: \"Oh, well no one knows who you are so I guess you aren't going up to see 'the owner!!' Bye bye!\"\n\nA bit shocked, I asked her if she was sure they didn't know I was coming and she just nods her head with a yes and answered the phone. I was not mad, just a little frustrated. So I went to the side of the lobby and text him that he has a great lobby security as they won't allow me to come in and claimed that I didn't have an appointment. Meanwhile, she starts yelling at me that I need to leave the lobby and she got flustered about it. I text him that she is telling me to leave and I will catch him next time. My phone rings and it's him. He says to stay and he'll be right there and continues to talk to me on the phone. Meanwhile you can hear the receptionist yelling at me to leave. \n\nI walk over to her, so as to not yell in an echoey lobby, and tell her he's coming to get me while I'm still on the phone with him. She absolutely did not believe me and told me to wait for him outside. So I do because she is causing a huge scene. He comes busting through to the lobby doors, yells and points to her in an angry tone,  and comes and opens the door for me to come back in. I can see the receptionist panicking and he is now retreiving me back into the lobby and then escorts me to his office. She apologizes a hundred times, but to him not me. He apologized for it, which was fine. I wasn't too upset about the incident, just annoyed that she was so obnoxious about it all (and that she never apologized to me either).\n\nHe didn't gain my business and it was not because of that incident, it just wasn't a good fit.",

They offered a solid education, it's part of the curriculum, I had a lot of Catholic friends, so I'm obviously not going to be an jerk about it.\n\nI had no issue showing up at mass and being respectful, taking four years of religion courses, or doing community service.\n\nBut that didn't mean I wanted to lead prayer.\n\nI didn't really mind saying a few words, but reading from the Bible never sat well with me and felt disingenuous. Luckily, most teachers were awesome and I could respectfully opt out.\n\nBut at least once a year, some teacher would absolutely insist that I get up and read from \"one of the many beautiful passages you should know by now!\"\n\n\"Okay.\" I would walk to the front, say the traditional greeting, \"In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,\" and then I would read:\n\n**II Kings 2:23-34**\n\n*From there Elisha went up to Bethel. As he was walking along the road, some boys came out of the town and jeered at him. \u201cGet out of here, baldy!\u201d they said. \u201cGet out of here, baldy!\u201d He turned around, looked at them and called down a curse on them in the name of the Lord. Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the boys.*\n\n****\n\nFor times I didn't feel like going with 42 children being brutally mauled by bears for making fun of a bald guy, there was another passage that was (somehow) often a more appropriate read:\n\n**Deuteronomy 25:11-12**\n\n*If two men are fighting and the wife of one of them comes to rescue her husband from his assailant, and she reaches out and seizes him by his private parts, you shall cut off her hand. Show her no mercy.*\n\n****\n\nAnd then I'd finish up with the sign of the cross and head back to my seat. And what do you know? My turn to say prayer never seemed to come around again.",

            "Long ago, in my Army days, there was a mandatory weekend breakfast event for everyone who's rank was exactly e4. To this day, not a single one of us knows why. Our Sergeant Major joined us, gave a speech no one listened to, and then said \"Well, this is a prayer breakfast, does anyone want to say a prayer?\" It *might* have been an honest mistake, as there were actual non-mandatory prayer breakfasts in that same location regularly, but it was still a bit annoying. I also happened to have a printed copy of Mark Twain's War Prayer (not from any actual bible, but that wasn't a requirement) in my cargo pocket... For a room full of trained soldiers, there sure were a lot of sick faces as I asked their god to help us tear our enemies to bloody shreds.

            "I attended a Baptist high school for my junior and senior year. On my first day, the principal/pastor of the church addressed freshman and new students. He explicitly stated that even though it is a Baptist school, that they do not force it down anyone\u2019s throat. \n\nBeing an atheist, I was relieved. But yeah, that didn\u2019t last long. \n\nJunior year was fine. I was okay with the mandatory theology class and the weekly chapel meetings. I\u2019m respectful and don\u2019t mind learning more about religion. I could handle some of the comments made by teachers, my personal favorite being about teen pregnancy in the South and abortion (\u201cWe may be fornicators, but we aren\u2019t baby killers\u201d). \n\nHowever this changed in senior year. In my senior theology class we had two projects. The first one required us to go interview and video strangers about God and their (Christian) beliefs. This was uncomfortable, but still mostly manageable. The second project was a school field trip to a local shopping center where we were to go around \u201cwitnessing\u201d to people. It was mandatory. No exceptions. \n\nYou know who wants to be witnessed to when they are trying to enjoy their day and get some shopping done? No one. Never mind trying to force me to convince people to belief in something that I myself don\u2019t believe. \n\nLuckily I found a group to kind of glob into, and just stood around awkwardly while they essentially harassed people. \n\nSure felt like force to me.

Much to their anger. I helped setting place and serving, but that was it. \n\nAs we were eating my husband commented how good something tasted. MIL immediately went on about how I wouldn't be cooking anything for him. When he said he can cook for himself SIL chimed in with how her husband or dad never had to cook a day in their life.

        "selftext": "Something someone said to me today reminded me of this tale and i thought some of you would appreciate hearing it.\n\nSo, this is my grandmother's story.  My family has been telling the tale for decades.  Grandpa himself told it to his daughter's fiance as a lesson in not underestimating his new bride.  Grandma told it slightly differently to my mom when she and my father were engaged.  This is somewhere between the two versions.  It's a lesson in \"be careful what you wish for, as you just might get it.\"  Personally, I've always thought that it was hilarious.\n\nMy grandparents were *very* old school.  Grandpa got a job working for John Deere as a teen and worked his way up the ladder to foreman, then manager.  Grandma was a typical housewife in the 1950's and was held to typical housewife standards.  She was to cook and clean and be prepared to entertain Grandpa's business associates at a moment's notice.  It was her job to make sure the children were taken care of and never got in her husband's way.  She was expected to have dinner on the table at 5:30 sharp, when he got home from work.  Her house and herself were to be impeccably kept at all times... etc.\n\nThey were progressive and well-off enough that Grandma had her own car.  She was expected to use it to run the household errands and take the (four) kids to appointments and such.  It was *important* that her husband not be bothered with such things.  The household and family were *her* responsibility.  He had a *job.*\n\nWell one day, Grandpa arrived home from work and not only was dinner not on the table, but Grandma wasn't even there.  The kids (teens at the time) hadn't been fed.  Their homework was still on the kitchen table, there were unwashed dishes in the sink, and a dozen other little chores hadn't been done yet.  Most importantly, Grandpa was *inconvenienced.*\n\nHe'd been home just long enough to let his frustration stew into anger when Grandma's car pulled into the drive.  He began shouting at her before she'd even had the chance to set down her purse or take off her jacket.  He ranted about all the things she hadn't done because she was out \"running around\" when she should have been home, taking care of the house and making his dinner.  He worked very hard all day to provide for this family, was it too much to ask for a hot dinner when he got home?  She'd had a very good reason for not being home, but he never let her tell it, accepting no excuses.  But she was a \"good wife\" so she intended to let him vent for a while, then she would serve him supper and explain what had gone wrong.\n\nThen, Grandpa screwed up.  As sometimes happens when we speak in anger, he began to blame the wrong thing for his irritation.  He began to blame the car and her access to it.  He said something to the effect of, \"You don't have any business out *driving* *around* anyway.  You should be *home.* I should never have let you start driving in the first place!  Women shouldn't drive!\"\n\n\"You don't want me to drive?\" Grandma asked calmly, retrieving her keys from her purse.  \"Fine.  Then I won't drive ever again.\"  And she set those car keys on the counter, put her things away, and served dinner.\n\nAnd bless her heart, Grandma stuck with that declaration not matter how much more difficult it made life.  Grandpa had to take afternoons off in the middle of the week when a teacher scheduled a meeting.  He didn't get a moment's peace on the weekends, between grocery trips and taking the kids to activities or doctors appointments or for haircuts or clothes.  He had to drive Grandma to every Saturday salon appointment.  Previously, Grandma had taken herself and the kids to church, letting him sleep.  Now he had to wake up early on Sundays to take them all himself.\n\nGrandpa was nearly as stubborn as his wife.  He held out, expecting her to apologize and ask for her keys back.  She never did.  Instead she simply rearranged the household schedule so that he could handle all the driving.  Months later, after never getting a single weekend to relax, after having dinner pushed back nearly every day because he had to drive *someone* someplace, he finally gave in and apologized.  He tried to tell her that he was wrong and that she should start driving again.  He tried to tell her that he now appreciated all she did to make his life easier.  He all but *begged* her to take those keys.\n\nI suspect that Grandma had always disliked driving, because she never did take back those keys.  Nothing Grandpa said or did could convince her to get back behind the wheel.  He'd said she had no business driving a car and she was going to hold him to that declaration, no matter what.  For over fifty years, until the day she died, Grandma never drove a car again for any reason.  Not after the kids graduated and moved out.  Not after Grandpa retired.  Even after Grandpa's death in the eighties she still refused because, \"my husband always said that women shouldn't drive.\"\n\nTLDR; Grandpa was mildly inconvenienced and told his wife she shouldn't drive.  So she stopped driving and he ended up *very* inconvenienced for a very long time.\n\n**ETA**:  A lot of people are asking and some seem very confused (I haven't even managed to read all the comments yet.  I'm really glad so many liked the story!)  so I'm copying the answer I gave one of the comments here.  As to the reason for the whole argument and why Grandma was late that day:\n\n>Sadly, as with the start of most epic arguments between married persons, the details of the triggering cause have been lost to time. Grandma, telling the story forty years later, recalled that it had been a \"one of those days\" for her. She'd been making dinner and had it nearly ready when she'd discovered that she'd forgotten to buy something that seemed vital at the time. So she'd stepped out to fetch it and one thing led to another until a ten minute trip turned into nearly two hours, accounting for car trouble.  \n>  \n>The only part of said trouble that she recalled clearly was a flat tire and only because Grandpa had to take the car to the shop to have the tire repaired later that week and he'd grumbled about how it was just another example of why women shouldn't be driving.\n\nI'd also remind people that this was a completely different era.  The argument was seventy years ago now.  My Grandparents were children of the Great Depression.  [This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/nyf37t/my_grandma_complied_with_her_husbands_request_for/h1jyzd5?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) was actually very accurate.  Watch some television from the forties and fifties and you'll get a better understanding of the dynamic.  My Grandparents loved each other dearly for their entire lives.  \n\nPiecing things together long after the fact, the entire family is pretty sure Grandma never liked to drive.  She was less than five feet tall, a tiny woman to be sure.  (Don't forget how cars were built in the forties and fifties!)  Grandpa had initially pushed her to get a license and he bought her a car.  Many women of that era never drove or only learned to drive very late in life, when cars got easier to handle.  \n\nThat being said, I do agree that this is hardly the healthiest way to end an argument.  However, that was never the intent of the story.",

As a joke my grandpa said \"My wife has never cooked me egg and bacon pie.\" Grandma was embarrassed and replied \"No, and I never will\". They were married for over 65 years and never once did she cook it. Grandpa did okay because it was a small country town and everyone knew each others business.

            "This reminds me of how I finally got a headlight for my Chevy pickup 2 winters ago. I hit a deer 6 weeks after buying my new truck, which isn\u2019t an uncommon thing in the rural Midwest. Apparently GM plants were also in the middle of a lengthy strike regarding their contract, so things were slow coming out of the plants. I was understanding at first. All I needed was one left headlight. 4 weeks went by, I made a call to customer service. Realized it was a call center that had nothing to do with GM, just a repository for complaints. After 6 weeks I resorted to what could only be described as harassment. I called the call center multiple times per day, to the point where I was put on a list where my call was no longer being answered. The frustrating part was that they couldn\u2019t even give me an estimated time of when to expect a headlight. \n\nSo I waited a few more weeks. At week 11 of not having a vehicle since my insurance was no longer paying for a rental replacement and GM would not offer a loaner, I got desperate. I started searching for GM employees on LinkedIn. I searched for anyone with \u201cparts\u201d or \u201caftermarket\u201d in their job title. The first guy I actually got through to worked in a distribution center and he gave me the scoop. Turns out, the headlights were not even impacted by the workers strike since they were completely manufactured in China. They have had problems getting them since the new redesign with the goofy, L shaped lights in 2017. They were just using the strike as an excuse to pass the buck. \n\nThe distribution center guy wasn\u2019t able to help since he had no headlight, but he did mention the department that would handle it. Back to LinkedIn I went and I quickly found a director level employee in the department and got ahold of him at the office. The guy ended up getting me a headlight in 3 days. GM strung me along for a total of 16 weeks and it ended up coming down to me contacting a corporate employee who probably took all of 15 minutes to find one and UPS it to my body shop. They needed up giving me a bunch of GM rewards points, which I am still not exactly sure I can use them for. I assume if I wanted some sweet GM emblazoned gear?  Might have to grow a goatee and get some white wrap sunglasses. I only bought the stupid truck to haul our boat.",

I emailed customer support and got a reply from an email which was a combination of initials and last name. They said they would fix it. They didn't... We repeated this for 5 weeks, with me dragging this mattress to the curb every week with the removal tag I had already paid for. So I googled the company, found a recent article which named their CEO. So my next email included the CEO as well as any other company exec I could find. I got a reply this time from one of the higher ups saying the issue would be fixed. Again, it wasn't... So the next email informed them that **their** mattress was sitting on the curb and that they were currently littering on my property. The mattress was gone the next day.",

Just like your case, it was an old lady that bought it when it was new construction in the late 70\u2019s, had a family and now kids had all moved out and husband had passed.

We\u2019d seen comps, exact same floorplans and size just updated and modern, for anywhere from 130k-160k. She rejected our offer flat. No counter. Our realtor said her realtor claimed to have pleaded with her to take the offer or even counter with something, anything to keep dialogue open because the house had been on the market so long. We ended up buying a house a few streets over for 158k that had already been updated and was turn key. Her house went into foreclosure and I think the bank sold it for something like $89k.

            "Twenty years ago when I sold my last house in California, I was very upfront about what it needed - the roof needed to be stripped off and replaced (the previous 'new roof' was laid over the existing, and my home inspector didn't mention it), it needed to be repiped (40 year old galvanized iron), etc...\n\nI am not one to screw someone over.  In fact one realtor complained to my agent that I  was trying to screw the deal by being honest about the condition of the house.\n\nSo, buyer comes around, we agree, closing date is set.  The day before closing, he shows up as I am packing up the last, with a crew of workmen...just getting int he way.  He asks if he can get his people started (move-in cleaning,etc)...I reluctantly agree.  While I am working, he's asking 'Oh,, are you taking that hose with you?  What about the wall unit in the garage?'  etc....  Yes to the hose, no to the built in wall unit.  The guy tells me he's a general contractor....\n\nSo, I move out, got my money, realtor hands over the keys the next day.\n\nThis was in the beginning of the summer in So Cal.   Come October and the first rain, he's all pissed off because the roof is leaking (exactly where I told him it would), and ruining hte drywall in the entry (exactly where I told him it would), and he's demanding I pay him something for repairs.  And my squirrel of an agent suggested I toss him a thousand or so.\n\nOh, HELL no.  \n\nI sent him a letter (via my attorney) that the house condition was disclosed to him prior to purchase, that his agent and my agent were witnesses, and at any rate he had the option of getting an independent home inspection, even though he claimed to be a 'general contractor'.  And after 4 months, he was on his own.\n\nNever heard from him again.  I suppose I can't blame him for trying, but sleeze like that does not sit well with me.",

        "selftext": "This happened years ago, when I was just starting to wake up to companies abusing employees, and employees taking it cause they are just thankful to have a job. \n\nI worked as a sales rep for a company in the technology field. Two way radios and alarms to be specific. Said company never had enough technical staff so I started training myself, and asked our lead technician to teach me to program and sort out minor problems, as well as do installations. Which was nice, since I was doing client visits 1-4 times a month, depending on how big the client was, and then I could sort out problems while I was on site. \n\nI ended up doing most of my client\u2019s installations, and the manager of the technical department was happy cause its less work for him, and he knows I do the jobs properly cause I want to keep my clients happy. Accordingly he had no problem signing my timesheets and overtime hours as well. OT was around 10-20 hours a month, so 2-5 hours a week. Which I think was a great deal considering I was doing the jobs of 2 people actually. \n\nIt went well for a few months until one day just before payday I get called in by the MD/owner. He had my timesheets for the past few months infront of him. He asked me what they were, and I gave him an explanation. He scratched my OT out, saying sales reps don\u2019t get paid OT. I tried to explain to him why I was claiming OT, and that he can ask the tech manager, but he was having none of it. I was pissed as it was a little extra money, but whatever. \n\nAbout a week later I was at a client about 160km(100mi) from the office. We had an big installation and was almost done except for programming and tidying up some cables. I checked the time, and told the apprentice technician to pack up. He was like but we are not done with the job. I told him I don\u2019t care, I don\u2019t get paid OT, its 2pm and its still a 2 hour drive back to the office. We packed up, client comes out and I gave him the explanation, saying we will be back the following morning(to finish what was effectively 30-45min of work)\n\nClient wasn\u2019t happy, but understands that I don\u2019t get paid to work late. I was on the road about 15min when my phone rings. It was the owner(same one that said I don\u2019t get paid OT) he asked what was I doing and why I wasn\u2019t finishing the job, as the client was not happy. I told him the explanation above, and then I said that he said I don\u2019t get paid overtime, so I\u2019m not working late, and will drive back to finish tomorrow. Silence for about 5 seconds as I assume he realised I was following his express instructions, and there was nothing he could do. \n\nHe told me to go back and finish the job and we can talk about it later. I told him no, unless he pays me OT. He says he will, I tell him to put it in an email before I will turn back. I could hear him go red in the face, he said he will send it now. I switched on my laptop, connected my dongle(this was still before smart phones and email on out phones). A few minutes later the email came through, We turned around and finished the job. I got paid my overtime, and never again was there a query over my timesheets or hours booked. I was the only rep out of 5 that got paid overtime.\n\n\nEdit for more info: This has blown up to where I can\u2019t answer all the questions or reply to all the comments. Thanks for the awards and wholesome replies. Of I don\u2019t reply to your comment, nothing personal, I will try reply to as many I can in between work. I will answer some common questions on here for clarity:\n\n1. This happened in South Africa. The labour board there is not very efficient, especially if it comes to smaller companies. Also, this employer had extensive government contracts, and knew a lot of people personally. So even reporting him would not have helped much. And if the do investigate, its pretty easy to get the investigation squashed with a bribe. \n\n2. My contract stipulated I was not entitled to OT. I negotiated OT with the technical manager as it would be mutually beneficial for both him and me if I did tech work as well, and ultimately the company would save money as well so he agreed to it without any objections. \n\n3. The OT did not amount to much every months as it was based on basic salary which was low. Commission made up 3/4 of my take home pay, excl allowances. So it wasn\u2019t much about the money, more about the principle. \n\n4. Other sales reps refused to do tech work as they said that was not why they were appointed. The other guys also were on the wrong side of 40 and in shape. If you can call round a shape. I was in my early 20s and wanted to get ahead so I did extra to prove myself. \n\n5. The OT that he scratched put did not get paid. At least not to his knowing. I added extra hours over the next 2 months to make up for that, so I did get paid eventually. \n\n6. This happened in \u201808, so before smartphones and voice recording etc. My work phone was a Nokia that had no internet ability. I could call and text. Don\u2019t think it even had a camera. We connected to the internet on our laptops via a dongle. It is a device that takes a sim card, plugs into the USB port and then connects to the cell network. Almost like dialup internet. It even made a similar sound. My laptop did not even have wifi. If I wanted to connect at the office I had to plug in the LAN cable.",

            "Back in the early '00s, a mid-sized German company a friend of mine worked at were looking to switch their old ERP system to SAP. Since that kind of switch can be majorly disruptive to a company's processes, they were preparing as much as possible. That included designating one guy as project manager, giving him a team, even sending him on lots of seminars at SAP (the company - you pay through the nose for those seminars).\n\nFrom all accounts, the guy was good, did an excellent job organizing things, but it was obviously a lot of work, and he was accruing OT hours like there was no tomorrow. Unfortunately, the company had a policy of not paying out OT, only letting you take time off instead. But he'd never be allowed to take off that much time (would've amounted to at least a couple of months), so he requested an exception be made and his OT hours be paid out.\n\nThe company refused, so he quit. Gave his notice three months before the \"Go Live\" date of the new system (Germany has very long notice periods). He apparently left excellent notes, so it wasn't as much of a catastrophe as it could've been, but the whole thing still cost them a lot more than that overtime payout would have.",

            "A few years ago I was back door on nightsift for a large supermarket. During the night you receive deliveries of bread, milk, newspapers from third parties. While I am not unloading deliveries I am on the shop floor filling shelves. I can't hear the backdoor bell while on the shopfloor but it's OK since each night I take a managers internal mobile, which the drivers phone as they arrive.  \nOne night we are given a spot check by security. I am asked what was in my pockets. I replied keys and mobile. Security then told me I was not allowed to have a mobile or any keys except locker key. I tried to tell him that it was a store phone and that the keys included the forklift key but he would not let me finish, interrupting with 'no exceptions'. So I returned the phone to the office and the forklift key to my locker. The bread and milk drivers would only wait 15 mins to be let in before leaving, they would come back at the end of their run but that was well after the end of my shift. In the morning the store manager was a little upset that there was no bread, very little milk and none of the bulk stock that was kept on the racking was worked. I explained that security wouldn't listen. \nThe security guard must have got in trouble as he tried to get me fired over a silly mistake I made while shopping in the store, which I immediately corrected when informed.",
            "My current job the new PM tried to implement a no cell phone for anyone policy.  Now I get not having a cell phone on the floor if youre working production.  They can be very distracting.  I text the PM multiple times a day when I need answers to things.  Not to mention some of the machinery we need to call the vendors and have them check on parts/get drawings/help troubleshoot.  All things I need my phone for.\n\n\n\nI crap you negative, I tried to explain that dynamic and was shot down.  I knew what happened next was going to happen, I just didn't think it would be THIS quick.  So I didnt fight it and went back to work.\n\n\nMaybe an hour later one of the machines goes down and we start trying to figure out why.  PM comes out looking for an update and asks 'did anyone call Dude Guy at Company yet?'.  It was a very quiet 10 seconds before I said '...... with what?'\n\n\nThe narrowing of the eyes was enough acknowledgement as I was going to get so I pulled my phone out my pocket and got it figured out.  The no cell phone policy still stands but its yet to be enforced.",
            "I work at a gas station, we just got a new policy that we can't do safe drops of more than $100. So now I drop my money anytime I'm prompted to, even if there's customers and it's busy. Thought about only doing $99 drops...",
            "I am puzzled why your boss didn't give you the new job title of \"shift manager\" on the spot",
            "Yep, that company sure showed you whos in charge.  \"Take your two weeks paid vacation and get out!\"\n\nWith the high number of short-sighted managers out there, how does capitalism even work?",

            "I will never again work for a company with a no phone policy. \n\nI understand that jobs are places where we go to work, but a blanket 'no phone rule' is essentially treating me like a child. \n\nIf an employee cannot stay off their phone then discipline them and them alone. I have too many important things going on in my life and may need to glance at my phone very few hours. \n\nExceptions: jobs where there are strict security protocols and procedures. Stuff like gov work or proprietary IP's/RnD. That gets a pass as it's not a personal attack against the employees it's to satisfy some requirement to do the work they do. That's just CMMC type stuff, really.",

            "Wow. All of that because they were salty that you didn't have a stupid *word in your job title* that you would have had if you'd been in their org anyway?\n\nI hope their beancounters ripped them a fucking new one for that.",

            "The war on phones is so stupid. I get not letting people have them where they can be a legit safety hazard or legal issue. But I\u2019m a fuckin adult. I have a family.

I\u2019m not \u201casking permission\u201d to respond to my while telling me she was in a car wreck, or telling my kid to call my workplace\u2019s phone and just hope they take them seriously if there\u2019s an emergency.\n\nLet people keep them on their person unless there\u2019s literally no other option. Have a policy about usage, but if you expect me to answer your calls when I\u2019m off the clock, you better damn sure expect me to answer my wife when she calls instead of texts.",
            "Wait, so you weren't even a part of their company, and they tried to enforce a rule that didn't directly affect them on an employee that doesn't technically work for them? And the ego was so fragile that they temper tantrumed out of a contract before the work was even done? How do these places even stay in business?",

            "I have seen things like this happen several times. I've often thought of starting to round up these specific stories for a composium titled \"When Policies Defeat Common Sense\" or something along those lines. \"Oh, you aren't titled as a manager? Well clearly you aren't important. Take your peons and leave because we aren't changing our policy due to your lack of a title.\" Idiots of the world abound....",

I work for the nutrition warehouse so we get pallets of food from our distributor and then we distribute them to the different kitchens and cafeterias on different locations around campus. Sometimes we have to put away items for the main hospital, the kitchen has a no phone policy, and the kitchen supervisors try to enforce that on us. The issue is we are a team of 6 with one supervisor and his direct boss is the is the executive in charge of the entire nutrition department. We need to stay in constant contact with each other to coordinate deliveries and pick ups. So we end up laughing in all the kitchen supervisors face. \u201cWe have a job to do and you are slowing up production\u201d, something my boss told them.",
            "That\u2019s not malicious or compliance.  It is, however, a really good story about management idiocy.",
            "This sounds more like a contract issue? Weird story anyways. Normally you cannot just \"stop working\", can you? You undertook the contract and will pay some penalty if you don't deliver. They don't have to fire you at their loss.\n\nSo this is possible only if that rule about phones wasn't even remotely in the contract. Then they impeded your work and they're at fault. But once they see that, wouldn't they just rescind the orders? They know they can't enforce their pettiness, why lose 100ks of $$ too?\n\nThe only reason to stick to it is if that rule wasn't pettiness but something like security protocols which are required. But then their problem is not writing it in the contract.",
