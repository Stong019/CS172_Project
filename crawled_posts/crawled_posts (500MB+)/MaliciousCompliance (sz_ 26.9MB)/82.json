        "selftext": "Not me, but my father-in-law's story.\n\nIn the 1970s (before email and faxes), my father-in-law, Carl, worked as a trust agent for a bank in the Midwest, which is on Eastern time (ET). He handled trusts and estates for bank customers, including one older lady. Her son-in-law, Brewton, lived in California, which is on Pacific time (PT), three hours behind Carl, and managed his mother-in-law's estate on her behalf.\n\nBrewton used to call Carl with questions, which is not a problem. Except Brewton would call Carl at home at 8 p.m. ET, expecting him to answer questions. Carl would be at home, eating dinner or spending time with his family, so Brewton's calls were unwelcome.\n\nCarl would explain the time difference and said that Brewton should call before 5 p.m. ET, not PT. But Brewton always ignored Carl's requests, and demanded that Carl call him back \"first thing in the morning.\"\n\nCarl was nice and would wait until 11 a.m. ET to give Brewton time to get settled in his own office. Until he decided he'd had enough.\n\nThe day after Brewton's latest call, Carl went to his office extra early, got the information, and then promptly at 8:00 a.m., Carl called Brewton's house.\n\nA sleepy Brewton answered the phone and croaked, \"Hello?\"\n\n\"Good morning, Brewton!\" Carl all but hollered into the phone.\n\n\"What time is it?\" Brewton groaned.\n\n\"It's 8:00,\" Carl said.\n\n\"But it's 5:00 in the morning here.\"\n\n\"Huh, so it is. I guess there's a three-hour time difference. But you said you wanted these answers first thing in the morning, and it's 8:00 here, so I thought I'd give you a call.\"\n\nBrewton never called past 5:00 p.m. again.",

            "Many years ago I worked nights and my roommate worked days. I'd get home about 7am and go to bed as she was leaving for work. For some reason her boyfriend liked to call about 9am and wake me up to ask me to relay a message to my roommate when she got home. (This was way before answering machines). No matter how often I asked him not to or had her tell him not to call and wake me up, at least once or twice a week he'd call.\n\nOne night I got home early...around 2am. Could not shake that wild hair out my ass, so at 3am I called his apartment. *His* roommate answered. His roommate was a great big boy. Not fat just BIG.\n\nI explained to Bob that Jeff kept calling me and waking me up and that starting that day every time Jeff called and woke me up at 9am, BOB could look forward to me calling and waking BOB up at 3am. Bob said he'd take care of it.\n\nJeff never called me and woke me up again.",

On numerous occasions he would mention how the culture in Denver was too relaxed. The more I've thought on it, the more I'm convinced it was mostly due to the time zone difference. He hated that we weren't online the same time they were and would complain that he had to wait for someone. He saw it as us not working as hard as people from the East Coast.\n\nTo top it off, he declared that our open seat in the West Coast was moving to Charlotte and that left me, the manager, as the only coverage for the West Coast past 2pm. Then when I left, they moved my position to Charlotte leaving zero coverage for any other time zones. It was all \"on-call\" after that.\n\nThat boss made it about 6 months after letting me go before getting terminated for being a bully.",

        "selftext": "This isn't my story, but the story of a friend of mine I'm going to call Steve.\n\nHe ownes a landscaping business and has several employees. They work hard and get along really well. Steve pays them for their work done by the yard, not by the hour, in addition to buying his workers two meals a day.\n\nSteve hired a guy named Jim, who isn't a bad worker at all. Jim is just a little slow on the uptake sometimes.\n\nJim decided to start a fuss. \"I don't like that we're getting paid by the yard,\" he told Steve one day. \"I wanna be paid by the hour.\" Steve explained to Jim that, when you break it down, being paid by the yard comes out to over $10 an hour (about $22 in today's money, this was back in the 80's)--or more, depending on how many yards get done--and his hourly workers only make minimum wage. Steve further explained that the paid-by-the-yard workers get perks like meals, and operate on a true merit-pay because the more they get done, the more they get paid.\n\nJim was adamant, though, so Steve agreed. \n\n**Day 1**\n\nJim showed up, ready and raring to go. He decided, it appeared, to prove to Steve that being hourly doesn't mean he'll slack off! Like I said, Jim is a good guy and not a bad worker; he has a good work ethic and a big sense of pride. A couple yards got done, and it's lunchtime. Steve grabs everyone's order and asks Jim if he is going to buy anything.\n\nJim looked confused. \"What do you mean?\"\n\nSteve re-explained. \"If you're going hourly, I can't cover your meals anymore. You'll have to buy your own lunch.\"\n\nJim grumbled but ordered something small, and after lunch they all got back to work.\n\n**Day 2**\n\nThe crew was down two guys. Jim was in a good mood, maybe out of schadenfreude, because less guys on the crew meant less yards done--but Jim was going to make the same amount either way!\n\nWith a little bit of a smug attitude, Jim got ready for work, but when he looked at the job list for the day he looked taken aback. Steve had rearranged the yards for the week so that, for this particular day, they would be working on their smallest-yard clients. That way, the workers would get paid around the same amount they normally would if they had a full crew. \n\nJim hadn't noticed that Steve did this anytime he had a smaller crew: both because it guaranteed his guys were making over the legally-required minimum for per-part work, and because it kept their pay consistent.\n\n**Day 3**\n\nThey got a lot of yards done this day. In fact, they worked really well together that day, and really dug their heels in to get the last few yards on the schedule done. They'd taken about two hours less than expected, so everybody was able to head home early. \n\nJim asked if he could maybe go take on another yard or two himself, since if everyone got off early, he wouldn't be paid any more. Steve understood, and sent Jim out to get some hedges done, which took a couple hours because he was doing it by himself. But that was okay, because that was a couple extra hours of pay, and Steve was nothing if not fair.\n\n**Day 4**\n\nJim showed up to work a little late, because the extra three hours of hedge-trimming had left him more exhausted than expected. Steve was placing an order for breakfast as he showed up, and he just stood there for a few minutes as he watched Steve writing down orders for bacon and eggs and pancakes. Finally Steve stopped at Jim. Steve didn't say anything about Jim's tardiness; it was clear Jim had worked hard the previous night.\n\n\"You buying anything, Jim?\"\n\nJim swallowed hard. \"No, sir.\"\n\n\"It'll be mighty hard to work on an empty stomach, Jim.\"\n\nJim nodded. \"Yes sir, I know. I...\" I mentioned how much pride Jim had, and he really couldn't buck up enough to admit he had miscalculated. He knew he was wrong, but he was prepared to suffer.\n\nSteve, however, was a good dude. He recognized where Jim had erred, and didn't lord it over him. He made it plain and simple: \"I'll just put you down for some eggs and bacon, then.\" And with an understanding and appreciative look, Jim started packing the truck for the morning.\n\n~\n\nThey never really discussed moving back to per-yard rate, but Steve was nothing if not fair. Jim got his next paycheck to find that he had been paid per-yard as if they hadn't changed his rate at all. This meant not only did he end up with the better rate, but he even got some extra in his paycheck for the three yards worth of hedges he had done by himself. \n\nJim stuck around a long time, and ended up managing the crew after a while. He tells people that if you treat your employees right, they'll stick around. And that's worth more than a handful of pinched pennies.\n\n~~\n\nEdit: this was the mid-80's. $10/hr then was about $22/hr today.",

We had a woman retire 3 months ago, they had me start doing her work along with mine (insurance). I was happy to help, they are very good to me. After the first month I got a $3000 bonus. I was shocked and didn't expect that. Then the 2nd month another $3000 bonus. And then this 3rd month, another $3000. Most places would just make you pick up the slack.

            "Really the difference here is Steve makes all sorts of concessions for his per yard guys, but does not for the hourly guy.   \n\n\nFor instance you have 10 yards that day estimated to take 10 hrs...but you get them done in 8 hrs..naturally the per yard guys go home with a full wallet, but the per hour guy needs a concession, but only a moral one...the boss only need acknowledge the work done and money earned is the same let the guy go home early  whilst  giving him full pay...Moral of the story is either way can work as long as your not a stupid rigid prick. I am glad in the end both came out happy, but truly nothing gleaned here.   \n\n\nSame can be said for the fact the boss rearranges the calendar for the small, per yard crew..it's a concession he makes so that his method works that day, what about day 5 is that the day they work on the mansion lawn and are able to get one done...you see? Ohh wait I bet there some form of concessions made for the per yard people when that happens too....   \n\n\nMaybe I missed the part where its explained meals cant be bought for the hourly guy? Isnt that a perk/concession that is external to the \" per yard/per hour\" dynamic being explored, except for that Steve envisions that it must be that way?",

            "I used to work a job that paid by the job. Except it was kind of a screw job on me, rather than a benefit by my employer. On the one hand, it meant he paid me a higher percentage for an install job than I'd get if I were hourly. Which meant phenomenal paychecks when there were install jobs out the ass. On the other hand, it meant when I was doing service calls and non-piece rate work, I was getting paid below industry standard. In the end, it all balanced out to an industry standard payscale, though, for most of each of the years I worked there.\n\nWe installed geothermal loops. Paying the loop guys a piece rate made more sense. It encouraged faster work. And, it generally took a relatively similar time to put in a loop of X feet long each time, with some variable for soil quality/type, weather around the install, etc. \n\nBut I installed the inside pipes. Which had absolutely no consistency to the length of the loop field. The best I did was a ten ton loop (1000 feet of pipe in the ground), that took me two and a half hours from start to finish. Paid me something like 20+ hours. \n\nThe worst, I did a three ton (300') where I was literally calling my boss to ask if the fact we had more pipe inside was an issue that took almost two days because of the length and complexity. \n\n",

I appreciate also to some of the readers who applauded me to do this to a power tripping cops. While it is highly effective, I don't condone on doing it unless it's the last resort, like in my situation. I actually found most cops are extremely friendly and helpful to drivers. In fact, I got pulled over before for speeding 5 above limit on a downhill. The cop is extremely understanding, waived my ticket, & also gave me tips on the load that I carry at that time, which is a completely new information for me. The cop actually went beyond extra miles to educate me. I still have faith in humanity.\n\nEdit: For those who asked \"did I do anything on my log book during laughter?\" you all have asked the most important question, bravo. I did set it as \"Off Duty\" but did not put comment on it. I guess, in the eyes of my dispatch, it looks like I'm doing 1 minute of silence. I did get questioned by my dispatch and after thorough explaining, he too, did a 1 minute of silence.\n\nThis malicious compliance has brought to you by my trip from Chicago, IL to Los Angeles, CA.\n\nBackground: I'm an over the road truck driver and most of the time, it's more convenient for me to do my \"business\" on the highway shoulder. I don't have to drive around & around just to park to use the restroom. Just a quick 30 second emergency stop, do my business (either on the side of the road or empty bottles that I'm saving up [gotta do what you gotta do when you're on the road]), then off driving again. I'm sure I'm not the only over the road truck driver who have done these, it's very common.\n\nSide note: According to FMCSA, by law, we have to carry log books to calculate our driving & on duty time. This is relevant to the story.\n\nOn to the story:\n\nThis happened just a few hours ago somewhere in I-40 WB in New Mexico. I was suddenly in need to relieve myself badly, so as usual, I pulled over to a clean, wide highway shoulder, then I put my log book to \"Off Duty\".\n\nNote: this isn't my first time today doing my business.\n\nI have a habit of being very meticulous with my driving time. Which means, when I'm not doing anything, even for 30 seconds, I put my time in off duty. I tried to save as much driving time as possible, those multiple 30 seconds can add up to a lot to avoid doing 34 hours reset too soon.\n\nI looked at the passenger side window & sees multiple cars passing by. Turns out, there's a road where cars drive by on the side of the highway. Doing my business on the highway shoulder, nope! Instead, I did the alternate route, do it in a bottle, seal it, and stow it for trash later.\n\nJust as I finish doing my business, I heard a knock on my passenger door. Very weird, because this is at the highway shoulder, where no one should randomly be walking around. I stow away the bottle and go look who it is and it's a cop. I was thinking, crap, this isn't happening.\n\nI switched my log book to \"On Duty - Inspection\" and go answer the cop. Before I could say anything, the cop asked me to see my log book (it's part of their job to check whether we comply to the rules or not) so I show it to him. The graph looks like a heart monitor, as I was relieving myself probably 4 or 5 times per day (tiny bladder problem).\n\nThe cop questioned why I was off duty for 30 seconds to 1 minute every 2-3 hours almost everyday (electronic log book can be backtracked up to 14 days). I explained to him that I have to relieve myself every 2-3 hours, give or take. The cop didn't believe me and assume that my truck had a problem, that's why I have to stop every 2-3 hours. I repeated myself about my bladder issue but the cop still didn't believe me. Instead, he said:\n\n-Cop: Unless you have proof that you're actually relieving yourself, I'm afraid I have to give you a ticket for false usage of log book.\n\nCue malicious compliance.\n\nI told the cop to wait a moment and went back inside my cabin. I grabbed every single bottle of urine that I've been collecting today and the previous day (I haven't had the chance to throw it away), put it in a plastic bag, and for extra measure, grabbed the newest one out of the plastic bag (it was still warm). I showed the whole bag to the cop, plus the warm bottle, told him it's the newest one I just did a few seconds ago, and asked if he would like to hold it for further inspection.\n\nThe cop had the mixed look of disgust & horror. He was literally gagging, so I put back the evidence back inside my truck so he can recover. Then the cop says:\n\n\"I was expecting doctor's note or something like that. What you showed me was disgusting!\"\n\n-Me: But you asked for proof that I was, in fact, relieving myself.\n\nI was holding back my laughter so hard that my cheeks started to hurt. Then he gave me back my log book and told me to have a good day, then drives off. Have a good day, indeed!\n\nI took an extra 1 minute on the shoulder to laugh until I'm satisfied, then I'm off to drive again.",

Fine is \u20ac250,- (about $300,-) and is really enforced. It's especially annoying for truck drivers. Most are not allowed to drive in Germany on sundays and official holidays between midnight and 10 pm, so truck drivers try to stop on parking places as closely to the German border as possible, but there aren't enough of those. In the past, some would park on the highway shoulders. I believe that's one of the reasons the fine is so high (the other one is that this fine is also used for people who drive on the highway shoulder to avoid a traffic jam).",

You can fill one while you're emptying another, and then dump it somewhere responsible, throw it out, and swap to a newly emptied one. Gatorade bottles work alright, too, but less capacity.\n\nIt takes a little practice, but it's the superior method because stopping on the shoulder is a bad idea.

        "selftext": "Hi i drive charter tour coaches for a living, our industry is VERY heavily regulated, as it should be as we carry the most valuable of cargo, your family/kids/relatives, and if I fall asleep and hit your car, well you can work it out.   Now one of the rules is after a working day a minimum of time in complete rest must be given undisturbed...by law, this time can be reduced but only 3 times a work period (between 2 weekly rest periods... basically between your days off).  Another interesting rule is, by law, if your rest is disturbed, your rest must restart as though you have had no rest..this will be important later.\n\nIt sounds confusing, but I can have only 9hrs rest 3 times a week and the rest must be 11hrs, minimum, less than 11 complete hours rest period and it's treated like I had 9hrs only...even if it's 10hrs 59 mins.  Because of this most tour companies keep rest periods to 11hrs minimum, looking on the reduced rest as a \"just in case\" we get held up and get finished late etc, so we can start on time the next day and stick to the itinerary.\n\nNow we worked with one tour company, I'll call them mega-cheap tours, and their tour leaders like to squeeze every last bit of driving out of their tour hires, excursions all day to some out of the way flea pit, as long as the tour leader gets a kick-back, travel to hotel, then a dinner transfer and back to the hotel at night (none of it as the itinerary stated).  Most good companies eat close or in their hotel to allow the driver to rest, but for these guys, cheapest was best, and if that meant an hour there and an hour back at night...so be it, screw the driver, we are paying for him.  The reason for this is the tour leader got a kick back if they ate at the tour leaders \"favorite\" spot, and they had one in every overnight stop.   I had spoken to my traffic manager about how these guys just ignored the itinerary, and was told \"just do what they say, they are the customer\".\n\nNow I was working with one tour leader we will call him Wan, well known for not only working you to death but also stiffing you on your gratuities (he collected them from the passengers on the last day as we traveled to the airport  to \"help you\", sat behind you then placed them into an envelope,  an envelope you knew was light from experience). It's the last day of the tour, tomorrow I get rid of them all at the airport, and good riddance I thought, as the passengers are in an excursion, Wan comes to the coach.\n\n\"We need to go here for dinner tonight\" (passes me the address)\n\nI looks at the satnav\n\n\"wan that's 1hr 15mins away from our hotel tonight, you lot will be eating for 2 hours then an 1hr 15 back, then I need to shut down the coach and park it, i wont be finished until about 11pm\"\n\nHe looks at me \"i know the rules, you only need 9hrs rest, we will leave at 8am, plenty of time for a 2pm flight (international)!!\".\n\nHe was right of course, but remember that 3 times a week thing...he had already had me on short rest 3 times this trip owing to dinner transfers, not 9hrs but 10hrs something each time (this guy always pushed it to the max), it was at this point malicious compliance kicked in,\n\n\"Your right, i can work after 9hrs\"\n\nI changed the subject quickly as he smiled at me thinking he had screwed me over. Well the dinner transfer was worse than I thought, heavy traffic getting there meant I was late, which meant they started eating late, which of course meant they came back late, by the time i parked at the hotel it was closer to midnight.  I knew what was coming in the morning so phoned my 24hr traffic department, as I expected I was told under NO circumstances was i to break the law and run without my legal rest (massive fines for the company and for me if I did).   Normally I set 2 alarms when I'm on reduced rest as, to be honest, it takes it toll, and i need them to get up, but tonight....I set nothing, and took my hotel phone off the hook.\n\nI went to bed, I woke up to thumping on my hotel door there was the hotel manager and a very irate Wan\n\n\"You stupid driver, it's 8am, everyone is outside, checked out, with luggage, and you've slept in, get dressed and get the coach\"\n\nI smiled \"Wan, I'm on my legal break, we got back nearly at midnight so can't start to nearly 9, but besides, I've worked 3 times after reduced rest this trip and can't go anywhere until 11hrs undisturbed rest,  also you've just disturbed my rest as this gentleman can confirm (I was friendly with the hotel staff, they use the same hotels every trip and the staff hated Wens trips, as he never tipped..or rather his guests did through his suggestion, but he collected it to \"hand in\"), which means by law my rest period re-sets and starts again, but you know this, as you know the rules right?..., so see you at 7pm tonight..I'm cool for a late check out right? (I said to the manger who was nodding enthusiastically, knowing what I'd just done)\"\n\nWan's eyes nearly bulged out of his head...which was funny, \"Wait, what do you mean, we, we, need to get a 2pm flight\"\n\n\"I know\" i said \"Best start organizing taxi's for the 40 odd people out there, and next trip don't stitch up your driver\" As i shut the door on them both.\n\nI knew what was about to happen, within 5 minutes my own phone rang, the traffic manager, asking what time I finished the night before, then saying you can start at 9, until I pointed out the 3 late finishes...silence..then\n\n\"Well your right, but don't expect to be doing anymore of this companies tours, they will request we never send you\"\n\nI asked if he wanted me to drive without legal rest...I knew he wouldn't dare say yes, as i could be recording it.\n\n\"No you must take legal rest, this is the tour leaders problem, of his making if he had stuck to the itinerary's hours everything would be fine, just do me a favor and start at 11am...not 7pm, we need the coach back here tonight\"\n\nI knew when to not push it any further, and said i would be happy to start at 11am, and would start getting ready now and go down for breakfast.  An hour later I went down and saw Wan surrounded by angry passengers screaming at him with a phone to his ear, he saw me and came over\n\n\"Mr driver, please, i nor my company can get a coach to hire and it's 40 miles to the airport and our flight leaves in just over 4hrs, my company are mad I've not left you legal rest, and blaming me..please help me\"\n\nI couldn't resist\n\n\"Wan, if you use all those gratuities you have stolen from me and everyone else over the years, you will be able to afford to hire 10 taxis no problem and make the flight, but I would be quick about it, otherwise you might get stuck with 40 odd replacement flights as well as taxis\"\n\nWan gulped, eye bugle, and went white..all in one..it was funny to watch, and ran to reception asking for 10 taxis, what was funnier was when the taxi's showed up they said he needed another 4 or 5 just for the luggage (Each person had 2 massive suitcases), i just sat watching the show through the window eating my breakfast and drinking my coffee.  The staff thought I was a hero, and all smirked and looked on from their respective posts, i knew after this, no tips from the passengers would change hands and the cost of those taxis would hit his current fiddle bankroll hard (or so i hoped).\n\nMy boss was right, i never have nor never will do this companies tours again, it was quickly passed back I was not wanted, but Wan has never been back leading this companies tours either, my ex-colleagues (I knew my cards are marked as \"trouble\", and found another job with another charter company VERY easily) have told me that now the tour leaders are told by their head office to NEVER give the drivers less than 11hrs off EVERY night and factor this into any dinner transfers, if it can't be accommodated then no dinner transfer, and NO off itinerary excursions...period,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Got own back on tour leader using malicious compliance over-working me and stealing my tips\n\nEdit: Thanks for the Gold, my first ever\n\nEdit 2: platinum wow, thanks, and the silvers\n\nEdit 3: in the comments it has been stated I set him up and it was a dick move, well i saw it as his greed for a kick back set himself up...the itinerary said 9pm finish, this guy did this to me all the time.   He was supposed to (as much as me) be monitoring my hours to ensure the tour stayed legal, yes I could have pointed out the night before I needed 11hrs, but sometimes you just have had enough...so I complied and did as I was told.     As for possibly harming the passengers, making them miss their flight home, all this happened at 8am, 6hrs before their flight, if he had got taxi's then, which was what I wanted,  him to pay out money he wouldn't get back  (and he had the money on him plus to pay for those) they would have been at the airport before the coach would have got them there, no one was more surprised than me when I came down and they are all still there. If they HAD missed their flights, I assure you the tour company would have rebooked everyone on the next available plane...then came after my blood.\n\nAlso folks have got confused about the disturbed rest, why I didn't sit until 7pm, by the letter of the law I could claim this, and if wan had pushed it I would have, but I'm brave, not stupid, if the guy paying your wages says do him a favour and start at 11am after your first legal rest period...I start at 11am.",

We were always filling stock in the aisles and weren't allowed to \"just stay at the register\". \n\nManagement decided that the longest any customer should have to wait was 15 seconds before starting check out. As I always do when given tasks that contradict each other, I ask \"hey, what gets priority - getting our stock out or ensuring this check out happens within 15 seconds?\" They confirmed that it was the customer service and that it was a top priority.\n\nPerfect.\n\nI had my cart of stock and I was in charge of the register. My cart was about 7 seconds of walking time away from where I could view the register. So I literally walked for 7 seconds, checked, walked back for 7 seconds, which left me with a single second to do stock.\n\nNormally you can get a cart of stock out in about 30 minutes - my cart was still quite full after about 4 hours. Management came by and saw me walking back and forth \"barely doing any work\". I reminded her that what I was doing was top priority, and since I wasn't allowed to stay at the register, that I was accomplishing both my tasks in the most efficient way possible.\n\nThe next day the 15 second rule had been abolished.",

            "\"Why are managers so bad at problem solving?\" is my real question.\n\nLike okay. You have customers waiting too long because your staff is all spread out over the store and nobody is at a register. You only have 2-3 staff to work with, but you want to cut wait times. You could do it stupid like in OPs story and just say \"get back to the register faster\", but it doesn't actually solve anything.\n\nSo how about this: one person is on register watching duty. Their stock cart should be filled with items that are within view of the register only. If there's restocking, part of their job is to check the other restocking carts and collect the items on the endcaps/shelves/whatever that have view to the register area.\n\nThey're going to cover a much smaller chunk of the store, but will also do the bulk of checkouts so it's all fair in the end. Maybe swap partway thru each shift to give the register guardian a mental break.\n\nIt's a little more work for the manager to get it organized, but then the problem is actually solved.\n\nEDIT: I'm aware of bells. I find them an insulting way to call someone and would use them as a last resort if I was managing a team in this situation. Seem like they'd be terrible for morale.",

In my league they had a 1000, 2000 or 5000 parcel target contract. I went with the 2k one. At the end of year 1 there would be an evaluation, and they said they would be very flexible and reasonable because their priority is \"to help grow my business\". I actually had that in writing.\n\nFor any parcel I had sent through them beyond the 2k target I'd get a 50% refund of the difference between the 2k and 5k rate (e.g. 2k rate is 3,5 euro/parcel and 5k rate is 3 euro/parcel, they would refund me 0,25 euro back for each parcel above my 2k goal).\n\nOn the other hand, for each parcel I was short at the end of the year of the 2k target, they would charge me double the difference between the 2k and the 5k rate, on top of a flat rate penalty fee (so basically 1 euro per parcel I was short in the above example + penalty).\n\nEnd of  year 1 of my contract is 2 weeks away and I'm sitting at 1850 parcels. Thinking that 92,5% of my target is pretty good for year one, I gave them a call to talk about the extra charges and the penalty, and see if I could get the 5k rate for the next year as I was seeing / expecting strong growth. In the end it was their priority to help grow my business, and they are very flexible and reasonable.\n\nNo sir! They were dead set on me paying the penalty, charge me extra for the 150 parcels and on top of that they would set me back to the more expensive 1k target rate for the next year. Tried to escalate it but to no avail. So far for 'help growing my business and being very flexible and reasonable'.\n\nIn comes malicious compliance: I did the math and paying the penalty + extra charges was nearly double of what it would cost me to reach my target if I would just pay for 150 extra parcels out of my own pocket.\n\nI bought 150 bubble wrap envelopes dirt cheap, printed 150x stickers with my own address, put those on each envelope, drove to the mail office and dropped off 150 empty envelopes. Next morning the mail man arrives at my door with a grin on his face (he is a cool guy) and a stash of envelopes, wondering wtf I am up to.\n\nLater that day I called them to let them know I had reached my target and that I would not renew my contract. I signed with a competitor for about the same price per parcel, no strings attached  and did 17k parcels in year 2, which amounts to \\~50k euro in business they missed out on.",

Except when I dont... yesterday I took care of a 4 year old girl,   a 2 year old boy, and a 5 month old boy. \n\nI was there yesterday and I know kids at this age have enough energy to make the world stop spinning and they tend to not listen... but damn these kids were TERRIBLE. No control of themselves at all. There was paint on my dress, I was hit by glass cups and plates were thrown at me. Glasses covered in jelly. Kids were purposefully coughing in my face and I had some spit on me (I think they were sick too ugh)  needless to say my first thought was a shower and a hot meal. \n\nI lost my cool and I had to issue timeouts and separate the kids when they fought. Cleaned messes. Shield the infant. Take toys and TV away from kids and not allow them to choose movies. I record these so the parent know what happened.\n\nI always try to keep a positive outlook every day. Smiling and being super nice to everyone and ask how they are. I do this, and the mom told me when I first step in her house, was, \"do NOT parent MY kids. YOURE NOT THEIR MOM!!\". I was taken aback and wanted to be petty. So I said \"aight\". Mom left to go to work and I am currently letting the kids go ham in the house. There's a mess everywhere and I'm not even being bothered. Hit me with a glass? I hope it breaks and MOM can pay my medical bills.\n\nThe 5 month old is really the one I'm caring for at this point and I'm making sure he's safe. He's being cute af right now.\n\nI have yet to be done with my shift as I type this. The house looks horrid, there's a red spot on me from a kid hitting me, I am covered on coughs and paint and markers (thank the gods for washable shit). I'm not parenting them.\n\nI hope the mom enjoys the mess when she comes home.\n\nEdit 1: yall are amazing! Thank you for the awards! And the comments are making me ugly laugh!! I will absolutely be posting an update when I get home.\n\n--UPDATE--\n\nmom came home and was APALLED at the house. The cut on my hand (from me being stupid on thanksgiving) was torn back open because of kids and it needs to be patched. My hair is covered in peanut butter. My leather shoes will need to be cleaned and polished. Theres literal shit on the walls! And so, so,, so much more that happened. And I put the baby to sleep and walked out. Mom screamed she's gonna get me fired. I said nothing. She also followed me to my car saying she will pay for the damage to her home and the maid service. I'm not worried tbh\n\nShes being blacklisted by me. Never again am I going back. I need to take a nap and a shower and I need some mac n cheese lol\n\nUpdate 2: was on the phone with the agency and the mom. The family's contract is being voided and I'm being paid more than the extra money they were giving me. Plus the mom will pay for my medical bill to patch up my hand, cleaning my clothes, and clean my glasses\n\n Edit 2: some of you are concerned about the coughing. I had a rapid test done today while the doc was fixing my hand. I'm negative! \n\nEdit 3: Some of you have expressed concern about the incubation period. I will be self monitoring and getting a second test next week. Until then I'll be isolating as much as possible. I had it once and it sucked but at least I know exactly what to look out for symptoms wise.",

There is a serious difference and frankly I'm gleeful her ass got blacklisted.

        "selftext": "My dad gets sent on business trips fairly often. As with most business trips, all of his expenses are covered. When he has to spend money during the trip on things that can't be paid in advance, he gets reimbursed by the company when he gets back and lets them know what he spent and what he spent it on. This is just stuff like the hotel, food and transport.\n\nDuring one of those trips, he was staying in a Swiss hotel, taking a plane back home the next morning. As he leaves the workplace, they ask him if they should order him a taxi for the next morning to get to the airport, which is about 50ish km away. My dad replies  that its a 5 min walk from his hotel to the train station, so he'll just take a train to the airport instead.\n\nHe does, and a few days later he gets a call from whatever finance departmant handles repaying expenses. They ask him if he's got a receipt for his train ticket, because otherwise they can't cover it.\n\nDad replies he only has the actual train ticket which has the price on it but thats all he has, you just buy it at a machine in the station and all that you get is the ticket, there is no receipt. So the lady at the phone tells him they can't pay him the cost because he doesn't have a receipt.\n\nSo a few weeks later, he's back in the exact same spot, and when they ask if he's going to take the train again, my dad goes 'no can do, I dont get a receipt that way. Order me that taxi. So the next morning he goes on a fairly long taxi drive to the airport. Fun fact: Swiss taxi rides are expensive as fuck.\n\nOnce again, a few days after he's back, a call from finances. About what the hell this 200 euro charge is, and how he had to spend so much this time. Dads reply was something in the lines of\n\n\" Well last time I took the train, but you didn't want to reimburse my ticket because I didnt have a receipt. So this time I took a taxi, but don't worry, I made sure to get a receipt this time, so there should be no problem with paying me back for this right?\"\n\nI was told they accepted because technically there was nothing they could do: the expense was necessary (to get to the airport) and he had a receipt proving it. Later that day they informed that in the future he was allowed to use the train if it was cheaper, and he would only need to provide them with the train ticket.",

Submitted the receipt in my expense report itemized as breakfast for that day.  Accountant rejected it saying it wasn't breakfast, it had to be a meal, and the company won't pay for my drinks and snacks all day.

            "I absolutely love it. In a previous job, about 25 years ago, I dealt with a similarly up-his-ass accounting manager. He decided to eliminate the generous per diem that the traveling group was getting in favor of some complicated formula of reimbursements because \"his research\" showed that we were profiting from the per diem. We were, but we were also travelling for weeks (sometimes months) at a time and the per diem was set-up that way on purpose to encourage people to stay in the traveling group, which was responsible for over half of the company's income, and was passed onto the clients at a profit to the company.\n\nHe felt any expense profit should come to the company, through his department so he could show upper management his cost savings. Almost *en masse* we all started to follow his new formula to the letter and submitted max reimbursements for every meal to the penny and per diem reimbursements skyrocketed for about 6 month and the company started losing money. He was pissed. We weren't terribly happy either as we were buying things we didn't really want, but none of us were willing to stop as we wanted the old per diem back.\n\nEventually, he got fired, as the per diem plan wasn't the only cost-savings plan that he instituted without proper backing or research that ended up costing the company money. After about 6 months, the company went back to our generous per diem and everyone was happier... except the accounting manager, as he was looking for another job.",

This goes back to the 1970s when proper men still wore hats, and our friend was indeed proper, so he showed up in Chicago in full British-style attire, including his beloved woollen hat. Lo and behold, Chicago can be a very windy place and, shortly after arriving in the Windy City, his hat blew off and was completely flattened by a passing car.\n>\n> Our friend thought it reasonable that the firm reimbursed him for his loss so, after having acquired a new hat, the cost found its way to the expense report, which he submitted on his return to London. In those days ours was quite a small firm, and expenses were controlled with an iron fist by one very senior person in New York, who shall remain unnamed. When he saw the expense report, he went ballistic and immediately demanded for our friend to re-submit his expenses, this time without the hat.\n>\n>Now, our friend was not giving in that easily. He was truly upset about the loss and only found it fair that Goldman compensated him, so he re-arranged his expenses, with the total adding up to the exact same amount, but the hat had mysteriously disappeared. Then he wrote in big fat letters across the expense report: \u201cFind the Hat!\u201d\n\n-- famous urban legend, debunked on snopes.com",

            "British accountant here and I'm not sure where your dads company is based so local laws might be slightly different, but the reason you need the receipt is for tax purposes, if you transfer money into an employees account without sufficient evidence that it's an expense reimbursement then the employee is liable to pay income tax on that and the company should be paying a National Insurance contribution.\n\nA receipt is the general accepted level of evidence. Let's say it's a 50 EURO train ticket, no one really cares about this 1 off cost, but if over the course of a year, there's potentially hundreds, if not thousands of expense claims without proper receipts then this can create quite a serious level of non compliance and can land companies in serious trouble.\n\nOn top of this, receipts will have the suppliers tax number on it, which the company can offset against their own VAT bill. If your company pays out 100k in expenses without VAT receipts, that means they won't be able to claim back 20k in VAT.\n\nThat's why companies have blanket policies which seem quite ridiculous when you look at smaller examples.\n\nThat said, at our company we will accept a copy of the train ticket and not a full receipt and we'll just tell the employee to not do it again, it's not worth upsetting an employee over a small expense claim.",

        "selftext": "This happened in Germany so the laws are different to other countries, especially to the USA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was working for a family owned business (about 40 employees) a couple years ago. My time there wasn't the best because i had huge problems with my bosses younger brother. He was on early pension and officially just working on a small part time contract while in reality working full time with getting most of his salary out of pocket.\n\nThat i was hired meant for him that he just worked about half the hours he worked before and having a huge paycut because of me pissed him off as you can imagine. He talked bad about me behind my back all the time and tried to get me fired.\n\nDealing with him was a pain in the arse but i didn't had to deal with him to often, my co-workers were nice and the pay was good. So i didn't care about finding another job despite my relationship with my boss and his wife got worse over time too. My boss even came with me to two deliveries to costumers because his brother probably told him i would waste time during the deliveries.\n\nAt one day i had to do a delivery with my bosses wife's car because the company car i normally use was at the inspection at that day and the timing couldn't had been worse. I scratched the fender of her car on a wall when i tried to get out of the parking spot. The scratch were barelly noticable but i immediately reported it to one of my co-workers so no one can say that i tried to put it under the rug.\n\nI did the delivery and when i came back my bosses wife already waited for me. She went completely crazy, screamed at me for ruining her car (without inspecting the damage before) and said that she will take the money for the repair from my paycheck.\n\nI told her that i won't pay for anything because the insurance will pay for it anyway and thats what let her snap and she slapped me in the face. I immediately turned around, grabbed my stuff, clocked out and went to the doctor to get a sick note because of mental stress, which i threw into the companys mail box in the evening.\n\n2 days later i got a termination letter in the mail and had to laugh while reading just the first sentence. \"We are terminating your work contract immediately, or if this isn't applicable, within the legal 30 days.\"\n\nTo people who arend't familiar with german workers law's, it's illegal to terminate a contract immediately AND within the legal period of time in the same termination letter. You can do one or another but not both at the same time.\n\nSo i went to the government office to apply for unemployment and hired a lawyer to sue my boss for illegal termination. Over 2.5 months went by until i got a court date and my boss was really pissed when the judge explained to him that the termination was illegal and that he had to pay me for the last 2.5 months.\n\nBut the illegal termination wasn't the only mistake he made. The judge gave me 2 options. I can accept an immediate termination on that day and leave without compensation or i can have a 2 month salary compensation but i have to work another month for the company.\n\nMy boss laughed and said that i'm to scared to go back to work and that it makes him happy that i leave the court unemployed. He didn't looked that happy anymore when i asked him \"why should i be scared? Do you want to beat me like your wife did?\"\n\nSo i took option B and went to work the next morning. My bosses brother already waited for me to hand me the termination letter and made comments about how difficult the next 30 days would be for me. I checked the termination letter and after i've seen that everything was right i just said that i'm not feeling well, turned around and went to my doctor to get another 30 day sick note because of burnout.\n\nSo at the end i had a 3.5 months vacation with full pay, 2 month salary compensation and he had to pay for my lawyer too because he lost at court. I could have sued my bosses wife for the slap too but that would have been to much stress for maybe a couple hundreth euros.",

            "> To people who arend't familiar with german workers law's, it's illegal to terminate a contract immediately AND within the legal period of time in the same termination letter. You can do one or another but not both at the same time.\n\nIt sounds like you are the one not familiar with German labor law, because this is ***exactly*** how this is done in cases where you terminate immediately:\n\nYou can only terminate contracts without notice for grave misconduct, that's typically theft, sexual harassment, violence, etc.\n\nHowever if a case goes to labor arbitration or court and the termination is withdrawn, then the contract is reinstated and you will get compensated retroactively, and if they still want to fire you, have to terminate then. Which apparently happened in this case for some reason - but the initial termination (without cause, regular notice) should have been perfectly valid.\n\nSo why the court sided with you / gave you those options I have no idea.

I had 72 weeks -- yes, that's more than a year -- of unused vacation. Unused chiefly because that's how it is in my country and my area of work.  \n\nI asked for my contractually allotted 4 weeks of vacation and 8 more as a way of, 1: giving me a break before my next endeavor, and 2: as a payback for the 72 weeks of unused vacation.  Some of the deciders actually balked at giving me the 8 weeks (and sort of sneered at me actually using my allotted annual 4 weeks of vacation -- something I'd never done in 20 years) saying I wasn't owed any severance since I was leaving voluntarily. Fortunately, saner and more humane minds prevailed and I was granted the 8 weeks.\n\nEpilogue: Those delicious 12 weeks combined break came in the depths of COVID so I was basically stuck at home day drinking and bingeing Reddit in solitude -- I even lost my dog right before this happened.  Would have loved to have gotten my 72 weeks, but...Murca.  And, it's been 20 months since I gave my notice and they still haven't found my replacement.

        "selftext": "Years ago, I was working for a large organization. My boss was very nice and pleasant to work with at first. I was hired and tasked with taking a very troubled department and bringing it up in standards. My boss was fairly supportive during the initial few months on the job but then, something changed. The department began to perform and improve greatly within the first 6 months and this was recognized and heralded by upper management. This made my boss look good and also improved overall morale on the team within the troubled department as they were finally recognized for their efforts and talents,\n\nAbout this time(6 month mark), I was told to watch my back by a few other colleagues (both men and women) outside of my department, because my boss had a reputation for putting her own success over anyone else's. They also warned me that she was known for being very threatened by any successful males who worked with her (male here). She was a very big champion of the women on her team and regularly promoted and advocated for them but it seems that every male that worked on her team ended up leaving or getting fired (this was something I was not aware of when I was hired. I also am the ONLY male on the team). After investigating this further, I found there to be some truth to all of this. As it happens, over a 12 year period, over 8 men on her team either quit or were fired (6 fired and 2 quit). Of the women on her team during the same time period, 8 were promoted, 2 quit, 4 were still on her team and 0 were fired. So, I am a bit concerned about this now as 1) I am a male and 2) she has this reputation for making it difficult for men on her team. \n\nI just took this all in stride however and focused on continuing to manage the department to greater levels, work on continuing to increase the morale of the department and ensuring I communicate with my boss regularly about any situation that would become problematic for her or me. I also focused on ensuring that she got maximum credit for the improvements of the troubled department and credited her with being a great boss that ensured that the department received the resources and support that it needed to succeed.\n\nFast forward to about my 8th month there and I am in a meeting with my boss and she begins to rage against me that I emailed someone who was in the upper management of the company. I explained to her that yes, I did cc that VP because the email in question was one that necessarily involved the entire area under which this particular VP lead. She said I am not to do that and then proceeds to tell me that I am forbidden to email anyone that is above my pay grade as 'that is not my place.' She then tells me that ONLY SHE is allowed to email these people and that if an email needs to go to them, cc or not, SHE WILL send it. I ask her if she would like me to send the emails that would need to go to VPs to her for her to send and she tells me \"Yes, send them to me and then I will send them.\" I ask her also if she wishes I do not 'call the VPs on the phone as well'  and she say \"Yes, you are not to call them either\". Then she says \"I know you may be used to getting your way because you are a man but this doesn't mean you can try to take my job.\"  WHAT?!!  I'm kinda befuddled at this and just take it all in and decide that I need to respect her wishes because there must be something else going on here of which I am not aware. \n\nOK, fine. We will do it your way.\n\nAbout a month goes by and during that time I only need to email a VP once and I write up the email to this VP's department, send it to her and then wait for her to send it on. Now this email is time sensitive and involves giving the VP and his people a head's up about resources needed for a particular project. Now the VP MUST be included in this email because this request involved budgetary issues and only the VP over a specific area is allowed to change or adapt their budget. Otherwise, I would have just communicated directly with the members of this other VPs team to give them the heads up. So I send the email to my boss, ask her to send it on within the next 3 days and then I wait.\n\nAbout a week goes by and I happen to run into this particular VP in the elevator. She asks me about the project, resources etc etc and I let her know that things are good. She then asks about the overrun on this one particular area and I tell her that it is best she ask my boss. She then asks me to send her an email on this particular overrun and I let her know \"Sure, I will make that happen.\" I follow back to my boss, let her know about the conversation with the VP in the elevator and she blows up at me. Starts yelling and screaming and telling me that I am not to even talk with that VP or any VP about this project. I explain to her that sure, I get it but it would have been rude to not acknowledge this VP's questions since we were stuck in the elevator together and I did not seek out that meeting. She then begins to tell me that she has to write me up for being insubordinate and not honoring her request to not email, call talk to VPs'. I am floored but nothing I can do. As I am leaving her office, she tells me that \"I made a mistake in hiring you. I though you were different but you are just as entitled as all the other men I've hired.\"  DAMN!! Ok, so this is going really well. \n\nDo I go to Human Resources and have them play their stupid games with me? Nah, not gonna solve anything especially with a boss that has been at the company for 10 years or so. Human Resources generally cares very little about employees and only really worries about risk and protecting the company. They aren't gonna do shit for me so I don't report any of this. I seriously thought about filing a complaint about my boss's comments to me. But, when I had the meeting where I had to sign my write up, I decided against it given the HR officer had to read the write up before I signed it and I figured that since the write up was based on a BS policy that my boss created out of thin air, I was right in assuming that HR would do shit for me if I had complained anyway. So I just try to get through all this shit and start looking for another job on the side.\n\n2 days later I get a call from an SVP (to whom the VP from the elevator reports to). Now my boss also reports to another VP (this VP is a female and also not the same one from the elevator) and this VP to whom my boss reports, also reports to this SVP. This SVP asks me to come to a meeting that next day. I explain that I am happy to do so but I will need to check with my boss first to ensure that there are no conflicts in the schedule. I also state to this SVP that I would appreciate it if she would contact my boss as well to ensure that my boss is made aware of her request. The SVP pauses and then tells me \"No, that won't be necessary in this case\" and then hangs up. \n\nSHIT!!!\n\nSo, I email my boss, tell her that the SVP is requesting to meet with me the next day and wanted to make her aware of the meeting. She comes storming into my office around 5:30pm (about an hour before I usually leave) and closes my door and berates me for a good 20 minutes for talking with the SVP. She was so loud that one of the members of the department in which I worked was about to call security just before my boss exited my office. I knew my boss would be mad but didn't expect anything like this. \n\nSo, next day, I go to the meeting with the SVP. At that meeting is another 3 VPs: the first is the female VP whom I ran into in the elevator and was asking about overruns; the second is the female VP to whom my boss reports; and the third is a female VP that used to oversee the department in which I presently work. The SVP proceeds to ask me about the overruns. I explain as best as I can about the issues involved and also explain that I had prepared an email a few weeks ago about this. The VP whom I ran into in the elevator states that she never got that email on the cost overruns from me. I then explain that it would not come from me but would have come from my boss. The VP asks why I wouldn't send it. I say that is not my place to send emails to VPs. Then the SVP stops everyone from talking and says \"What did you just say?\" I then reiterate my response. Then the SVP begins questioning me about this point. After about 15 minutes of my explaining to them that I am not allowed to communicate with them per my boss's orders, they are all pretty disgusted and frustrated. I further explain that this policy was created by my boss and has been consistently enforced by her for the past month or so. They tell me that they will have to come back to me on this but in the meantime, they will get the emails about the overruns from my boss and follow up with her.\n\nSHIT SHIT SHIT!!!\n\nSo, I go back to my office that day and realize that my head is on the chopping block. I am really in a no win situation and I just have to wait for it to play out. And play out it did.........\n\nI come into work the next day (it's a Thursday) and I don't think anything has changed. Seems like a normal oppressive day and I am just waiting for the ax to fall on my head. I work most of the morning and then right before lunch, I get an email. The email is from the SVP with all the VPs copied in on it, that my boss is taking some time off and will be back in a few days. During her absence, all requests and management decisions will be made by the VP to whom my boss reports. I am not quite sure what this means but given the weekend is coming up, I am just glad this friggin week is almost over. Day goes by uneventful and the around 4pm , the VP responsible for the department in which I work ,comes down and comes into my office and tells me that as of that day, my department and I am no longer reporting to my boss but I was now reporting directly to her. I ask what that means for the department and my job. She said nothing, it just means that the department will be better served under this new reporting structure given the increase in the amount of business that the department was engaged in since my hire as well as the strategic internal leverage that would be needed going forward. I also was explicitly told that I was free to now communicate with ANY other VPs or SVPs of the organization as I saw fit. She then apologized for the experience I had with my boss and told me that she was unaware of my boss forbidding me to communicate with her or other VPs or SVPs. I take this all in, not knowing whom is telling the truth but relieved that I will no longer have to endure being treated like a child by my boss. I then ask about my boss and her reporting relationship to my department's other team members and was told that she was forbidden to execute orders to them on her own unless she has my prior approval. \n\nKARMA!!\n\nI stay at this company about 3 years total, have a great working relationship with the VP, whom was now my boss as well as the other VPs and SVP to whom they reported. I only left when I got a better offer in a different industry.\n\nMy former boss was eventually counseled out (over a 3 month period) after HR investigated her behavior, interviewed me about the arbitrary rules about communicating with VPs that my boss had enforced on me (as well as her shouting at me and writing me up and disparaging me as a male). Talk about karma, her write up of me was used as evidence that she actually had implemented this no contact policy solely with me and because she wrote it up and put it in my employee file, it proved my veracity about the entire no contact issue. In addition (and also compounding the problem) other alleged issues concerning cost overruns/financial reporting irregularities that she had hidden over the years. \n\nI have never seen her again but if I ever do, I would love to be able to say to her \"Great seeing you again. I always tell people that you are the boss that taught me the importance of using email to further my career.\" \n\n**TLDR**: Boss forbids me from emailing/communicating with upper management in an effort to ensure that she is the only one who gets credit for anything. Boss has a track record of bias against men and exhibits bias against me based on this same bias. This gets found out by upper management and then this leads to exposing my boss's attempt to hide her alleged financial malfeasance. Boss loses her job and I keep mine.",
