        "selftext": "My father died 20 years ago, and left me a tiny cabin house. He loved that place, built it himself and tended to it religiously. After he died, I couldn\u2019t find it in my heart to visit, because every rock on the wall, every flower reminded me of him. My mother never cared for it even when my dad was alive, so within a few months I realized that it would be a while before either of us would be ready to spend time there again. As such, we called up the electricity, telephone, and water companies to shut off services to the cabin until further notice.\n\nWhile other companies complied without an issue, the water company decided this request could be made only by the person whose name was on the bill. Mind you, their fee (due to zoning and a well on our property) was less than \u20ac2/month. Repeatedly faxing the death certificates as well as next-of-kin transfer of the title got us nowhere. Dozens of calls per month, several emails, in-person applications, smoke signals, interpretive dances, telepathy etc. nothing made any difference. \n\nBoth me and my mother were entirely flabbergasted, so we asked around and found out that indeed the process is unsolvable and, albeit not technically legal, people stopped paying those fees and the water would get shut off anyway as a result. Getting any lawyers involved would not be worth the money, so we did just that, discontinued the connected bank account, and never gave it another thought.\n\n2 weeks ago while at my family house, I got a call from the water company. They were closing inactive accounts at the 20 year mark, and my father\u2019s cabin was up. They did however tell me that 1) there was a pending sum of \u20ac11.93 to be paid for the account to be closed, and 2) the account owner themselves had to make the application to close the account. Once again I mention the whole \u201cyou know, he\u2019s dead?\u201d spiel and was passed over to a supervisor, but in a reminiscing demonstration of absolute absent-mindedness/stupidity, the response I got was \u201cunfortunately they have to show up in person, as we need a paper copy for accounts older than X years, otherwise we can\u2019t proceed\u201d.\n\nNow. I don\u2019t know how widely common this is, but in my country, you \u201crent\u201d the burial site/grave in 3-5 year increments. My father's grave\u2019s 20 years were up in August and my mother decided it was time to unearth his bones and surrender the site. As such, we had just been delivered a very respectful package with my father\u2019s remains, cleaned and curated, only that week. Everyone that has ever gone through this process would recognize that box for what it was. And what it was, was great timing. \n\n2 days later, I went to the water company\u2019s local office. I wore my most purple, silky, goth outfit, dark make-up, and \u201coh-so-heathen\u201d jewelry, and carried a large bag with me. I asked to speak to the same supervisor, who luckily for me was in an open-space area with *their team\u2019s director* and quite a few more desks. After confirming with her why I was there, she started telling me the whole \u201che needs to be here in person\u201d thing again, but I interrupted her and told her \u201cI know what you will say, so I brought him with me so he can tell you himself\u201d. \n\nI plopped a Ouija board and the box with my father\u2019s remains on the desk, and loudly shushed the area. Heads turned, her director looked up with a \u201cwhat the fuck\u201d expression, and the supervisor herself was frozen and wide eyed. I placed my hands on the Ouija board and just as loudly started asking my father\u2019s spirit to communicate with me, show me a sign he was there with us, reach out to me from the grave. Everyone was silent, people walking by the door stopped and stared, I threw a few \u201cPapa can you hear me?\u201d in there as well, for dramatic effect. In comedic timing that happens only once in a lifetime, I think a pen?/something small fell down from someone\u2019s desk behind me, which against the silence was quite startling. Excitedly I moved my hand to YES and proclaimed I needed his help in the form of his signature from the beyond, in order to close this account.\n\nFinally the director snapped out of it and came over with an \u201calright I can help you over here, I think this is enough\u201d but hell no it wasn\u2019t. I started gathering my things as I laid into him, how asking to speak in person with an indisputably dead man of over 20 years was beyond stupid and if I had to put up with their idiocy, they had to put up with the process required to get ahold of him. I also mentioned that denying someone\u2019s legal title claim was lawsuit-worthy, so he immediately changed his tune that I could of course close the account. He tried to bring up the fee but I cut him off with a \u201cdon\u2019t even think about it\u201d and walked out.\n\nIt's still early but so far, there has been radio silence. My mother thanked me for handling it, but when I suggested she should write to someone higher up about this, she just said \u201cmeh, not worth it, it\u2019s over now\u201d. What a missed opportunity for a \u201cwater under the bridge\u201d comment :P\n\nTL;DR Water company wants to speak to my long-deceased father in person. I go above and (contact the) beyond to grant their request.",

            "Nothing quite that dramatic, but closing accounts after my parents died was a pain in my ass.\n\nI remember calling one company and them saying that they would need to speak to the cardholder to cancel the account after I had told them my mom had passed away. I told them, \"That will be difficult.\" The silence I got as a response for a moment before they asked me to hold while they got a manager was somewhat satisfying.\n\nYou get a bit jaded after dealing with it for a while. I carried copies of my parents death certificates with me for about a year, just in case I found an account that got missed.",
            "My aunt got in trouble for doing something similar. The phone company pulled a similar stunt, insisting that only the account holder could close the account, otherwise the bills would continue. She mailed them an official copy of the death certificate, along with a baggie of ashes from the fireplace and a note that since they didn't believe the death certificate, or any of the legal documents naming her executor of his estate, perhaps they'd like to take it up with the account holder himself? (The \"cremains\" in the baggie) The bank freaked out and law enforcement got involved. So now my 68 year old hippie aunt has a FBI file.",
            "After my mom died, my dad tried to transfer the couple credit accounts only in her name to him. One company did exactly what OP's water company did, and after a lot of fighting my dad straight up said, \"I am not obligated to pay this card back, but im doing so because I feel morally obligated to and I can afford it. If you keep fighting me on this I'll give up and you'll never get your money back.\"\n\nThe company refused, saying that they'd get the money no matter what cause if the death certificate went through they'd be allowed to just pull the funds from the estate. But jokes on them cause there was no estate. My parents were married. My mom's \"estate\" was automatically transferred to my dad's name, or was already jointly owned. And the card company had just refused to put their account in his name as well.\n\nAs far as I know my dad never heard anything from them.",
            "I had a similar problem when my mother died. Finally got through to most of organizations, but one charity would not hear of it. After many phone calls I had a most dramatic fundraiser who just would not give it up. I listened to her wailing about it being for (cue dramatic quaver in the voice) DYING CHILDREN! They are going to HEAVEN! Finally snapped at that one and told her firmly Well, she beat them there. She's dead, and she's not going to be donating from there.  The organization finally left me alone after that.",

            "for something that happens all the time and will eventually happen to literally everyone, businesses are spectacularly bad at handling the death of customers. probably because they can continue getting more money out of people too busy grieving to fight every company. literally every person i know who had to handle the estate of a loved one has had to fight multiple companies to get accounts paid off/closed. like even people with lawyers to help with the estate dealt with it.",
            "I kinda did the opposite of this. My brother went to a very prestigious university. Not cheap. And he paid for it himself. However, because the school is so pricy, everyone who handles money there assumes the student's parents are paying for it. So naturally, the donation solicitation office got my parents' number and started calling to ask for donations. Now, my whole family is generally of the opinion that most colleges and universities are already too good at extorting money from people, so we didn't have the time of day for the donations folks. And, I'm not sure why, but every time they called they asked to speak with my mom, and every time they called she'd ask to be taken off the call list and added to the do-not-call list. After about five months of daily calls, sometimes multiple times a day, we were pretty fed up with it. Didn't matter if we threatened harassment suits, begged, pleaded, or hung up on them, the calls kept coming. So one day, I try a different strategy:\n\nPhone rings. I answer \"Buddh13 residence, how can I help you?\"\n\nIn the brightest happiest scripted voice I've heard yet \"Hi, my name is Peggy from the Fancy School Donations office. Is Mrs. Buddha13 there?\"\n\nMe, putting a catch in my throat, \"unfortunately, no. Its been about two months since the accident, and we just got home from her grave. I'd really appreciate it if you'd stop calling and harassing us asking to speak to my deceased mother.\"\n\n\"....\" awkward silence. Stammering. Very softly \"I'm sorry.\" Hangs up. \n\nI feel a bit bad for Peggy. She sounded like she was new and still optimistic about people wanting to throw more money at the school. But it was effective. Never got a call again.",

            "I\u2019m a young widow who lost her husband very suddenly. I also moved to my hometown a week after the funeral. Most of the companies I had to deal with were understanding and professional. Especially when I waived the military death certificate in their face. But the electric company gave me a hard time. Actually just one of their employees. I went down in person to shut it off. My sister was waiting in the car with her little baby so I was anxious to get it over with fast. It\u2019s a long line. Finally I go up to the counter and hand them the death certificate and tell them I want it shut off. The woman seems confused. Asked why I don\u2019t need the electric for myself. I explained I\u2019m leaving town and moving. Apartment is cleared out and keys handed over. No one\u2019s there. So then she asks where does it say on the death certificate that I have the power to shut it off on his behalf. I point on the death certificate where it says so and in fact I had it highlighted. Then she looks at the account and says \u201cI can\u2019t let you shut off the electric, he was living with another woman!\u201d I don\u2019t know how I didn\u2019t slap a bitch. She told me he was living with [my first name, maiden name]. I told her that\u2019s me. That\u2019s my maiden name. We were engaged when we moved in together. Then I replied, \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter who he was living with. I have the power to shut it off regardless.\u201d She had the look of defeat on her face at that point and begrudgingly complied like she should have originally. Woman was acting like it would cost her personally if I shut off my electric",

Everything but his bank account and his car insurance were in both his and my mum\u2019s names so getting all the joint stuff sorted was easy as hell. I was put in charge of handling the bank, my sister his insurance.\n\nHis bank we (mum and I) went in with the death certificate, to close the account and pay any outstanding fees he may have had - later found out that as he was a pensioner they no longer charged him fees - the lady at the counter kept telling me that he would have to come in and close the account himself even though we had the death certificate. We went home with nothing sorted and mum was quite upset. \n\nApparently my sister had the same amount of luck with the insurance company.\n\nLuckily enough for me, the following week my sister got a call that Dad\u2019s ashes were ready to be picked up. The plan was hatched and this time we didn\u2019t take mum with us. \n\nWe both walked into the bank and then the insurance with my father\u2019s ashes, put them on the counter and said \u201cwe\u2019re here so our dad can close his account\u201d. Never had I seen tellers and office staff move so quickly to get things done. We never told mum what we did, but dad would have found it hilarious. I did also make a written complaint about the policy that a deceased person had to be present to close their account.",

            "My father passed away early this year. His dad (my grandfather) had taken out a life policy on him in 1942, probably expecting dad's participation in WW2. Dad kept that little policy, and in 1962 he got a letter that the policy was paid up.\n\nSo about a month after dad passed, I started the process to file a claim on that policy. After some run-around they mailed the claim forms to DAD's home address --- the home he moved into in 1963 and sold in 2016 --- not to the address I gave them on the three different emails I sent when making the claim. To this day, I have no idea how they came up with that address.",

Multiple attempts! No one would listen!\n\nFinally, totally sick of it, I answered one last time and told them she wouldn't be needing glasses anymore. \"Oh, did she get laser eye treatment?\" No, she won't be needing them because she doesn't have eyes. \"...what? Was there an accident?\" Oh, no, she's just dead. I'd be happy to bring her urn for a check up but ashes don't have eyes. \"I'll...uh...put a note on the file not to call you further.\" Thanks, you do that.\n\nCalls stopped.

I had one such customer who did not qualify for the rental vehicle she reserved. Per my training, I was not allowed to rent anything larger than a sedan because she did not have a credit card.

She refused to acknowledge that I was doing my job properly.\n\nI repeated company policy multiple times and did my best to inform her that I was doing the best I could with the current situation. She refused any attempt I made to placate her. My manager eventually stepped in, and he broke down and did the rental for a SUV, against company policy.\n\nThe entitled woman smirked at me and pushed a stack of Post-It notes that was on the counter in front of me.

I accepted the gift cards (they were new at the time) not knowing that our systems were programed to not accept more than ten gift cards at a time (even my boss didn't know). So I started scanning them in, confirming each one (which takes a lot of time) until my system suddenly told me that I have reached the maximum number of cards. Surprised I apologized and told the costumer what is going on and that he will have to pay the remaining amount with cash or a bank card.\n\nAs you can imagine he wasn't thrilled about that and started arguing. But the system literally prevented me from scanning in more cards and as \"gas\" is one transaction I wasn't able to split it up, especially as ten gift cards were already locked in. There was really no way out. \n\nSo we argued for a long time, everybody in the shop was annoyed, the line was getting longer etc... I stayed professional until I finally shouted: \"look, the system is preventing me. nothing I can do\".  While showing him the error message on my screen after scanning in another gift card for the xx time.\n\nThe costumer answered: \"I do not give a shit, circumvent the system.\"\n\nLike I am some kind of hackerman or like there is some kind of secret cheat line.\n\nSo I shrugged and walked around counter stood besides him for a second and walked back behind the counter and scanned in a gift card.\n\n\"Just did, still doesn't work.\"\n\nAt this point he started screaming and insulting me. All my colleagues were laughing and my boss had to take over. In the end the costumer paid the rest with his cc. \n\nWhile I understand that this wasn't his fault, it also wasn't mine.

He tells me he can wait all day.\nHe gave up after about 20 seconds of silence and intense eye contact from me but that's where shit went downhill.\n\nWhen I'm on my way out with him, he reaches out and strokes my arm. I jerk my arm away mostly just stunned and I keep walking. So he does it again. I tell him, \"If you touch my arm again I'm going to rip it off and beat you with it.\"\n\nThe rest of the way he complains loudly about how feminism has ruined everything and men should be able to \"do wthat they want to women\". I don't even respond at this point because I'm feeling so unsafe. When we get to his car I step back but don't start walking to the desk because I don't want him behind me. He tells me that he's going to talk to corporate about how I threatened him.\n\nOh yeah sir, please. After the display in the office and the path with a dozen cameras, please do.

The guy was a mooch - he would brag about how much money he made, while hitting you up constantly for \u201csmall\u201d loans (the one person I know who gave him a $25k loan never saw that cash again because they were (unfortunately) too nice to sue family). \ud83d\ude21 \n\nAnyway, Major Dickhead got pissed when I wouldn\u2019t loan him $40k and had been punishing me by not letting me see my nephew and niece (Major D wasn\u2019t my nephew\u2019s father but he was my niece\u2019s father, and both still lived in his house). When a truce was arranged by my apologizing as sincerely as John Cleese did in a Fish Called Wanda\u2019s window scene, he allowed me to once again send gifts for birthdays and Christmas but they needed to be arts and crafts type stuff (no electronics). So for my then extremely active 4-year old nephew\u2019s Christmas gift, I included a box of 1,000 stickers. I made sure they were all shapes and sizes, ugly as hell, and (most importantly) that had been down voted because reviewers reported them as being almost impossible to remove. \n\nI hope that fucker still finds those fucking things every so often to this day and thinks of me when he does.",

        "selftext": "When I was 14, I was qualified fully in my country in a piano-playing performance qualification. I had worked really hard for this and was so proud, my parents too. I was too young to join paid orchestras (and they didn\u2019t exist near me) so instead I handed out business cards to residents nearby in a fairly wealthy area and thought I could make some money teaching after school. Teachers in the area were charging \u20ac20 per half-hour so I charged \u20ac17 because of my age (edit: and *lack of experience* since someone got their knickers in a twist) and got very lucky that a few mums caught on and switched to me instead.\n\nI quickly had 4-5 kids/adults to teach every single weeknight in an area I could bike around. This was roughly \u20ac400 every single week due to fluctuations of people cancelling and so on. An hour\u2019s lesson was 50 min with a short water break and explanation of homework at the end. A half hour lesson was 25 min with explanation and homework at the end. I made all of this very clear and learned it was necessary through time to walk people carefully through homework and exam prep. \n\nThese parents paid 10 lessons in advance every time, and I kept a calendar and updated parents weekly on where they were at. One parent would always ask for a full summary of all 10 weeks for all 3 of her kids and I was happy to provide it.\n\nSuddenly one week she decided she didn\u2019t owe me money for the next 10 lessons until I had \u201cmade up for lost time.\u201d I was obviously very confused and asked her what she meant. She cited the reason that I cut 5 minutes off every 30 minutes and 10 minutes off every hour so I should teach that extra time before getting more money. \n\nHere\u2019s the real kicker: her kids were horribly behaved. They were easily the most spoiled entitled kids I taught and often said things like \u201csince we pay you, don\u2019t YOU work for ME?\u201d They were ages 6-11. She had also referred me to a lot of other parents so I was concerned about my jobs. Because her kids behaved badly and didn\u2019t do homework I ALWAYS spent extra time on them, 5-10 min per week because they needed it. \n\nBut ok SURE, you want me to work that time? NO PROBLEM. So I decided to tell this mother from now on I would set a timer and charge every minute on that timer and show her when I clicked it on and off, and gave a huge apology.\n\nYou can imagine her shock at the end of the ten weeks when she saw that the kids combined 30 hours was actually more like 36-37 that she had to pay. She never bothered me about timing ever again and rushed through every homework or exam prep explanation getting me out of the door :D\n\nTL;DR - mum got what she deserved questioning the time I was teaching her kids when in fact I had been most generous with them. I made her pay all the hours with a timer.",

At that time, there were not substitutive exams of any kind, no matter the reason. So it wasn't uncommon for people to fail subjects because they couldn't attend the test day.\n\nIn the end of my last year, I don't know how or why - since  I took the vaccine - I got chickenpox. Luckily for me I didn't suffer at all, maybe a day with mild fever and that's it.  All the itching was completely mitigated with medicine. Although externally I looked really bad.\n\nMore concerned about my appearance than anything, I called and asked If I could take my exam another day. The lady who answered it immediately denied my request, as expected. Then, being as patient and kind as possible, I tried to explain my situation, but she was very rude and cut my explanation short, not letting me even say what my illness was. As a last attempt I asked if at least I could take the exam in a separate classroom. Then she told me to wait on the line.. I heard some people talking in the backgroud and laughing, after she left me hanging for more than ten minutes, she comes back just to say that there is no way. So I thanked her and hung up.\n\nI don't really know what heck they expected, that I didn't come and failed my very last test? Hell no. So I went.. looking absolutely hideous, not a square inch of my skin didn't have a mad hash, including my face.\n\nIn the class, after the monitor arrives, he told me to remove my sunglasses and cap, as per regulations, and so I did, including my jacket and medical face mask. Oh boy, I'll never forget his facial expression. And then my fun begins, during the test I start to fake cough like a man about to die. Getting really good on my act, was really amusing seeing the monitor's reaction going from little apprehension to total panic, until he gave up and left, leaving the class unattended!\n\nBarely able to hold my bursting laugh at this point, my  colleague who got what was going on, look at me also holding his laugh and shaking his head.\n\nIn the end I did pretty well on the exam and had my fun, including paying a visit to the lady who left me haging. Later on, after graduation,  I found out through a friend that I became sort of a famous joke, like the guy who came back from the dead to attend his exam.",

I tell him I really can't drop this one because I need to drop the exam that I *already* failed, but he says sorry, only one drop, and no makeups.\n\nSo I figured I can't do worse than last time, right? Show up to the exam looking like absolute death. I'm ehausted because the pain and itchyness had been keeping me up so in addition to my extra-pale face and red rash I've got dark circles under my eyes.\n\nHe's handing out exams at the front of the lecture hall. Now, I had not spoken to him in person so I doubt he knew my name at that point, but the second he saw me I'm sure he knew that I was the one who had emailed him. His eyes got wide and he looked like he had seen a ghost.\n\nI take the exam, getting side-eye glances from the professor the entire time. Ended up scoring an even worse F than last time.\n\nShortly after that exam, I get on the right medications and start making up the work in all my classes. Studied my ass off for the final exam in this class since it's my only chance of even passing. I ended up with a 97 on the final. Calculated my grade and figured I'd end up with a B-/B in the class.\n\nGrades come out. I have an A-. Guess I made enough of an impression that he dropped both exams!",

            "Mandatory attendance for strictly scheduled test dates **without exceptions** should be fucking criminal. If they're not willing to offer proctors (paid or volunteer, Idc) to give tests on alternate dates due to illness or emergencies, then they've failed as an institution of education and certification. They should be doing everything in their power to ensure you can take that test. And that you're prepared for it. They don't have to ensure you'll pass or ensure it'll be easy, but they should be *desperate* to get you into the chair. Every certified graduate is good for their record. Every failure is going to count against their record double. I can't comprehend what sort of idiocy goes into making testing this strict. They should be far more rigorous about managing and revising their curricula than about testing practices. I know it's probably an industry-wide standard.

Read that folks who do the same job for 1/4 the pay and no benefits to speak of. I was lucky as somehow this happened during the summer and not during school.\n\nI got a surprise raging case of chicken pox or measles who knows I had red blisters all over. Damn things were under my nails and in my hair. The bonus were the ones on the bottoms of my feet. It was the 3rd time too. Really sucked as I was an adult getting it. Now my job was not good to us. If I missed  days in a row I needed a doctors note to return or I was subject to different outcomes even including termination. So off to work I went. \n\nYou have never seen a place empty at the rate of speed it did. (7-11 was hilarious though) I sat down at my machine with a large coffee and danish. I couldnt get warm in the summer heat but I was sweating buckets. No one would even come in to see what was wrong they were grouped up  outside. I was clocked in. My shift manager was prodded into coming over and asking me to go home (He was the person who would write you up for being late to the time clock or not at your machine on time). I told him no, sorry I dont have a doctor's note as I know whats wrong and I am sick BUT if I miss 3 days I could lose my job per my handbook. So machine is started and Im watching it roll. Its the only one running.....\n\nOur contract manager strolls over. He tells me its ok to go home I am obviously ill and with my attendance he is sure that they can overlook the note. (I still rarely miss time) Now he had told the story when I was hired in about running into people who were supposedly ill out at bars and events.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI went home and got better. I was stir crazy and my girlfriend who was immune it seems drove me to the movies. We were sitting chatting and guess who was DIRECTLY in front of me in the theater with his whole family?

        "selftext": "I used to be a sales manager for a B2B Services company. We provided a service to business. Unlike a lot of companies we would not auto renew a clients service UNLESS they signed a new contract. The contracts were generally for 1-3 years.\n\nAll our contracts were signed on an Ipad, that recorded the GPS coordinates of where the document was signed AND we emailed the client a copy of the agreement instantly and in the email we basically said \"If you disagree with this contract or would like to make changes contact us within 5 business days, if you don't we will move forward and bill accordingly\" \n\nIn addition one of the cancelation terms in the contract was dishonesty. If the client could prove we were dishonest they had a right to cancel without penalty. If the client acted dishonestly, we had the right to cancel their contract with us.\n\nThere was a client, that was actually quite a small account but always proved to cause a lot of headache for my reps. I remember calling the rep and going over the common issues I've seen with this client and I stressed, get the signature on the ipad in his office. I also stressed that if the client wanted to cancel, let him cancel because he's been proven to be very difficult to work with.\n\nSales man went to the sales call, signature was signed, clients service was executed according to the terms of the contract.\n\n4 months later I get an email from a customer service rep, the client is claiming that my sales man forged the clients signature. I did my due diligence before calling the client.\n\n* I checked where the newest contract was signed, it was signed in the clients place of business via the ipad\n* I compared the signature on the newest contract to the many signatures on the numerous contracts we had on file with the same signer from the client they were all very close\n* I also looked at the email that we went to the client right after the contract was signed, the client opened the link to see his contract 65 minutes after the contract was signed and did nothing. Also the link was open for several minutes.\n* I looked up the clients current billing status, he was 45 days behind, he knew we didn't start charging late fees until 60 days behind and at 120 days we would began litigation/collection account status.\n\nI called up the client and this is how the call went\n\nMe: Hello this is Luther from ABC I was told you are accusing my sales rep of forging your signature on the renewal?\n\nClient: Yes I never agreed to pay that much I never would have, I told him to give me a discount and I wanted to see it in writing before I signed\n\nMe: And did he give you a discount and show it to you in writing?\n\nClient: No he said he had to go talk to his boss and I never heard back from him\n\nMe: Ok, and then what happened?\n\nClient: Well yall kept up the service and I noticed on my billing it hadn't gone down but up in cost and I looked back in my emails and saw the sales rep forged my signature, and that's illegal\n\nMe: Yes you are right, if the sales person did forge your signature that is illegal\n\nClient: Well good to see that we agree on that\n\nMe: After the contract was signed regardless if the signature was forged or not you would have gotten an email with a link to the contract asking you to verify that everything is correct, and if its not to let us know within 5 business days did you get the email? If you did get the email, did you review the contract?\n\nClient: Well yes, but I was pretty busy and didn't open the email until recently\n\nMe: I totally get it, we are busy now-a-days, so assuming he did forge the signature what would you consider an acceptable resolution to this? Would you want to end service with no penalty? Would you like a discount?\n\nClient: I would want a discount\n\nMe: And what would you consider an acceptable discount? \n\nClient: 3 months of free service\n\nMe: Got it, well Mr. Client I got several problems with your claim that my sales rep forged your signature and before I fire this sales person for forgery and offer you a discount I'd like to see if we can't address those problems.\n\nClient: Sounds fair\n\nMe: The signature was captured on our Ipads, which records the GPS coordinates of where the signature happened, per the GPS coordinates it happened inside your place of business.\n\nClient: Well he knows that right?\n\nMe: Yes he did\n\nClient: That just means he forged it inside my building\n\nMe: Ok, well the next issue is that the signature on the renewal contract looks exactly like the previous contracts\n\nClient: He just copied my signature, I know I didn't sign that\n\nMe: Could it be possible someone else in your company signed it?\n\nClient: No, everyone here knows I'm the only one that gets to sign those contracts\n\nMe: I understand, the next issue I have with your claim is that the link to the contract that was emailed to you was opened 65 minutes after the contract was signed\n\nClient: No it wasn't\n\nMe: Yes sir it was, the reason why we have you click a link to view the signed contract is so we know if you opened the link or not, not only that it appears like the link was opened for several minutes. Which to me would indicate the person who opened that link reviewed the contract. Also the fact that no one ever responded to the email would indicate to me the person who reviewed the contract was fine.\n\nClient: Are you accusing me of lying?\n\nMe: Yes, and because of that I will be canceling your service with us effective immediately how would you like to pay your current balance?\n\nClient: Your canceling my service and want me to pay?\n\nMe: Yes I want you to pay for the services we provided\n\nClient: I'm not going pay\n\nMe: If your not going pay for the services we provided I'm going refer you to our collections department, and they will add late fees and if you don't pay them they will refer you to our law firm for litigation.\n\nClient: We have a contract, you can't just cancel my service\n\nMe: Actually I can, since I have good reason to believe your lying about the accusation that my sales person forged your signature, everything I have says you signed it. Our contract states that we cancel your contract for being dishonest, and that's what we are going do\n\nClient: Fuck you *Hangs up*\n\nI referred the client to collections, he eventually paid them without us having to sue him (honestly we probably would have just sold his debt to a collection agency due to the dollar amount not being high enough to be worth it to sue) \n\nTL:DR Client accused my sales rep of forging a signature, I canceled his agreement with us for lying",

It was a bit out my way, but he never had a car and was not on a public transport route.  I didn't really want to give him a lift each day, but money was tight at the time, so I said I would give him a lift each day on the condition that he shared some of the fuel costs with me.  After a few months, he still never handed me any money, so I gave him an ultimatum - money by a certain date, which was a Friday after payday, or the lifts would stop the following Monday.  No ambiguity.  A simple condition.  He agreed.  Friday came and went and no fuel money was handed over, so I simply drove straight to work without picking him up the following Monday.\n\nHe arrived at work about an hour and a half late, having cycled there.  The workplace was at the top of a long steep hill, so the bike ride must have been tough.  He immediately approached me at my desk and asked why I didn't pick him up, and I simply reminded him of the fuel-money agreement.  Then the penny dropped and he shuffled away huffily.  He was a complete chancer and thought he was smarter than he was, so I didn't give him a second chance.  We never really spoke afterwards.\n\nAfter that, he continued to cycle to and from work, and  I really enjoyed the times when I drove past him on that long steep hill and the weather was inclement!

I also had a friend who worked in the same office and we could carpool, as her home was on the way to mine (so it was no big deal).\n\nAs it happens, another co-worker (Karen) from our office lived really close to my friend. When she found out about our carpool arrangement she wanted in. She guilted my friend in to asking me and, since it was on my way anyway, I said ok.\n\nWell, around this time time my husband's car was in the shop, so I had been making detours to pick him up. My husband was a giant of a man (6'3\") and could not physically fit in the back; so to make things easier my friend would just sit in the back instead.\n\nKaren was a big woman, though not tall, so on the way home one day she got in the front. I explained to her she has to sit In the back, which she did.\n\nWe got to my husband's jobsite and, right after I park, Karen jumped out of the car and got the front seat. I told her to go to the back, and she strait-up said 'no', because the seatbelt in the back was too tight and hurt her chest.\n\nI told her it's to bad, and that she could get out of she doesn't like it. At this point, she got out and went to the back seat. My husband arrived and climbed in, and I started the car. Immediately the seatbelt warning light went off and started beeping; Karen had taken the seat belt off.\n\nI told her she needed put the belt on, and I was met with a 'No, I can't, It's easier if I sit in front.'\n\nI said to her we're not going anywhere until the belt is on. She crossed her arms like a child and said 'I guess we're not going anywhere'.\n\nI told her if she didn't put the belt on she could get out and walk home.\n\nWith a nice bit of snark she said 'well you better call me a taxi.' That pissed me off, so that's what I did, I called a taxi.\n\nShe then put her belt back on but I say it's to late, that she can either get out for the taxi, or I'd call the police.\n\nShe got out, then her jaw almost hit the road as we drove away.\n\nOutside of my friend, I never let anyone from work in my car again.\n\nEdit: English is my second language I usally type on word but am mobile and was pooping",

It was pretty good 4 days working 3 days off and the pay was decent. \n\nHowever most people didn't take their job seriously, they would call in sick or just not show up for work at all and especially on nights when there were 4 only 4 of us. If one person didn't show up you felt it. \n\n\nI was a star employee. I showed up early logged in and started working usually from 6:30. I Never took a sick day. Changed my holidays to fit the companies needs and worked any overtime they needed me to work. I was so dedicated to the my role that I had worked on multiple occasions 18 - 24 hours as people wouldn't show up for shifts and they needed cover. It was my first REAL job and I believed in the company. \n\nI used the train system to get to and from work and always planned out my routes around as much as I could to avoid being late however on this particular day they were running a reduced service due to breakdowns alot of the trains had been repaired using less than stellar parts and the wheels kept sticking to the track when they hit the brakes causing wearing on the wheels in specific spots. So ALOT of trains were out of commission. On top of that the train I was on had been stopped due to a signal issue for 15 - 20 minutes this led me to being late. I had shown up about 10 minutes late to the start of my shift. \n\nBefore I had even sat down my manager was giving me grief. Apparently they were mad because I had stopped other telephonists going home as someone had to work 10 extra minutes to cover my shift as 2 people were ill and couldn't make it in. Now I hate being late. I was already pissed off that I was late but my manager giving me trouble as soon as I walked through the door just irritated me even more. \n\nMy reply to him was as follows \"Apologies I was late however how many times have I ever been late? I show up 30 minutes before my shift every day. I have stayed late to covers days before the train had an issue and it was out of my control. I was stuck underground with no signal to call or text to let you know.\" \n\nMy manager didn't give a fuck their reply to me was \"You start at 7 you finish at 7. You are in early on your own time. Those times you have stayed behind you have been paid and no one asked you to.\"\n\n\"Okay then\" was my reply. \n\nThe next day was EXTREMELY busy. my colleague had left and only one of the morning guys had shown up for his shift to take over. As he sat down I began to pack up. At 7am on the dot I left. As I usually helped out when this happened everyone was surpised and had asked me where I was going. My only reply was \"I start at 7 I finish at 7.\" \n\nThis was my final shift and so I was off for the next few days.\n\nOn my first shift back I get pulled into the office by my manager with HR. They ask me why I left a single telephonist on their own. I looked at my manager and repeated the EXACT same words that were said to me. \"My manager informed me I start at 7 I finish at 7\" The look on HR's face was priceless. She WAS pissed. She already had a staff issue to deal with and on top of that one of her most helpful staff members had been mugged off by a manager. She told me to go back to my desk and she needed to speak to the manager in question. \n\n20 minutes later the manager came back in looking absolutely defeated. He never EVER said anything to me again about being late.",

I said nothing about it at all except to ask if everything was okay. Turns out he had a breakdown on the way to work, and had to Uber in the rest of the way, leaving his car on the side of the road. I had his car towed to his mechanic while he was at work, and personally gave him a ride there after his shift was done.\n\nGood employees should be treated well. He was never dinged for it, and when upper management asked why he clocked in so late, I told them it was approved by me.\n\nDid his lateness affect that day? Yes. A lot. Was he ever late before or again? No. If he had been late regularly, it would've been a different story.",

I am also attending college at night pursuing a BSME. On one occasion, I stayed up late studying for an exam the next day and slept straight through 3 alarms. I woke up with the sun shining in my window and had the \"fuck fuck fuck\" moment. I texted my boss and hauled ass to work. As I was getting my work orders together for the day, I was scarfing down breakfast. One of the other employees was bitching about how I showed up late and still got to eat my breakfast with no repercussions. Before I could say anything, the owner of the company stepped in and said \"because he shows up every morning an hour before he is supposed to, does whatever we ask him to, is on call every weekend, drops whatever he is doing to go to work if I call him, and doesn't ever complain about anything.

            "Because this thread is full of employees that work for a company where the managers don't see their effort, or let the lackluster performance of bad employees slide, I want you to know that the opposite situation does exist in the world.\n\n\nI hired three new employees that started within a few weeks of each other (two the same week). Two of the three are flat out amazing and I've already given one of them a raise *while they were on probation*. The third took time off sick during their second week on the job, and took even more time off sick a few weeks later. Since we only provide sick time after probation has completed, we were under no obligation to pay for any missed time. Instead, I worked out an arrangement with the employee where they could make about a quarter of the time up over the following three weeks, take some of the time as a mix of as yet unearned vacation and sick time, and only have a few days unpaid.\n\n\nTo thank me for working out this arrangement, the employee over the following weeks: showed up late on five different days (once as late as 3 hours past the start of their shift, claiming that they had witnessed a car accident and were required to stick around as a witness. It was a lie. When we looked into it, the pictures they sent us were from two different accidents, and taken on a completely different day at a completely different time); left early, unexcused on three separate occasions, not only failing to work the scheduled makeup hours for that day, but also failing to work their full shift; leaving early, or working so few hours that by the end of the period they were supposed to have made up only a small portion of the time owed, they actually owed the company even more time.\n\n\nTo prevent this employee's toxic behavior from infecting the rest of the staff, I fired this terrible employee less than two months into their probation. The weirdest thing about letting them go was that in the termination meeting they actually asked why they were being fired. Like it was baffling why we wouldn't tolerate this behavior and were letting them go.\n\n\nThere are companies/managers out there that will recognize good effort and punish bad. If the company you work for isn't one of them, spend time and effort seeing if you can change managers or companies. It's not worth working somewhere you're disrespected or unappreciated.",

It happens.         \n\n>  I Never took a sick day.    \n\nSo you came into work sick and risks getting others sick, or you just got lucky and never got sick? People are allowed to be sick, thinking otherwise is messed up. It is up to the **business** to build in enough slack to allow a sick employee to be sick, if the business cannot handle a single sick employee then they're under-staffing the position.    \n\nFar too many employees have these kind of unhealthy attitudes, which boil down to siding with their employer over their colleagues. Unless you're an owner of this business, this attitude is irrational. And I feel like this whole story is part of OP's journey but they still haven't realized their attitude towards their colleagues was wrong, they're blaming their colleague's for the business's failings.",

You shouldn't have to walk on eggshells to stop your boss from being a bad boss of course, but still just makes me realise how the ultimate revenge is tricking your boss into thinking that they aren't allowed to push you around so much, manipulate your interactions with them so that they don't comfortable chewing you out over nothing or bringing up your negatives while your positives still outweigh those negatives. It's not nice to manipulate people but for things like this it's easier in the long run, and besides it's not \"real you\" manipulating them to make your own life easier, it's \"work you\".",

I wasn't bad at academics, but saved my competitive streak for more important things like kicking my friends' asses at Street Fighter.\n\n\nAnyway, the morning of the math test, I felt absolutely unwell. The conversation went something like this:\n\n\n\"Mom, I don't feel good. I need to stay home.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\n(She's from India, they straight up don't accommodate sick days. Hopefully it's changed since. I tried to explain America is more chill about these things, but somehow it didn't work.)\n\n\nSo I sped through the test, handed it in, ran out the door - with permission - and vomited in the first toilet I got to. Yeah, definitely going home for the day.\n\n\nAs a result of subpar performance on said test, my grade for the quarter was an A-.\n\n\nCue mom: \"An A- is the same as a B+! You need to do better!\"\n\n\nI was pretty salty about the situation with the test, so like any 11yo with cable and my own room, I binge watched Toonami instead of paying attention to my math homework* for the rest of that semester.\n\n\nShockingly at the end of it, I had a B+.\n\n\nMom wasn't pleased.\n\n\nSome kind of generic yelling later, I came back with: \"It's the same as an A-.\"\n\n\nWelcome to the commutative property, mom.\n\n\n\nTl;dr: mom tries to get me to do better at school, but phrases it in a way that justifies doing worse\n\n*Edit - I still did my homework, I'm not a maniac.",

If they demand a doctor's note, go after them to cover the cost.  They're the ones needing it.  They are a business.  They can afford it \n\n2. Businesses should be giving paid sick leave.  Sick workers destroyed efficiency and productivity.  Letting one person stay home sick with pay is likely going to cost less than an entire office trying to concentrate while they're sick as fuck.  7-10 paid sick days a year should be a standard minimum.",

            "When I was a freshman in high school, I had a geology teacher who was so tough that in her 30ish years of teaching she had only ever given one A, and she had the nickname of \"Dr B\\*\\*ch\" from the students.\n\nI worked my *ass* off to try to get a B. I got a C+. My father went nuts, I literally got screamed at for 4 hours. \n\nAfter that, I realized that no matter what I did, no matter how hard I worked, I'd never succeed in her class, my father would go nuts, and I didn't need that class to graduate. So I did *nothing*. Not one damned thing. I didn't do the studying. I didn't do the homework. When she handed out a test, I signed my name at the top and turned it in blank. I didn't answer any questions in class. I put all the mental energy that would have gone into that class into doing well in my other classes. (And indeed, I got As in all my other classes.) \n\nThat second quarter, I got a D+. My father went nuts and screamed at me for 4 hours. I couldn't get a word in edgewise to explain that the fact that I got a D+ proved that grades were arbitrary because I should have gotten an F-, he just wanted to scream at me. \n\nThe next quarter I continued to do nothing. I figured, I was going to get screamed at for 4 hours either way, so why bother? I got an F+. My father completely lost his mind at me and literally spit in my face. (At that I walked out of the house for a few hours and we didn't speak to each other for several days.)\n\nThe next quarter (the fourth) I continued to do nothing. I got a D+. My father screamed at me for a couple hours before I finally got through to him that the fact that my grades went up and down while I did *nothing at all* proved that the grades were arbitrary. When he finally realized what I was saying to him, he went sheet white and shut up. He didn't apologize, he just left the room. The next day he went into the school and yelled at the principal. It did nothing, but at least he wasn't screaming at *me* any more. \n\nI don't know if he ever realized that this is what he gets for incentivizing me badly.",
