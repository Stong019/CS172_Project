        "selftext": "This happened when I was 16 years old and just got my drivers' License.  My parents had me run to the store to pick up some groceries.  I stopped by my friend's house on the way back home for maybe 5 minutes to show him I got my license and I was out driving alone.  It was a really fun moment in the life of a 16 year old.\n\nMy stepmom Mary Ann freaked out. \"We did not give you permission to drive to Bill's house!  We told you to go to the store and that is ALL!\"  I told Mary Ann and my dad that they had let me drive to Matt's house the day before, so I didn't think it was a big deal. \n\nThey went unreasonable and laid down the unbendable rule that set up the Malicious Compliance.  \"You are not allowed to drive anywhere we do not give explicit permission for you to drive.  Period, end of sentence.  Just because you were allowed to do it previously does not ever give you permission another time.  Ever.\"\n\nFast forward three days later.  My 13 year old stepsister has been a jerk to me all day, and I'm sick of her BS.  She goes quiet for about 30 minutes and then comes out all sticky sweet.  \"Hey Brian, it's time to take me to ballet.\"   \n\nI have taken her to ballet 3 days a week since I got my license.  It's basically one of my chores.  But I see my opportunity to say \"Screw you!\" to all three of them at once.  \"Sorry, Tina.  I'm not allowed to take you to ballet.  The parents didn't tell me to take you, and I don't want to get in trouble!\" \n\nShe screams, she cries, she begs, she threatens.  She calls her mom and leaves a message.  She calls my dad and leaves a message.  Just like Steve Miller says, \"Time keeps on slippin', into the future.\"  I'm not sure I'm brave enough to hang on to the bitter end and actually go through with it.  I'm shaking, but I know I've got them dead to rights.   No call back from the parents and the clock goes on past the start of her class.\n\nStepmom comes home and Tina runs to meet her.  \"Tina, what are you doing here?  You're supposed to be at ballet!\" \n\nI hear Tina tell her rendition of the story, leaving out how miserable she had been, and they go back and forth.  Mary Ann comes pounding down the hall and yells (as God is my witness) \"You just wait 'til your FATHER gets home!\"  I had to stifle a laugh because I never really believed people actually said that.\n\nAn hour later Dad comes home and the TWO of them go running out to meet him and tell him how horrible I was.  I wait in my room for the hammer to fall.  About 10 minutes later my dad calls down the hall, \"Brian, would you please come here and talk to us?\"\n\n\"Well, Brian, you did it.\"  \"What do you mean, Dad?\" \n\n \"You got us all, and there's absolutely nothing we can do about it. OK, let's make this reasonable for everyone. ..\"\n\nAnd they did.  They agreed that they were over-the-top.  They recognized that Tina isn't always very nice to me, and they spoke to her about that.  I was allowed to have reasonable freedom if I was driving somewhere, since I had good grades and had never been in trouble.  I walked down the hall back to my room, my back to my parents, with the world's biggest grin on my face.",

            "I was kind of hoping the story was that they specifically told you to go to the store but didn\u2019t specify that you were to come back home.  So you sat in the store parking lot for hours",

            "I told my kids that if they ever do something wrong\\break something that as long as they don't lie to me they would not be punished. Fast forward a few months and one of my kids broke a window, I was fuming, but she came to me and before I asked she said she broke the window and it was an accident. Fuck. So I thanked her for being honest sent her to her room to watch TV and had to eat my anger.",
            "Man, when my stepmother said \"just wait until your father gets home\" it never ended well for me. I'm glad he saw the real issue and understood what you were doing. That's some solid parenting there.",

            "The battle in my house was over passengers. \n\nI could go out for a drive any time I liked, so long as I was home on time and that I wasn't driving around with people I hadn't told my parents about. She was strict about it, too; I once got grounded for driving my coworker home when her car wouldn't start. \n\nThen we had a power outage, and both my brother and I slept late. As I'm eating breakfast in an attempt to make myself late enough to miss all of first period I get an idea. My brother always took the bus to hang out with his friends (and being driven around by your embarrassing older brother is so not cool), so Mom didn't know I'd be driving him.\n\n>Me: Hey, Bro. You want to stay home today?\n\n>Bro: Sure, but Mom will kill me,\n\n>Me: Naw, she'll blame me. Just you wait.\n\nSo I call Mom's work. Voice mail, she's on another call. I ring my step-dad's, he's out and can't be reached.\n\nGreat! \n\n>Me: It's done, Bro. Go back to bed if you want, I gotta leave or I'll be late for second period. Just don't answer the phone. \n\nThat night at dinner was tense. Mom wanted to know why I didn't drive Bro in, though she framed it as \"I know you're not his keeper, but..\".\n\nI out and out admitted to telling him to go back to bed.\n\n>Mom: Why would you do that?!?!\n\n>Me: I couldn't reach you for permission to drive him, and he looked tired.\n\nThe look on her face was *scary*.\n\n>Mom: He's your brother. He's not some random person I don't know.\n\n>Me: You know all my friends and coworkers, and I can't drive them either.\n\nI was expecting to be told I was grounded, but instead she just sort of sputtered for a second before telling me we'd have to discuss this later.\n\nNever actually did, but she also never bitched at me for driving home coworkers or teammates again.",
            "Sounds like they laid down the law out of reactive fear for you (it\u2019s scary when your kid becomes old enough to drive!), and your dad later understood that that wasn\u2019t the way to do it. They should have figured all that out before you got your license. I think you handled it great and so did your dad.",
            "This is a weird world. I had older friends and family that literally drove me to work when I was 15 so I could save up and buy a car at 16. \n\nBought my 2 colored POS ford for $1200. Dad was pretty proud when he signed the title.\n\n rules. Or the car is gone.\n\n Answer when I call you, no excuses.\nKeep your grades up\nStay out of trouble.\nYou better keep a job (16yo and literally forced to work now or the car gets taken) bittersweet for sure. Grades definitely suffered bc the restaurant industry takes no prisoners.\nBe home by 8 every week night.\nGive my parent the insurance money every month. ( We're talking 2004 money here) I was added to the family plan and I had to pay the difference in from the old rate to the new rate. Which was alot. Im still salty about this 17 years later.\n\nI made 5.15 an hour. Car insurance was $200 month for full coverage. I worked my ass off. Even holding 2 jobs in the summer because of labor laws.. I lived 20 miles from work. I was pretty broke but I could afford insurance and gas and that was about it.\n\nDay I turned 18 the car was signed over to me. I dropped off the family insurance. Went straight to my own and straight to liability. Went from 200 a month to 50/mo. Got rear ended a month later and got a 1800 check from their ins. Sold the beater and banked the check. Put that down on my first motorcycle. Rest is history.\n\nAnd yes. I realized fast that first year i would have paid more in insurance than I bought the fooking beater for. And constantly moaned about this. I paid 200 a month for a 90HP 5speed rust box  while my sister paid 75 a month for full coverage in a slushbox dodge neon that would suck the paint off my car. She was 3 years older. I was pissed. Then my younger sis jumped on the fam plan and had nothing but praise about how cheap her insurance was.\n\nStill to this day I wonder if I was extorted by my parents or if Insurance companies literally HATE 16yos driving  rusty ford escort manuals.",
            "Malicious Compliance: Complete. Well done, OP.\n\nDad is also a hero here, as he recognized that OP did everything right and maliciously. Good on him.",
            "The secret villain of this tale is suburban planning. It\u2019s crazy that one of the perks of being 16 is that you suddenly have the ability to purchase groceries. \n\nAnyone without access to a car in the typical North American suburb is stuck on an island without a boat, totally reliant on others for basic sustenance.\n\nWe can design suburbs way better! We don\u2019t have to get rid of them. The main problem is massive parking lots spreading everything out. Reduce the parking need by adding light rail, zone some concentrated walkable shops and residences, and possibly avoid stepmom\u2019s wrath when it\u2019s time to visit a friend!",
            "Props to your dad for owning up to it.\n\nNot gonna lie, if my kid pulled something like this, i'd have been proud as hell, lmao.",
            "Good for you. My parents never would have admitted they were wrong; they simply would have added additional punishments.",
            "What a total dad. Great story.",
            "Reminds me of when I got in trouble with my mom for being out past legal curfew at my friend's 18th birthday party...with a bunch a nerds who didn't drink at all yet...less than a ten minute drive from home...less than two weeks before I turned 18 myself.",
            "Wow, props to your dad for recognizing the absurdity of the situation and correcting it in a reasonable way.",
            "I love how this story ended. You have a good father. He realized his mistake and I have to wonder if there was some pride in this. I bet he was thinking, \u201cthat\u2019s my boy\u201d lol. \nAnyway, good story. Thanks for posting.",

            "am i missing something in the timeline? you just got your license, and told your friend about it. 3 days later this blowup happens...but you've been driving your sister to ballet 3 days a week since you got your license, as a regular chore?",
            "I don't understand. The story says Tina asks you to take her to the ballet 3 days after you got your license. But then you then say \"I have taken her to ballet 3 days a week since I got my license\". How were you taking her to class before getting your license? And why could you do that again?",
            "This is great - and reminds me of some of my own teenage MC. \n\nBackstory: I grew up in a rural suburb, so cars were pretty much the only way to get to any actual social gathering event (mall, movies, etc.) My parents didn\u2019t like carting me around, so, I often was getting driven around with friends by their older siblings or by some of our older friends. No accidents, nothing. All was fine. \n\nBut, for some reason - at some point in late middle school, suddenly my parents came up with a rule that I wasn\u2019t allowed to drive with anyone who \u201cwas new to having their license\u201d until I had my learner\u2019s permit. There was no definition for what \u201cnew\u201d exactly meant. But, they did make it clear that it meant no longer being able to ride with older friends or friends\u2019 older siblings (who again - were often tasked with driving us around) - even if they were in their 20s and people I had driven with for years! (That is - Unless I got permission from my parents first, which they rarely gave\u2026) It was the MOST annoying rule. Especially since it seemed to come out of nowhere. And would change from day to day\u2026 (I have two older sisters who never had such a rule\u2026 and there was no catalyst for it\n- that I know of anyway.)\n\nI do get that they probably just wanted to keep me safe since teenage deaths from car accidents are kind of high where I grew up. But, they never explained it as such. Plus, I was actually a good kid who just wanted to hang out with friends - we had clean, not too thrilling fun. Not to mention, my parents still refused to drive me anywhere and my sisters were out of the house by then, so I was often stuck at home just because of this random rule. (It really did pretty much ruin my social life.) \n\nThen one day, I saw my next door neighbor/one of my best friends driving down the street. He was two years older than me and actually was a bit of a troublemaker. (He typically ran with a different crowd, but we had been friends since we were very little and stayed close despite having different friends groups.) \n\nWell, his parents refused to let him get his license, so I was surprised to see him driving. He pulled over when he saw me.\n\nMe: So, you got your license?!\n\nHim: No, but I know how to drive\u2026 so, here I am. Wanna ride?\n\nAnd - cue many many instances of MC til I got my temps. I wasn\u2019t allowed to drive with anyone who was new to getting their license\u2026 But, my friend simply didn\u2019t have one - so he didn\u2019t fall in that criteria! I never told my parents that I rode with him, but if I ever got caught - I was ready with my flawless logic.",
            "And then will bitch and moan he never visits when he moves out.",
            "He finally realised that his son was a punching bag and it needed to stop.\n\nHooray!",
            "That\u2019s awesome. Now try that at work with one of the Exectutives. Happened to me. My COO wanted to control my day so I had to check in at the headquarters to start my day to account for my start time. About a week later, my CEO needed me to come out to his cottage to fix their internet by 10am for an important meeting. Normally I would have started early and left from my house but because I was explicitly told that I must check in at 9:30, before going anywhere, I did exactly what I was told. \n\nGo my to work, checked in and told him that I now need to drive 2.5 hours to the CEO\u2019s cottage for a 10 am meeting. Well 10:05 rolls around and the CEO calls me and asked where I was. I told him I was on my way but I had to check in with COO before I could leave. The CEO wasn\u2019t impressed, put me on hold and 5 minutes later got back on the line and said get here when you can and get the internet fixed. \n\nWhen I returned, the COO pulled me into his office and rescinded his new rule for checking in. Found out the CEO had an unpleasant conversation about micromanaging and placing demands where they weren\u2019t needed.",

            "I was hoping this was going to be about how you never put gas in your car because your parents never explicitly told you to drive to the gas station. So then your car dies while running one of their errands and you have to call them to come get you because it's not your fault they never said you could go to the gas station. Lol.

            "My little cousin is probably the sweetest and most honest person I know. Yet, for some reason, her parents low-jacked her car and set the most stringent rules for her I'd ever seen. Only allowed to drive to and from school, except with explicit permission. Had to give text updates every 30 minutes. Couldn't be more than 5 minutes late, otherwise would be grounded. Couldn't have any friends in the car *ever*. I sincerely don't understand why parents are so freaking protective of their children. If you can't even test the waters of freedom, how can be prepared for when you have it all thrown in your lap at once? A little trust goes a long way, and makes everyone happier in the long run.",
            "Beautiful! I'm so glad your dad not only had your back but also recognised that the original request was unreasonable. \n\n(The only thing missing from this story was sticking your tongue out to your stepsister. Hopefully there were other opportunities for this)",

            ">\"You are not allowed to drive anywhere we do not give explicit   \npermission for you to drive.  Period, end of sentence.  Just because you  \n were allowed to do it previously does not ever give you permission   \nanother time.  Ever.\"\n\nMy kids (my own, not my stepchildren) give me flack because I will say \"period\" at the end of statements when I'm mad.  They've pointed to several memes and clips online and I've for the most part stopped doing it, unless it is for comedic effect.  \n\nWhen you create a \"rule\" like this, as a parent you are only setting stage for a war.  Battles will be won and lost on both sides, but this is flat out nuclear warfare.  My wife and I forbid our oldest from meeting up with boys we didn't approve of.  That ended well.  She sneaked her way out of the house one evening through her bedroom window and met up with a teenage boy of questionable moral and legal behavior.  She was \"smart\" enough to leave her iPhone in her bedroom, which then led to us (wife, her younger brother, and I) not being able to track her.  It wasn't until the mom got a hold of the daughter's friends that we figured out where she was.  Eventually the friends flipped on her, and told her she better get home.  \n\nBy that point I had already driven through town and saw no sign of her.  Her brother was crying that he would never see her again (he was 10) and I was fighting fear of having lost a child over how I would conduct myself when I saw her return.  She eventually returned, and walked into the house like I probably would have at that age - knowing fully well I was in trouble and no matter how I carried myself I was going to be punished so why not have a shit grin?\n\nThe wife and I have been infamously known locally as the parents who gave their child a flip phone as punishment after said child went online and started talking to strangers.  A flip phone doesn't prevent texting, or calling for that matter, those very same people she did on her iPhone.  And one could argue the low-tech punishment allowed her to escape more easily.  But we followed through, and it demonstrated to her that if we set a punishment, we are going to follow through with it.  This mattered very little in the end, because it wasn't a month after she had the flip phone for the better part of a year that she sneaked out of the house. \n\nThere is always a \"better\" way of addressing things.  Since she is our first, our daughter has been on the receiving end of our less than perfect judgment at times.  We have a rule now with our daughter that if she changes locations we have to be notified by text.  It's a cat and mouse game now where she conveniently turns off Find My on her iPhone or puts the device in battery saver mode and prevents her location from being shared in real-time.  She would honestly be allowed more freedom if she just kept us updated.  If someone were to ask us where our kid is at, we want to be able to confidentially say we know where she is.  That does not in turn mean we are policing the activity going on then - she could say she is doing one thing when the reality is another.",

I ask her what I can get her, and she says she\u2019d like an omelette. We have a list of pre-built omelettes, or you can build your own, so I ask her how she\u2019d like her omelette. \u201cJust a regular omelette, please\u201d she tells me. \n\n\u201cOkay, so you don\u2019t want one of the signature omelettes, what would you like inside of yours?\u201d I ask\n\n\u201cNothing, just a regular omelette.\u201d She replies with a huff \n\nI pause for a second because this order does occur, but not often. Some people like their eggs scrambled and cooked, then rolled up. \u201cSo you\u2019d like an omelette with nothing inside?\u201d \n\n\u201cYES! A plain omelette!\u201d She snaps, now irritated that I\u2019ve questioned her several times. \n\nSo I enter the order, a 5-egg omelette with no fillings and no toppings. A few minutes later it comes out, and she is appalled. \u201cWhat is THIS?!\u201d \n\nYour plain omelette, I reply...\n\n\u201cBut where is the cheese, or the ham or the onions?!\u201d. She is irate. \n\n\u201cMa\u2019am, you ordered an omelette with nothing inside...\u201d \n\nShe gets cocky and says \u201cAn omelette is eggs rolled up with ham, cheese, and onions! Everything else is extra! You should know this, working at a breakfast place!\u201d\n\nI look at her deadpan and inform her \u201cactually, ma\u2019am, omelette is French for scrambled eggs that are fried and rolled or folded; everything else is extra\u201d\n\nI\u2019m busy so I walk off and help other colorful customers, meanwhile she flags down a manager to complain, who confirms what I told her and points out that in the menu there is, very specifically, a ham cheese and onion omelette  with a large picture in the middle of the page. Then tells her she has to re-order her meal and wait a second time. \n\nShe didn\u2019t leave a tip.",

            "Reminds me of my ex-MIL. She used the word \"regular\" to mean what she wanted. At a fast food restaurant if she was asked if she wanted a small, medium, or large size drink, her answer was \"regular\" (not one of the choices she was given). If her husband ordered a steak at a restaurant she would get mad at him and tell him that he's supposed to order something \"regular.\" I feel like the word \"regular\" is sometimes used to mean \"what I am thinking of\" or \"what I am used to\" or \"what I believe to be average\". We cannot read your minds and what is \"regular\" to you may not be \"regular\" to the person you are talking to! \"Regular\" is a vague term and should not be used when you have something precise in mind.",

They revealed that the proteins in eggs bound with excess water and were less runny than when you used milk or no liquid, and give a better finished product.\n\nSo F you home-ec teacher!\n\nOh yea, and omlet is not ingredient base, but technique based - whisk it until it's frothy and then cook it with minimal movement unti it's time to flip.",

I was assisting a company manager with a project and my hotel was near his regular office in the Theater District.\n\nIf you are not familiar, the Theater District is heavily built for tourists. Restaurants are generally kind of fancy and expensive. There were really not any quick and cheap options for dining in that area. The company had a generous meal policy of up to $30-40 meal for travel expenses. I did use that for a bit, but the food got to feeling too indulgent and kind of ridiculous given it was an extended assignment. Also I was working really long hours and did not want to go sit in restaurants- I just wanted to go watch tv and sleep in my room.\n\nSo after the first week or so, I instead went to a grocery store on Monday night. I bought some basics for cereal, sandwiches and snacks, and some frozen meals I could microwave for lunch in the office. It cost about $60. I then took a few cans of soda from my hotel fridge to make room for my weekly food purchase , and returned them before checking out at the end of the week. And that was it for food costs, with an occasional meal out here or there. I did the same the next four weeks, submitted my expense report at the end of the month. You know where this is going\u2026\n\nA lady from accounting called, and refused to reimburse my expenses because $60 is more than $40, the max allowance for a meal purchase. I explained that had covered 5 days of food but was told it didn\u2019t matter.\n\nI then spent the next month trying all the food in the neighborhood. There really were not any cheap options. I went out to eat a few mornings, lunch whenever I found time, and dinner absolutely every day. I could have bought a few installments of groceries but the once/week shopping convenience was part of why I\u2019d wanted them. It had also seemed wasteful for me to go out for an expensive meal every night for long term travel, but now I\u2019d been told that was preferred by accounting to my grocery bills!\n\nThe next month, I got a call from my NYC manager asking how I\u2019d run through more budget every week of the month than the entire month before combined. I explained the grocery situation, and he thanked me and hung up. About 10 minutes later, that same lady from accounting called me to tell be they\u2019d pay my still-not-reimbursed grocery bill and any going forward as long as the daily amount averaged for the week was under the aggregate meal allowance. \n\nI happily returned to a more reasonable diet.",

ANYTHING outside of the rules on one line would cause your entire expense report to be rejected and it could take 6-8 weeks to get it revised. \n\nI went with any other guy from my location and before we left the last guy who went gave us a \u201ccheat sheet\u201d of all the local restaurants and how to make \u201cspecial orders\u201d.

I'm salaried, so it didn't matter on hours.\n\nWas given 48 hours to prep for a 12 day trip, Columbia to Albany to Syracuse and then back home.  Flight from CAE to ALB, then rental car, drive to Syracuse, drive *back* to Albany, then back home.  Round trip flight, Delta was the required airline, Hertz required rental (medium sedan,) Hilton Garden was the required accommodation, etc.  Because of the short notice, the economy seat flight and one checked bag was $973.41, rental was $611.03, gas and tolls cost an additional $99.57.  Transportation costs, reimbursed without question was $1684.01.\n\nHad I driven, the mileage paid would have been about $1030, plus another $12.20 in tolls.

Basically \"we'll cover your meals just don't eat steak and lobster every night.\"\n\nI was at a job for two weeks at a remote ski resort. Closest town was 30 minutes away. For lunch break there was one restaurant at the resort and it wasn't cheap. Kinda fancy and knew it was the only dining option around so they took advantage of that. I ate lunch there the first day and it was close to $50 with tip. So when I drove back to town for the night I hit a grocery store and bought a pack of buns, some deli meat, a pack of sliced cheese and a case of bottled water. Ate that for lunch for the rest of the week and it cost me like $20.\n\nI submit my expenses when I go home Friday and when I'm back out there Monday my boss calls me to remind me I'm not allowed to expense groceries under any circumstances. The contract states meals only. I explain to him what I did and he says it doesn't matter.\n\nI ate lunch at that restaurant every day that 2nd week and probably spent $300.

When I got to town I was horrified at how much a rental car was a day, close to $100/day with taxes and shit, so I called around and found a local car dealer that would rent me one for $20/day which included insurance (that's important). I literally hitched a ride from the airport and left the dealer in a brand new car with like 7 miles on it. I drove the crap out of it for 3 weeks and the total bill was less than $500. I also ate on the cheap while there and when I turned my expenses in I got a shitty note from accounting about NOT renting from Hertz, who was our \"approved\" supplier. My bosses bosses bosses boss, who was an executive VP, had to approve it before I got reimbursed. \n\nA couple of months later I had to go back for another tour. I flew in, rented from Hertz, DECLINED the loss damage waiver per the accounting departments instructions and left. Every single day I had the full breakfast bar at the hotel, which was NOT included in the room rate, or ate a full breakfast at a local restaurant. Every day at lunch I had an extra large pizza with everything delivered to be plant and simply let the guys there eat it since I wasn't hungry, which was a powerful motivating force btw. And for dinner I had the surf and turf at the local supper club next door to the hotel and what I couldnt eat I fed to the cats that hung around. After about a week I had like 20 cats waiting to be fed filet mignon and lobster every night. I even bought a big bag of cat food which attracted even more cats. And the icing on the cake was when I wrecked the rental car, and since I had declined the LDW per policy the company had to eat like $6k in repairs and \"loss of use\" in addition to the $2k in rental fees. I turned in my expenses and they paid everything without batting an eye but when the bill hit the VP's desk he had a shit fit. He came to me personally, asked me what the fuck I did to run up such a bill and I told him the whole story. He just stood there with a dumb look on his face then started laughing. He explained a lot of financial shit to me about operating expenses and how it's basically all a tax write off then went back to the main office and fired the accounting manager. \n\nAbout a week after I got back I got a letter from one of the engineers with a newspaper clipping of a story about an army of hungry cats around the hotel and supper club begging for food and trying to get inside and shit.

I'm not completely sure why, but she would go out of her way to make my life miserable. Demoted me to an overnight shift but wouldn't give me a reason, changed my shift around on a whim without notice (once changed my schedule for the next day after I had left without telling me, then wrote me up when I didn't show up on time). Stuff like that. She was a monster. So I was looking for another job.\n\nWell I found one, and I went in to give her my 2 weeks notice. This happened to be in the middle of a mass exodus for the company, as I was the 5th person to quit over the course of about 3-4 weeks. Morale was very low, and whenever anyone quit she would buy pizza for everyone instead of addressing why the place was so miserable and people were leaving. \n\nAfter I gave my 2 weeks, she said \"Don't tell anyone you're leaving.\" So I said OK, and walked out of her office and announced to all my coworkers \"Hey, guess what everyone! You're all getting pizza!\" and they instantly knew what had happened. She was very unhappy and I felt great. I served out the rest of my 2 weeks and she never spoke to me again.",

Those expectations are set by policy, consistent enforcement of that policy with everyone, and a discussion had with the employee before discipline escalates. \n\nPoor leadership like this is why I won\u2019t leave my role in leadership. I can\u2019t fix everything, but I can help people within my realm of influence. I really suggest that anyone with the desire to change things for the better go into leadership themselves.

        "selftext": "I had a manager who hated reading emails and would miss important issues/meetings because of it. I even suggested text to speech to make it less unpleasant but he told me off. He spent a lot of time \"playing golf with clients\" and was mostly inaccessible. It got to the point where most of the team cc-ed me (I was next on the totem pole) so I could grant approvals for stuff like expense reports and help out on projects my manager was supposed to work on.\n\nWhen I was getting married I requested 3 weeks off for my honeymoon (EVERYONE knew I was getting married, manager even congratulated me on the engagement when it happened). I had 5 weeks vacation accumulated and didn't think it would be a big deal, especially since I was requesting it nearly \\~8 weeks in advance.\n\nThen a \"vacation request denied\" email comes in from our \"time off\" system. I emailed manager following up, left voice mails, and after a week he finally replied to an email,  \"Look, we need dedicated people, if you think you can take 3 weeks off for a vacation, you need to reconsider your position here.\" Keep in mind, my request stated \"Vacation request for honeymoon.\"\n\nI replied with \"No consideration needed, my last day will be <date in 3 weeks>. Let me know about transitioning duties.\" I forward this to HR, cc'ing manager and HR sets up my exit interview, but HR tells my manager to setup transition for my responsibilities. During my notice period, I even replied-all to this email twice, asking about transition plans, since I didn't get any transition plan...\n\nI tell my team, they ask manager what to do with my duties and manger says he'll think about it but doesn't do anything nor email anything out.\n\nFour weeks later, I get a call from my old boss, \"Are you planning on coming in this week?\"\"Why would I?\"\"Because you work for me?\"\"Not as of last week.\"\"Stop messing around, get your ass in the office.\"\"I told you my last day when you denied my vacation request.\"\"How about giving proper notice and transitions?\"\"HR asked you to develop a transition plan and to attend my exit interview. It's not my fault you don't read all your emails.\"\n\nI hang up and block his number, but screenshot the call log and sent it to the HR contact with an innocent, \"Should I be worried <old manager> thinks I still work for him?\"\n\nFallout:Things went from bad to worse for my old manager.  Apparently I was doing most of his managerial duties, so he actually had to try and get stuff done himself. He also got into some legal issues (those client golf outings? he played golf...but not with clients) that made his termination \"with cause,\" so no severance for him.\n\nI ended up at a competitor with a nice bump in pay. I wanted to start after my honeymoon but new company really wanted my help on a pitch.  I joined for several weeks, reworking \\~1/3 of the pitch and then went on my honeymoon for three weeks (they paid me for the entire time off - that garnered a lot of good will from both me and my wife).  I only left the company because mrs and I moved cross-country and they didn't have remote positions back then.  \n\n\nETA: Thank you for the awards!   \nI don't have the all the details but know old manager had to hire lawyer**s** to deal with legal issues related to his dismissal and the expenses.  \nClarification: This happened in the late 2000s. Mrs and I are still married.",

I approved of course, but in a call later with the CEO -- she said, I can only congratulate her, but this is terrible planning. Imagine the load on the remaining team when she's not around. Thankfully, she didn't say anything to my team member. \n\nMy question is, why can't we just be happy about people instead of making a scene about oh who's gonna handle your workload. Isn't it the company's concern to ensure people can take their entitled leaves? \n\nCorporate culture sucks. \ud83d\ude11",
            "It's funny how people who are barely functioning adults weasel their way into managerial jobs.",
            "I'm glad for you OP!\n\nOn one of my jobs, my (extremely boomer) boss insisted that we should arrive at least 30 minutes earlier because she believed that the clients shouldn't see the employees arringing to work after them. One of the colleagues arrived like 45 minutes earlier to suck up a bit.\n\nI have to mention that people who would arrive earlied did no work whatsoever, they would just sit, waiting to start working - also the boss would always hold them up by chatting, so they would usually start working 10-15 minutes late, and they would later get criticized for keeping the clients waiting. And if they said that they have to go - they would be \"rude\".\n\nAnyways, when negotiating my employment, I was extremely up-front that I will be starting my work on time, however, I won't be arriving 30 minutes early. And the type of contact was similar to part-time, pay was good, however, I only got basic health care. Because of the type of contract, there was no 2 weeks notice.\n\nI do have to say that when covid began I updated her business model, and basically saved the company since she was on the verge of closing it down and firing everybody. After literally saving her company, she started becoming increasingly hostile, once stating that I was trying to undermine her authority and things like that. Which was extremely far from the truth.\n\nNow that being \"late\" part. I am a bit OCD about some things, which translates to me never being late to work in my life so far. I live like 20 minutes (on foot)away from that workplace. It takes me less than 10 when cycling/driving. So i usually show up like 10 minutes early, set everything up and I start working the moment my shift starts.\n\nOne day, I arrive like 10 minutes before my shift starts, she starts criticizing me how i'm not a team player, how I'm always late, how others are parents but still make it 30-45 minutrs before the shift starts even if the have families at home waiting for them.\n\nI'm shocked but i keep it cool and say that we should keep it civil and that we can settle it in private.\n\nAfter that she continues having a meltdown and asks me what's my problem?\n \nTo which I say something like \"let's focus on your problem which is finding somebody to deal with 25 clients I have scheduled for today\", pack and leave the office.\n\nShe actually called me to berate me and order me to come back to which I told her not to call me again or I'll be reporting her for mobbing and harassment.\n\nAfter I left, within 2 months, all of my former coworkers have left her and now she is working with her husband and her daughter as employees. Heard that the are not having a fun time.\n\nAnd, like 3 weeks after I quit, started working for a new company, for double the salary, amazing benefits, 2 types of health insurance and I just got my second promotion, and I'm working from home, most likely won't be going back to office, even after the pandemic ends.\n\nAnd I have like 32 days off per year, plus paid leave, the job is stress free and most importantly amazing management that really values us and are doing their best to help us achieve our goals and are actively working on our development. And we also have mental health days - how cool is that? Used them a few times - said I'm feeling kinda stressed, and day off got approved right away, and nobody even mentioned it when evaluation came up.\n\nIt's not always easy, but going out of your comfort zone can really be a life-changing experience.",

Was denied, told I couldn't take both weeks under any circumstances.   He even told me I couldn't take EITHER week during the summer months, we were short on people in my role and summer was a busy time.   \n\nSo instead, I took one week in April and one in May (wedding was in July).   Turned in my 2 week notice 2 weeks before the wedding (it would have taken 8 weeks to properly train a replacement).   And interviewed for new jobs.    Got back from my honeymoon and started my new job the next day.   Oh yeah, the new job also paid $6k a year more.\n\n\n\n (Side note:   I had never taken even a single week of vacation in my 2 years working there.   First year, no vacation time given.   These 2 weeks were at the tail end of my second year.   And I requested the time off 6 months in advance.)",

He threatened to fire anyone who knew what was going on if they told on him and was bribing them to keep quiet.\n\nOn top of all that, he was keeping a separate account with one of our supply vendors and wasn't sending the invoices through his boss for approval.  This vendor sells higher-quality products and gives you free gifts at spending levels.  So, he would spend a ton of money on office/cleaning supplies with them and give the free gifts (things like a jacket with a sports team logo, a charcoal grill, a bluetooth speaker, coolers/mugs, etc.) to his subordinate girlfriend or to the office employees to keep them quiet about said girlfriend.  \n\nEventually, someone made an anonymous call to HR and blew the whistle on what he was doing.",

        "selftext": "So, when I was living in the city, I had a contract with my internet provider. (Rogers, for my fellow Canadians) After a year in my apartment I decided to move in with my then-boyfriend (now-husband) on a farm. A farm on a dirt road in the middle of nowhere. So I call to cancel my internet. \n\nMe: I need to cancel, I\u2019m moving-\n\nThem: (interrupting me) your service moves with you! You signed a contract for x years and it only ends early if we are unable to provide service!\n\nMe: you ARE unable to provide service, I\u2019m moving to a rural area. \n\nThem: not possible! We provide service to many rural communities. What\u2019s your new postal code? (I provide it) that\u2019s for townname. We have service in townname.\n\nMe: but I\u2019m not living in townname. That\u2019s just my postal address. Im living on a farm OUTSIDE of townname.\n\nThem: repeats contract speech, with the additional offer of an absurd buyout fee if I want to cancel my contract early \u201cwithout cause\u201d\n\n*cue malicious compliance*\n\nMe: fine! You know what, I would LOVE hi-speed internet instead of shitty satellite internet! When can you come?\n\nThe install guy had to call me three times from the van. Twice because he was lost and a third time because he was stuck in a snow drift. When he finally arrived it took him about 30 seconds to determine that there is obviously no infrastructure for hi-speed internet. I offered him hot coffee for his trouble coming out and he happily cancelled my service free of charge and accepted my equipment return. Cost Rogers a 3-4 hour call out when you count the drive, just to try to keep one impossible contract.\n\nEdit to add: Wow, this went a little crazy overnight! Thanks for all the upvotes and awards everyone! :)",

            "SMH. My relationship with Rogers unfortunately has been a hit and miss. Back in 2013, my boyfriend of 4 years was on my Rogers account. Unfortunately he passed away suddenly due to a heart attack in his sleep. You can imagine the pain and distress I\u2019m going through. I managed to get enough strength to call Rogers, requesting cancellation of his line. The rep proceeded to tell me how much it was going to cost to cancel his line. I took a deep breath and told him that the person whom the line was being used by is dead. Rep didn\u2019t even flinch and proceeded to repeat the same speech about cancellation. At this point I\u2019m just angry. I request to speak to a supervisor. One comes on the line after however long, I explain the situation to her, and guess what?! SHE PROCEEDS TO SAY THE SAME SHIT!!! At this point I\u2019m just crying angry tears. I request to cancel everything I have with them, which at the time, being a Uni student wasn\u2019t much. I found their corporate head office number and email, sent them a long email regarding my experience. Within a week, someone reached out, apologized for the prior people\u2019s insensitivity, offered up condolences, cancelled my boyfriends line and proceeded to provide my remaining services (which I believe was my cell phone and internet) 6 months of free service. I\u2019ve remained with them since. Of course I still have to deal with the occasional idiotic rep here and there, but once I get through to management, I end up with what I want.",

            "I briefly worked for Rogers and got a taste for how inflexibly asinine most of their policies were. Made it work *for* me once, though: when I got my first HDTV (dating myself here, but whatever), it came with a deal for a free HD cable box. So I called them up, they say they can ship it out in two weeks (no) or I can go pick one up at a store nearby. I say that sounds great, they give me three nearby locations with boxes in stock.\n\nAfter visiting them, it turns out *none* had any boxes in stock, and the employees complained that they had been trying to correct the false inventory for ages with no effect. I feel for them, give up on this, and call Rogers back to say \"fuck it, just mail me one in a few weeks\". But the person tells me that no, since I said I'd pick it up, I am now inexplicably ineligible to have one mailed out.\n\nI just say \"okay\" and hang up. Then I call back, and ask for Customer Retention. Customer Retention is the hellish department that you get transferred to when you try and cancel, whose internal metrics are solely based off of \"did the person cancel? if so, you did badly and can be fired\".\n\nSo they pick up, ready to be yelled at (since that's the norm for those calls). Instead, I calmly explain my current situation, and I can hear the person getting a bit confused. At the end of my explanation, they gently try and tell me that they're not the right department for this issue. I then correct them, asking what I am expected to do with TV service that no longer works on my TV.\n\nI can *hear* the gears turning. Because unlike 99% of the people who get sent to Customer Retention, I actually *wanted* to keep my service. I was a deliberate, easy win for this guy. **And,** Customer Retention actually has a shocking amount of flexibility in what they can do for customers (the kind of flexibility that customer support should have *before* people try and cancel).\n\nSo they suddenly ask, \"How's the signal on your cable TV?\" And I admit I'm confused, since I don't have it hooked up right now. \"Hmm. Sounds like there might be noise on the line. I'll have a tech sent out right away to check the cable for noise on the line, he can be there in under an hour. *Oh, and he'll also be able to give you a new HD Cable box.\"\n\nSure enough, in less than an hour, a Rogers van pulls up and the tech blatantly knows that he's being used as a delivery service. Hands off the box, half-asses checking the line, \"Yep, it's clean. Later.\" and heads off.\n\nRogers is a solid block of bullshit, *but* there are ways to exploit the beast.",
            "Got a similar story (different country), but I did actually move to a zone where they had service.\n\nThe issue, you ask? They didn't send the tech... THREE F&%$ing times!!!\n\nSo for about 3 weeks I had no service.\n\nCherry on top? they still charged me and refused to refund because \"the service was still working at the prior location\"\n\nFiled a complaint with regulatory authority. Funny thing, when got to the meeting (legal requirement) the ISP's lawyer didn't let me speak. She just called her company \"a bunch of imcompetent idiots\", gave me 2 months for free and 50% for the rest of the year.\n\nI bursted out telling her \"you cheated on me!, I was comming for a fight!\"",

            "I had a phone with rogers and decided to cancel that service and go on my moms. They didn't and texted promotional texts for years. I didn't notice because it was being sent to our accountant. They charged over 8,000 dollars in promotional texts and when we found out and tried to get the money back they offered us 150 dollars back. To say that we were pissed was an understatement. Then years later my mom's condo had a deal with rogers to provide cable tv. She returned one dvr and decided to only have one. We handed it into the store who lost it and then charged her for a DVR for years as well. I don't even know how much in fraudulent charges we've paid. I cannot stand them and am very vocal about how much I hate them. So I feel your pain.",

            "I cancelled our household internet 2 months ago. It took a few phone calls, and ended up with a rep crying and another rep giving me the what for. \n\nI read my bill one day, and decided to call in to add my husband to my account. It was supposed to be a siimple transaction, would have taken 5 minutes. However, before the rep came on the line, and automated message came on saying that our router wasn't going to work after a week. \n\nThe company provided router, that we paid extortion rates for was going to stop working in a week. I hung up and checked out my cellular plan. I re-read my internet bill, and made a snap decision. Going with my cellular provider would save us $500 US per year. \n\nOkie dokie. I called the ISP back, and again worked my way through their automated system. When I got to a rep, I asked to cancel my service. She asked why we were leaving them. I told the truth. I said, \"Your service isn't worth the $1250 per year that I'm currently paying. We have outages daily when the internet doesn't work at all. Then there was the automated message that my router that I rent from you is getting retired, and all internet service will be stopped unless I buy a new router. Then the fact that in March my internet bill will go up to over $1800 per year.\" \n\nI did not yell. I spoke quietly, and clearly. She started crying, and set up the disconnection. \n\nThe skullduggery happened when I went to turn in the equipment. That same router box that didn't work anymore by that time, would have cost over $350 on top of the cost of the money already spent renting it for the time we had service with this company.\n\nThe person behind the counter asked why I was disconnecting, and demanded to know who my new provider was. I told the truth, I said my cellular provider. She then proceeded to rant and rave about how evil my cellular provider is, and how much overages are, and all kinds of chuckle worthy things. \n\nI got a signed receipt for their router, and have it safe in my desk. The final bill came, and was paid off. \n\nThe gimmee on this? My cellular provider hasn't had a glitch at all since, and my bill didn't go up as much as I thought I would. Good riddance to bad rubbish.",
            "Had something similar a few years back with my DSL service. I moved across town and into a recently renovated duplex. The owner (he lived in the other half) hadn\u2019t seen any point in running phone lines in the house since they were on cable internet. \n\nI called the company and explained everything and luckily the person I talked to was super understanding and told me they would go ahead and cancel without the early termination fee. A few weeks later I get a letter saying I owed the big fee and that kicked off months of hell. Every time I called I\u2019d walk back thru the situation and they\u2019d tell me they understood and that they were waving the fee but the system never reflected that. Eventually the fee that they agreed I didn\u2019t owe got sent to collections. So then I had a whole other layer of bull shit to deal with.

The company would put out these boxes saying enter to win XYZ prize. They were only there as a way to easily generate contact info for the sales rep.\n  So I am scheduled to install a system on a Saturday morning an hour out of town. Paid per install. The customer had called the main office number to cancel the install, they had a window of time to do this. Main office didn't pass down the info that the call was canceled to the local office nor to the tech (me). I get up nice and early to get loaded up and on-site at the appointed time. Get informed the install was canceled. Customer was very nice. So nice they took me out for breakfast as an apology because head office didn't pass along the cancelation. It wasn't their fault nor their problem but they did it anyway because I went through the trouble of getting up early loading up and arriving on time. And waking them up early to top it off. I really appreciated the time and effort they took to not make the trip a complete waste of my time. \n  I did get a free breakfast out of it and the day off after mentally preparing to work that day.

This is a funny story for you (and for me, as a consumer), but as someone who's drunk the corporate Kool-Aid IRL and love kaizen, this actually looks like a really great case. Clearly, if they'd just believed you, it would have been much cheaper for them. On the other hand, I definitely see where the urge to push to keep contracts as much as possible comes from. So perhaps they're totally fine losing a certain amount of money on calls like yours if that means being sure that they're only losing the customers who they logistically could not keep. Or perhaps this would be simply a training opportunity for the poor guy who took your call--maybe he should have been trained to listen to you more. Maybe everyone in their call centers should be better trained. And maybe their whole internal review processes could be revamped to reduce unnecessary call-outs like this, and perhaps save them a lot of money! \n\nI think you handled this as gracefully as you could have under the circumstances--but if Rogers is smart, maybe they would see this as a great opportunity to review why things like this happen and take steps to prevent them from recurring.

            "Reminds me of this joke:\n\nA US Navy cruiser anchored in Mississippi for a week's shore leave.\n\nThe first evening, the ship's Captain received the following note from the wife of a very wealthy and influential plantation owner:\n\n'Dear Captain, Thursday will be my daughter's Debutante Ball. I would like you to send three well-mannered, handsome, unmarried officers in their formal dress uniforms to attend the dance. They should arrive promptly at 8:00 PM prepared for an evening of polite Southern conversation. They should be excellent dancers, as they will be the escorts of lovely refined young ladies. One last point: No Jews please.'\n\nSending a written message, the captain replied:\n\n'Madam, thank you for your invitation. In order to present the widest possible knowledge base for polite conversation, I am sending three of my best and most prized officers.\n\nOne is a lieutenant commander, and a graduate of Annapolis with an additional Masters degree from MIT in fluid technologies and ship design.\n\nThe second is a Lieutenant, one of our helicopter pilots, and a graduate of Northwestern university in Chicago, with a BS in Aeronautical Engineering. His Masters Degree and PhD. In Aeronautical and Mechanical Engineering are from Texas Tech University and he is also an astronaut candidate.\n\nFinally, the third officer, also a lieutenant commander, is our ship's doctor, with an undergraduate degree from the University of Georgia and his medical degree is from the University of North Carolina . We are very proud of him, as he is also a senior fellow in Trauma Surgery at Bethesda .'\n\nUpon receiving this letter, the mother was quite excited and looked forward to Thursday with pleasure. Her daughter would be escorted by three handsome naval officers (and the other women in her social circle would be insanely jealous).\n\nAt precisely 8:00 PM on Thursday, Melinda's mother heard a polite rap at the door which she opened to find, in full dress uniform, three very handsome, smiling black officers.\n\nHer mouth fell open, but pulling herself together, she stammered, 'There must be some mistake.'\n\n'No, Madam,' said the first officer, 'Captain Goldberg never makes mistakes.'",
            "my neighborhood has a facebook group.  I quickly came to realize it is a bunch of people who sit in their houses being afraid of everything outside.  I was kicked off the group for commenting on the post \"there is a black man sitting on the curb at the corner of STREET and STREET.\"  I asked why him being black was literally the only piece of information they chose to give...no age, height...clothing..nothing.  They responded that it was so I knew who to look out for.  \"So, I am supposed to be suspicious of any black man walking around in my neighborhood?  You know that black people live here too, right?\"  I was immediately booted, as was my wife, who was not involved in the conversation at all.  ",

            "I am a state police officer assigned to a state university. I was once sent to an outdoor campus venue where a hundred university students and faculty/staff advisers were holding an overnight \"homeless awareness\" event. They called 9-1-1 to report a transient was seen in the area collecting cans from the trash. No other behavior, threatening or otherwise concerning was reported. They explicitly demanded that he be cited for the offense (taking property from a trash container) and removed from campus.\n\nCalls like the OP has shared and this are not uncommon. Police officers are regularly put in a position where they are unreasonably put in a no-win position because those who call are horribly bigoted, racist, ignorant and/or hypocritical. ",

We stop look at the car for a very brief moment and continue on to breakfast.  On our way back home as we approach the intersection where the car was parked all of the sudden we are surrounded by police.  They start asking us questions like where we're going and where we're coming from, I tell them we're just coming back from breakfast and heading to my house which you could actually see from where we were.  \n\nThey asked why we were looking at the car parked at the end of the alley.  I point out that the car has a for sale sign on it and that we are on foot. \n\nTurns out the owner of the car saw me and my friend looking at his car which was for sale and thought we were car thieves.

Asked them what was going on and they said \"nothing, he's just black\".\n\n\nSecond favorite was when I had to send an ambulance crew on an IFT from our hospital to a hospital about an hour away in a larger city. Medic comes to dispatch and says she's really nervous going to the city, especially at night. I ask her why and she says \"BECAUSE! they got them people there that you can barely see when it's dark out!\"\n\nEdit: example medic #2 was the same woman who once put a raw potato in the microwave for 10 hours thinking that she hit 10 minutes and then completely forgot about it.

She was scared of black men changing her alone so I was helping my aide who was a black man and we were joking with her. (She wasn't a bad old lady at all, just literally raised by people who probably told her from the time she could walk that every large black man was out to rape her.)

She mostly seems out of it and gets easily confused and overwhelmed, but every time we passed a black person in that Walmart she would look up, smile, and wave. Only the black people. And then a big young black man came walking towards us. He happened to be wearing the same sports jersey as my lady, so she smiled real big, gave her wave, and pointed at her shirt and then his. He smiled, waved back, and told her he liked her shirt. My favorite sweet lady <3",

            "When I look at this in this most objective way possible, I imagine the neighborhood where I've lived for 20 years.  Mostly white town.  That's just fact.  All the houses were built in the 50's, usually by the home owners themselves.  Over the years those people started dying off or going to nursing homes, but the ones who remain are simply not used to anything other than white folks.  I'm NOT justifying or condoning ignorance, just trying to understand. \n\nWe're taught by the police to call when anything looks suspicious.  In the above scenario, a black man in that neighborhood is \"out of place\".  He totally deserves to walk down any street he damn well pleases! But to those old people there, they grew up in a different time & set of circumstances.\n\nSomeone needs to educate them.  I run a neighborhood watch and I actually do some of that educating.  I do it with kindness but firmness.  I have changed some minds.  In fact one old \"bitty\" now has fresh made cookies ready after school almost every day for children that are Hmong, black, Latino & white since the neighborhood has become more diverse in the past 5 years or so.\n\nIf we judge them for not understanding, laugh at their ignorance I guarantee they will not become better human beings.  \n\nMaybe we can step up our game & show them how good diversity really is.

It's like 4:30 in the afternoon in October, and I decide to take a walk around my suburban, Northern Californian neighborhood after school. So I head off, and get about 3 blocks away before I walk down a court and see these kids stare at me, sprint across the street, and into their house. I was kinda confused at the time, but I just shrugged it off an went on.\n\nI get another couple blocks away before I notice I'm being followed by a big white Suburban. Now, I'm just a 12 year old kid, and being followed by a big, white SUV was unsettling. Moments later, I'm being shouted at by a soccer mom from the depths of hell. She told me that I \"scared her kids with my walking\" and \"that there were at least 4 cops in the immediate area that she knew and would call on me\" for \"roaming\" (is that even a thing?). Now, being the nerdy 12 year I was scared shitless. I just said okay and left before something actually happened.\n\nAnyways, looking back on it, I actually would have wanted her to call the cops, just to see what happened. But that's in the past and I guess I'll never know.",
