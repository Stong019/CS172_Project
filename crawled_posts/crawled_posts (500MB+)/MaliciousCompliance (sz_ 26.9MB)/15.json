The vast majority of the crews that work for us are filled with guys (and the occasional gal) from Central America. Being in a state with blue cities and red country between, we definitely get some of the \"Good Ol' Boy\" mentality from some of our customers. \n\nWe had an install go out months ago, and the customer specifically requested: \"Don't send no dirty Mexicans to my house.\" While we have some guys from Mexico, we truly have the gamut of Central America represented in our subcontractors. So we do our schedule, not sending one of the guys from Mexico. \n\nThe salesman was in the installation office when the customer called, rather frustrated: \n\n>Customer: I thought I told you not to send Mexicans out here.   \n>  \n>Salesman: Yes, sir, you did.   \n>  \n>Customer: So why are there Mexicans at my door saying they're from your company.   \n>  \n>Salesman: Well sir, it looks like Gustavo is out to your house today. Gustavo is actually from Honduras. \n\nAt that point, the rest of us couldn't hold in our laughter, so the salesman left the office to finish the call. Gustavo and his crew were allowed into the house to install the flooring, but we haven't made a repeat sale to the customer just yet.",

She goes to the group that includes Dick, puts the scales on the table and proclaims \"Let's weigh them!\".\n\nYou see, Dick had ordered the promotion and then said that his order was missing almost half of it and demanded four more skewers \"to make it correct\" (his words). Now, in almost any other place he would be probably right. Most of them buy their skewers already made and they weigh between 100 to 120 grams, which means that a kilo is usually 10 skewers. But we prepare our skewers in house and are much bigger, between 180 to 220 grams (which is written on the menu), so our kilo is usually six of them. So, basically Dick was demanding almost another kilo of meat for free.\n\nDick, smugly: Yeah, let's weigh them and then you can bring what you still owe me!\n\nMary grabs the skewers and a fork and starts removing pieces of meat and placing them on the scales. Initially, Dick has a very smug smile. But he starts to frown when 3 skewers are emptied and the scales shows more than half a kilo of meat. Finally, with the second piece from the fifth skewer, the scales shows just above a kilo.\n\nMary, holding the remains skewers and smiling smugly: It seems you were right about the order not being correct. We put more. I'll take those (waving the skewers in her hand) back to the kitchen. Enjoy your food!\n\nMary returned smiling to the kitchen and put the skewers aside, while Dick ate his kilo of meat sullenly and the rest of his group smirking.",

We had some really big companies as clients, so we were used to some really idiotic demands, but most of the time we could convince the people whose main job seemingly was \"to be in charge\" to listen to our expertise. Not so Mr. Bigwig. Mr. Bigwig was the CEO of a large automobile sales company. He also was the type of guy who prided himself with being a \"great negotiator\" and \"thinking so far ahead, regular people can't follow\". And he was a complete ass to everyone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMr. Bigwig went on a holiday once and set up an automatic out of office reply in his mail account, but - as is the technical standard - everybody who wrote him during that time only received the reply just one single time. When Mr. Bigwig returned from his vacation this infuriated him a lot so he called our support line and yelled and cussed his way up our hierarchy until he had me on the phone. I tried to tell him that this was working as intended and tried to explain why, but Mr. Bigwig wouldn't have any of it. This went all the way to our CTO who sent him a waiver to sign, stating that we would deactivate this limitation, but not be liable for any consequences (in short). Then he told me to make the changes to MBs account. I tried to object, but the CTO just smiled, shrugged and went into his office. Mr. Bigwig was happy. He won and booked this as his latest negotiating victory.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow let us jump to December the 29th of the same year. I get a phone call. From Mr. Bigwig. He is not happy. He is not happy because he is blacklisted on about every blacklist in existence. He is also not happy because he can't receive or send any email. And he is not happy because he can't find any mail he received during the Christmas holidays or near them. He can't find them because the nice number in brackets besides his inbox folder, that indicates the amount of unread mails he has, reads 50,000. A quick look around the server logs tells me there are indeed some mails he did not receive. 150,000 to be exact. They are still pending delivery because his inbox is full.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe is also not happy because he is the laughing stock of everybody he ever respected.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow let me guide you as the reader to the bottom of this. What you don't know and we also did not know at the time is: Mr. Bigwig was member of a very exclusive group of business owners, CEOs and high ranking politicians around the globe. The kind of people you would imagine sitting around a large oak table, smoking cigars, drinking 200\u20ac whiskey and discussing world dominance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis group had a mailing list. A shitty, basic mailing list.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt went something like this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBigwig: (Out of Office Reply) Hey, thank you for you mail, but I am on holiday! I will reply later.\n\nSomerandomdude @mailinglist: Merry Christmas!\n\nMailinglist @everybody: Hey guys, Somerandomdude is wishing you Merry Christmas.\n\nBigwig @mailinglist: Thanks for telling me, but I am on holiday! I will reply later.\n\nMailinglist @everybody: Hey guys, Mr. Bigwig is on holiday, he will reply later.\n\nBigwig @mailinglist: Thanks for telling me, but I am on holiday! I will reply later.\n\nMailinglist @FUCKING EVERYBODY: Hey guys, Mr. Bigwig is on holiday, he will reply later.\n\nBigwig @mailinglist: Thanks for telling me, but I am on holiday! I will reply later.\n\nMailinglist @FUCKING EVERYBODY: Hey guys, Mr. Bigwig is on holiday, he will reply later.\n\nBigwig @mailinglist: Thanks for telling me, but I am on holiday! I will reply later.\n\nMailinglist @FUCKING EVERYBODY: Hey guys, Mr. Bigwig is on holiday, he will reply later.\n\n...repeat until the servers give out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo B-Diddy was not the only one who had thousands and thousands of mails in his folder. All his fancy pants networking contacts had too. Mr. Bigwig raged hard at everyone who was brave enough to get on the phone with him, threatened to sue us for millions of Euros and to \"end us as a business\". We finally put him through to our founder, who listened to his rant and told him he would send him a solution within the next ten minutes.\n\nHe sent two documents: A scan of the signed waiver, in which the consequences of disabling the out of office message restriction were outlined in detail, and a service contract, allowing us to fix the problem to our abilities without any financial budget limitations, but with a really nice (read: enormous) estimated budget.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was a good year for the company, with an unexpected spike in revenue, just before new years eve.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n//Edit: Thank you kind stranger for Reddit Premium!

Turn off auto-replies, delete the few hundred emails(max) wait like an hour and turn auto-replies back on. \n\nNot this ticket. Because lucky us the people behind the original recipient were not checking their public folder at the time but they were storing incoming email for later processing.\n\nSo we got a ticket to go stop and auto-reply loop and delete the emails. We mounted the public folder to find 2.1 million emails. Turns out they hadn\u2019t been checking the public folder for like 3 months. \n\nBest part of that was our maanager didn\u2019t let us send the ticket to the server team for batch deletion and at the time we weren\u2019t given access to powershell....so it was deleted all by hand. 500 emails at a time.

        "selftext": "When I was doing my articles at a small law firm (internship to be admitted as an attorney) I was the go-to person for everything at the office (setting up computers, buying stationery, paying bills, going to court, seeing clients,etc). After being admitted as an attorney I continued doing all this because the secretary only did about 20% of what a secretary would usually do and refused to do anything else. My boss does some shady business (don't pay taxes, etc) so he couldn't just fire her for fear of her ratting him out. He also never disciplined her. We are not in the US. \n\nSince we worked from my boss's mother's house, the secretary also spent about 50% of her day just chatting to his mother and they became fast friends. Guess who was always the evil one that everyone ganged up on? Yours truly. I was made out to be incompetent at my job and I used to cry a lot and almost became an alcoholic from work stress.\n\nOne day the secretary got really upset with me (after I asked her to buy stationery since we didn't even have staples) and after a heated argument told me that I'm not the office manager and should stop lording it about as if I was (bear in mind I was her senior both as an attorney and in number of years worked at the firm). My boss did nothing and rather got upset with me and so did his mother.\n\nI decided there and then I am done doing both secretary work and my attorney work because I was working roughly 50-60 hours per week (standard is 40) trying to get everything done without receiving overpay (the unemployment rate in my country is around 30% and in the legal field supply of lawyers exceeds demand). She knew this and my boss knew this but no one cared that I was basically working myself into an early grave.\n\nCue malicious compliance. If everyone agrees that I am not the office manager than I will stop managing the flow of the office and only do my attorney work. I stopped paying the bills, buying the stationery, reminding my boss of important meetings, etc.\n\nWithin two weeks the electricity was cut off for 10 days because it wasn't paid and my boss' elderly mother and the rest of his family had no electricity. We could also not work for those 10 days. Once the electricity went on, the phone lines were cut because of non-payment. We could again not work. The post piled up, there were no stationery. We couldn't do service of court documents because our service providers cut us off. It went on for weeks. I simply worked around the issues and sorted my life out (one example: when the wifi was off I used my cellphone to hotspot my laptop without telling anyone). \n\nIn the end my boss and his mother begged me to do what I used to do but I refused. Since I was focusing more on my actual work my fees increased and my pay increased as well. Shortly thereafter I moved away from that office to our secondary office and worked alongside lovely colleagues who all did what they got paid to do. I have been at this new office (same firm just a different location) for the last two years.",

        "selftext": "Disclaimer: I tried to keep it as short as I could but it still turned out pretty lengthy. No TLDR...read it or don't.\n\nThis is the story of my former employer. I work in the northeast US and my employer at the time was a very small company (Boss and 5 employees) in a very specific industry where 90% of our work was on construction sites and finding a well-qualified person in this very specific industry is a very very hard thing to do.\n\nMy boss was the kind of boss that every employee hates. Corners were cut every possible way in order to keep overhead costs down. On top of that he would constantly overbook on jobs (like signing contracts for 6 projects during the same week knowing full well that he only has 5 employees) which would result in the employees often working 14 hour days or more....which really sucks when you're on salary (no overtime). \n\nHis worst attribute by far was approving time off and then during your time off calling or texting you asking if you would be willing to work a day or cut your vacation short. Sometimes he'd even ask you to move your time off to the next week or next month \"when the workload lightens up\" (hint: it never lightened up due to his constant overbooking).\n\nAfter working at this company for 6 years I got used to all the aforementioned annoyances. But then things changed, my son was born. In the months leading up to his birth I made it very clear that I would be taking a 5-week unpaid leave of absence once he arrives. The state we're in allows new parents to take up to 8 weeks of unpaid leave. I told my boss that I know 8 weeks would be a huge strain on such a small company so I was willing to take 5 weeks but those 5 weeks would be completely \"off the grid\" meaning dont call me, dont text me, if youre going to ask me to do anything work-related the answer will be no so don't bother. I'm going to be spending time with my family. He 100% agreed.\n\nFast-forward to my son's birth. He was born on a Friday and after a short stay in the NICU (don't worry, he's fine) was released on Monday and we took him home. Tuesday morning (yeah...the next day) I wake up to a missed call, an email, and 3 texts all from my boss asking me to call him back ASAP. For reasons still unknown to me to this day I call him back and he tells me there's a slight emergency (code speak for he screwed up the scheduling and has a job with no employee at it) and asks if I could maybe come into work that day and maybe work a couple more days that week until he finds someone to cover it. \n\nI lost it. I literally felt something in my neck snap and unleashed a verbal assault on him that I still feel bad about now, a year later. I ended my rant with an apology...as much of a dick move it was for him to be calling me in that situation it was still completely unprofessional of me to say what I said to him. Obviously he wasn't a big fan of what I said and after a small rant of his own ended with the sentences that made this whole story possible. \n\nHe said, \"You've got a pretty good gig at this company that most people your age would be thankful for. I'd be impressed if you could find a better job in this field because I've been doing this for 30 years and I know how small this industry is and trust me, good jobs like yours don't come along very often. Think about that.\"\n\nSo we ended the call and I did what he said. I thought about it. After thinking about it for about 30 seconds I got out of bed, sat down in front of my computer and started looking at job postings.\n\n5 weeks later my time off came to an end and my first day back I came in to work, walked into my bosses office and handed him a piece of paper.\n\nBoss: \"What's this?\"\nMe: \"I thought about what you said about how you be really impressed if I could find a better job than the one I have here. ...so I did.\"\n\nMy boss reads over what I handed him...a job offer from a competitor for the exact same job I was performing but at a 25% higher salary, an extra week of paid vacation compared to what I had AND a stipulation that company policy was that work hours are capped at 8 per day meaning that once I hit 8 hours on a job I pack up and leave it until tomorrow. No exceptions.\n\nBoss: \"Well then...ummm...can I have the day to crunch some numbers to come up with a counter-offer?\nMe: \"No, don't bother. I just wanted you to see it because I know you wouldn't have believed me otherwise.\"\n\nGave my two week notice and left for whatever job site I was on that day. That was a year ago and I could not be happier with my new job. I get to spend lots of time with my boy and that's the best job perk there is.\n\nFor all you bosses and managers out there. Dont fuck with your employees...especially the good ones. Treat them how you'd want to be treated. \n\n***Most employees don't quit their jobs....they quit their bosses!***",

            "I'm counting down my days right now.\n\nI have a pretty sweet gig, but I'm massively underpaid relative to my colleagues in the same role, purely because I was hired on as a tech and worked my way up to a project manager. Couple that with no raises since last March of 2018, and no raise in sight until \"end of year\" from what we've heard (pending profitability, hah).\n\nMy current employer fired my former boss over a year ago. He reached out to me after his non-compete expired and offered me a position with his new employer starting in September for 20k more than I'm making now.\n\nI'm burning all my PTO, and even dates I had marked off later in the year I'm moving to use them now rather than later - I lucked out and work asked me to travel for a job in two weeks, right when some of my PTO was planned and approved already. I agreed, reentered all my PTO so I'm burning it all before September now under the guise of \"I'm not booked on projects and the ones I'm on should be slow\" and they're cool with it.\n\nThe amount of shocked Pikachu memes that will be given when I tender my resignation to my director, sales lead and sales VP is going to be priceless.\n\nAll, if you have an employee billing clients at $170 an hour, 25-40 hours a week consistently, pay them more than $65k a year.",
            "Finally a story i can completely relate to.  My baby girl was born last year and boss tried to make me work during my paternity leave (paid by government) when i pointed it out, he apologized in such bad way i just started looking elsewhere. It has been a month i switxhed and I've never felt happier, healthier and closer to my beautiful baby girl.\n\nI was the third in 2 weeks who quit and because i kept in touch with former coworkers, I've learned another one will be handing his 2 weeks notice after the vacation and another one might join me in a different department. So in other words, in a business with 4 employees,  they will now be 3 and soon 2 tech to deals with a work load of 15 techs.\n\nNo more my circus, no kore my monkeys. Previous company HR may final realized that i wasn't exaggerating when i said he's unfit to be a supervisor with his passive-aggressive attitude and moodiness.",
            "This is one of the reasons I'm so thankful for the company I work for. We're also very tiny, three people in the office, two out (though the two out are owners).\n\nRecently we had our fourth team member quit, and it's not in the budget to get a new one quite yet (bs a bit, but dudes got multiple companies and were the only one really turning a profit) and were also open 6 days a week. They want 3 people there, but can really only manage two except on busy days where we need three.\n\nIn August I'll be taking two weeks off and in September both my manager and I will be taking 4 day weekends to deal with various stuff we've had planned for almost a year (I've got a festival and my manager has a wedding). I asked my manager today how our other coworker is going to handle time without us. She skyoed the owner and was like \"hey so when (other coworker quit) you said you'd come jn during the times we needed off. So we need you to come in and do customer service, tickets, phone calls, and theres a few other days we may need time off so here's a list\" and laid it all out for him. He said hell come in just to remind him beforehand.\n\nThis wasn't very malicious compliance, but I am so thankful the fact that she put her foot down when she knew we had previously had plans for vacations and stuff that she wasn't gonna let the fact that he wouldnt let us hire somone else come in the way or let the company suffer. She stood up for the three of us, got me and my coworker raises, and made sure that the owner (\ta workaholic) knew that he was gonna have to pick up some of the slack in the office doing our job (which he hasn't done in 5 years), maybe he might also rethink having us have such low salaries.\n\nI bitch about my job a lot, but for the same reason that people quit shitty managers I will likely hold out with mine for as long as possible. She's a great person who knows how to stand up for people. I hope that if I ever get her job I'll be half as competent as she is.\n\nWow thst got long, sorry.",
            "Very true. I worked in a truck shop with 1 other mechanic and a service manager. My wife works and we split the kids time off if they need to go to the doctors etc. There is a big shortage for skilled diesel technicians at the moment which adds some spice to the story because he was looking for months to find another mechanic for first shift. So one day after I had to take the day off because my daughter had an ear infection he says \u201cyou really don\u2019t give a fuck about this job huh?\u201d Mind you, he is a baby boomer who\u2019s wife stays at home. So him and I get into this massive argument. I hate confrontation as well but this guy loved it. The next few days I combed for jobs and found one for better pay and less hours. The day after I received a job offer I brought my truck and loaded up my toolbox. All of a sudden he starts telling me how maybe we can be more flexible with time off. Life is too short to put up with bullshit. But before you leave make sure you have a backup.",
            "Reminds me of when I was a manager at this small town Mom & Pa type grocery store when I was 20-22,  Store owner treated people like fucking shit, Refused to give breaks,   Would call you in on days you had off, would refuse to give you days off for serious shit,  Witnessed a co-worker one time get denied the weekend off when her mom died, Boss just said sorry but no, Your work is more important (spoiler, She quit)\n\nBut for 3 weeks once, he had my scheduled from 4:30am -1pm EVERY day, (We didnt even open till 8am) I was denied my 15 minute breaks, He didnt schedule ANYONE else to work with me for those 9 hours, this went on for 3 weeks almost,  I complained to him and he just laughed and said \"Sucks huh? But Im not changing it, Get back to work, I know you cant find anything better to do than work here\"\n\nSo I quit...I was managing 3 full departments, Bakery, Deli and taking care of the backroom shipping, Which NOBODY else in the store knew how to do, Within 2 months of me quitting the store was doing so badly they had to close down, Old boss was calling my cell 3-4x a day BEGGING me to come back.\n\nOne of my fondest memories of my 20's",

            "I was an employee that the bosses called on their day off at 6 am cause someone called in and I always covered it. One day he called my other job and asked if they would let me leave early to cover a shift, my boss at job B was like wtf why would you call her at work and ask her to leave find another person. \n\nWhen I was pregnant I had some early bleeding and was freaking out and asked to leave 30 min early to get to the OB before they closed and was told no, I then spent the next 8 hours in the ER cause he wouldn't let me leave a few minutes early ( we had plenty of coverage), then when I called off the next day he told me I had to go in with 3 hours of sleep. Later at about 6 months pregnant he came storming into the small pet area (pet shop) banging on the glass and waving me out \"do you have a problem\" \"uh no?\" \"Then why do I have a bunch of people telling me you can't do your job? Can you do your job? If not I need a note\" \"uh..I'm literally doing the job that your screaming at me for not doing so I'm confused\" he just walked away. Then a bunch of groomers came walking over and asked if he took me off cleaning duty (there's no vents in the small cages so it's hot and hard to breathe and I was super preggo while the boy on staff played on his phone) \n\nOne day I was on vacation I planned it 3 months in advance he signed off on it. I worked a full shift then drove 10 hours to my grandparents house getting there around 3 am maybe 4 am and at 10 am I get a call and he's foaming over the phone \"where are you, why are you so late? We have people here for potty classes that you need to teach\" \"yeah I'm in Michigan, there's no way I can make it, I took the week off, you approved it\" \" well the other trainer isn't here\" \"well she is on the schedule I know she is I checked before I left last night so I don't know what to tell you\" he took me off the schedule for two weeks cause he was mad he forgot about my trip so showed up for my classes and then had to leave right after he wouldn't even let me clean so I was like cool enjoy the pee off your floors.\n\nHe made me take off my coat and searched it and my purse cause someone was stealing fish food...I didn't even own fish. He wrote me up for being on my phone on my break while buying stuff at the checkout and then let all the other people go and I had to clean the whole store alone and drive home in a snowstorm. \n\nThe final nail after 7 or so years of this abuse was I was 7 1/2 months pregnant and couldn't lift anything over 15 lbs, I was throwing up blood, and my baby was crushing my spine even the ultrasound tech was like damn girl I feel for you, and he still had me stalking shelves and I just couldn't do it, I was teaching dog classes, doing cashier work, taking care of small animals and inventory and I just couldn't do it, I was to sick and tired and in pain and he said \"but I need you, who else can stock the shelves\" he didn't even think about the 40 other people who worked there who could do it. So I walked into the office typed up a fuck you letter and quit right before Christmas and went and got a pregnancy massage that my husband got for me and was super happy, 6 years later and he and all the staff has been moved due to his issues and they still haven't replaced me.\n\nIt's a great feeling getting away from a shitty boss.",

Another thread reminded me of it, and I think it absolutely fits here, so here goes.\n\nBack in 2014, I was selling cars. Ford, specifically. For all those who aren't car buffs, both the Mustang and F-150 were getting ground-up redesigns for 2015, and Ford had just announced that there would be no Shelby Mustangs or Raptor F-150's for 2015. Instantly, we were fielding several calls a day about these vehicles, and almost overnight, the inventory we had came with a $10-20k \"market adjustment,\" due to demand.\n\nOur GM loved both vehicles, and traded for them whenever he could because he loved chatting about them with buyers, so we had 21 Raptors and 6 Shelby's still on the lot when I sold a ruby red Raptor extended cab at $10k over sticker the last week of the month. Both are CRAZY numbers for the <200 new cars we sold/mo. With the trade, I was due about $4200 in commission, but my check was about $1700 light.\n\nCome the first Saturday morning meeting after payday, we were told that commissions on such vehicles would be capped at $2500, retro to last month, per a previously ignored provision in our pay plan. There was much grumbling, but management stood firm, citing how incredibly easy Raptor/Shelby deals were. They weren't wrong about that. There was no such thing as a test drive until the deal was done. You could absolutely drive the car before you bought it, but only after we had a signed buyer's order, credit app, and the deal had been submitted and approved. They were generally in and out in under 45 minutes, if not half an hour. But still. Dealership gets free money and doesn't want to share?\n\nCue malicious compliance. \n\nI talked to several other salespeople, who to a man were pissed, and we colluded. I whipped up a little excel macro/widget that would take the invoice price/holdback, add in pack and whatnot, and spit out a sales price that would produce an exactly $2500 commission. I sent it to every salesperson we had, and everyone used it. It only took 3 signed buyer's orders with seemingly arbitrary numbers for the desk to figure out what we were doing and to call another meeting. \n\nThat meeting was basically management yelling at us, and the entire sales staff calmly saying, \"remove the cap, or you'll never see another signed buyer's order that exceeds it. Fuck you.\"\n\nThe cap was lifted 3 days later.",

They're gonna get an extra fractional percentage of any deal!\n\nBut they would now be capped at $10K a quarter.\n\nBob didn't like that. \n\nBob got zero deals signed that month. \n\nThe new rules meant the deals he'd already had in the pipeline exceeded the amount needed to get his people paid, so why look for more?\n\nWhen the company reversed the cap, Bob suddenly had $30 million bucks in deals, and his people made $40K.",

It was so stupid that I would purposefully try to spread deals out if I was going to go over cap to put the sale in the next month and I would lie to customers that it was going to take an extra 5 days to process or something...\n\nI remember one month I had a great sale to a nursing school that agreed to buy tablets for all students, and I hit my commission cap and exceeded it on that sale (this was like a $100,000 revenue sale). I wasn't even halfway through the month. \n\nSo, I put in the hours to get my hours, but I literally didn't sell another thing the rest of the month, didn't try to, didn't go out of my way. I even had my manager call me and ask me why my production was done and I told him I just had some misses and some bad luck. I was lying. Why would I work just as hard and not get my commission?\n\nIt's when I realized how stupid commission caps were and made me realize how idiotic the company I was working for was.

So whenever I got an inkling of being sick I would call out and get tested. Now if I tested positive then I would get two weeks off without penalty. But I tested negative and returned to work. I get called into the office and got a verbal warning because I had one too many sick days. I said to my manager \u201cyou realize we are in a pandemic right?\u201d  She says \u201cyes, I know that but we still have to stick to the original policy.\u201d When we clock in, there is an electronic message that pops up on the time clock that reads \u201cDuring the pandemic we need to self monitor ourselves and by clocking in you are declaring that you are fit to work.\u201d There was no adjustment to the policy even though we were a covid unit during a pandemic. So I would either have to lie about feeling sick when I clock in, or call out and get in trouble. \n\nHere is where the malicious compliance comes in. I had always picked up a lot of extra time in a sister department. Not because I needed the extra money but because the hospital was always short staffed. My manager didn\u2019t like the fact that I picked up extra time the other department. She wanted me to pick up extra time in our department. So she said. \u201cAs punishment you can not pick up extra time in the other department for 90 days (The length of my disciplinary period). You should be responsible enough to pick up extra time in your own department.\u201d As I didn\u2019t need the extra money, I didn\u2019t pick up ANY extra time in that period. I got called almost every day to ask if I could come in because they were short staffed. One of the reasons they were short staffed was because our sister unit was even more short staffed and the nurses on my unit were getting pulled to go work there. If only more nurses picked up extra time on the other unit, hmm. \n\nAt the end of the 90 days I was told I could pick up extra time in the sister department again. At which point I handed in my two weeks notice and told her I accepted a position at another hospital. She then tells me that because of my years of service I need to give four weeks notice.

And with everyone working from home now with covid, almost nobody calls in sick. First of all because there are less sick people but also because at home you are more comfortable and you can still get work done while sick.\n\nOf course, you can't be a nurse at home! That would be weird to bring patients to your house so you could work from home hahaha :-)"

        "selftext": "This is a story of my mothers. She has always been incredibly hardheaded, but this sticks out a lot from my teenage years.\n\nOnce a year she always had us pull everything out of the garage (lots of boxes my mom has a concerning amount of possessions) so we could go through it and clean/reorganize. This particular year the couple who owned the house across from us (flippers) where in the process of selling their house. Unhappy with my mothers \"unsightly\" driveway covered in boxes soiling their good image, they made a call to the HOA.\n\nBy the time my mother received the letter, the mess had been put away, but they decided to get her on a few other complaints such as the bikes against the side of the house and the \"patchy\" gravel. She had two weeks to have everything up to standards.\n\nPetty and easily frustrated, my mother knew immediately who called since the couple had come over and told her flat out with their renovations they were selling that house for \"way more any other house and this neighborhood\" and would appreciate if she respected that by keeping her property on par.\n\nFor the next two weeks every box from that garage was in our driveway. The couch and the living room TV came next. This was early summer, so it was perfect weather to sit in your yard in your short shorts and sports bra. My mom made sure to wave and smile every time they brought someone over for a showing.\n\nThe final step came at the end of that two weeks though. After the yard had been cleaned up and cleared by the HOA, my mom went to the local walmart and bought a for sale sign. She wrote about 1/4 of their ridiculous asking price on it and finished off with a big SOLD written across the front and stuck it out in our yard.\n\nNo clue what they ended up selling their house for, but it sat empty for a while so I'd assume it was below offer.\n\nTL;DR Don't tell my mom she's devaluing your house, or she will go far out her way to do so, all while complying with the HOA.",

            "My dad had a habit of starting big projects (putting in a pool, installing a geothermal well, adding chimneys and fireplaces, etc) and taking forever to finish them. We didn't have a HOA and most people didnt mind the mess, but one couple we shared a property line with were always complaining to the city whenever they could. When my dad built the frame of the deck for our aboveground pool, he waited to finish the platform and the fencing until he could get nice planks and make it look good. But this couple complained to the city, and my dad couldn't find a loophole in the building codes that would give him more time. So instead of hiring someone to do it or taking some extra days off work to do it himself, he threw on some unfinished plywood flooring and made a fence out of chicken wire. The neighbors were not happy about the \"eyesore\", but it was up to code, and my dad never got around to fixing it up.",

            "I have reluctantly taken on the mantle of HOA President recently at my complex. It is literally eight units in two buildings with a small courtyard, front yard, and parking spaces out back. Despite our modest property, you\u2019d be surprised how often I\u2019m bothered on a regular basis about the tiniest nuances of day-to-day life (e.g. literal text I received recently asked me to tell the lawn service to \u201cnot cut the grass too short since it would show \u2018bald spots\u2019\u201d...seriously). I have to ensure we collect assessments, maintain liability insurance, sanitation needs, pay utilities, etc. The main objective is to have a tiny community sublimating our impulsive whims in order to aim for the ideal balance for all of the landlords/tenants. In other words, we don\u2019t want someone painting the front of their unit to look like a Cannibal Corpse album cover (although that could be wicked and should be brought up at the next meeting). While I value open mindedness and independence, if you want to be a \u201cfree spirit\u201d or whatever you deem necessary to enjoy your home, then this type of place is not for you. I can tell you from experience that when I was looking for a more traditional house to live in, that all of the listings (at least in my price range) seemed to be flippers renovating homes in seedy parts of town in line with all of the latest trends. While the finished product may have been impressive, it seems fairly challenging to enjoy when the neighbor across the street has a half dozen rusting junkers on their front lawn and clearly doesn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass how their place looks at all. I\u2019d rather have a somewhat bland exterior because inside is where I welcome the people I value most anyway and truly shows my personality.",
