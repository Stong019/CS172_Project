Now, I worked the night shift stocking the shelves with 10 other people or so and no one else. For months no one gave a fuck, but right before Christmas they changed store managers and the new one was a humorless dried up sack that was a dick to everyone. If she couldn't find anything wrong with your performance she'd find *something* to write you up for.  Admittedly, i never followed the dress code exactly, my pants stay up just fine - so fuck wearing a belt.   One night she of course comes up and essentially throws the employee handbook (or whatever the fuck document it was), with the dress code at me. \n\n\"You need to put a belt on\"\n\n\"I don't have one, I'm broke as fuck\"\n\n\"Well go buy one before work tomorrow or you'll be sent home\"\n\n\"Sure, i don't need to eat, I'll get a belt instead of lunch\"\n\nShe clearly missed the sarcasm and walks away, leaving me with the dress code. Upon inspection i realize it says something like \"belts will be worn with all pants with belt loops\". Clearly these pants weren't the best quality so i took pleasure in sawing off my belt loops when i got home. The next day I get to work and she comes up to me and asks \n\n\"Where's your belt?\" I stare at her and say \n\n\"Where are my belt loops?\" \n\n\nShe was fucking *livid*",

            "This reminds me when I worked at Rucker\u2019s. I had been an employee from the day it opened. Then a year or so later the owner decided to hire this dickhead of a guy to be the manager. I would work shifts alone in evenings all the time but all of a sudden I needed a babysitter? He was only five or so years older than me and for he most part we got along. \n\n\nOne night we were standing behind the counter joking around as usual and then his demeanour changed in an instant. He got this look on his face that most women know. He wanted to over power me (not physically). Was on my back that my shirt wasn\u2019t tucked in. Becoming verbally aggressive. It was never a problem before. We wore golf type shirts and they weren\u2019t that long so it never looked untidy. And that night no one was even in the place. I almost quit right there. It was an unnecessary power move.",

            "Once upon a time, a guy worked for Best Buy and ran into the typical over-aggressive power hungry manager. \n\nBack then the employee discount was really something. (Does F4 Emp#1 Enter F2-print still work?) And this college grad couldn't find a real job during the great recession so he packed up for a sunny location and took the easy job. Made friends and had all the carefree experiences you're supposed to while being extremely underemployed. Fast forward a few months. The job is boring and grad has another higher paying job. He's there for the discount. Comes in once a month, is polite, takes people's orders for TVs, chats with some friends, and goes home happy. \n\nApparently that was a problem for the back-stock warehouse manager. A career Best Buy retail hero who wanted the 100% commitment. Still not sure of the motivations to this day. Anyways, it is important to note the QUICKEST method to fire someone is to catch them abusing the employee discount. **If you work there** and someone starts asking you questions of past purchases, keep in mind they are **not** trying to help you out.\n\nFast forward to a large TV purchase was accidentally rerouted to an old college dorm address. Mistake but hey, shit happens. Well Mr. Manager would not refund the new TV sent to another state! Angry comments and WTFs later and a meeting was set to straighten it out. In a closed door office never before seen began a discussion that was supposed to be about the fate of one lost HDTV. Instead he went over item by item each purchase on the employee discount to force the trap. It didn't work. \n\n\"How can you spend more in store then you've made all year?\"  He showed his had too quickly trying to force the firing and was exposed as hostile. Tried to refocus back on the TV, more frustrated anger ensued. \n\"How many cars do you own?\"   \n\"2 maybe 20, what does this have to do with my TV?\"   \n\"I see you purchased 3 radar detectors\"   \n\"...and?\" \n\nTL:DR\nFuck Best Buy",

        "selftext": "The setting: United States, Northern Neck of Virginia.\n\nThe situation: Bought land and built a house on it.\n\n\nBack when my wife and I were much more newly wed than we are now, we hired ourselves an architect and went whole hog on having our cozy little dream home designed.\n\nWhile this was being done, we went shopping around for a parcel of land on which to have it built, which went quickly and easily, and we even got a pretty nice deal on a half-acre lot that was just far enough back in the sticks for us to be happy, but close enough to our jobs that it wasn't much of a commute.\n\nBest part of all?  No Home Owners Association.  There weren't any active back in that area because, point-blank, it was full of poor people back there.  Dirt poor country types and working poor wage slave types. \n\nWe made very sure with our lawyer that no previous owner had ever had the title amended to allow for any HoA nonsense as well, because that's a thing some real estate developers like to do - they'll buy up a property, get the title amended to force the membership of that property into a local HoA (that they usually operate or are in cahoots with those that do) and then resell it with that as a new requirement for any prospective buyer to automatically agree to when they sign the title.\n\nFlash forward to August of 2019.  Covid was just around the corner, but nobody knew that yet.  Everything was that which passes for normal out in those parts, and my wife and I had since moved to a different location, but retained that property as one of our various rentals.\n\nIt was our dream home for several years and we loved that place.  Moving was tough.  It was a good neighborhood out there and folks were very welcoming.\n\nThen a company that's totally not named Ryan Homes or anything even slightly similar came in and spent some years buying everything up back there that got the market and pressuring folks into selling, which worked out for them only too well.\n\nAnd of course, they gentrified everything.  For three years and some change, there was massive amounts of the old being torn down and hauled out and the new being built up and sold.\n\nThe HoA was built right in, because of course it was.  Folks with money enough to throw down on shittily built houses that looked nice from the front moved in one by one and two by two, property values in the area skyrocketed, property taxes skyrocketed right along with them and more of the less-poor people were forced to sell because they got taxed out of their own homes.\n\nMy wife and I knew what was coming from the get-go.\n\nWe knew those dinguses from Totally Not Ryan Homes were going to come sniffing around our way not to try to buy us out, but to see if they could finagle, schmooze or threaten us into joining the HoA they were installing.\n\nIt was inevitable.  Lots of information is public record. They knew we had money.  They knew we were living below our means by two orders of magnitude.  They knew we clearly meant to be exactly where we were because we sure didn't have to be.\n\nThey knew they didn't have a snowflake's hope in hell of pricing us out on taxes, so they tried nagging us to death and coming right up to the line on harassment, always to 'talk to us about joining the HoA'.\n\nThey failed.  They got told by One Expensive Lawyer to find something else to do before we all got super busy helping them find things to worry about.   And so they desisted for some years.\n\nThen my wife and I moved and got the property set up as a rental. \n\nAbsolutely Not Ryan Homes starts bothering our tenants there, both trying to get them to pressure us into putting the property into the HoA as well as getting our tenants riled up with the most outrageous lies about what could happen if we, the owners, don't 'protect our renters better'.\n\nMy wife and I were livid after hearing about this crap, and so we got ahold of Definitely Not Ryan Homes to let them know that this was our formal request that they stop bothering our tenants and that all further communications would be from our Really Expensive Lawyer.\n\nThey must've assumed we were bluffing or maybe whoever was in charge of thinking that day didn't show up for work, because they just kept right on with their nonsense.\n\nIt got so bad that they were even sending fake but convincing-looking envelopes with 'EVICTION NOTICE' that, upon being opened, said '... Could be what you find in your mailbox one day without our wondrous HOA!' and containing information about the benefits of the HoA.\n\nWe gathered it all up and got the tenants to talk to our lawyer and got the police involved to get the ball rolling on a harassment investigation.   Another formal request to cease and desist was sent to Never Ryan Homes by the Very Expensive Lawyer, which they... Utterly ignored.\n\nI think their guy that's supposed to come to work and think about things quit a long time ago.  Maybe he never told anyone.  Maybe nobody noticed.\n\nWhatever the situation on their end, when my lawyer talked to their lawyer, their lawyer told my lawyer that their client was doing everything legally and that if we wanted to pursue the matter in court, that was what we'd have to do. \n\nSo we did. \n\nI'm not sure what kind of lawyer magic my lawyer and his fellow legal demons worked on this front, but we were in court for one single hour when my lawyer and their four lawyers and the judge had a private talk after the preliminary hearing.\n\nHalf hour later and the lawyers from Maybe Ryan Homes come back into the court room looking like a quartet of cats that had been pissed on.  My lawyer takes a seat beside me and says 'They're going to settle.'\n\nAnd I was like 'I didn't think we were that far along into this yet. What happened?'\n\nAnd he said 'They built fifty one homes in COUNTY OF CONCERN over two years.  Every single one of them was inspected before close of sale by a real estate agent that never actually got around to getting her home inspector license.'\n\nAnd that's how Was It Ryan Homes The Whole Time paid me ten grand to not sue them while they got bent over by the county and the state and tag-teamed like the new boy with the pretty lips in a prison yard.\n\nTl;Dr - housing developer harasses my wife and I, then harasses our tenants after we leave and rent the property or, to try to make us join their creepy HoA.   They make us take them to court to get anything done, at which point my lawyers let the judge know that everything the developer built in that area was unlawfully sold because the home inspector wasn't actually a home inspector and all the legal documents she signed off on during every closing on every one of those units in the whole county were invalid.\n\nDeveloper gets throat-punched repeatedly by county and state for probably millions of dollars in fines and fees and settlements with home owners that were sold properties that were never lawfully inspected before being turned over.\n\nI got ten grand in the settlement, which my wife and I gave to the tenants in that property because they deserved it and we really didn't need it anyway.\n\nEdit: spelling words is hard",

But then things happened.\n\nSuddenly residents looking to put in fences, for example, had to get HOA approval before the town would issue a permit. Weird thing was the HOA automatically approved the requests and didn't charge. As a 50 year old development most residences already had fences and it was generally just the newbies, who didn't know better, were being affected.\n\nFast forward to this past summer. Now what could happen to the pool club property as stated in our deeds was very basic: belongs to the HOA or can be donated to the town. Remember how I said the club is looking nice these days. Long story short the HOA president is also a township committee member with desires to move up the political chain and threatened us with either our dues double for new infrastructure issues or we donate the club to the town. No alternative and she was going to show us the books, which never happened. Oh and thanks to Covid the annual meeting didn't happen.\n\nNow, our deeds all state we own our lots and a portion of the pool club. We are in NJ so that little portion is worth quite a few dollars.

They\u2019d ask about me when I was off, and loved me for brightening their day. My manager came to me one day with a script and demanded I spoke from it. I repeatedly did not use it. And eventually she got frustrated and threatened me with a write up if I didn\u2019t read from it. \n\nHere comes the malicious compliance. There was a typo in the script that referred to McDonald\u2019s as McDondald\u2019s. So. I\u2019d repeatedly say it, and because everyone has a headset, they\u2019d all hear it, And the staff would chuckle because most could read English, and they all got the script.

            "Mcdonalds was honestly the worst place I've ever worked. I started Valentines day 2020 and walked out that December. It felt like hell. I wear hearing aids, and at the time i was trying out a different part on the hearing aids. Normally the microphone where all the sound comes in is in the hearing aid itself but i was trying one where the microphone was in the mold that goes in your ear. What i didn't know at the time was that sweat would get into the ear piece and dissolve the glue holding the microphone, which made it stop working, which meant i would have to constantly send it off for repair. Well one time i told the kitchen manager, not the GM, the situation and her exact words were \"I know you can't hear but you still need to listen.\"\n\nAnother time i was told to do something and i heard the GM tell this girl, let's call her Anna, to watch me to make sure i did it right. I heard Anna say \"Why do i have to be the babysitter?\". There was another time where i did something with the dishes not in the exact way the biscuit maker wanted because she talked so soft i couldn't hear her, so when we ran out of biscuits in the middle of breakfast rush and i asked her to make more, she refused, which screwed the whole store up. The kitchen manager told me \"She says you ignore her, she ignores you.\"\n\nBut what was the most infuriating one to me, is when it was slow they would always have me washing dishes, and call me back to the fryer if we got busy. Well one time Anna literally set up a whole crew meeting to \"talk about my attitude.\" She said \"I don't know why MustangLover22 always has such an attitude with me, i ask her to do something and she doesn't do it.\" To which i said \"Well don't have me washing dishes when it's slow because i can't hear you when that sprayer is going, maybe if i had a second person with me-\" I instantly got cut off with \"You shouldn't even be using the sprayer anyway.\" They didn't even acknowledge that i couldn't hear when they needed me and asked for help. I bit my tongue so hard and almost walked out then, but i stayed for another couple months until i lost my temper over another incident and walked out during lunch rush.",

There was also a part that mentioned removing the Cmos battery.\n\nIt was short lived since my coworker was at that part, and the manager heard him say Cmos battery and immediately starts yelling at my coworker about telling someone to remove the cmos battery and who told him to do so. He told him that it's on the script, which the mangler declines is there. Cue the embarrassment as he and my lead show him the exact script he wrote and approved saying to perform this action.

Yeah I would; do you know where I can get some? \ud83d\ude04)\n\nAnyways... my pals and I thought this was really great, so we started packing on as many superlatives as we could think of when ordering. 7 seconds of \"Gimme a cheeseburger, small fries and a chocolate shake\" became a 35 to 55 second verbal ordeal, with the poor frustrated counter person becoming very annoyed.\n\nThey soon dropped the enhanced crapola, but probably not because of us - it was just so industrial-strength lame.",

        "selftext": "I used to wait tables at an upscale restaurant that was known to be the place to have your holiday or office parties. Great money if you got the right group. The menus were pre-set, the wine and liquor was pre-set, and it was all auto-grated at 18%. All of it was in the contract the host signed pre-event. Usually the host would make themselves known fairly early on so you would know who to talk to if there was an issue and who to give the check to at the end of the night.\n\nOne night, I am splitting a party of 30-40 with another server. This event had top tier food and mid level wine and booze. Very nice. A small group of 5-6 people arrive a bit ahead of schedule. 2 guys and 3-4 women. Not a problem, its actually nicer if they slowly roll in so we can get drinks started. I walk over, introduce myself and the other waiter and ask for drinks. Now this was back in the early 2000's and chads weren't a thing yet, but the 2 guys were the chaddiest chads. If they could have popped their collars in their suits, I'm sure these guys would have found a way.\n\nSuperchad1 - \"Me and my bro are going to start with a round of Johnny Walker blue, and these ladies are going to have (expensive red wine)\"\n\nSuperchad2- (turning to the girls) \"Once you have Johnny Blue, you just cant drink anything else. It changes you, bro\"\n\nMe- \"If you like, I can put those on a separate tab, the event contract has Johnny Walker Black, but not blue, and the red wine selection for tonight is (less expensive wine)\"\n\nSuperchad1 - \"This is our party, just get me what I ordered and dont question me again!\"\n\nSuperchad2- \"Who do you think you are? You're just some waiter, we have MBA's. Just get us our drinks!\"\n\nI walk over to the other waiter and tell him we are in for a hell of a night, but the check should be nice. For those that dont know, Johnny Walker blue is 3-4x the cost of Johnny Black. So one round of drinks for these people is over $100. The whole night goes exactly as we thought. Nothing was good enough, the appetizers were crap, the food was horrible, not enough bread, too many bread plates, drinks were taking too long, why do some people have food and others dont (its 40 people man, it takes a minute to get that much food out). To make it worse, chads and co are all over the place, moving seats and making others move so they can talk to who they want. This makes serving hell because we did everything by seat number.\n\nSurprisingly, most of the table was normal, not entitled people and who knew that waiters are people too. They were impressed by the food, and graciously ordered the drinks that were in the contract. One older gentleman at the other end of the table from the chads apologized for their behavior, saying \"they might have fancy degrees and good jobs, but you cant teach class\". Love that guy.\n\nFinally, they are winding down and after drinking almost a full bottle of Johnny Blue along with all the other food and drinks they have a VERY hefty check and the other waiter and I are excited to get paid. We start picking up the dessert plates and asking for last drink requests. The nice older guy at the end of the table says to bring him the check. Not wanting any more interaction with the chads than necessary, I bring it to him. I tell him I can take care of it whenever and go about clearing the table. A few minutes later he calls me over\n\nNice guy - \"Maybe there was a mistake in ringing up the drinks? There is almost $600 for Johnny blue, when the contract I signed only included Johnny Black. And there are some single glasses of wine that are different from what we agreed upon.\"\n\nMe - \"No mistake sir, that is what was ordered and drank.\" (He is being awesome, and I feel bad)\n\nNice guy - \"Why did you give the drinks to them when we clearly had a contract?\"\n\nMe - \"I apologize sir, they told me that this was their party and since I was just a waiter to shut up and do as I was told. So I did. Im sorry, I took them at their word\"\n\nI point them out and he calls them over. What follows was the singularly greatest ass chewing I have ever been witness to. He goes on about how he was doing something nice but apparently that wasn't enough. About how horrible their behavior was that night and how he is ashamed for them. But my favorite line was how you see a persons true colors in how they treat people that work for them and they had shown theirs. Then he calls me back over.\n\nNice guy - \"Apparently I thought this was my party. Guess I was wrong. This is their party and they will be taking care of the check. Oh, and up the gratuity to 25%. You earned it.\"\n\nHe turns around and walks off, leaving the chads with the check. All in all it was about 3k. I have never seen 2 grown men look so defeated.\n\nEdit: credit to u/beepolai The boss might have been their father. It makes total sense looking back. Thanks!!\n\nEdit2: Holy crap. Thanks for the gold and silvers!!!  Now if someone can tell me what that means!\n\nEdit3: The words have been paraphrased, this was 10+ years ago. The only word for word thing that I remember is \"Once you have Johnny Blue, you just cant drink anything else. It changes you, bro\". It was such a DB thing to say I still remember it.",

He had recently had an incredibly nosy couple move in next door and realized the flimsy four foot fence he had got for the dog wouldn\u2019t keep out peeping eyes.\n\nSo he installed a fence. But instead of using a standard size, which he knew his neighbors would peer over, he built an 8 foot fence.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t even a week before HOA was on his ass, threatening every fine they could and claiming he couldn\u2019t have a fence over 6 feet tall. So, being a dutiful citizen, he called the fence company to uninstall said fence. \n\nWhile the fence was being taken down, he closely examined the HOA handbook on the precise definition of a fence.\n\nHe installed a new 6 foot fence that fit every single regulation, but with a 3 foot brick wall beneath it.\n\nEDIT:\n\nA lot of people are pointing out they\u2019ve seen a story like this here or on Tumblr. I acknowledge karma farming is a major thing, but I am relaying the story as I heard it. \n\nI have plenty more from him, granted they don\u2019t fit in this sub.

The property is strange as our front gate is down a secluded footpath but the side of our property abuts the main road. \n\nThe old boy who lived here before had a very small white picket fence around the garden right next to the main road. He used to be into his gardening and would chat to people over the fence and at the bus stop on the road. He also let people cut theough the garden to the village green rather than walking round. We have three children and after several incidences of delivery people and even villagers jumping the fence to use our garden as a short cut, we decided to put a 6 ft fence up for safety. Meaning people had to walk around our garden and our kids could be out there in peace \n\nNot 2 days later we got a letter from the parish council saying 6ft fences are not allowed at the front of a property and it needs to be 4ft. Thus was odd as the fence in question was at the side of our property, we were not addressed on the main road but on the road the footpath leads to so I ignored the letter, again they wrote to us and said they'd be reporting us to the planning office or something if we didn't take it down. \n\nI decided to write back saying that it is the side of our property, and said anymore letters will result in the fence being painted shocking pink (they were very, very pre-occupied with what the village looked like). They obviously checked and confirmed what I said as I received no more letters and it's been 10 years.",

Many years ago he decided he wanted an off-grid home on one of his hills to be powered by solar panels, toilet on a septic tank, and he wanted a well near a creek that could be pumped up to a cistern on the hill. Had an architect draw everything up and submitted it to the city. Of course they refused it.\n\nThe architect called to see when the permit would be approved, and was informed of refusal. He said \"give me a day\". At no charge, he made a few minor changes, and resubmitted the plans as a barn with an \"office\". It's legal to have running water, electricity, and a toilet in a barn.",

The fence is still there, but you can\u2019t see the top 2 feet. \n\nAs a side note, they lost their drone when they tried spying on another neighbor\u2019s daughter and he blew it out of the sky with a 12 gauge.

Client had a steep slope in the backyard to where the house was a good bit higher than the property line in back where the privacy fence was. Original 6ft fence wasn't tall enough and the house behind them (and their yard) was clearly visible from the clients back deck. But the HOA wouldn't let them install an 8ft fence even though the circumstances of the slope meant it wouldn't be any taller than any other fence around them. So instead we built about a 3ft \"bulkhead\" and then a 6ft fence on top of that, totaling about 9ft of height coverage.

Now this is back when smoking was still allowed in restaurants and we had a smoking section and a non smoking section.

Now on Sunday we had your wonderful church rush that would pack the entire place for hours. So Sunday was totally non smoking until 3pm.\n\nOn the weekends we would have about 8 servers. This ment that smoking side had 2 while the other side had 6. So if you worked the smoking side you had 10 tables to take care of while the other servers had 4. Management knew I was good at what I did and would always put me in the biggest section on Sunday and I could take care of all 10 of the tables no problem. Now servers always talk about their tips and without fail I always made more than anyone else. This caused anger from some of the newer servers and they said it was because I always got the better section.\n\nManagement came to me and told me what was going on that's when we decided on malicious compliance. Ok you can have my section next Sunday I will take this small section. But since I am on the other side of the restaurant I will not be able to help you much. I then got to enjoy a less stressful Sunday did my job like normal turned my tables and made a ton of money. The other server was running around like crazy and not getting much done. At the end of the shift they learned that they made less than the week before because of how bad they were taking care of their tables and the church crowd are horrible if you aren't taking care of them right. \n\nIt was always great to hear the server say you can have your section back I don't want it ever again.

We had the drunchies, we were all 24-28 years old and wanted to sober up and avoid a hangover for whatever Saturday shenanigans we chose. \n\nThis place was typically a ghost town but sometimes they would get a few tables from the bars letting out and the locals who knew they were open 24 hours. Typically it would be 6-8 of us. We ended up becoming regulars and the waiter who typically served us was this guy named Mike who was working Friday nights for extra cash. We were always pretty wasted but Mike was a damn good server and really cool and friendly. He never really hung out but would make sure we had plenty of coffee and would stop by for a few minutes at a time to laugh at our bullshit typical bro shenanigans. Typically they only had two waitstaff at that time of night and some kitchen staff. We always requested to be sat at Mike's section because we liked him and he was a good server. We did this for years and no matter how many times we tried to convince him to come out Mike stayed professional (which as a former server, LOL) and never came out to party as much as we tried to convince him. \n\nI don't know what the fuck happened but I think the other servers who were occasionally scheduled to work Friday nights as part of their rotating schedule started complaining that Mike would leave with a big fat wad of tips from a half dozen or more drunken former frat bros. We started coming in on Friday nights and he would have to avoid us and we would be sat in a different section. The servers we got weren't as friendly and would sometimes rush us (we would stay for an hour or two to end the night of partying) and weren't as down with our sense of humor as Mike was. \n\nEventually after a few times of going there and getting seated in a section without our preferred server we decided to stop going to that diner all together, even when we were wasted and hungry on a friday, because it wasn't the same atmosphere/ambiance without Mike. \n\nSo the owners/manager decided instead of making at least a few hundred on (back then) cheap af to purchase and prepare breakfast food, to lose that money to appease some squeaky wheels who worked night shift at a diner that didn't get a ton of business late at night because they didn't want to work hard.",

        "selftext": "I worked for a mid size fashion company with around 150 retail stores nationwide as a maintenance and safety coordinator.  4 months into the job my manager quit and I picked up everything and was doing fine on my own for years and I was the only person in charge of maintaining the stores and the alarm systems in all the stores.  I did get a pay bump but not a promotion in title.\n\nI put my contact number on every store's emergency contact list just in case the primary contacts, usually the store managers, don't pick up their phones in case of emergencies.  And the store managers almost always refuse to pick up calls during off hours, so my phone would ring at least 2 to 3 times every night.  99% of the times are false alarm, usually caused by window break sensors getting tripped by vibration from a big truck passing by or a leaf hitting the window.  I hated it but had to do it because if no one on the emergency contact list picks up the phone, the alarm company automatically calls the police for dispatch and there are penalties for false alarms, ranging from $50 to $200 per incidence after 2 or 3 freebies, varies by location.\n\nIn 2017, Department of Labor passed a law requiring all employees making under a certain amount of $$$ to be converted to hourly so they can earn overtime.  My salary was $800 short of making the cut.  I brought it up with HR stating that an hourly schedule would actually interfere with my duties and a $800 raise in pay would make everything easier.  And HR simply said, \"well, that's too bad and we can't do anything about it at the moment.\"\n\nWell, ok.\n\nAfter that conversation I put my phone on mute and stopped caring about anything outside of my 9-5.  In hindsight, life was actually so much easier and better that way and not sure why I even wanted to stay on salary.  Months go by without any serious issues, except for the penalties for false alarms starting to pile up.  One day Accounting and Operations brought me into the office asking what those costs were. I told them what they were and Operations sent out a memo reminding all store managers that safety is of critical importance and they have to pick up calls from alarm companies.  No one bothered asking why there was a surge of these additional costs and I didn't care enough to remind them that it was because of me.\n\nFew more months go by and one morning I woke up to almost 20 missed calls on my cell.  Apparently, one of our Florida stores was broken into the night before at around 3am.  The store manager tried to get a hold of me because I was the one in charging of requesting/dispatching vendors for things like emergency board up.  After an hour of trying to get a hold of me, she eventually started calling up everybody on the hierarchy for help and I had 6 missed calls from the Senior VP of Operations alone.  Eventually the Director of Constructions was able to get a crew to board up the store but that was almost 3 hours later and everyone was royally pissed.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the second I stepped into the office I was called into the office with all the senior management and HR and were asked why I was not there to take care of it.  And I simply replied \"because I already clocked out.\"  The senior VP of operations was obviously not pleased with that answer and said it was my duty and I needed to be on standby at all times to handle these situations even during off hours.  To which I stated \"oh, so I should be on call then.  In that case I'll have to work with Accounting to get properly compensated for my on-call hours once we have a schedule established.\"\n\nThe room went silent.  And nothing came out of the rather short meeting.\n\nLater that afternoon, HR called me into the office again asking whether I'd like to become salaried again with a pay bump.  I said I'll take the pay bump and but I'd rather stay hourly and walked out.\n\nThey didn't give me the pay bump.\n\nEdit:  Sorry I didn't provide what happened next.  So here's some closure.  I was put on call for a few weeks because it was summer at the time of the incident and HVAC systems kept failing over the weekends in our Florida stores.  And again, I was the one to dispatch vendors to fix them.  Money was great during that period lol.  Eventually the Director of Constructions was put on as the emergency contact for off hour issues and he absolutely hated it.\n\nI left the company last year.  They had to scramble to get a replacement and hired a maintenance supervisor with an MBA in political science, but no related experience......  My last contact from the company was the supervisor asking me what the log in credentials were for all the 150 stores' alarm systems.  I didn't reply.",

            "Something similar happened at the hospital I worked at. The supervisors were salary and were in charge of taking call outs and arranging for coverage. Once that law passed, HR didn\u2019t want to bump up their pay to keep them salary so the supervisors were no longer able to take call outs. I was a manager at the time and I knew the value of my supervisors. I had fought for them to get raises because i knew they were worth it. They all offered to still take call outs because they knew it would fall on me if they didn\u2019t. I told them to not take any calls off hours and instructed the employees to only contact me outside of work hours. I ended up getting burnt out and quit about a year later. That wasn\u2019t the main reason but it was just the icing on the cake of being overworked constantly. I still have friends who work there and conditions have gotten steadily worse in the 3 years I\u2019ve been gone. I count my blessings every day that I was able to escape.",

            "I remember working as a general manager of a fast food chain restaurant. I won\u2019t name the restaurant but it rhymes with \u201cshit-fondles\u201d. \n\nAnyhow, my district manager was on my ass about labor cost and I kept insisting that I needed that much labor in order to break the sales records that I was breaking. I had a regular clientele that reliably showed up every day for breakfast (seniors) and then construction workers were flooding in for the \u201cGolden hour\u201d. I scheduled 28 employees every day to handle the lunch rush, and my deposits from lunch alone were up to $10,000 a shift! In my first year of doing this our store went from 1.2 million in profit to over 3 million in profit. My manager didn\u2019t care. She wanted me to only have 12 people on to do the shift. \n\nI held out as long as I could because my crew was so happy to be making a good paycheck. Everyone was getting 38 hours a week. It was the best I could do for them, 40 hrs a week was not going to be allowed period. \n\nAfter many arguments my manager started dictating how to run my store and scheduling was done by her and we dropped down to 12 people. That when shit hit the fan. Every lunch was a disaster. It took hours to clean up after the lobby had been destroyed and I finally started thinking maybe I should quit. One night I was still in the store doing paperwork at 9:00 at night. I realized that I was getting up at 4:00 a.m. to open, working breakfast and lunch, then cleaning with my crew and then helping them set up for dinner. On average I worked 4a.m. To 5p.m. Every day and I was working that schedule 6 days a week. \n\nOne day I did the math. I was earning a little over $7 an hour. I put in my notice and never looked back. I think my experience with the shitty arches really informed my opinion of the corporate world in general.",

            "In 2005ish I worked at a job where I was on a rotation of being on call. It was shifts around the clock. If anyone didn't show up for a shift, I had to be available to cover for them. The last shift of the day started at 11pm, so when I was on call I would wait until about 1130. By then everyone who was scheduled to work had shown up, and I could go to bed.\n\nI was also an assistant manager (basically I was a manager but they structured it so they could pay me less). I always kept my phone charged, near me, volume up, in addition to the on call pager when I was on call.\n\nOne morning I came in to work and my manager says I'm in trouble. Why didn't I answer my phone at 3am? I took out my phone and showed him my call log. No incoming calls since the afternoon before. No missed calls. I asked if he had paged me. He said no, he had just called me directly. This was technically a violation of procedure, but everyone did it that way because you were supposed to call back asap anyway. I hated that damn pager--why bother when everyone has cell phones?\n\nSo he tells me that he decided to do a spot check in the middle of the night. He was required to do a certain number of these on each shift. He went in at 3am found a violation, fired the staff member effective immediately. Then he called me to cover the rest of the shift. \n\nBut that's not what the on call person is for. I'm only supposed to cover staff calling out sick. I told him this, explained that for whatever reason his call hadn't come through, and that he didn't use the pager. I didn't have a land line and wasn't required to. He was generally a fair minded person and he didn't really have anything to write me up on, so he \"only\" gave me a warning. I told him if I was on call all night I wanted a heads up on spot checks. He said that no one could know about spot checks ahead of time or they would be pointless (reasonable).\n\nI left the meeting and made a complaint. The company had a shift called a \"sleep shift\" where you would sleep on site. If you weren't needed you got $25. If you were needed someone would wake you to and you'd clock in. I said if I was on call all night I wanted sleep shifts.\n\nWell, a bunch of people talked to each other. The fallout was that company policy said that if you fired someone on a spot check, YOU cover the shift--not the on call person. I was there when they told my boss and he was like, \"...oh.\" If he was acting, he deserved an Emmy. He genuinely thought he could fire someone and the drag me out of bed to clean up his mess. \n\nI never figured out why I didn't get his phone calls. He called 5 or 6 times that night. I verified he called the right number. I even called my cell carrier and they had no record of calls.\n\nNot long after that the company made nighttime spot checks voluntary for managers. They said too many people were getting fired (not a good reason) but I think it was that managers didn't want to cover their own shifts.",

The woman who ran the business office openly despised me and flat out stated she didn\u2019t think my position (running an admissions department for a law school) was worth the required $47,500/year salary. I said, \u201cOkay, well how about I keep track of my overtime and we can see if it\u2019s cheaper to switch me to hourly work.\u201d \n\nA lot of my job involved travel (drive time, events at schools, recruiting to classes, etc), constant emails, and phone calls all hours of the day (6 pm California time = 9 pm my time).

It ended up being about $2,400 of overtime a month, which would have almost doubled my salary.

He really loved left-over home cooked meals. \n\n \" I don't get lunches off, I have to work to keep paying your salary. You can go buy another lunch\"   He would say. \n\nI hated him so much, but I got paid a lot. He was fresh out of his internship and residency, and he thought he was above everyone. \n\nWe complained to the office manager. She went to the doctor and said we were all pissed about it.  The doctor told her to \"deal with it\".  If the Doctor  decided to eat one of our lunches, we could have the office manager just order us something.  \n\nThis was amazing! There were 2 people besides me  that had family and kids, so we always brought leftovers. \n\n If he ate my food, I ordered from the most expensive steak place in town. Appetizers,  22 oz steak,  3 sides, a salad, and dessert.  I'd eat the salad, and the rest went home.  And of course, there are plenty of leftovers to take to work the next day! \n\nThe rest of the staff was doing the same. Ordering full chickens,  4-5 different Chinese dishes, spending hundreds of dollars to replace stolen meatloaf sandwiches and day old soups and spaghetti. \n\nThe office manager went along with it. After all, he said we could order what we wanted if he took our lunch. \n\nIt went on for 2 months until dickhead doc caught on.  From then on, he had the office manager order him a lunch. \n\nI did miss trading off a cold pork chop and Spanish rice for  prime rib and all the fixings. \n\n(I posted this as a comment on r/askreddit, but, as I typed it out I decided it belonged here.)",

        "selftext": "I work for a company that does commissions for clients.  I am the manager of my department.  This comes with a number of responsibilities, one of them is bidding on work.\n\nLast fall I evaluated the current global situation and how it it would be effecting the costs of our supplies and possible shortages as well as inflation.  As a result, I priced a few of our pieces of work to help prepare us for the price increases I had predicted, giving us a 8-10% profit upon completion.\n\nA well known client came in and contracted us to do a rather large and time intensive project.  This individual is very well off and is in no way in any danger to be going broke any time soon.  However, this client complained about the new prices.  He had contracted us in the past on certain items and wanted the same work done again, but seeing the new price, he complained to the boss and threatened to go elsewhere.\n\nThe owner, my boss, decided I had priced the work too high based on the complaints of this one customer.  (Previous customers had not batted an eye) Boss asks me to adjust the price down to be the same as the \"competition.\"\n\nJust so you know, the competition does not carry the same quality standards and often has a 2-3 year turnaround.\n\nI explained this to the boss that my numbers were based on the increases from suppliers and subcontractors, who I speak to regularly.  These companies we work with warned me before hand about what was coming, and I took it all to heart.  I had passed the warning on to the boss at the time but it appeared he blew it off or forgot about it and at the time of making the new price list, he didnt complain.  It wasnt until this one, somewhat well known local client rose a stink that he decided to bring the issue up with me.\n\nSo Boss insisted that we should be pricing lower to keep up with the competition or we would lose this customer.  Of course I argued that it would hurt us in the long run and all we would be doing is attracting tire-kickers.  He stood his ground though, and I didnt have the energy to fight him on it, so in the end, he's the boss and got what he wanted.\n\nSo the time came to order the supplies and pay the subcontractors.  The costs of these materials as well as the work done on them were 90% of the price Boss had agreed to the customer.  This is before my own labour costs were factored in.  Boss sees the bill and gets really upset and asks me what the customer was paying to have the work done.  I gently reminded him this was for Rich Tire Kicker Customer, and I had warned him well before hand, but because he wanted to retain Rich Tire-Kicker Customer, he got what he wanted, but the company did the work at cost, and perhaps more with my labor factored in.\n\nBoss later came to me and asked me to make up a new price list.  I told him I didnt need to, I did that last fall and as long as no one gives deep discounts, we will be in the green.\n\nHes listening to me now.\n\nEdit: Spelling!",

            "Used to work in a big pharma company (evil, I know). Key customers were seen as important to business, so they got special treatment. Big money flowing in. \n\nAccount Receivables (Finance dept. invoicing customers) were always worried about late payments, for obvious reasons. The more money not collected, the more money lost on interest. Among my duties was to make monthly reports on accepted orders, so AR could predict future invoices. \n\nWhen year-end financial reporting was approaching, AR stepped up their collecting duties to get better results under the line. More notes were sent and Customer Service was making reminder calls to customers late with their payments. \n\nWe noticed one key customer, or actually just one European division of theirs being horribly late with their payments. Like months past the due date. 7-figure sums. More than all the other customers combined. Other divisions of this same customer had no troubles paying, only this one. It was not due to lack of money, just plain old-fashioned negligence. Very obvious target, the late fees alone were running in hundreds of thousands. \n\nBut no. Key Customer manager jumped in to stop the collection. Not even a request for information was allowed. Because they're Key Customer and they might leave. Where exactly, I really don't know. They were a long time customer using our products for their processes, and those can't be just simply moved to another provider like you would change your favourite sausage stand. And a single division can't step out of a global supply process, because mothership tells them what to do. \n\nSo we took the monetary hit, only hoping that customer would pay. Even the late fees were nullified. They kept making monthly orders and they'd pay eventually. But they clearly abused the lack of targeted collection process. \n\nAnd at the same time our small and medium size customers would be ruthlessly harassed for their unpaid bills - and definitely no mercy on late fees. Which all were basically nickels compared to this single Key Customer division. \n\nThis kind of spineless and completely useless a$$kissing just blew my mind. Not even a reminder or request for information? Just hoping they'll pay some day? Bollocks, I say.\n\nTL:DR; Single subdivision of a big customer gets away with super late bills, because someone is afraid they *might* leave - while in reality they can't. \n\nEdit: Corrections and TLDR",

I also wanted approval from authority figures (as I rarely got it at home), so I kept quiet, did good work and was generally well liked by my teachers.\n\nLike I said, it was a strict household and my outfits were closely inspected for \"modesty\" by my very conservative parents.  If it passed at home, it wasn't going to get me in trouble.  I tried hard to fit in with the other kids though, and found that wearing a layer underneath made regular outfits pass the home dress code.  So I still got to wear the distressed jeans, but you could see black leggings instead of my knees. Not a huge deal, and it helped me feel better about my appearance, at least socially anyway.\n\nAs trends were set, leggings became super popular!  Finally, I was ahead and on point with my style!  Some girls did begin to abuse the system though.  School dress code required skirts to be no shorter than 3 inches (1 index card) above the knee.  Standard was suddenly lots of tiny denim mini skirts with leggings.  So the school cracked down and said leggings were no longer allowed under skirts.  Of course, since I had different home rules, I didn't even own a skirt that short.  My skirts had to reach the knees, which was 3 inches longer than the school requirement.  I didnt even mention the new school rule at home because I didn't think it was an issue.\n\nSo I get super cute, wearing my knee-length denim skirt and leggings (as it was still trendy, and a bit chilly out), pass home inspection and head off to school.  Nothing was said in my first three classes, but like I said, I was a good kid and always well covered.  One of the super mean teachers (not even mine, just one standing outside her door) spotted my skirt and leggings in the hall, and grabbed me and marched me down to the office.  I knew of the rule change, but I truly thought it wouldn't be a big deal since I wasn't wearing a mini skirt.  She shoved me in and yelled something about a dress code violation and left to return to her class.  \n\nI was called in, thinking the principal (who I didn't know well) would laugh with me about her unreasonableness.  Boy was I wrong.  He screamed up and down how I was dressed inappropriately, and he would be calling my parents to come get me to take me home to change.\n\nOh no.\n\nOooohhh nonononoNO!!!!!\n\nAs I stood and turned around showing him my clothes, I tried to argue that my skirt met code and the leggings covered more. I even tried to explain that my parents would take it out on me in an aggressive manner.  He wasn't going to hear any of it.  I had to think fast.  Cue malicious compliance.\n\nWhile he was still looking for the number to call, I kicked off my shoes and began wriggling the leggings down and off, right there in his office in front of him.  Since my skirt was long enough, I shoved my pants in my bag and stated that now he has no reason to call my parents.  I was fully compliant with the dress code of the school.\n\nAs he stared with his mouth agape, I could see him turning red while trying to figure out how to deal with me. He ended up just yelling, \"Get out of my office! Get to class!\"\n\nNever have I felt so relieved.  \n\nTLDR:  Leggings weren't allowed under skirts but I thought mine would be fine since it met regulations.  When I got in trouble, I removed my leggings from under my skirt right in front of them.",

The school also decided that in-school suspension for the day was an appropriate punishment for violating the dress code in such a MAJOR way.  How were they determining whose pants were too tight? By having a make cop who worked in the school look us over and personally decide if our pants were too tight or not.
