For a visitor to be granted entrance, they had to prove that a) they have an appointment, and b) they are who they claim to be.\n\nNow the first part was easy, no need to show us your email, just give us a name and we'd call that person to confirm. The second required some sort of ID though, driver's license, employee badge, something like that. Or your inviter would have to meet you out here and confirm to us in writing. Note that we didn't keep your document, we just needed to put down your name and take a real quick glance of your face and photo.\n\nMost of our visitors had no problem with the protocol. Some would voice their frustration but still comply. Well not this special guy. He got aggressive and demanded an explanation about the need for an ID when he was standing right here. Couldn't seem to grasp it however we tried, and he got increasingly louder. He didn't want his inviter to meet him outside because \"this is wrong.\" Security was ready to see him out when he screamed at us to call the cops, because we needed to be arrested and taught a lesson on civil rights.\n\nCalls were made, cops came quickly, and he went out in cuffs. Turned out they already had a warrant, just weren't in a hurry to get him. Icing on the cake was that he was here for a job interview.",

Dude starts losing his shit on my guard (who had a body cam, I quite enjoyed the video later), and not only pulled a knife on the guard, but demanded he call the police because he was being harassed. Guard was like alright if you insist, calls the cops and says \"yeah this guy pulled a knife on me and started making threats before demanding I call you because apparently I'm harassing him\". Cops show up, ask him outright if he'd been threatening the guard with a knife (which the guard had been able to get away from him) and the guy straight up admitted to making threats with a deadly weapon lmao needless to say they laughed him into the back of the cop car.",

For some reason, 19 year old me when no medical experience was allowed to tell these doctors that services were not needed medically. \n\nThis job was the easiest, yet most miserable job experience I ever had. I was only able to last a few months there. During my last 2 weeks, I was really slacking off. I was just so burned out. I couldn't stand denying yet ANOTHER case where someone needed meds and the insurance company didn't want to pay for them. I was reprimanded for not working hard enough and getting processed. \n\nInsert malicious compliance. I worked faster than I ever had before. That's because I approved every case that came before. Every doctor I spoke to, I just gave them approval. Every prior authorization I saw was approved. \n\nDuring my first week, I did this once and was told to not do it again because I have to follow company guidelines, but I didn't care at this point.

But first, I had to argue for three months just to get them to cover it because they claimed my chart had a previous diagnosis on it from years ago and the medication was not covered for anyone who had ever had that diagnosis.  It involved lots of phone calls and letter-writing, and in the end, the CEO of my company had to call the people who were providing the insurance and threaten to change plans, before they finally agreed to cover it.

The will of the people and the public good are irrelevant when elections are decided based solely on who can spend the most money and our public policy is guided by the best interests of corporations and billionaires.  If that's not you, then as a citizen, you no longer have a meaningful voice or a say in how our government works.\n\nThe end result is that politicians who had already been corrupted by the ~~bribes~~ campaign contributions of the wealthiest Americans were now further corrupted by millions of dollars from corporations, ensuring that for as long as *stare decisis* remains in place for *Citizens*, every single decision made by our \"elected\" representatives is merely a reflection of the wishes of the corporations whose money informs every decision they make and every position they support or oppose.   Want to win a seat in Congress? The endless corporate money can buy one for you, provided you're willing to make sure that every vote you cast aligns with the best interests of those same corporations.  If you don't toe the line, they can take your seat away in the blink of an eye just by redirecting those endless streams of money to other candidates who aren't bothered by things such as ethics and the will of their constituents.\n\nThis is why meaningful health care reform in the United States is currently a pipe dream, and why a nation that once took pride in being among the world's foremost innovators is now saddled with an antiquated third-world health care system that exists only to make Big Pharma and Big Insurance, along with their \"owned\" representatives, wealthier and more powerful, while taxpayers and the sick, injured, and poor shoulder all of the burdens.",

At those production rates, a year\u2019s supply of human insulin could cost $48-$71 per patient, and analog insulin could cost $78-$133 per patient per year.\n\n(Link to study: https://gh.bmj.com/content/3/5/e000850 )\n\nThink about that. At the most, one of those can cost $133/year. Based on the price cap that's set with Medicare, the average diabetic on Medicare is paying $420/year. Now think about this, people NOT on Medicare are paying MORE for insulin. The companies that produce it are making billions of dollars, because they are allowed to mark up life saving medicines at an exponential rate.\n\nThis doesn't just affect those on insulin, there are tons of other medications that are the same way. They are cheap to produce, yet expensive to buy, because there is a severe lack of regulation on the price they can charge. \n\nInsurance companies don't care that medicine is expensive. Even if they're ordered by the government to cover more, they'll just raise your rates. If we can bring costs down significantly in the medical world, it will lessen the need for insurance companies, and it will be easier to regulate them, as they can be forced to only raise rates at a set percentage a year, instead of whatever they feel like, their costs will be lower, and it will still be profitable for them if they're forced to cover a lot more.",

            "I wear dentures, top & bottom because I have no teeth (obv right?).  I need new lowers right now. So, insurance covers re-line @ 50% and a brand new one @ 100%, not sure why but ok I\u2019ll get the new ones.  Turns out I need PA, ok, fine. I wait a week and they come back with \"before we cover your new dentures you need a full set of x-rays\".\n\n??? X-rays of what exactly? Proof I have no teeth? \n\nIn the meantime I can\u2019t wear my lowers because they don\u2019t fit anymore and each new appointment takes a week and then I wait a week for insurance. I figure I\u2019ll get my new dentures by the time my birthday comes around at the middle of next month.",
            "My insurance company tried to not pay the pediatrician bill when I had my son, saying that the doctor\u2019s office billed the wrong insurance (they have a two tier system). I fought this for so many hours it was crazy. I even was threatened with not being able to continue seeing my pediatrician for my baby\u2019s wellness exams if I didn\u2019t pay the bill. I ended up paying it and several months later got a refund. Health insurance in the US is criminal.",
            "I had an OB who, when told the insurance company wanted her to discharge a patient that she thought should still have another 24 hours in the hospital, would call the insurance company and inform whoever she was talking to, usually in another state (and Round Rock, Texas isn't anywhere near a state line) that *they* would need to come to the hospital in person to authorize the discharge, because she wouldn't, due to whatever good reason was the case with that patient. \n\nIt was effective.",

            "And that's exactly why insurance companies should have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with people's medical care. They are making money on other people's misery. \nIllness can happen to anyone regardless. First people pay money to get help if they need it. And when they do, they get non.

            "American healthcare system is SO broken...\n\nIt should never be a question of money who gets the treatment they NEED. Almost no one seeks medical attention for the fun of it, this is what people need to survive, yet these companies denies it because it will cost their shareholders a nickle or a dime.\n\nIt should always be the government controlling this. A government who has its citizens best interest in mind :-)\n\nFrom a cost perspective it would be much MUCH cheaper to have the government run it rather than companies. Just look at other countries, who spend much less per citizen on healthcare than is done in the US, yet they all seem to work out just fine.",

            "Quick story, somewhat related. I live in a Muslim country. I received a lecture once about Muslims and alcohol, from a Muslim. But, of course, I already knew it. The guy was kind of a jerk, just being preachy. He kept bashing me with the fact that ***Muslims don't consume or handle alcohol.*** Okay, geez, I get it.\n\nWhen people use the word \"alcohol\", they typically mean ***ethyl*** alcohol, which is the chemical name for the alcohol you find in beer and booze. I'm not a chemist, but I do know that \"alcohol\" is really a generic word for any organic material where oxygen and hydrogen form a special bond with carbon. There are many kinds of alcohol, including isopropyl alcohol, which is an antiseptic. Anyone who's ever gotten a shot has had alcohol wiped on them.\n\nBeing cheeky (and because the guy was a jerk), I pointed this out, insisting that he does, in fact, handle alcohol. The antifreeze in your car's radiator is ethylene. It's an alcohol just like propylene (used to de-ice airplanes). Methanol naturally occurs in the human body (in small amounts); it's in all of us right now.\n\nYeah, he didn't like that at all.",

I hope this does not come off as presumptuous, but I felt that perhaps some words of encouragement and advice would help you gain a new perspective. \n\nI don't believe what you did was truly malicious in nature, and the fact that you are agonizing over how your actions have affected another person demonstrates empathy and compassion. The feeling of guilt is an indication of a healthy conscious and strong morals, things that I believe are essential to being a good person.  Good people act out of anger at times just like everyone else, it doesn't make you any less of a good person. \n\nYour actions may also have the unforeseen and unknowable consequence of improving the lives of others. This woman sounds like she is a bitch to everyone, and while I doubt her true nature will be changed or affected but she may reconsider how she behaves around and treats others. \n\nOverall I don't believe you did something inherently wrong or evil. You exposed the truth, nothing more. While it's not as easy as the million people in the thread saying \"don't feel guilty\" or you \"shouldn't feel bad\" what you can do is accept those feelings of regret for what they are, the feelings of someone who has a good heart and then forgive yourself.

        "selftext": "My very first job was working fast food, at Wendy's. I was 16, and most of my coworkers were also teenagers. There was always work to be done (\"if you have time to lean, you have time to clean\"), but working afternoons/ evenings with a bunch of teens, there was also plenty of fucking around. \n\nWork wasn't the greatest, but it wasn't really that bad either; it was tolerable. Then we got a new manager. This guy was in his 40s, and he was a lifer. He was super strict, and was not about having fun at work at all. Unfortunately, I quickly became his favorite work vessel, because I was easier to control than some of my coworkers. He leaned heavily on me, to pick up the slack that the others left. It got real old, real fast. Why should I work more than everybody else, for the same pay? Why should I be stuck doing more tasks than my coworkers, who get to continue to goof off? \n\nI voiced my concerns to the manager, but nothing changed. He was usually busy hiding in the office, with the mirrored glass window, just watching everybody. He'd only surface on occasion to tell me to work harder, and give everybody else a free pass. Eventually, I had enough. \n\nOne day, I marched in to his office, and demanded that either I get a raise, or for him to hold everybody else to the same standards. He didn't go for that. I told him to consider that conversation my two weeks notice then. He said he needed that in writing. I ripped a sheet of paper out of a notebook on his desk and wrote some along the lines of: \n\nThis is my two weeks notice. \n- Name\n\nI walked outside his office, spit on the paper, and stuck it to his mirrored glass window. He could look at it all he wanted that way. I felt amazing. \n\nFor the next two weeks, the manager kept letting me know that it wasn't too late to change my mind about quitting. He kept alluding to a raise, but never actually offered it.\n\nUpdate: \nWow! I never imagined so many people would enjoy my quick story. It makes me happy reading all the comments from people with similar stories. \nFor the doubters, yes, this was my personal experience. I started some time in fall 2006, and quit in summer 2007.\nAlso, I am aware that two weeks notice is a courtesy, not a necessity. It just seemed wrong to me to not give notice, and two wrongs don't make a right.",

        "selftext": "This happened 12-15 years ago, my ex boss was a bully (I took the official route and he lost his job in the end for breaking pregnancy laws) \nAround this time I kept getting really bad ear infections in my ears. I was told I can still work, important to note that I\u2019m Deaf and wear 2 hearing aids, with out them I hear nothing. \n\nSo he had me on a freezing snowy day stand outside running a stand about the environmental work that was due to be carried out, I had a bad ear and a cold already. By the end of the day I couldn\u2019t feel my feet (steel toe cap boots work made us wear) boss told me it was my fault not drinking hot drinks (I only like cold drinks) \n\nNext day was Saturday, and I spend the day in the warmth of my flat trying to get better, but my ear was killing me. So I called our out of hours NHS and told me to go to the treatment Centre. Was seen and got told that I had a very nasty ear infection and gave me antibiotics. Woke up Sunday to my ear twice it\u2019s normal side, burning, and half my face numb, I knew I was in a bad way. \n\nDrove myself to A&E at 1am, all they could do at the time was give me pain meds and make me comfortable until the ear specialist comes in on the Monday morning. Several hours go by and by then I can\u2019t move my jaw, my ear is swollen shut. My ear was so badly infected that I was admitted onto the ward with a drip of antibiotics, a wick in my closed ear (I passed out when they did this) to put antibiotics in the ear and a morphine pump. \n\nAnyhow after 2 weeks I was back at work in front of my Boss and the HR lady as I had gone over my 10 sick days allowance. Um I was in hospital for over a week, doesn\u2019t matter and you should still come into work if you have a bad ear. \n\nI said I do, but if both flares up I can\u2019t come in. (I work outside with the public) HR lady said that be fine we give you office work, phone duties. \n\nI said you want me to come in when I can\u2019t wear my hearing aids and do phone duties. \n\nBoth her and the boss said yes. \n\nOkay fine then. Signed the paperwork to say that we had this chat etc. \n\nI was angry as I felt he had caused me to be in hospital and they don\u2019t just keep you in for the sake of it. \n\nSure enough the following month both ears flared up and I couldn\u2019t wear both hearing aids, it was scary for me to leave my home not being able to hear but I had to follow their rules. \n\nGot into the office, told boss my ears gone bad again but I\u2019m here. \n\n(I was told later I had shouted) Boss said something (I decided not to lip read, I wasn\u2019t making it easy for him) I kept shouting \u201cwhat you say?\u201d A few times and then he wrote go to the desk over there and deal with any phone queries. \n\n\u201cOkay!\u201d\n\nSo I sat there, staring at the phone waiting for it to ring. After a couple of hours, the phone hasn\u2019t rung, Boss came over and started talking to me, red in the face. \n\nI looked at him puzzled and said \u201cwhat did you say?\u201d \n\nHe look so angry and wrote down \u2018why aren\u2019t you answering the phone?\u2019 \n\nI looked back at him and said \u201cwell, I haven\u2019t heard it rung yet!\u201d\n\nSwear he had steam coming out of his ears, I got sent back home as I was a \u2018health and safety risk!\u2019  Apparently the phone had been ringing off the hook the whole time but of course I couldn\u2019t hear it ringing.\n\n\nSeriously asking a deaf person who can\u2019t wear their hearing aids to do phone duties!!! \n\nThankfully only had one more hospital induced ear infection since and strangely after having my tonsils removed after way too many tonsillitis, I haven\u2019t had one ear infection.",

By the time I got back to the GP in the morning, both external auditory canals had completely shut and both sides of my face were swollen. Couldn\u2019t hear a damn thing. Not my baby crying, nothing. And  I had taken enough sleeping tablets to tranquillise a rhino (according to my GP) to no effect. He was so cross with the hospital he rang ENT and discussed me directly with the consultant. I was told to go directly to hospital, bypass a&e and go straight to the ward where they were expecting me.  \n\nI had the wick in both ears.

I too was awarded the order of the morphine drip. \n\nCan I say, I\u2019m no stranger to pain, I\u2019ve had a 10lb 14oz baby with no pain killers, and meningitis, but this had me climbing the walls.",
            "I used to get tonsillitis quite a bit as a kid.  I was pretty much guaranteed to get it at least twice a year.  One year, I got it 6 times in an 8 month period.  That was when the doc finally removed my tonsils.  I didn't miss a single day of school after that, and I've only missed work 5 or 6 times in the 20 years I've been working.\n\nOne of those times was for an ear infection.  It was only one ear, but it was hurting bad enough that I wasn't able to sleep, despite taking ibuprofen, acetaminophen (known as paracetamol in most of the non-US part of the world), aspirin, *and* pain relieving ear drops.\n\nI was in my early 30s at the time, but I had to have my mom drive me to urgent care (lack of sleep, too much pain in the moment, I'm stubborn, but even I knew it was a bad idea to try to drive myself) the next morning.\n\nThe doc estimated that my ear was about 95% closed from the swelling.  He installed an ear wick (I didn't pass out, but *damn* did that hurt!), prescribed me some antibiotics (both oral and ear drops, which is why I needed the wick) and some narcotic level painkillers.",

Then because everything in the states is either yes or no, never a grey area, the pendulum swung the other way and it was barbaric to remove tonsils for ear infections. My sister is three years older than I am, she had hers removed at 3. I did also at 3. My little brother is 14 months younger, same amount of infections, if not more, and by then it was nope, not removing your tonsils. Poor kid was on antibiotics a lot and finally grew out of them around 6 or 7. Neither myself or my big sis had another ear infection after getting ours out. Now I hear stories of kids struggling for years with chronic infections, tonsilitis, sleep apnea, ADHD, and then they finally take them out when they are older and it is more risky of a surgery. I say take them out.",

            "To anyone reading through the comments here who\u2019s experienced similar health care related issues and how to approach them with work. YMMV depending on country:\n\nIn many countries there\u2019s specifically H&S related personnel who take care of H&S in the workplace. I\u2019m one of those people. HR exists for the employer, not the employee. They exist to mitigate employer liability and ensure the employer doesn\u2019t end up with labour fines because of the Mishandling of employer-employee relationships. \n\nIf you ever find that you need extended periods of time off work for health related reasons, always involve your Health and Safety Administrator/coordinator. More often than not their role is to ensure compliance from the employer, but they\u2019re also very passionate about making sure employees are safe. It\u2019s all our job is. When speaking to your health care practitioner ask about a note for your condition and Return to Work (RTW) instructions or guidelines. \n\nIn a lot of cases a health care practitioner will supply a note for us for what you can and cannot do with your injuries. In many countries it doesn\u2019t matter if it happened at work or not, we have to follow the RTW program because it covers the employer from unnecessary damages if you were to return to work and injure yourself on site. It also ensures that you heal and can still come to work if there is work available. This RTW program, provided by the guidelines of a Health care practitioner ensure that we know what you can and can\u2019t do, and helps us work with you to get better and return to your regular position in time.",

He was one of those people that flips homes in lower income neighborhoods. I\u2019ll call him Todd, but honestly, I\u2019ve forgotten what his name is. Todd asked me to meet him at a vacant house he recently bought to give him an estimate for a full rewiring job. He was 30 minutes late, so I was already unimpressed with him. \n\nUpon entering the house, which was right after a rain storm had passed through, we found an inch of water covering the hardwood floors. There was water pouring out of small holes in the columns on the front porch. Everything was soaked. Instead of showing me around, Todd called his business partner and brother and spent the next 20 minutes cussing him for not fixing the roof. \n\nI\u2019m standing around and listening to his man-baby rage on full display. The whole time I\u2019m thinking there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to work for this guy. His fuse was way too short and his anger was out of hand. I gave him a price, which admittedly was the \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this job price\u201d, and didn\u2019t hear back from him. Until months later\u2026\n\nTodd called me later that year. He explained that he had found an electrician from three states away, and had paid the electrician with ceramic tiles instead of cash. The problem now? Well, he needed an inspection from the city electrical inspector. I agreed to meet the inspector for him, which I would bill him for. \n\nI went back to the house about twenty minutes before the inspector showed up and saw numerous issues. When the inspector arrived, we walked through together. Every issue I saw, the inspector also saw. He pointed them out, and every time, I agreed with him that the work was not up to code. This inspector kept looking at me with a puzzled expression. After we did a complete walk through I finally explained to the inspector that I didn\u2019t do any of the work and was hired to get him to pass the inspection. He asked me if I thought he should and I told him \u201cabsolutely not\u201d. I got paid for my time, I got paid to repair all the violations, and I formed a strong relationship with that inspector, who was always lenient with me on all my future jobs.",

I didn\u2019t break the rules (it was to MY benefit) and if he was ever inspecting an electrical prewire in a unit I did low voltage in, he\u2019d rubber stamp my permit too.

When he showed up for a surprise inspection, my boss was out sick and there was literally no one in the office. I told him I'm the one that handles the bats so I showed him around. We got shut down the last week of school. My boss said I should've played dumb. Not a chance! Literally every job in this town has to deal with the health inspector.

We went back and forth and he refused to believe that putting down a number that was not correct to the best of my knowledge, was falsifying the report.  I had receipts for everything.  He was trying to gain brownie points because he knew damn well that the company would sign off on it without flinching.

They are the ones that are familiar with local codes. I recall a slumlord that hired a guy from about 3 counties over to install a furnace. Thank god the family that rented the house had bought a Carbon Monoxide Detector. Three days after the guy left, the detector went off. They called fire marshal, he came in, then had code enforcement come in and the slumlord was written up. The contractor? Long gone with the money. Slumlord had to pay a local, licensed professional, cost him an extra $4K from what the fly by night guy charged, and the furnace that was put in was defective so had to replace that.

        "selftext": "The Year was 2000 in Canada. One if the better grocery store chains Loblaws, had introduced their new President\u2019s Choice PC Points Reward Program. This was tied into their PC Financial MasterCard.\n\nThere was a month-long promotion where you could get bonus points for purchasing select items.\n\nOne of the items was their signature President\u2019s Choice Decadent Chocolate Chip Cookies. These are amazing cookies that are still around today.\n\n**The offer was:** For every bag of cookies purchased for the regular price of $1.99, you got 1,000 PC points when you used your PC Financial MasterCard. That 1,000 PC points was worth $1 for a later redemption.\n\nBuying a package of great cookies for half price after reward value would not make for a good Malicious Compliance story now would it\u2026\n\nI figured something out and started some major malicious compliance with their offer.\n\nI started by going from store to store and buying every bag of cookies I could find. I even asked if they had cases in the back. From one store, I was able to get 8 cases. I ended up getting 1,400 packages of cookies over a 3-week period before the program broke.\n\nHaving 1,400 packages of cookies created a problem. What was I going to do with all those cookies I bought for $1.99? At the time, I was a field sales rep for a company with 4 factories in the province. I ended up selling most of the cookies for $1 a package to the employees. They thought it was a great deal and could not get enough.\n\n**On to the points:**\n\nEvery couple of days the bonus points would show up in my PC Points account. I realized I could take my PC Points and convert them online from PC Points to Petro Points (Petro Canada gas station rewards program). Once I had 100,000 PC points, I would convert to 100,000 Petro Points.\n\nI would then go online into my Petro Points account and convert those points to Sears Club Points (Sears was a department store that is now gone). Eventually I would redeem the Sears Club points for vouchers that could be used for in store purchases at Sears.\n\n**The Break:**\n\nAfter converting 1,400,000 PC Financial points to Petro Points over a couple of weeks, Petro Canada caught on and immediately stopped all conversions to Sears for everyone. No more points could be converted. It even was marked as not available on their website. I called Petro Points when I found out and after a little discussion regarding the sudden end of the conversions, was allowed one final conversion.\n\n**The Math:**\n\n1 Package of cookies cost $1.99. I sold the package of cookies for $1.\n\nEarned $1 in PC Points.\n\nExchanged that $1 in PC points to $1 in Petro Points.\n\nExchanged the $1 in Petro Points to $5 in Sears Club Points.\n\n\\*\\*Edited. Messed up the math. It was $1,400 net investment not $700\\*\\* For a net investment of **$1,400** (after selling the cookies), and transferring 1,400,000 in points among programs, I ended up with $7,000 in Sears Club Vouchers that I used on sale and clearance items at Sears.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was a fun 3 weeks while it lasted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Grocery Store had a points bonus, did a number of transfers to get 5x+ in value. Broke a program affiliation in the process.",

Get $1000 worth of rewards points or airline miles or whatever\n3. Deposit the quarters in the bank (they're still quarters)\n4. Pay off the credit card\n5.

Anyway, this giant K-mart on a very prominent Boulevard in my area has been vacant for quite some time.  The property is owned by a local big name car dealer and several people have approached him about what he's going to do with this eyesore.  He has now had to come on the news to say that K-mart's parent company intends to continue to pay the rent on the vacant space in perpetuity unless said car dealer buys them out of their lease for millions of dollars.  \n\nThey are also duplicating this strategy across the country, in case you're wondering how long your former Sears or K-mart is going to sit vacant.",

This was around 2006 so details are a little fuzzy but mostly accurate.\n\nAt the stime we were resellers for a very well known \"Office\" software product line, which also had many, many other software products.  A customer of ours wanted to buy about $250,000 worth of various licenses because they were expanding greatly.  (If this seems like an impossibly high number you are not familiar with corporate license agreements for enterprise software.  Companies spent millions in licenses every year for tons of different things)\n\nWe didn't really make much margin off the sale, but as resellers we had to actually buy the licenses at list price minus our reseller discount.  We then invoiced the customer.  That all worked fine - we got paid on time, etc.\n\nTo actually buy the licenses we were able to use our (I think Amex?) corporate card.  So we charged something like $240,000 on the card, at a time they were having a promo where you'd get a $20 Home Depot gift card for every $3000 you spent.  \n\nWe finalged it somehow so we ended up with 160 $10 Home Depot gift cards, which were delivered right before a big convention.\n\nAt the convention we had a sign that basically said \"Sit through our 10 minute presentation and get a $10 Home Depot Gift Card\".

I was taking phone calls one day, when I received a phone call that went something like this:\n\nMe: \u201cHello, thank you for calling-\u201c\n\nPerson: \u201cHello, I am calling to complain. Your office provided dentures for my grandmother and you charged her far too much for them!\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that, but this isn't...\u201d\n\n\u201cBut nothing! How can you possibly treat an elderly person this way! You clearly took advantage of her and-\u201c\n\n\u201cExcuse me, if I can say something real quick-\u201c\n\n\u201cNo! Do. Not. Interrupt. Me. I have something to say to you people! You should be ashamed of yourselves...\u201d\n\nSo, I did as they asked. I didn't interrupt. This continued for a solid 45 minutes. They laid into me HARD. Very upset about the way that their grandmother was treated. They were fully justified, I might add. She was treated horribly and was clearly taken advantage of with her procedure.\n\nThey come to the end of their rant:\n\n\u201c...I will be reporting your office for your behavior. What do you have to say for yourself?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I am terribly sorry for how your grandma was treated. That\u2019s horrible and nobody should take advantage of the elderly that way. But I\u2019m afraid you have the wrong number. That's what I was trying to tell you.\u201d\n\n\u201c...\u201d\n\n\u201c...\u201d\n\n\u201c...This isn\u2019t \\[Dental Practice\\]?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. This is \\[Business\\]. We build websites for dental practices. \\[Dental Practice\\] is our client.\u201d\n\nBig reveal: I was a tech support agent for a dental website company! Somehow, this person got our phone number from the practice\u2019s website and, since they were deafened to rage, they wouldn\u2019t listen when I tried to inform them. They apologized for wasting my time and wished me a good day. I thanked them for the apology, wished them an equally good day and had a very good laugh with my coworkers once they hung up.\n\nEdit: a lot of comments mention something to the effect of: \"Why didn't you just hang up?\" and to that I say:\n\n1. If I hung up, they were just going to call back again, but angrier\n2. It was very entertaining\n3. Since I knew they had a wrong number, I didn't really have to pay close attention to what they were saying, so I just kind of took a 45-minute break and browsed the internet\n4. At least I didn't have to talk to an actual angry customer for 45 minutes\n\nAnd for those who insinuate it was bad work ethic or a waste of company time to spend 45 minutes on a wrong number call... well, yeah. You're not wrong. Welcome to customer service. I also used to take smoke breaks just to get away from angry customer phone calls and emails. And I don't smoke.",

            "I used to work for a superannuation company (superannuation is a government-mandated retirement savings scheme, and the company managed those accounts) and the contact number was one digit off of a particularly cheap internet service provider. As a result, around once a week I would get calls from disgruntled ISP users whose internet had stopped working.\n\nI don't know how they missed the signs that they were calling the wrong place - the automated recording says \"Thank you for calling [superannuation company]. To make a transaction to your superannuation account, press 1.\" They'd press 1 and sit on hold for 2 minutes of automated advertisements about our various superannuation products, and then they'd reach me.\n\nUsually the conversation was something along the lines of:\n\nMe - \"Thank you for calling [superannuation company], this is Chet_Awesomelad. How can I help you?\"\n\nCaller - \"Yeah my internet isn't working.\"\n\nMe - \"This isn't an internet company, this is a superannuation company. You must have the wrong number.\"\n\nCaller - \"Oh.\" \\*hangs up*\n\nThey never apologised. Sometimes they'd actually get mad when I told them it was the wrong number, and I'd hear them say something along the lines of \"Oh for fuck's sa-\" and then the line would disconnect.\n\nAnyway, there was one call where it went differently. The woman who called started launching into her complaint immediately, similar to your caller. I tried to interject, same as you, and she shouted me down. Eventually I got the chance to tell her that she had called the wrong number, and she started insisting that she *had* called the internet company and that I was just too lazy to fix her problem so I was *pretending to be from a different company to avoid doing any work*.\n\nShe refused to hang up (we weren't supposed to hang up the call, even in these sorts of situations) and kept demanding (well, screaming) that we fix her internet. I kept trying to tell her that she had called the wrong number. Eventually I had to say \"Okay fine, I'll just transfer you through to the support team now!\" Then before she could respond, I cold transferred the call to the correct number.",

        "selftext": "My first time posting here.\n\nI used to work for a supermarket chain, and quite often I'd be asked by management to work at other locations.Most of the time, this wasn't a big deal. I was happy to help out - It gave me an excuse to drive and have the petrol paid for.\n\nHowever, one day I was asked to work at a location very far away at a very early hour of the morning. I initially refused on the grounds that I would have to wake up at around 2am in order to have a shower, breakfast, and drive to be on site for 5am.After some arm bending from management I finally relented and begrugingly agreed I would do it.\n\nDue to the drive not taking nearly as long as I initially expected, I arrived on location at about 4.30am.I waited in my car with the music playing.At 4:50am I get a loud knock on the car window, nearly making me jump out of my skin. It was the manager for that store, who, never seeing me before, did not know who I was.The conversation went as follows:\n\nManager: \"You need to leave. This is private property.\"  \nMe: \"Oh, bu-\"  \nManager: (interrupting) \"-I don't care. Go. Now.\"  \nMe: (quickly realizing I can play this to my advantage)\"... Oh, I'm sorry, Sir. I don't want any problems. Of course, I'll go, right away. Sorry.\"\n\nAnd as per his request, I drove home with a smile on my face, knowing that I have the rest of the day free to myself.A few hours later I get a phone call. I answer the unrecognized number, and I recognize the voice immidiately - It was the manager who told me to leave.\n\nManager: \"Hello. I'm looking for \\[myname\\].\"  \nMe: \"Hi, yeah, that's me.\"  \nManager: \"This is \\[managername\\] calling from \\[location\\], I was expecting you to work with me today, you should have been here for 5am.\"  \nMe: (trying to sound casual) \"Yeah, I was there waiting in my car, you told me to leave, remember?\"  \nManager: \"...But you didn't say th-\"  \nMe: (interrupting) \"-There are no ifs or buts. I was on private property and was asked to leave. I was legally obliged to do so.\"  \nManager: \"Right. But don't you think-\"  \nMe: (interrupting) \"-It doesn't matter what I thought. I was asked to leave private property. I'm not going to break the law and risk getting in trouble with the police.\"\n\nIt was at this point he hung up on me.I expected to get in trouble for what had happened, but I never heard anything more about it. This was a few years back now too.It's one of my favorite stories to tell. I hope you enjoyed it.\n\nEDIT (to answer FAQ)  \n\\* I **was** paid for petrol money and travel time.  \n\\* I **was not** paid for the shift - It was originally going to be a day off anyway.  \n\\* I suffered **no financial losses** what-so-ever as a result of this.  \n\\* My local manager never spoke about this, and I never mentioned it to him. I did not suffer any disciplinary action.  \n\\* Yes. **I did** have to wake up early and lose out on sleep.",

Push once, push daily didn't matter. \nOne night before a light snow I went to the lot to see if I'd need to come salt or push before morning. I was met by a store manager while sitting in the lot in my car looking at weather radars and texting my crew. \n\"Sir this is private property and we're closed you need to leave\" \n\"I'm here to-\"\n\"SIR THIS IS PRIVATE PROPERTY WE'RE CLOSED YOU NEED TO LEAVE, IF I SEE YOU HERE AGAIN AFTER HOURS OR BEFORE WE OPEN ILL CALL THE COPS\" \nSure thing\nAfter a phone call in the morning wondering why I'm well rested and they're about to open with icy sidewalks, I gave the area manager the story and got paid for an \"emergency \" salt per contract.

            "I had a similar situation.   I was asked to cover the closing manager at a different location.\n\nI assume the reason for the confusion  was that the store I was going to was staffed by individuals of a different race than I am.  When I walked in, in work clothes,  I was told, \"we dont need your help,\"  so I walked out, drove down the street, and called my boss.  I told her what they said.  She told me to enjoy the night off and called the store to tell the opening manager that she now was working a double because she sent her relief out the door.",

It's a legal requirement. I worked the main area and went to 5 different sites every 6 months.   I was always early so the sales area could be done before customers arrived .    One time an early volunteer showed up and tried to call police on me for being in the carpark and loitering. (Note   Volunteers in these shops where I am think they own them and they are always right. They argue about every change.)  So long story short.  She had a lamp over her sorting area,. It failed its test.  I had to cut its cord.",
            "I had something similar. I was a relatively new IT guy working for a supermarket chain. Most of our stores were close by in a cluster, but one was nearly 3 hours drive away. Each store had a small server rack that pulled retail and price data and also there was WiFi setup for the price guns and so PoS systems can process card payments.\n\nI was on call on a Sunday (24/7 operation) and the system pinged me saying that the distant site is offline and the failover 4G didn't kick in. So, I jump in my car and drive 3 hours till I get there. I walk up to one of cashiers and ask them to point me to a manager on duty and they point out this guy. I walk up to him:\n\nMe: Hi, my name is NAME and in from the IT department. Could you please open the IT room for me to have a look at the server?\n\nThem: What? Hell no, I'm not letting some random on there. I'm gonna need to see some ID.\n\nMe: Sure, here's my driver's license.\n\nThem: No, work ID.\n\nMe: We don't have those. But look, I'm wearing the company uniform, and if you call the IT's number, it will route to this phone I got here.\n\nThem: You could have gotten that uniform from any clothes line. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.\n\nMe: But your IT system is down and you can't take card payments...\n\nThem: [Reaching for his phone] Don't make this difficult, I will call the police for trespassing.\n\nMe: Ooookay, thanks for you time.\n\nI jumped back in my car, texted my boss' work phone (which was off at the time, but still, to cover myself), wrote my notes into the support ticket and assigned the ticket to my boss.  \nNext day on Monday I come in, and first thing they pull me into a meeting, with my boss, head of IT, the company owner and on video call is the dude who denied me entry. They ask us what happened, I tell them, he doesn't try to wiggle out of it (since there are cameras that filmed our interaction).\n\nThe dude got his first and final warning prior to termination. I got paid 6 hours at 2.5x rate for driving there and back and listening to an audiobook.  \nI do agree they should have given us IDs but the guy had instructions that if he had reason to doubt our identity he should have called the  24/7 IT phone number and verify (which was routed to my phone, and would have rang in front of him).",

            "Had a manager give me written directions (pre-google maps) to a location that I was going to fill in at. Ass that he was, he gave me directions that took 2 hours to get there. Told me it would only take 40 minutes.\n\nLuckily I went early to eat. I got there barely on time and the manager here gave me proper instructions to get home. \n\nWhen I turned in my mileage, they had an issue with my route. They said they can't turn in my mileage like that because it would be suspicious. \n\nI told him that he could pay me out of his pocket if he didn't want his paperwork to look suspicious.  I added the only thing suspicious are the directions you gave me to purposefully waste my time and make me late. We can talk to corporate about those suspicions if you don't pay me!\n\nI don't know where the money came from, but I was paid by the end of the night. \n\nI hate managers that think they are so powerful, and use that to screw others! \n\nThe manager at your second store was taught a big lesson in politeness,  and courtesy the day you drove off!!
