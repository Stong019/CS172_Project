        "selftext": "Do you know that guy at work that every one hates? The rude, obnoxious, lazy one that no one quite understands how he still has a job? Well mines name was Bob. For months Bob \"partnered\" himself up with me with a lovely 90/10 split of the work. Any time I called out on it he got more and more obnoxious, and if it was actually possible did less and less work. \n\nOn top of all of his other charming traits, Bob is an absolute phone addict. This is bad enough in a regular setting. Where we work it's actually very, very dangerous not to be paying attention to what's going on around you. I've mentioned this to Bob repeatedly to no avail, even after he was nearly hit by a forklift and almost had his head smacked by a robot. Our manager at the time said \"if you're stupid enough to die because you wouldn't put your phone down, no one's going to miss you\" and ignored the behavior. My last straw at even attempting to get this guy to work and be safe was him snapping off \"Leave me alone about my fucking phone.\" \n\nWell we just got a new manager, partially because of our former managers attitude towards safety issues, partly because of poor performance. The new manager had a quick, to the point meeting at the beginning of our shift and stated very clearly \"I see your phone, you're fired. No excuses, no exceptions.\" Bob missed this meeting because he was running late, again. \n\nAbout two hours later I see the new manager walking to our area. Bob as usual was head down staring at his phone. Remember when he specifically said to leave him alone about his fucking phone? Well, that's exactly what I did. Our new boss wound up standing behind him for a solid three minutes before Bob even noticed he was there. Bob was promptly escorted to HR, and I was apologized to by the new manager, because I'd have to run the work area solo until a replacement was found. No big loss. The extra 10% is well worth knowing that guy won't be around anymore. Guess no one at that job will bother him about his damn phone again\n\nTldr: Work place phone addict snaps to leave him alone about his phone, so I did. Now he's fired and I'm grateful.\n\nUpdate: A lot of you were very worried that I would be stuck running a two man job solo for an extended period of time. I just want to let you all know that Bob's replacement was less than a full shift away. So far, so good. Not to mention I'm getting trainer pay until he is up to speed. \n\nEdit: Just for clarity, the no phone policy wasn't new. It is in our employee handbook and we have signs posted around the shop floor about no cell phones in the work area. The only change was a manager that took the rule seriously.",

            "Your former manager deserved to be let go.  I worked with a group of construction guys in a tight-knit community once upon a time and the manager was absolutely RABID about following safety precautions to the letter.\n\nIt seems a couple years prior, he allowed an employee a little grace in being slightlly lax on security procedures, and that employee died in a workplace accident and he said he will never forgive himself for the way his friend's widow looked at him at the funeral.\n\nNow when the guys groan about safety, he just tells them, \"Shut up.  Sit down.  Listen.  Learn.  Follow.  I promise you that I will fire all of you before I risk burying one of you.\"  They believed him.  We ran a very safe shop.",

He was awful never bothered to learn the job so you could never escalate a query basically sat in his chair lording it over us all day.\n\nAnyway, at the time I was also a union rep and asked for time off for a disciplinary and he said 'only if I hit target that day'. So in front of the whole team I said ' that's not how it works either I can have the time off or I cant, they need to know today to sort cover if I cant go'. His face was an absolute picture as my whole team and the surrounding teams looked between us. He eventually capitulated and I went to the meeting.\n\nThe following week we had a sudden restructure of the teams. He was no longer my manager. He didnt last much longer in the role either. Good riddance I say.",

Once we were done spotting the load I gathered up my crew and noticed that the phone guy was missing.

There's all kinds of ways Bob getting himself killed could negatively affect all the rest of you.\n\nYour pay could be cut for losing some bonus related to no-injuries-in-so-many-days, whatever accident kills Bob could also end up hurting you, or if nothing else you might have to sit through a safety standdown powerpoint meeting entitled \"Don't do what Bob did.\"",

Once a 5th grade boy knocked a football out of his friend\u2019s hands and it rolled under the bus. The first boy crawled under the bus in front of the front tires to retrieve the ball. I was about 100 feet away when I saw this rapidly unfolding and started yelling at and running towards the boy. \n\nHe had already crawled out from under the bus when I got to him. I was so upset when I verbally reamed him out that I must\u2019ve had veins popping out on my forehead. As part of my tirade, I explained that my father\u2019s only brother had been run over and killed by a truck passing their home. Plus, my husband\u2019s older brother was killed by a school bus when he was goofing off with some buddies and fell under the bus as it was pulling away from the curb. (My MIL never recovered from that loss. Hence my very strong reaction.)\n\nFortunately the bus had been turned off, door closed, and the bus driver wasn\u2019t in the bus so there was no immediate danger. However! \n\nThe red line was there for a reason.\n\nMy face was still flushed when I told the principal and front office about the incident about 10 minutes later.",

Couldn't even get it into the office. IF you managed to sneak it in, they wouldn't even HR you. They just walked you out front and shoved you out. Like, bye dude. So it amazes me that it took so long for this dude to get fired. \n\nHowever, props to HSN DC.

She was fine with that. \n\nWithin two hours of taking pictures of half a dozen high-school students, I ended up with 300+ shots because everyone wanted the perfect Instagram shot. Whatever, I can go home, study, and slowly work on sorting through the pictures later. They\u2019re not paying me so I wasn\u2019t exactly motivated either. \n\nI get a text from her and her mom that night at around 11pm, they want the pictures edited AND uploaded by the next morning so they could be shown off on social media. I tried to explain that I\u2019m studying but they weren\u2019t having it, they said, \u201cWe don\u2019t care how you edit it, just make it look nice.\u201d \n\nFine. \n\nI spent the next 3+ hours working on the pictures and editing them really nicely that even I was proud of....then I hid Shrek into the background of every single picture. Shrek with his head poking out between the kids, Shrek posing happily, Shrek had a very nice time at prom evidently. I uploaded the pics and sent them off, no one noticed the extra guest for weeks and I got my ear chewed out because my ex\u2019s sister didn\u2019t appreciate her  900 followers on Instagram seeing Shrek grinning between her and her boyfriend.\n\nThey asked me to edit however I wanted, so I delivered.

They are fully aware they do it on my time though, not when they want me too. For the builds I did them the day the parts came, but thats because I knew they where coming and could plan for it (plus I know what it's like to have new parts and want to play), but if I'd have told them it would be a few days and they demanded I do it there and then, they would have got a link to a building guide on youtube and a good luck message",

Our relationship started going downhill after her daughter, my ex-step daughter, broke into my house and stole from me and my new wife while we were on vacation together. Yes, I invited my ex-wife and her boyfriend to come on vacation with us to so it would be a family thing. My (current) wife was completely fine with it. Not only did we invite them, we paid for everything, plane tickets, rental house, meals, activities, etc. We\u2019ve done this before and it was nice.\n\nWhile we were on this vacation my ex-wife\u2019s daughter broke into our house and stole from us. We had to file a police report because some of the things stolen was medication and we couldn\u2019t get new prescriptions without filing a police report. This upset my ex-wife even though we told her before we called the police and she said \u201cdo what you need to do\u201d\n\nBefore this, my ex and I would pretty much just buy what the kids needed while we had them. Every once in a while she\u2019d ask me to split the cost of some things and I would. I have never asked her to split the cost of anything prior to this. But lately she has been asking to split the cost of just about everything. Fine, whatever. I usually get most of the things for the kids anyway. \n\nAbout a month ago my son needed new some equipment for indoor lax. She asked if I would split. I said fine. When she took him out shopping they couldn\u2019t find everything. So I bought most of it online. I asked her what she bought and how much and I told her what I bought and how much. It turned out she owed me for the split. It was only $40, I would have let it go but she hounded me for a week over $5. This pissed her off. \n\nShe\u2019d be fine when I have to pay her but gets pissed when she has to pay me. I only asked her for the portion of the split because she asked me to split the cost in the first place. \n\nWe argued back and forth and then she came up with a list of things we should not have to split and anything else we would split. So I started keep track of things that I paid for that were to be split between us. So she gave me her list and what I owe her, not a lot, I owe her $80. But when I gave her my list and her share, she now owes me $425.",

It\u2019s short for Douchebag. \n\nAnyways, he used to be a really nice guy. Always fun to talk to, had interesting stories, the works. However, after about 8 months of him being a regular, he asked me out. I (VERY POLITELY AND KINDLY) turned him down. And, my god, you would have thought I threatened his mom with the way he reacted. \n\nSo, following that point, he turned into a giant douchebag. Always snapping at me (both literally and figuratively), complaining about food that he never had an issue with before, etc. A couple months later, we had some changes to our menu and some slight price changes. Notably, his favorite soup (elk chili) was 75 cents more. \n\nHe stormed in and sat and ordered elk chili. I said \u201cof course! I just want to make sure you\u2019re aware that of the change\u2014\u201c he snapped at me and said \u201cHow dumb do you think I am??? I can read!\u201d Ok my dude whatever you can say. So he gets his soup, his meal, a few beers and a glass of one of our higher quality bourbons. I bring him the check and he flips out. \n\n\u201cThis is more than it was before! You never told me that it would be more! This is fraud. I\u2019m not paying this. Fix it!\u201d Ok, I can do that. However, on the check, I had also charged him for only happy hour price beers, which was significantly less than our regular prices. Happy hour ended before he even got there. I also charged him for a lower quality bourbon by the same company (please note, the owner was ok with that since he was technically a regular and had spent a lot of money there). \n\nSo I fixed his check for him. But I fixed all of it. The new check was about $15 more than it was before. He was so mad he was lost for words, and I took that time to show him how I fixed his check. He never came back on nights I was working after that. \n\nI don\u2019t work there anymore, I wonder how he\u2019s doing.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve realized my transgression and it will never happen again.

        "selftext": "A similar post got me thinking about my workplace.\n\nI work in a combined IT / AV department for a somewhat large organization, so if there are any events going on, we're responsible for setting it up, which usually involves setting up sound systems, projectors and cameras, and ensuring that when someone plugs in their laptop, it functions as expected.\n\nFor years, we got a lot of last minute requests. Some of them were literally along the lines of \"we're having a gathering tomorrow with 300 people. We need audio and projectors set up for 9am tomorrow and for you to advance the slides for us, plus this video in my Powerpoint Presentation doesn't work can you fix it up? We know you leave work in half an hour, but can you set it up? We knew about this for weeks but nobody thought to tell you\"\n\nSo one day we complained to our manager, who agreed it was bullshit and asked us to draft a policy that he could take to upper management and get them to sign off on. We did, and it was very straightforward: You need to give *at least* 5 business days notice for events, presentations / media must be finalized and playable without internet access (one less thing to go wrong) and you're responsible for advancing the slides because we're there to fix computer issues, not read your script and press buttons.\n\nOur manager took it to upper management, who agreed it was a good idea, and they signed off on it and it was distributed to all staff. We had some people slip up, but they were held accountable and promised to not do it again.\n\nOne day someone from upper management emailed us. Let's call him Bill. Bill was holding an event for 600 people with a guest speaker (who had to be booked weeks in advance). The guest would need their laptop connected to the internet because they had YouTube videos, the projector set up and wireless microphones set up because they'd hand mics around for people to participate. The speaker was due to speak Monday morning, and it was Thursday lunchtime. Plenty of time to set it up, but less than the 5 business days notice, plus we were double booked by someone who followed the rules, so we said no, even though he was upper management.\n\nBill was not happy. He demanded to know why we were refusing to set things up when there was at least 12 working hours between now and the event, and all that was required was to power on the projector, turn on the mixer and turn on the microphones and then set up the person's laptop when they arrived Monday.\n\nOur manager heard his complaints and sent him an email:\n\n\"Dear Bill, my team have said no to setting up for this event, and I support their decision. Attached is the policy on event support. This is a reminder that you approved this policy and agreed to abide by it. Attached are general instructions on how to set things up yourself, best of luck\"\n\nBill managed to run the event without us, but he had to do a lot of running around and had a bunch of technical issues that interrupted the event. But at least he learned that if you sign off on the rules, you need to abide by the rules, because he hasn't slipped up since.",

No such mic had been requested on the call sheet, and the room they were kept in was 10 mins walk away at the other end of the building. Baby tech me had to straight up say no to the CEO's face. Somehow I kept my job, but my manager reamed me out for 'not going the extra mile'. Not sure how I was meant to bend time, make the 20 mins journey there and back, set up and test a mic in ~5 mins but there you go. Wish I'd had a manager like yours!",

            "We have something similar at the moment with a return to the office. \n\nBefore the lockdown occurred, we were asked to work out butts off to ensure that we could switch work from the office to home working, just in case nobody could get to the office. We got everything worked out and the company instituted a test where we all worked at home for a week to make sure everything was functioning. We were pleased (and a little surprised) to see everything work faultlessly. Even Teams meetings were less stressful when you weren't battling for bandwidth on the office LAN and Corporate WAN. We got a serious amount of praise and kudos for delivering this in a short timeframe.\n\nAs things panned out we never went back after that first week of testing, the government here instituted a lockdown and that was it. I've not been in the office since March 2020. Now we have senior managers pushing for everyone to be back in the office, I guess it's all down to seeing the drones at their desks and the fact they took the chance to remodel the office buildings while everyone was out of the various sites. The problem is, we all now see just how efficient it can be working from home, I can go get a coffee whenever I want and don't have to go and queue in the coffee shop over the road, I can organise my day around me and my wife, take a longer lunch and still fit my work hours in around me. I don't have the commute and the traffic and I don't have to pay restaurant prices for my lunch in the staff restaurant. I have a great connection back to the office over the VPN and I have a better mobile phone signal at home that I do in the office. Why would I want to go back?\n\nHere's where it gets fun.  We don't need to be hands on with the servers, the senior managers created a hardware specialist team to do that. We don't need to be on site for client meetings, the sales and client relationship teams do that. \n\nWe always hear the senior managers going on about how we are a global team and how technology brings us together, so when the start demanding we all go back into the office, then are getting a push back and our team manager is one of those pushing back hardest. This is because he probably lives furthest out and has the worst commute of us all, but at the moment he says there is no evidence the office is safe from COVID and that we are all safer staying home to protect ourselves and the company. The directors are fuming but can't do anything about it, meanwhile we are all applying to be permanent homeworkers and have the evidence to show we can be just as productive when we do.",
            ">media must be finalized and playable without internet access\n\ngood for you for getting that one through.  I would also include:\n\n* media to be projected (or shared in Zoom) must be in widescreen format.  (people just love submitting word docs or .pdfs in portrait mode, then get mad when no one can read what's on the slides.)\n* any speakers who will be using a microphone must check in with one of the AV staff.  (this gives the staff member a chance to give a 30 second rundown on how to hold a mic.  so many presenters hold them around their belly area and then get mad that no one can hear them.)\n* all docs, once submitted, are considered final.  (it can get really confusing when there's six docs floating around called prez.ppt and prezfinal.ppt and prezfinalnothisone.ppt and prezfinalnoTHISone.ppt, etc.)\n\npeople complain, but these types of rules are basically for the benefit of THEIR presentations, not to make AV/IT work easier.",

            "A story on the opposite end of a policy requiring enough notice.... I had a situation where I was hosting an event in another office and needed a particular WiFi config in place for the event.\n\nI filed a ticket several months in advance, because I assumed they would need time to customize things. The ticket was closed -- too far in advance to make a temporary setup, resubmit a month before the event.\n\nSo a month before the event, I dutifully filed another ticket referencing the previous one, requesting guest WiFi access and the configuration we needed. The ticket was closed with a link to our standard guest WiFi arrangements and an assurance that it would meet our requirements.\n\nThankfully, I decided to arrive in town the end of the week before the event, because wouldn't you know it, the WiFi was the ordinary guest WiFi not configured the way I'd requested. So I filed another ticket on Friday morning, high priority, pointed to the previous two tickets and said it absolutely had to be done by Monday morning. Closed again -- too little notice for a custom network config, so sorry.\n\nI reopened the ticket, got the tech handling it on the phone, and pointed out that I'd given them three months' notice and it was not my fault they'd sat on their hands in the meantime. And to add to it, the person I was talking to was the same one who had resolved the second ticket.\n\nThey worked late on Friday night (and I was there, too, helping test) and couldn't figure it out. Didn't help that network management was not on site in that office, but a few timezones away. Saturday, they messaged and said they thought they had it working, so I came back to the office to test.

            "Years back it was pretty common for companies to get employees to sign one of those agreements \"I will not work for any of this company's competitors for the next 5 years\". I knew they werent enforceable or legal in my state. While everyone else passed them up to HR rep, I folded mine and stuffed it in my purse.\n\nSo 7 months later we all got laid off. HR (or I guess at that point our FORMER HR) made a huge point of \"reminding\" us that we had signed those agreements and couldnt work for any other company for the next 5 years. I then loudly made it a point to let them know that they were illegal in our state and not enforceable.\\* She then pulled out a stack of them again \"reminding\" me that I signed the form. \"Did I though? Can you show me where?\" Nope she couldnt - she never got it.  The other employees already had no intention of following the agreement and bet that the company (that had just lost its major contract and was seriously in financial trouble) wouldnt be able to track us down and sue.\n\nSo there's what you sign and what is legal. \\*Why not speak up?

Anyway, on with the story:\n\nThis happened around this time last year:\n\nI'm a website developer and I used to work for the stupidest buffoon of a man who had no clue about web development (he just ran the company, managed the accounts etc.) but he thought he did. He read articles on web development and forced us to implement the new things he had spent five minutes reading up on almost weekly.\n\nOne day, he was messing about on our company's site and because of some work I was doing, one of the pages he was trying to look at was temporarily unpublished resulting in a 404 error (This is just what the website tells you when a page can't be found at the URL you're visiting).\n\nHe went berserk and said lectured me on how this was completely unprofessional and if a customer ever saw it we'd lose them. I rolled my eyes and said it was only for a minute and it was fine.\n\nHe then told me we needed to be \"alerted somehow\" every time a user got a 404 error on the site.\n\nFirst of all, this is ridiculous, you don't need to be alerted every time this happens, second of all sites get hundreds and hundreds of 404 errors every day due to automated scripts trying random URLs to see if they can find anything good, or spiders trying to look for pages that may have once existed but don't anymore.\n\nI explained this to him but he wasn't having any of it, \"No, we need to be emailed every time this happens so we can fix it\". I was crying with despair internally at this point, but I decided it'd be hilarious to prove my point anyway.\n\nI set up a script on our 404 template that'd email him every time a 404 page was displayed and left it overnight.\n\nI came in the next day to find him sitting there scrolling through pages of his webmail trying to delete the 4000 or so emails that had arrived overnight, the best part was you could search for the subject, but at most only 100 were displayed at a time so he would have had to delete 40 pages of emails :D I also made sure to take my sweet time disabling it so he probably got a couple hundred more before I got round to doing it",

While it was raining.\n\nI did not break my arm dancing on a wet table in near darkness.\n\nWhen we\u2019d all had a good laugh, I went to step down (using the bench) and missed. My leg plunged down in the gap between the bench and the table, I went down and forward, hit the bench on my way, pivoted around it *really* fast, and landed on my outstretched hands. There was an audible snap.\n\nMy left forearm, bearing my full weight and sudden deceleration snapped in half. Didn\u2019t even break the skin. I remember rolling over, seeing my arm with suddenly two elbows, panicking, and pushing it back into place. (Not perfectly, obviously. It was broken. But it was no longer at a 90 degree angle.)\n\nThat\u2019s when it started hurting. A lot.\n\nThe ambulance took forever to get to us as they kept missing the turn off for the camp site. I found out later they drove past it for most of that time.\n\nEventually it arrives, I\u2019m loaded in, and it\u2019s off to the hospital.\n\nWhen we finally arrive, it\u2019s been about an hour since I broke my arm. I\u2019ve been in intense pain the whole time, and the EMTs hadn\u2019t given me anything for it. (I don\u2019t remember why. The whole ride is very fuzzy.)\n\n**Here\u2019s where the malicious compliance comes in:**\n\nI get brought in to the main desk/triage area. This hag of a woman with permanent resting bitch face starts asking me questions while the EMTs are standing by with me after telling her what they knew. It\u2019s a bit fuzzy, but the gist was this:\n\n>**Nurse:** \u201cSo, what happened?\u201d  \n>  \n>**Me:** \u201cI fell and broke my arm. It really hurts. The EMTs said you could give me something while I wait?\u201d  \n>  \n>*Nurse rolls eyes and makes a tut-tut noise.*  \n>  \n>**Nurse:** \u201cWe have to get your arm x-rayed first to make sure it\u2019s really broken. We can\u2019t give you anything until we\u2019re sure. Now go take a seat.\u201d  \n>  \n>**Me:** \u201cI\u2019m sure. It broke in HALF.\u201d  \n>  \n>**Nurse, smirking:** \u201cReally? You broke it in half? Prove it. I swear, I get kids like you all the time looking for drugs.\u201d\n\nNow, I am beyond pissed.  I\u2019ve been in agony for over an hour, and this woman is treating me like absolute garbage. Even if it were just a sprain, shouldn\u2019t that warrant some kind of pain management? I\u2019m holding my arm, think for a second, and decide:\n\n*Eh, fuck it.*\n\nAs the EMTs are about to interject, I raise my left arm, grab the far end of my forearm with my right hand, and PUSH.\n\nIt bends. Very, very far.\n\nHer face drains of all colour and she looks like she\u2019s going to be sick. She immediately gets on the phone. I\u2019m now in ten times the amount of pain, but I\u2019m grinning as only a shit-disturbing teen can.\n\nIt took them less than 5 minutes to put me in a room, pump me full of morphine, set my arm in a temporary wrap. They then x-ray me and schedule the surgery.\n\nI had a plate and 5 screws put in, along with a full cast that I kept on for about 6 weeks. They took the plate and pins out 6 months later. It was very painful and annoying, but other than a gnarly scar my arm is totally fine.\n\nThinking back on it 20 years later? Still worth it.\n\n**TL;DR Broke my forearm in half (but still intact), nurse didn\u2019t believe me, so I bent it 90 degrees in front of her. She believed me.**\n\nEdit: A sentence. Remembering 20 years ago is hard.\n\n**Edit 2:** Wow, I can't believe how this blew up! Thank you so much to the kind strangers who gave me my first silver and my first gold (x2!). I've read through most of the comments and I'll try to answer some of the most common questions.\n\nEdit 3: Formatting and a few minor corrections.\n\nFirst, here's a photo of the scar now: [https://imgur.com/gK08Y9k](https://imgur.com/gK08Y9k)\n\nHere's the plate and screws they put in then took out: [https://imgur.com/q74coAg](https://imgur.com/q74coAg)\n\n**Q: How did you break your arm to do that/90 degrees is impossible.**\n\n**A:** Both bones in my forearm essentially shattered. They called it a greenstick fracture. I don't know that it was exactly 90 degrees, unfortunately I left my protractor in my other pants. But it *did* look like a second elbow. That was freaky enough.\n\n**Q: What about nerve/circulation damage?**\n\n**A:** I was really, really lucky. The doctor told me (after I came out of the surgery anesthetic) that it was a good thing I pushed it back when I first broke it. The position it was originally in WAS cutting off circulation and I probably would have lost the arm. That's what he told me, anyway.\n\n**Q: How did you push your arm like that through all that pain?**\n\n**A:** I was in so much pain I was quite literally delirious. It was a snap decision and really not smart, but I'm also proud of 13-yr old me. He was badass. I don't think I could do that now.\n\n**Q: The EMTs didn't do anything wrong, etc.**\n\n**A:** No, they were really nice from what I remember.\n\n**Q: Where was this?**\n\n**A:** Southern Ontario, Canada.\n\n**Q: Where were your parents?**\n\n**A:** It was about 3am at this point. The camp had been trying to call my Dad the whole time, but he slept through it for quite a while. One of the camp counsellors rode with me in the ambulance. Apparently, he was more shaken up by the whole thing than I was. He didn't come back for a few weeks. My Dad eventually picked up, rushed over immediately, and felt really bad. I was already under by this point, but I woke up to him in my room. He's a good Dad.\n\n**Q: This didn't happen.**\n\n**A:** It did! Sorry if you don't believe me, but that's okay.",

            "I had a snap clean through one of the bones of my wrist when I was about 9-10, from falling off the bottom level of one of them spider-web climbing frames. I remember my mum acting really panicked while driving to A&E, but she kept saying along the lines of \"it's probably only sprained or bruised, but let's get it checked out anyway\". Just reassuring me - only told me afterwards that she'd clearly heard the snap when I fell and was definitely not in a state to drive. \n\nAnyways, got to the hospital and found that they just don't believe you when you self diagnose broken bones. They had me in a waiting room for ages, finally got to a triage nurse who felt it a bit and gave me some paracetamol and scheduled an X-ray saying: \"it could be broken but probably just sprained, we'll take a look\"\n\nWait up to an hour more (mum exaggerates and I don't remember too well) and get into the X-ray. Here the technician is acting real short, sits me down on a chair to take an image of one angle..  doesn't say anything, just suddenly twists my wrist to take an image at another angle.

            "Similar break the weekend before finals my freshman year of high school. Ended up having to have surgery. I was helping my sisters\u2019 Girl Scout troop set up a telescope, ran back to the main campsite to grab something, and when running back out tripped over an unmarked black 550 cord guyline on a tent. \n\nI got up, walked back to the adults and told my mom \u201cI think I broke my arm\u201d.

I looked at it, and about 2 seconds later I was passed out. Thankfully someone caught me before I hit the ground and broke anything else. \n\nSimilar ambulance story too... campsite was across an open field from the fire station, but 911 couldn\u2019t figure out where we were. Once they got there and were transporting me, the ambulance got lost on some old back roads. You could see the hospital from the campsite, and we still were lost. \n\nNo crazy ER staff... they had me in the back immediately. Tried a couple times to re set my arm normally, then they sedated me and used this Chinese finger trap looking thing. (The sedation didn\u2019t work... I woke up) Ended up having surgery to put in permanent plates and screws. \n\nIn the end, I have a couple of big scars on my arm, permanent metal in my body (no, I don\u2019t set off metal detectors) and I got out of taking finals that year.\n\nEdit: format and a word",

            "That was tough to read, must have been crazy to live through. \n\nMany moons ago, I went overseas to visit family. One day, I went out with my uncle and aunt and a few cousins roller blading. There was a collision and I broke my arm. I told my uncle I need to leave, to take me home so I can go have my arm taken care of. He refused, insisted that if I had broken my arm that I\u2019d be screaming and crying. \n\nWell, I was twenty, I didn\u2019t feel like screaming and crying especially around so many early teen cousins.

            "I want to punch SOME nurses in the fucking face.\nI had a similar incident happen. I was on vacation for Thanksgiving in the desert and a bunch of us decided to go riding quads. Now mind you I've been riding quads many many many times. I was fully suited up. I had a helmet, riding boots, gloves all the accoutrements you would need to go riding. Long story short I ended up getting a compound fracture breaking my riding boot in the process. Was about two hours before I got to the hospital due to someone having to go get a truck, bring the truck to me and then take me to the hospital. I went in for surgery had a 10 inch plate and eight screws, to which I still have 25 years later. About an hour, I'm guessing, after I came out of surgery my leg was on fire. Because there were no notes in my file to give me anyting, nurses refused. They actually came in and told me to be quiet and then shut my hospital room door. After more continuing crying and screaming from me some genius finally decided to call my doctor and he authorized pain medication.

            "Oh man, I totally forgot about this until now, but I have a VERY similar story!  When I was about 7 I was in a diving class.  After a few months of summer practice, they were finally ready to let us start trying the 3-meter board.  I watched most of the rest of the class go up and dive, all the while I was trying to muster up the courage.  My turn finally came and I slowly made my little way up that ladder, got to the end of the board...then noped the fuck back out.  I made it almost all of the way down the ladder, but in my excitment to get to solid ground again I misjudged where the bottom rung was.\n\nI stepped off 1 rung short and fell farther than expected, putting my arms behind me to brace the fall.  Unfortunately, elbows do not bend backward, and mine snapped clean in half (like yours) though not a mark on my skin.  \n\nSo I am there on the ground cradling my arm and crying, and the damned dive instructor comes up asking what is wrong.  I told him I broke my arm, but he said there is no way.  This went back and forth a few times, him thinking I was only faking it to get out of diving.  He kept accusing me so I proceeded to bend my elbow completely backward to show him.  \n\nLike your nurse, the color drained straight out of his face.  I don't remember much after that either other than my mom yelling at him once she came to pick me up.",

I went down to the corrections officer and simply stated my finger broke with no emotion.  He rolled his eyes, basically said to show him sarcastically, and said something to the effect of kissing my boo-boo.  I held up my hand, and he looked like he was going to pass out.  When we were walking to the medical facility, he apologized up and down, and said he didnt believe me because I wasn't screaming my head off.

        "selftext": "In college, I had a randomly assigned roommate that I did not get along with at all. Our personalities were just on two opposite ends of the personality spectrum and we clashed. The only things we had in common were that we went to the same college and lived in the same apartment. That\u2019s it. \n\nAnyways, it was a nightmare living situation. The apartment had four rooms and two bathrooms. She and I shared the same bathroom as our rooms were next to each other. We had two roommates on the other half of the apartment that we both got along with. \n\nAfter over 8 months of just pure passive aggressiveness towards each other (like, I would put sticky notes on her days old dirty dishes and she would put my wet laundry on the floor), she decided to report me to apartment management for \u201cbullying\u201d her. Honestly, we were doing it to each other. \n\nHowever, the apartment management took pity on her because I was tall and athletic and she was 6 inches shorter than me and very thin. She claimed I \u201cphysically intimidated\u201d her and she was scared to live with me. She did this because she wanted to move to a new apartment without paying a $500 fee but instead the apartment issued a written warning. \n\nThe warning stated that we were not to touch any of each others personal belongings without written permission. First infraction was a $250 fine. Second infraction was a $500 fine. And a third infraction would result in eviction. I was so scared walking out of the office because I could not afford those fines and she had the biggest smile on her face. I knew that she would immediately report me. \n\nI went back to the apartment and she left for work. I was mortified. Then I realized she made a huge mistake. Everything communal in the apartment belonged to me and she was a super moocher. I told my other roommates what had happened and they were shocked. I asked if I could use their bathroom temporarily and they said \u201cof course.\u201d\n\nSo, I immediately emptied out everything that was mine in our shared bathroom (shower curtain, toilet paper, rug, towels, soap). I grabbed my magnetic whiteboard and listed out everything in the kitchen that belonged to me (plates, cups, mugs, pots, pans, silverware, coffee maker, toaster, pot holder, towels, literally listed every single item) and said that she is not allowed to use any of it without my written (no texts) permission. I also drew some eyes to remind her that everyone was watching. I popped that whiteboard on the fridge and went in my room to do some homework.\n\nLater, she came home from work and had a meltdown. She screamed!!! Not any words, just a blood curdling scream!!! In the following couple of days, her father came to the apartment to threaten me that they were getting a lawyer (lol), she bought her first roll of toilet paper and a plastic shower curtain, but it was too much for her to handle. She went back to the main office to report my \u201cbullying\u201d once again and was instead told she could either deal with it or pay $500 to move to a new apartment. \n\nShe moved out 7 days after the warning was issued.",

They were all friends and just needed a 4th person for the apartment.  How bad could it be, right?  Wrong!  They were noisy, rude little &#%\\* who used my food and stuff without permission, never included me in anything and were obsessive about the thermostat (they insisted on keeping the AC off during a major heatwave in early September when we lived on the top floor in some insane bid to save money on the electric bill).  They also brought in a cat against the rules of our lease and even though they promised I wouldn't be fined for it, I still was.  I did my best to make it through the year mostly by staying with my boyfriend who lived in the same building or spending as much time in my room as possible (honestly, I don't think I spent more than a few hours in our common areas the entire year outside of preparing meals).

Naturally, we started just going to the router and turning the adapter off at the plug. \n\nIt caused a lot of passive aggressive door slamming, stomping, and at its peak that damn adapter was being turned on and off about 20 times a day. Eventually, she started a screaming match over it, during which she yelled \u201cIT\u2019S SIMPLE, JUST DON\u2019T TOUCH MY STUFF!\u201d\n\nJackpot. I replied \u201cNo problem! You can stop touching my stuff then - that includes every single pot, pan, plate, fork, knife, spoon, tea towel, glass, mug, etc in the kitchen. Doesn\u2019t feel quite as fair when it\u2019s you who can\u2019t use house essentials, right?\u201d\n\nShe was pretty stunned to say the least.

            "I had a falling out with my roommate after about a year of living together, and one of the ways they \u201cretaliated\u201d was by letting the communal dishes pile up in the sink for days so that if I needed to cook or eat I would have to wash stuff they dirtied. \n\nOne day, with the sink piled comically high, I opened the cabinet to find it completely empty and decided I had had enough. I went and bought plates, bowls, glasses, a skillet, a sauce pan, a pot, a glass measuring cup, a full set of silverware and a drawer organizer for the silverware, put them neatly in \u201cmy half\u201d of the cabinets and emptied a drawer for my utensils. \n\nAfter that, the sink never seemed to pile so high anymore and they also had trouble getting all their dishes to fit in \u201ctheir half\u201d of the cabinet. Felt good, man.",

            "I had a similar situation. Except it was with a house we rented out. But, the house was right next door.\nWe couldn't tell when we rented to them, but the husband was absolutely toxic. Didn't have a job, so tried to sue everybody. He was actually forbidden to file a lawsuit in California, without a judges approval. \nBesides being a very nice house, with fair rent, the main reason they wanted to live there, is because it was only a few blocks from the private Catholic high school their kids went to.\nI will spare the horrid details of the year of harassment we endured. But, at the end of the year, we refused to renew their lease. They were livid. Fortunately, they had to pay a large damage deposit and they knew we had photo evidence of the house conditions when they moved in. They were still screaming as they moved their stuff out. But, it was music to my ears.\nBut, after that, we sold the house... for a nice profit.",

            "I had same sort of issue, for some reason I thought sharing rent with a \u2018never left home before\u2019 friend was a good idea. Wow, was I in for a shock.\n\nShe moved in using garbage bags, had very little in the way of cutlery, or appliances and had zero furniture except her bed from home. Then it got interesting.\n\nI\u2019d do laundry, figure I\u2019d throw hers in on top to show good faith and start sharing chores. Into my washing machine of course.\n\nSo I didn\u2019t want to overstep and hang her washing (read; underwear) out in case her BF or her get upset over it. Boundaries etc. and I\u2019d get home an hour before her so by the time I did the laundry collection and wash cycle she\u2019d be getting home, so she could do it. Saving effort and time and catching last of the summer sun. Sometime if she had just shirts I\u2019d hang them anyway.\n\nWell being an \u2018always lived at home\u2019 chick she thought nothing of it and got used to it quickly. So much so that one day she came home, left my 1 dirty bowl and 1 dirty spoon unwashed from breakfast but did her big pile of dishes instead and then proceeded to complain that her laundry (from today) wasn\u2019t hung and yesterdays laundry was left on the line but that I\u2019d brought mine in (she hung her own underwear the day prior).\n\nSo I calmly explained all that I\u2019d been doing extra, for both of us, the whole time and how sharing and chipping in worked better as a two person effort, especially since I\u2019d provided 99% of furniture and appliances and entire home theatre entertainment system.\n\nWell! she hit the roof, went off her nut and walked out after a tantrum screaming I\u2019d better not touch ANY OF HER STUFF. No problem.\n\nSo the next day, I get home an hour earlier than her as usual but immediately started to stack all my furniture, unplug all my home theatre and TV and put all the appliances and white goods in little groups so they were unusable without some effort.\n\nWell, she gets home ready to watch some crappy TV show while I do chores and goes off her nut agin. I calmly explain that if things go both ways and if I\u2019m not to touch her stuff then ditto her, with mine.\n\nIt. Dawns. On. Her.\n\nShe leaves, BF later calls to say she\u2019s moved out the next day. I say sure, but does she understand lease agreements because I do.\n\nShe ended up on the hook for 4 months more rent (agent said to me just pay your half, we will chase her for her share) in the end I agreed to move out and her BF had to take over my lease.\n\nThat\u2019s was a close one.",

Turns out she was quitting her job with her last day being the next day (which was the end of the pay period).

            "Decades ago I worked for a company that decided one year to \"save money\" by hosting a Christmas party for management above a certain level and excluding everyone else, including scientists and engineers many of whom had advanced degrees and shit. And they did it on the DL by having it at a hotel which happened to be one of the more expensive places in town. Well, of course, they got outed for it and boy did it throw a wet blanket on the place. Of course it didn't take long for management to notice that people didn't seem to be going the \"extra mile\" mile anymore and things weren't getting done they way they used to. I remember my boss, who was one of the attendees, came to me and basically said he knew this was a shitty thing to do and how people would feel when they found out and spoke out against it to which I replied \"But you went anyway though, didn't you?\". He was like \"yeah\" and i was like \"nbd, at least everyone knows where they stand now\".\n\nI think they really got the message when a member of upper management got deathly ill and needed lots of blood and hr organized a blood drive and even had the bloodmobile come out to the facility. Not one single member of \"The Help\" donated. Some even made comments about their blood not being \"good enough\". The dude ended up dying and attendance at his funeral was \"sparse\" at best. \n\nThe best part was when hr tried to \"make up\" for it by throwing a lavish Christmas party the following year at the same swank hotel their private affair was the previous year. One guy thought it would be great if everyone RSVPed then didn't show so like 300 people RSVPed and most didn't show. The company got stuck with a bill for tens of thousands of dollars for nothing.\n\nThe company lost it's edge and ended up floundering around until it was taken over by another company, losing people left and right along the way eventually laying off most of the staff in a bid to stay afloat and eventually ended up filing for bankruptcy. Like 2 of the original over 300 people are still employed with the firm that took them over and their old facility has been demolished to make way for \"redevelopment\". I still drive by there now and then a mind savor the sweet taste of  schadenfreude",

Not sure how many people are on your team but I can\u2019t imagine them expecting to treat a team to a nice dinner for less than $1500. So the CEO\u2019s solution was to spend minimum of $1500 on a dinner instead of spending a maximum of $1500 extra on the party.

You know why?\n\nI'll tell you why...\n\nOne time my company got a deliver of fancy new desks for their dispatch centre. Each piece weighed no less than 400pounds. 3 pieces to each desk, times about a half-dozen desks. (These were super high-end hydraulic raising and lowering desks that would house about three towers and a half-dozen monitors, so, definitely not something you purchase foolishly)\n\nWe figured out that one 400 piece could go in the tiny wheelchair lift at a time, but since the lift was only rated for about 500lbs, we had to squeeze the tiniest female in there on top of the desk to work the buttons. We promptly overheated the lift hydraulics, which caused an electronic lockout for several hours.\n\nSo, we got about 6 big burly dudes willing to trash their backs and haul the fuckers up to the first landing, and we got stuck. Much like the couch on the landing of Dirk Gently's apartment building, the computer models all said the desk couldn't get to where it was, and there was no conceivable way to get it out.\n\nAt one point, my boss said, \"the engineers stated that in no uncertain terms, the desks would fit!\"\n\nTo which I replied, \"well, call the fucking engineers and have them come lift this fucking thing!\" \n\nI've always had a good working relationship with my employers, and have never shied from profanity.\n\nUltimately, we got the job done, we just waited for the lift to cool and went one piece at a time. To get the one unstuck from the stairwell, we just brought in more man power, and in the sketchiest move ever, lifted the god-damned thing above our heads and carried it all the way up the stairs like that. If one person started to slip, the thing would have crushed everyone in its path back down to the landing.\n\nIt's all well and good to draft something and claim it 100% will fit, but an Engineer with tech or trade experience is worth his or her weight in gold.\n\n-------------\n\nAnecdote aside.
