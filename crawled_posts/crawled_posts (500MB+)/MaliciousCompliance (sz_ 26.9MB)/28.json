        "selftext": "Backtrack to 1987. Times were good, jobs were plentiful and little 14yr old me walked into a job as a bakery assistant. Even the 4.30am starts didn't put me off, I rolled in every Saturday morning and worked like a trooper. \n\nAbout two months in, someone complained about their donut not having enough jam in. I wasn't responsible for this, but the lady was having none of it and demanded a new one, full this time, not like the last one. Well....ok then.\n\nIn the back of the bakery was the donut filling machine. It was like a jam vat with a spike and a pump handle. I took an already-filled donut and put three more pumps in. It was quite round. Another pump, and it was looking pretty much fit to burst. \n\nBack at the counter, the lady was looking impatient, so I hurriedly placed the weaponised donut in a box, gave it to her, apologised and off she went. The car park was visible from the shop, she made it back there before opening the white box and taking out the sugary goodness she'd asked for. \n\nI saw her bite it and recoil in absolute horror as the donut exploded all over her blouse. I laughed my head off. The shop owner found it less funny but realised the irony of it. For a moment I thought she was going to come in and complain but she obviously realised she'd gotten exactly what she asked for. \n\nShe never complained again, but I was also never ever trusted with the donut filling machine again either!",

            "About a decade later than yours, I was working at a Maccas when we had a guy complain that he had asked for extra pickles but didn't get enough extra. So we remade his Mac and threw in a ridiculous hand full of pickles, it was almost 1:1 pickles to the rest of the buger, and so the bulging burger that was more pickle than burger was sent out. \n\nNext thing we know he's yelling at us from the front counter, thinking we're going to get shit thrown at us again, we cautiously peek through the service window, and he's giving us double thumbs up grinning like an absolute idiot.  In the following days he's called the manager to say how great the service was, also wrote in to make sure the store owner saw it too, and also to the Maccas head office.\n\nThe next few years, every Saturday, around the same time, same order, he was there like clockwork always giving the back crew the thumbs up after he got his order. He became of those loyal as fuck customers that everyone at the store knew.",

Starts right off yelling, saying that his sandwich better not be cold. I'm wearing a headset so I hear all this despite him being in the drive thru. Well I made good sandwich, then I put it in the microwave for a minute.\n\nIf you don't know, McDonald's uses these insane microwaves, like 5 seconds in there heats most things up to acceptable levels. After a minute this sandwich was basically on fire, so hot that I could barely handle it. Not wanting anyone else to know about this I flipped around the counter, bagged it and handed it to the guy.\n\nWell he never ate there again. He came back later in the day and screamed at the store manager, I wasn't there but from what I gather he got banned from the store for being a dick.",

I was behind another man in line, and I hadn't spoken to any of the pharmacy techs to tell them I was there. However, all the pharmacy techs know me by name. \n\nThe man says he is there for the second vaccine, then says he doesn't have an appointment. Now the pharmacy does vaccinate walk-ins, but it is based on availability. So if they have appointments that will use up their stock, they can't accept walk ins. The pharmacy tech told him they may have one extra dose today, but he would need to come back in two hours to see (or call in to ask). The guy absolutely loses his mind, and starts talking about how he drove half an hour to get here, they can't turn him away. \n\nWell. The Walmart that is literally a 2 minute walk also does vaccines, there are 4 other pharmacies along this main street, and I can pretty much guarantee he probably passed a bunch of pharmacies on his way here if he actually did drive for half an hour.

She fought tooth and nail, knowing that they would no longer have access to walk on my property.

She was (, and still is--I don't live there anymore) a menace. She got really upset by a shed being built by the folks directly behind her. Come to find out they had gotten county permits, and were fine. So instead, she had it halted because they were doing a foundation within a tree dripline and that city has strong tree ordinances.  So they filled in the site, and build it on blocks (not a huge shed), which was fine. Now, every year they throw a big neighborhood block party that they call \"The Annual Shed Party,\" which they advertise with flyers to everyone, including her, and make sure the noise carries on to the legal sound and hour limits.",

            "For some reason this made me wonder how much the local planning regulations can be abused.\n\nWould it be okay to put in another shed?  Two more sheds?  Twenty totally separate sheds?  Can I put in paths between the sheds?  Covered walkways?  Partially walled walkways?  If that's too much, how about if they aren't in any way connected to the sheds?  A gazebo is just an open air shed, right?\n\nNow I probably can't just put a shed on stilts 10' in the air.  But maybe I could raise it a few inches above the ground, staying within allowed dimensions of course?  And if the terrain is uneven, one shed could be higher than another, right?  So how much can I alter the terrain without a permit?  I can bring in dirt, gravel, and rocks for landscaping purposes, right?  How high a hill can I build?  What if I do it a little at a time?  A few inches one year a few the next.  What about erosion?  What if my rocks and gravel happen to shelter some areas and not others and I end up with a hillside?\n\nSo, if I somehow happen to have a hill on my property, I can put a shed right next to it or even on it, right?  Even embedded a little into the hill maybe?   What about a lot?  Can I have a shed partially or even mostly underground?  What if it is a steep hillside?  Could I have one shed physically above another?\n\nIt's okay to have electricity and electrical appliances inside the sheds, right?  Furniture and furnishings?  Insulation, heating, and cooling too, right?  If I stay within the allowed dimensions, could I even add balconies, ladders, stairways, a whole second floor?  It would have low ceilings, but for short people it would be fine.  Basically, how big of a hobbit Airbnb hotel can I operate in a residential area without needing zoning permission?  \ud83d\ude06",

            "I wish I had had the guts to do something like this 14 years ago. When my father passed away, I inherited a piece of land. Now, this land is agricultural land, so we're not allowed to build a house on it or something, but a rich family living adjacent to the land has been renting it for as long as I can remember and turned it into a pasture for their horses. They had also put a shelter on this pasture when they started renting it. (A small, just big enough to shelter the two horses when the weather was bad.)  \n14 years ago, my uncle's greedy wife turned the rest of the family against me and my mother because we were renting my uncle's house (he had moved in with her), which she wanted him to sell. Now, one of her best friends works for the city planning dept. About a year after this happened, we suddenly get a letter about the shelter obstructing the view from the \"forest\" (I've seen city parks bigger than this forest) about 2 miles away. Now here's the thing:  \n1) The pasture isn't visible from the road, you have to go across my aunt's private property to see it.  \n2) The shelter was built underneath some trees along the edge of the pasture, which obscured it from sight from most angles other than my aunt's property.  \n3) Even if the shelter and the trees were gone, all you would've seen was a row a garages.  \nSo obviously, we found this very suspicious considering the circumstances and the fact that my uncle's wife was know to pull crap like this.  \nNow here's where the malicious compliance/revenge comes in. A year or so before my uncle's wife turned everyone against us, I had helped her friend build a new garage on her property. This garage was massive, big enough for two SUVs at least. Way bigger than you're allowed to build without a permit. She even straight up admitted it to us when we were building it.  \nI wish I would've had the guts to go get someone to inspect her garage.",

        "selftext": "Okay, this happened about 20 years ago, when I was 17, and working in a major UK supermarket, in a rather affluent London suburb. This was my first \"proper\" weekend job.\n\nI used to work in the bakery, and it was the best section to work in a supermarket! My job was to make sure that bread and fresh cakes was well stocked, and presented (and \"test\" the odd doughnut - for quality control purposes), so that we can make sure there was fresh items available before we ran out, slicing fresh bread, and... Making sure rolls were stocked and tongs were available.\n\nOne busy Saturday, I was doing a quick inventory count, and when I came to the individual rolls, I saw a middle-aged lady, in a large furry coat and luscious red fingernails. I didn't pay much attention to her, until I saw her with a crusty roll in her manicured and bejewelled hand, give it a squeeze, poke her thumb through the crust and threw it back in the basket. She did it again, and when she reached in to try a third one, I piped up;\n\n\"'Scuse me, Ma'am, would you mind using the tongs provided, please?\"\n\nShe ignored me, and grabbed a third roll, and broke the crust, so, a little louder, I said, \"Ma'am, please use the tongs provided.\"\n\nShe heard me that time, and glared at me and said, \"I beg your pardon?\"\n\n\"Ma'am, please don't grab the rolls, please use the tongs in the basket.\"\n\n\"Are you saying that my hands are dirty?\" She then raised her voice while waving her embellished hand at me, wiggling her fingers so they sparkled as they moved \"Are you suggesting that this is FILTHY!?!\"\n\nWell, knowing that folks tend not to wash their hands before using trolleys and baskets, without blinking or thinking, I said, \"Yes, they are. Please use the tongs.\"\n\nThe inevitable happened. \n\n\"I want to speak to your manager at once, you should learn to respect your elders and betters! I'll have your job for this insolence!\"\n\nSo, I called for the bakery manager to come on down, bearing in mind, this was a busy Saturday, he was in his whites and wanted to know what the problem was. The woman went into a sob story on how she was testing the rolls for freshness, and I was so rude to her, telling her how her hands were filthy, a few crocodile tears here and there, how she had never been so insulted. \n\nIn a stern voice, my manager turned to me and said, \"Did you say this to her?\"\n\nNow, I was starting to think I did something wrong, and a bit nervous, I replied, \"Yes, I asked her to use the tongs, she ignored me, so I asked her again...\"\n\n\"Okay.\" My manager turned to the woman, said that he will be back shortly, he needed to do something and get some paperwork. While my manager was out of earshot, the woman crowed \"See what happens when you don't know your place? I said I could have your job for this.\"\n\nMy manager did a quick count of the rolls, muttered \"224\" loudly and went into the back room, he then emerged with an industrial sized black bin liner. He then proceeded to empty 8 large baskets of rolls into the bin liner, and a label for 224 individual granary rolls, tied up the bag, handed it to her and said \"Here you are, Madam, they're all yours!\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\"\n\n\"The rolls, Madam, they're all yours. You openly admitted to contaminating our stock, you ignored a member of staff when she asked you repeatedly to use the tongs. You've wasted my time, you are paying for the stock you have damaged. Good day!\" \n\n\"What am I supposed to do with all of these bloody rolls? I only wanted 2!'\n\nWith a dazzling customer service smile, My manager chirped \"Not my concern, Madam, security will escort you to the tills and make sure they are paid for. Enjoy your weekend.\" He then turned on his heels, and went back upstairs to the bakery.\n\nThe woman looked at me, then the huge bag, absolutely aghast, so I did the only thing I could do, grab a random loaf of bread, take it to the bread slicer, and laugh in the back room.\n\nI saw her almost every week afterwards, always using the tongs.\n\nWe wouldn't get away with that now, but easily my favourite manager, in all of my years of working.\n\nETA: I do not consent to having this shared outside of Reddit.

        "selftext": "TLDR at the bottom. On phone, so excuse formatting. English isn't my 1st language, and I'm a terrible storyteller.\n\n\nLast month, I was shopping around for a washing machine.\n\nFor context, I'm in Nairobi, Kenya (Yes, it's a place. Yes, it's in Africa. Yes, we have electricity and running water) and I'm a bit of a late bloomer, so I look more like a 23 year old but I'm 32. Also, I'm a photographer and I dress for comfort, so I more often than not look homeless.\n\nBack to the story.\n\nI looked up what what I wanted online and saw it was available at one of the major chains, but since I was free, I decided to go to the store in person. I went straight to the section with laundry equipment and one of the salesmen came to me. I was busy checking out the model I wanted, opening the door, reading the spec sheet and whatnot, so after he greeted me, we started talking about it.\n\nHe asked if I'm interested in buying it and I told him I'm considering it and asked for the price. It was just shy of $900 (I knew from their website) but since I was in the store, I asked if they had in-store discounts or discounts for return customers and enquired about their payment plans. I had bought a cooker there a few months before, so I knew all these things existed, and while I could afford to buy the washer outright, it would have left me a little cash strapped and I wanted to spread the payment over two or three weeks. Also, I'm frugal so I always look for discounts.\n\nAt around this time, a well dressed couple came into the same section, probably looking to buy something as well, and as soon as the salesman saw them, he walked to them and left me hanging.\n\nI called to him like \"Hey, I wasn't done.\" and he said \"I'm serving a client now. I'll come back to you in a bit. In the meantime, look around for something you can afford.\"\n\nI was furious, but I'm a bit of a coward, so I walked away and went to the customer service station and started making my enquiry all over again. The attendant offered to call a sales agent for me (same guy. Apparently he's the go-to guy for washing machines) but I declined. I told her I already knew what I wanted and I just needed someone to help me with the paperwork and payment and I'll be on my way.\n\nShe did just that, I paid the full amount out of spite, and as we were finishing up, the salesman came up to her claiming I was his client, which I denied, and the attendant listed herself as the sales agent. It turns out they earn a 10% commission from each sale and the guy just missed out on a decent bonus. Salesmen earn around $300 plus commissions monthly.\n\nAs I left, I turned to him and said \"Turns out I could afford it\" with the biggest grin I could muster. Felt good. Best part? The couple he ditched me for left without buying anything.\n\n\nTLDR: Salesman treats me horribly so I buy what I need though another salesperson on the same store and he misses commissions.\n\nEdit: I didn't think this would get so much attention. Thanks for the upvotes and awards. Be kind to everyone y'all. It costs nothing.\n\nEdit 2: The part about electricity and water is a joke. Ask any African. Also, I probably know that African.\n\nEdit 3: This post has taken OFF!! I have tried to reply to as many comments as I could, but I simply can't keep up. Thanks again for the awards. It's well past my bedtime now so... See ya! Be good.",

This gentleman comes in; very overweight, very smelly, very greasy looking. Had boils (if I recall correctly) on his face. Hands were gnarly, some kind of medical problem maybe. NO ONE there would even look at him. It wasn't my turn, but I got him by default. No sweat off of mine, it costs nothing to be kind. \n\nSo I smile, talk to him. He wants to see some of the guy rings we have. I show him, he tries a few on. Ends up buying one for 2.5 K.  Cash, out the door.  Everyone was so pissed. He didn't want a bag or anything, he wore it out of the store.\n\nAs an even better ending, I had the next two days off. The next day I worked, I was told he had come back in the day before. He wouldn't deal with anyone except for me. He came back in that day, greeted me by name, and told me he needed another ring. I asked him if there was a problem with the other one and he told me that his dad liked that other one so he gave it to him. He ended up buying one for around 3 grand. \n\nKindness costs nothing. Even if he hadn't spent a dime, it still would have cost me nothing to be kind. But it sure as hell gained me a lot.\n\nEdit: Wow, thank you so much for all the awards!

My visits are also marketing surveys ... I wanted to know what work similar to mine is selling for. I asked the owner the price on one.

            "I had an experience like this about a decade ago, being the one that actually made the sale.\n\nI used to work for a large national company that sold recycled automotive parts as part of it's larger business.  The location I was at was newer to that part of the business and being smaller than most other spots, I was the only customer-facing person.  Did everything from mix paint to pulling parts and handling the will-call window, etc.\n\nNormally the large used parts are all sold by phone to automotive shops, I rarely get walk-ins for them.  This particular day was the exception.  Customer comes in inquiring about a transmission.  I looked it up and saw that we did have one, but I was unable to answer all his questions about extended warranty costs, etc. as we only recently started handling the recycled sales side of the business (before this, we only did warehousing of them for another location.)\n\nRather than spend half an hour looking everything up, and with customers lined up behind him, I suggested that he call the regular call center phone number to have his questions answered, then they can input the order and I can then pull it immediately for him.  He was fine with this, as was the line of people behind him.\n\nHe was on the phone with them for ~10-15 minutes.  In that time, I handled all the other customers and waited patiently for him to finish the call.  He hangs up, looks and me, then the phone, then me, and says, \"They didn't put the order in, but I guess I'll take it!\"\n\nI made up the slip, processed his payment, loaded him up and had him on his way within minutes.

I'm not on commission.  I make the same whether I sell him a transmission or a paint stirring stick.\n\n2.  It's not my fault you didn't ask for the sale.  You had EVERY opportunity.\n\n3.  Incompetence on your part does not create an issue on mine.\n\nI then wished him a nice day and hung up mid-scream.

            "Be nice and if you are on commission basis, serve everyone equally. You never know! My cousin saved up money for a few years to buy a brand new car. Growing up, we only had second or third hand cars. The day we were to go to the dealership, she and I decided to hitch a ride with my mom and get dropped of at breakfast place with great pancakes (Cousin lived with us; pancake place was on the way to my mom's office). We were done with breakfast but it wasn't 9am yet and the dealerships were still closed. So we decided to walk all three kilometers from the fast food chain to the dealership instead of taking the bus. This is dry season in Asia, with temperatures usually nearing 30 degrees Celsius even this early in the morning. By the time we got to the dealership, the two of us where filthy and sweating buckets. We went in and just stood there with no one paying attention to us. We walked over to the display area and were checking out a car. But cousin already knew what her budget could buy anyway. Long story short, we left after 20 minutes of standing and looking without anyone approaching us to find out what we were doing there. My cousin called the manager right before we left - told manager that \"I was going to buy this car in cash. No one paid attention to us. We're going next door. Bye!\"",

            "A few years ago my husband and I went into a Jared to ask about a Movado that my husband had seen online. The salesperson greeted us, but once she realized they didn't have it in stock, she passed us over to their repair liaison. I keep looking around and I ask to look at some diamond studs. The repair liaison then goes back to the sales associate who brushes her off and refuses to come help us again. When the repair liaison came back, I told her I want to buy the studs. She looked very shocked and was just stunned. As we're walking to the register I tell her that I used to be a department manager at a Jared and I understand the how sales affect their pay.  As she is ringing me up, the sales associate comes over to remind her to put her on the sale. I look at the liaison and point blank tell her not to do that. I tell her that I saw her try to get the salesperson back in the sale to no avail. So this $3500 sale is 100% hers. We also ended up ordering the watch through her for another $700. Repair liaisons have daily sales goals that are like 10% of a sales person's goal. This probably put her over for the month. Never assume that someone just browsing will only browse.",

            "I used to be a sales advisor to a group of salespeople. Basically, I knew the details of the products we sold and considered it my job to teach the salespeople so they'd be more effective. I also taught them how to find items in our system.\n\nThe line to reach my group was supposed to be for the salespeople only. Occasionally, we'd get a customer dropped in our queue (I could tell just by looking at the phone display before I even answered). I used to transfer them back to the sales queue. Then I started taking orders. For some reason, I even got small commissions from this (I guess payroll couldn't really extract us from getting them, or it's because I used to be in sales before moving to this job). If sales couldn't take the time to learn, I've no problem taking their commissions.",

The salesman refused to believe he could afford to buy the Mercedes with cash, so he agreed. \n\nHe left, went to the bank, and came back with the cash. \n\nSalesman was surprised, to say the least.",

Went wedding dress shopping with my sister. Saw this amazing lace dress. Asked the sales lady how much. And she said in a bitchy ass tone that this one is expensive. It was 3k in Chinese money which at the time was about $500 USD, which is a fricking steal for a dress like that! But hey she want to look down on me because I dress like a poor Chinese chick, so I walked out with my sister and started talking in English(American = money). Her face dropped.

The saleswoman ignored us for quite a long time, but eventually asked if we needed any help. When we asked about sales, this must've confirmed their preconceived notions about us, because the woman looked us up and down, sniffed, and said that perhaps we'd have better luck finding something in our price range at the Walmart down the street. My roommate got a bit of a wicked gleam in her eye and (to my surprise) she appeared to agree with the saleswoman. Then she took out her wallet, pulled out her massive wad of cash, and pretended to count it as we haughtily walked out of the door. Petty? Sure. But it felt great.",

My agency is not cheap, so we make it quite clear that they are paying for our experience and knowledge, not some Photoshop monkey. Most of the time, my clients are appreciative and enjoy the extra guidance and professional advice.\n\nOccasionally, we get \"fun\" jobs.\n\nThe sales pitch went well enough, the business owner, Bob, seemed like a decent guy and happy to trust our professional expertise. However, shortly after signing the deal, he brought on a new manager, Karen, who was put in charge of marketing, including the new website we were just contracted to do.\n\nIt quickly became clear that Karen thought of herself as a multi-disciplinary genius and despises us because she thinks she can do better than a professional design agency. Karen loves sending over incomprehensible design instructions and feedback in the form of design mock-ups she creates in Powerpoint. They as ugly as the devil's butthole after a strong curry, but we try our best to translate the abominations she birthed into good-looking professional design proposals that best reflects the intent of her ideas.\n\nKaren did not like it one bit. Karen was rude, uncooperative, and removed Bob from the email threads when we tried to reach out to him to get his opinion. When we sent over a design, she would bitch about how it wasn't want she wanted, and scream over the phone while our team patiently explained why we couldn't design *exactly* as she wanted. Mainly: It would be ugly as heck and nobody would want to do business with them with a website like that.\n\nThe last time Karen bitched about how we were \"stupid morons\" for not doing what she wanted, we got her on the phone with Bob. She was screaming incomprehensibly and nobody got a word in. Finally, Bob took her side and said \"Karen is extremely experienced and knows what she's doing. I want your team to FOLLOW EVERY INSTRUCTION, EXACTLY AS SHE ASKS.\"\n\n*No problem.*\n\nOnce again, Karen sent over a ridiculous 70mb Powerpoint. If we followed it *exactly*, it would look like a website from the 90s with the worst UX ever. We went through every little pixel of her PPT, asking her \"So do you want us to copy this... *EXACTLY*?\" To which she would reply with a smug YES. So we documented her instructions down to the letter to cover our asses. Once again, we asked Bob: \"Are you *SURE*?\"\n\nReply: \"Yes please hurry up and make those changes exactly as she asked.\"\n\n*Okie dokie.*\n\nWe copied every ugly font choice, every terrible gradient, every hideous element into the design. We even went the extra mile to export the ugly lopsided shapes she drew as .PNG graphics, so it would all be \"exactly\" as she wanted. Then we sent the design over: \"Here is the design, we have done everything exactly as instructed!\"\n\nKaren once again replied, taking Bob out of the loop, \"PERFECT! Now, it wasn't so hard to do things EXACTLY ASK I ASKED, was it? ;)\".\n\nWe waited.\n\nBob exploded, demanding a meeting the very next day to explain why we were delivering such shoddy work.\n\nWe go to the meeting and Karen starts demanding that we propose a completely new design.\n\nWe presented all past designs, the document in which Karen confirmed that she wanted all the changes, the countless emails in which we painstakingly explained to her why her ideas suck, and finally, the last email in which she praised us. \"You see, Bob, after our last call with you, we had followed Karen's instructions TO THE LETTER, EXACTLY AS SHE HAD ASKED. She seemed very happy with it. I am confused, why the quick change of heart?\"\n\nI then pull out the contract and calmly point out the portion which stated the number of design proposals we would create. Karen had used up all of it. I had reminded her that she was limited to X number of proposals, but she clearly didn't remember any of it because she didn't bother reading our emails, and would keep talking or yelling over us when she spoke on the phone.\n\nI looked Bob in the eye and told him he could either pay extra for each additional new proposal Karen wants, or choose from the existing designs done. They ask for some time to discuss privately. We break for coffee.\n\n\"Well, Karen is extremely experienced in this field. We will go with the last design since it is exactly as she wanted.\"\n\nEven my intern couldn't hold back his surprise. As we drive back to the office, he asks, \"Is Karen sleeping with Bob or something? Why does she have him by the balls like that?\"\n\nI shrug. It's his business, and we're getting paid anyway, and he clearly doesn't appreciate our design expertise after all. The less time we spend arguing with them, the more time we could use to focus on my appreciative, good clients.\n\nWe make Bob and Karen sign off on the design, and finish up the project quickly. Karen still tries to be difficult, but we stick to the contracted terms and she couldn't do anything.\n\n2 months after the project ended, I get a call from Bob. He began with some small talk about innocuous project-related business, but I realized it wasn't the purpose of his call. Karen had been fired after making more serious mistakes causing major losses to his company. He sounded contrite, but did not offer any real apology. \"That's terrible, Bob. I'm so shocked. I thought Karen was extremely experienced and knew what she was doing.\"\n\nEdit: Sorry guys! As much as I would love to show you the site or Karen's presentations, I'm afraid I must keep things anonymous! You'll have to trust that it looks every bit terrible and outdated as a website designed by a Karen(tm) could be.

            "I used to work for a number of web site agencies. I did work for web sites including Minolta, Olympus, UPS, and Dunkin Donuts. Those clients were all very nice to work with, and these stories are not about any of those.\n\n# Story #1\n\nWe had a policy that when we were presenting an initial layout for placement purposes only (not an actual graphic design, just something so the programmers could get started and put in the design later), we'd present a pencil sketch, in which a programmer would literally sit down with a sheet of paper and a pencil and draw (deliberately badly) a web site. It'd look like we got a kindergartner to draw it for us, almost with crayon. (We'd probably have used crayon if we had any around.) This was done to deliberately not look good because if we presented a powerpoint it would look bad but it would look too slick in its badness so either the client could never get over that and would bitch constantly about us doing shoddy work and then when they got the final design they'd bitch that it didn't look like they were expecting, or they'd fall in love with the powerpoint and then be very angry when we presented actual designs from the graphic artists, because they want the powerpoint. \n\nSo the pencil sketch was so obviously bad that they'd realize \"this isn't the actual design for the end\" and thy wouldn't care about it. Not Karen. I got a call one day that Karen had fallen in love with my pencil sketch and wouldn't even look at a design from the artist, she insisted it look just like my pencil sketch. I could hear my project manager asking (without words) for malicious compliance, so I gave it. I scanned the pencil sketches in, found the location of all the screen elements, and made them all clickable. When I got the final text from the writer I wrote it out by hand, scanned it in, and positioned it on the scanned pages. We delivered this to the client, who had the unmitigated gall not to recognize the technical feat of delivering a hand-drawn web site in 1999.  (I actually redid my personal web site in this style, and prospective employers were very impressed by it.) Karen was very happy, and smug about it. Karen't boss was... shall we say... unimpressed, but because Karen had signed off (a literal actual pen-on-paper signature) on the design, they had to pay us to do it all over. (A web site from us cost tens of thousands of dollars at minimum.) (Even though this *was* the 90s, our designs would be hot today, we had *very* talented people.) \n\nI'm not going to make this a separate post because the story is so close to OP's story that it'd look like I'm trying to one-up them. I'm not, I'm just trying to show some sympathy, to say \"yeah, unfortunately Karens happen.\"\n\n# Story #2\n\nWe had The Client From Hell. (TCFH.)

I had the feeling they were an inch from complaining to the boss about it - and we were enough of a prestigious agency that he could do something about it. \n\nHowever, one day TCFH called when some peers and an executive and I were together at another office. We had just acquired another company and wanted to show their people that we were friendly people and really wanted them to join us and be part of our team, every one of them would be welcomed into our group and there would be no demotions, and they could keep working at their current office until we got a new one in a few months, across the street from them. We'd just throw them some clients in the meantime, because they were hurting for work and we were hurting for people. (Summary: most of them didn't believe us and quit, but we were serious. We bought the company for its people, not to eliminate a competitor.) I was between jobs and was asked to be there to show my smiling face and tell their people about our (actually quite good) corporate culture and make sure they knew they were welcome. So, even at a company at which we wouldn't tolerate bad treatment of our people, everyone was *unusually* primed to not take BS from a client in front of these people. \n\nSo I was sitting around having a friendly chat with the executive (he was the VP, the son of the founder with his last name on the company, but there on merit, not nepotism, and well liked) and a coworker, and the main office transferred a call over for my coworker from TCFH. My coworker answered, and immediately held the phone away from his ear as TCFH had called to unload at him and the phone was too loud to hold by the ear. In the midst of the screaming, the VP said \"give me the phone.\" He cut them off, found out who it was, and told them that they were fired, we'd package and deliver what we were working on in a day or two and our agency would no longer be handling their needs. He pointed out (truthfully) that we had so many prospective clients we literally didn't have room to hire enough people to deal with them all and were turning away work, so we didn't need TCFH's work, we'd have somebody else to work for within hours. (Sure enough, we started on a new client the next day.) On the other hand, they'd have to work with an inferior agency. He hung up the phone and told us to drop all work for that client, prep it to go to them, and deliver it to the project manager. He phoned the client person's manager, who had actually hired us, and explained that because of his person's unprofessional behavior to our staff that we wouldn't be handling them any more. \n\n*That's* how you handle a nasty client who yells a lot.",

            "I left a company this year under a non-compete, which means I can't talk about fight club, but here's a redacted story.  The main owner/president asked our marketing group to come up with a name for a new product.  It would compete with an established product that has a one-syllable name easily recognized by consumers.  The instructions were specific - \"make it sound tough and bad-ass and durable.\"  After months of meetings, testing, back story development, and logo design - we presented the results to the company's ownership.  The single syllable name/logo was descriptive of both the product and its use and conveyed the appropriate level of bad-assery.  (As for logo, think of the traditional scripted Ford logo vs. the blocky FORD lettering used for their Raptor truck.)  Five minutes into the presentation, the owner's sister announced that she always wished we had a product named \"Inspiration\" (not the real name, but close) and that this product would be it.  The owner/president caved and so we launched a macho product with that insipid name.   \nThe president/owner hemmed and hawed after the presentation, but said he did not want a fight with his sister because he needed to get other items approved by the family/board.   \nThe product was well-made and included technology that worked better than the competitor's model, but in part because of the lame name, customers never made the connection that this product was even in the same class so it never gained market share.  After four years it was discontinued.",

To say the bosses exploded at our point of contact would have been an understatement.

            "I worked for a Casino that was building gas stations. They had a license agreement to sell soft serve and so on the soffit that hangs from the ceiling, it needed to have the logo. So I get the blueprints, and design a SCALE mockup exactly to the blueprints so I can see what the customer sees as they enter the store. I go in and pitch in a huge meeting with the CEO of the company. I tell him that the cigarette soffit hangs so low over the registers so employees can reach the cigs, that you won't be able to see the logo of the soft-serve ice cream on the right when you enter, as it's blocked by the soffit. The smug ass head of construction, stands up, and says that I am wrong, that my model, based on the blueprints, was wrong. I was mortified that I lost the battle, with fucking PROOF IN MY HANDS. It was because he was in charge and had to look good, it had nothing to do with my perfect scale model. Fuck that guy. Anyways, 6 months later after they built it, I cornered him in the hallway and he quietly apologized. What a giant toolbag. I quit 6 months later. God I hate that shit.",
            "I had something similar happen in the early 2000's when my firm still did web design in house. A client came to us wanting to redesign their web site and also make use of our marketing and search engine optimization skills to get more hits, traffic, reads, and thereby, sales.  They were extremely hands-on when it came to content and appearance.  VERY hands-on, in that they wanted each & every page to look a certain way, even if it reduced or eliminated functionality, consistency with other pages on the site, or were just plain double-ugly.  We had them sign off on each page, and the signed-off on document included our firm's notes (including layout & presentation) of the firms recommended options/revisions for the pages.  In the final presentation, we went through the finished site with them page by page.  They were estatic with the finished product, and once again we noted the problems we thought these pages presented.  They approved everything, so we turned to files over to them to upload to their host and waited.  They set it up so we got copied on their web traffic reports so we could observe and, if necessary, tweek the product.  \n\n\nOur back end work, that they had very little input on, worked exceedingly well.  In the first week, traffic to their pages increased 20 times what it was before. 35 times what it was before in the 2nd week as we made adjustments and 'turned the dials' as it were.  In week 3 got contacted by them with some disappointment.  Web visibility, hits and page views were up 40 times what they were before we engaged them, but sales were only up 15-20%.  We advised them that, although they would likely need to confirm this with outside surveys and market research, our best guess was that, given the overall 'ugliness' and and lack of user-friendliness on the web site, people were leaving before purchasing, in droves.    \n\n\nThe project exceeded our expectations as far as driving traffic, but we ere pretty sure that potential customers would ditch before wading throught that tangler of a website to complete a sale.  We were not disappointed.  \n\n\n2 Months later, we made a new contract to put up the complete site we thought would click best with their clientele. Overall hits were up a total of 50 times previous, and sales were up 30 times .  Gee, if only there were some way to get all those sales they missed during that 2-3 monther period of the super-ugly website....\n\n  \nYes, listen to the experts you're already paying the FIRST time around!",

        "selftext": "Edit: I've gone through every comment. Thank you for the conversation, but I'm going to disable inbox replies for the post now. Have a great one!\n\n\nMy work environment is less an environment and more-so a conglomeration of duct tape, spit, and cussing. I managed, among many things, a set of rentals, accounts receivable, and customer database analysis. Essentially, our company's bus factor was far too ~~high~~low.\n\nAnother important bit that I handled were various legal documents that the State requires meticulous processes to be followed, and allows for a digital or physical paper trail. I opted for digital.\n\nNow, my boss kindly provided me a Pentium 4 dual core computer that he found at the bargain warehouse for about $40. I had the most sophisticated work station in the business, for context. This wasn't quite enough for database management and analytical software to boot up - more or less process a dataset, so I called up our IT guy.  Who worked for the boss's friend's sister-in-law's business. 200 miles away. I go, \"Hey Tim! I need to add my personal laptop to the company network. Can you make that happen?\"\n\n\"Sure, I'll be down to that location in a week or two. Can it wait?\"\n\n\"Sounds perfect, Tim.\"\n\n\nSo Tim shows up. We get the boss to rubber stamp that this is all OK, and I have remote access to the servers and some annoying corporate* mandated securities on my laptop. Which, no big deal, they stay out of the way.\n\n^^*Tim's ^^corporate. ^^My ^^boss ^^doesn't ^^know ^^a ^^computer ^^from ^^a ^^VCR\n\nWe didn't have anything like a software policy, either. I think some computers had Office 2007 installed, but that's clunky and makes data transfer complicated. It's the 20 teens, there's no need for that.\n\nI do all of my work on a google drive account tied to my work email. This is great, because I can hot-swap my work station to wherever the boss wants me today. Sometimes he likes to pretend I'm a secretary and throws me in his office. Sometimes he thinks I'm a technician and puts me at a station with no computer. Whatever. Data is transient. \n\nAnyways. Things have been tense recently. I've moved almost all of my job to digital, and the boss thinks that means I don't work any more. Obviously, an office monkey with no papers is an office monkey with not enough work. Now, he wasn't EXACTLY wrong. I had been automating things, and was doing the job of about 6 people.\n\nHow can I do the job of 6 people without the boss knowing? Easy. He likes to manage by the seat of his pants. One day he fired a maintenance person and just \"rolled\" that job into the receptionist, driver, and technician jobs. One day he decided that the sales team could handle marketing - surely buying a single $2000 camera is cheaper than having a professional do shoots each week. Besides - guerilla handicam sales pitches are in vogue, it'll be great! \n\nMoving on, after two years of \"shuffling\" I had accumulated a large amount of jobs. Many of them tedious. And, with the right tools (made by me, at home, on my personal laptop that happens to be able to connect to the network), a good 4 hour job can be completed with about 10 minutes of sorting and parsing data. \n\nSo the time comes. We all know its coming - one of the suits tipped me off that the particular suit who's payroll is wasted on chumps like me had propositioned the boss that a pair of receptionists can do the work I do, for cheaper. Just hire some college kids, work 'em each 18 hours a week, it'll be grand.\n\nKnowing that, I backed up everything to my personal google.drive account - but of course did not delete anything from the company owned one. Like I said, the State has a vested interest in these processes, and I knew in my heart-of-hearts that the company couldn't be trusted to maintain records. I didn't want to be on the hook for that in 6 years, so I kept a copy.\n\nI figured it would go smoothly. I'm called to the big office for a meeting. There's too many suits, my supervisor gives me some side eye. It's not a surprise. I carefully make sure to click, \"Log out of all locations\" on my Google account and tuck my laptop into my car before heading upstairs.\n\nThe meeting starts with the boss saying, \"Well kiddo,\" yes, he calls me kiddo. Since I'm not 60 years old, I'm obviously a child. \"Well, Kiddo, I'm sad to say that I was wrong. I shouldn't have hired you. You're fired.\"\n\nWell... that was blunt. And rude. So I stand up, extend my hand across the table, and prepare to thank him for the last few years.\n\n\"NOT so fast. Sit down, we have things to discuss.\"\n\nHahaha... what? I sit down for a moment, in brief shock. The adrenaline starts to pump and my finger tips are cold. Boss begins to tell me all of things they need from me. Contacts. Account statuses. Explanation of discrepancies on AR accounts. documentation for State interests. All things that, as his competent employee, I could have printed and sitting on his desk in moments. I decide to comply with him starting the meeting by saying I'm fired. Where I live, either of us can stop the employment situation for any reason. He had legally fired me.\n\nI counter him, \"Well, Boss, I don't feel particularly comfortable accessing your network since I'm not an employee.\"\n\nHe exploded. Think of Karen, a millionaire Karen with little-brother syndrome who wants to be John Wayne but looks a bit too much like Smoky the Bear's fat cousin to get the role. His explosion was violent. Spit everywhere. I'll save you the details of how he stalked me to my car and demanded the employees \"form a barrier\".\n\nHe called me a few times. They went to voicemail as I drove to a public wifi hotspot. I carefully removed my laptop from their network. I drove home, unpacked my work lunch. My phone hasn't stopped ringing - he probably had a receptionist being paid minimum wage to hit the \"redial\" button.\n\nEventually I answer a call from his cellphone. He makes some demands. I very flippantly offer to come to work for him at 10x my rate. He yells some more. An hour later, he's pounding on my door. I don't want to deal with that, I know he carries a loaded pistol in his car (again, cowboy - emphasis on the boy). The cops escort him away and I email a copy of my security footage to the responding officer. He thanks me.\n\nThe company doesn't flounder, of course. Bossman is a millionaire, and has been very carefully losing tens of thousands of dollars a year while operating his business. He may have lost some more in the interim. \n\nBut that's not my concern. My concern is collecting my unemployment. And wouldn't you know, I was fired a few days before fall college class selection begins. I decide to take a few master level classes - I've had my BA for awhile, might as well get some more school in on the Boss's dime. Classes go well, and I coast through spring semester by tapping into a bit of savings. And wouldn't you know it? The pandemic happens, and my unemployment benefits are extended. Guess I'll take some summer classes. And those extended benefits were at 3x the base unemployment rate? Gee wizz, guess I can take a full set of fall classes too. And then the state extended it for another 3 months at double the base? I have winter session's signup date marked on my calendar!\n\nThe bossman calls me this morning. I coyly thank him for firing me without cause a year ago, and let him know I made the Dean's list last semester. He tells me to fuck off, he called to take me up on my deal - he'll hire me at 5x my rate to give him some information. I remind him, \"Wasn't the deal 10 times my rate?\"\n\nFuck you, 5x is too much. And I only need you for an afternoon.\n\n\"Well, I've been thinking about it. My unemployment benefits run out in a week or two. So I'll do it. I'll contract for you. I want 20x what I was making. 40 hours minimum. Paid in advance. Oh, and written scope of work - I'm only doing the work you say you need done during negotiations.\"\n\nFuck you, I'll give you 5 times and a day of work and that's final.\n\n\"No, thanks Boss. I have to get back to the classes you're paying for. Thanks again!\"\n\nI hang up. He calls back an hour later, just moments before I started writing this, actually. It's actually his daughter, the comptroller of the company. She says she spoke some reason to the boss. He'll hire me at 20x my rate for 40 hours of work, half paid up front.\n\n\"Actually, it was 100% up front, not half.\"\n\nFine. she starts telling me what needs done. Turns out, they're failing a State audit quite badly. Like, \"Boss is not a millionaire if this isn't fixed\" kind of badly. They have all the information they need, of course - it's on my company email account's google drive.  I'm not going to tell them this. Once he pays me for half a year's work, I'll gladly spend the hour or so of time it takes to transfer all of the data he needs to a flash drive, wait until Monday of next week, and then hand it to his receptionist.\n\nReally, the man couldn't have been nicer. He's already covered me going to college full time for over a year, and is about to cover another two semesters. I should buy him a cake.\n\n-----------------\n\n**Edit / Update:** I got a call. They seem to have decided that the daughter/comptroller would be the best point of contact, which is fine with me. We got along fine, she has a nice kid that used to run around the office. It seems like the bulk of the issue is the information that they can't find. That's roughly zero work. But since they can't find that information at all, auditors are nitpicking very fine details that my replacements have bungled up. From the way she told it, it sounds like a nightmare. The literal end of times. Honestly it sounds like a solid day of work running through their server with some of my tools. Maybe two days. She wants me to start ASAP while they finalize writing up a contract. I gave a surprised, \"Heh\" of a chuckle and said no dice. Contract first, and I'll have them pass the audit perfectly, like I always used to.\n\n\"But there's a deadline.\"\n\nI work fast.\n\n\"You don't understand, we only have until the end of the month. This needs started on today.\"\n\nI work fast, and it sounds like you should hire someone who knows how to write contracts fast, too.\n\n\"Whatever. If you don't fix this you're.... you know what, nevermind. I'll email you something in the morning.\"\n\nSounds like a plan, good night.\n\n--------\n\nedit 2: I'll do a final update once everything is settled, per the subreddit rules. The ending won't be as glamorous, but it will be an ending.\n\nEdit: everything was wrapped up. I'll post an update and link back here once I can.

            "This is some Oceans 11 shit what a ride \ud83d\ude06",
            "I've worked two jobs in my life, still working the second. The first was for 13 years two weeks out of HS full time, it was my college education. I worked my way up from plant to Inventory Control Manager and IT/PC Manager/Developer, we are talking late 80's into mid 90's, a couple bumps in the road getting there, but once I did I found my place.\n\nThe plant manager didn't hate me as a person but didn't like that I just didn't work like a dog all day. You see before me, the people in charge of Inventory over the years (to note company of 300) didn't know anything about computers and working smart. They were just always taking inventory on paper, any quarterly or yearly inventory shut the whole place down for 1-2 days.\n\nI started in the factory and worked my way up to the front based on that I was able to create a spreadsheet where daily the owner could see where each job was to budget, schedule and profitability. That daily report all by itself changed the company and how the owner actually knew what was going on. To note he owned multiple businesses so he couldn't always be at this particular shop. If one was paid their worth, honestly I could have moved to the highest paid employee of his just off this report alone, it was a company game changer to the end, details he never had, prior he'd juts get a EOM P&L and a lot of unanswered questions, didn't know where to focus.\n\nBut the Plant GM just didn't like how I could idle so much. I literally could balance the whole inventory each day in ~20 minutes because of computers vs what they had before a full time job for one. Plant wide inventories went from days to 4 hours or less, sometimes later on being able to not even shut down, just queuing inventories into the process and not moving them to finished goods for this period, because I worked with Toilet and Douche over the years to come up with a plan to do so that they were good with it ahead of time, they like to move fast to. I also brought in the first pc when mainframes were still the thing in tandem and when I ended every person that should have a pc had one like you would expect today, I maintained that on a 10baseT network then.\n\nSo over the years he's annoyed goes to the office GM and states he doesn't like how I can be not so engaged all the time. And the office GM had my back, \"like it or not, he does what he does faster and better than what we ever had before. Everything is done, I don't care what he does otherwise\". He got it, I can only say I worked hard to understand the process and to automate it the best I could to take up the least amount of time but still have accuracy better than ever. Basically I used pc's for what they were good for, not just for looks or something like that.\n\nThis was also a place where you had to put your employment on the line every time you wanted a raise. This amount or else, this always went to the top for approval. By this time the owners son was running the show and we got along well and he was good, it wasn't anything bad on him. But with my last ask they said no and well I stuck by my word and gave them my notice. In this case I became like a contractor for double the money for like 5 months training my successors and finally I had to just say \"you know this needs to end, it was sort of cool I was working 4 hours per day and making more\" but I was just ready to move on, so we cut me off and I'm gone. One of my bargaining chips for the raise was \"it's going to take two people to replace me, one for Inventory and one for PC maint/developer\", this is one thing they didn't believe me and well that backfired. The person that replaced me in inventory was related and made over twice what I did, they thought he could do it part time, ended up full time and then they got another to do PC, I have no idea what they paid them, I know they never replaced the software I wrote as I still had friends there. But there is a solid chance they ended up paying 3x to 4x more for less output. Oh well I was moving on. I left on a good note for sure, they became family and I'm glad they didn't match, my next job looks like it will end up as a career one and I'm making way way more with all the bells and whistles.\n\nThey ended up closing the shop many years later, as a software developer what I wrote they tried later to replace a few times with no luck. The people that worked there worked there a long time, each app I wrote was based on sitting with them and knowing exactly what they wanted and even improved their own processes, it was 100% tailor made. For example I wrote a time clock module that even Kronus could never match in functionality they were called in and just couldn't do it, which always surprises me, they are the experts and I'm one guy who isn't even credentialed. The inventory/logistics and invoicing app more of the same, it was so exactly them that any change would mean changing their business and way and cost them a lot to do that as well. That software ran to the very last transaction there, I always took pride that they couldn't replace it.\n\nStill was a great place to cut my teeth, I would visit from time to time. In the end too many bosses don't want to take the time to understand your work, how you work, your value and just always think people are replaceable at no cost. I know I was replaceable that is always true, but in this case at a cost and they paid.\n\nMy current job (IT based) I'm well compensated, they know I've done several things some in my area that save them a metric ton and then a few others well out of my area that created services and revenue for them that has added up to over 100 million over 20 years. But yeah that is what a good employee do, the contract is I work for you and you pay me for it, so when opportunities arise you just do them and you look back and see what you brought to whatever it is. Most of the time it is the job you are paid for, but often enough I found myself outside those lines changing the game some, that said it's been a while since I have done something really special, opportunities aren't always there.",

        "selftext": "Hi there! Long time lurker, first time poster,  on mobile so please be gentle.TL;DR at the end.\n\nI deliver home heating oil in a very rural and mostly flat part of the UK. In my delivery area there are many large drainage channels or \u201cdykes\u201d in the local lingo. The roads are often very narrow and single track and frequently run alongside these dykes separated only by a narrow grass verge. No safety barrier. \n\nAnyhoo, this one day in the depths of winter it was below freezing, there had been a light spattering of snow and there was a thin scum of ice on the water in the dyke. I had just finished doing a customers delivery and was winding in the hose prior to collecting payment and departing. My truck was completely blocking the road as there was nowhere for me to pull it off the road. We are limited by the length of delivery hose, blocking the road is common and legally acceptable as long as we work quickly and safely. \n\nSo...... I was just waiting for the customer to finish writing the cheque for their oil when this large Mercedes car pulls up behind my truck and the driver immediately starts leaning on the horn and shouting and swearing and shouting at me to \u2018move that f**king truck out of the way, NOW!\u2019\n \nMy usual response when faced with similar behaviour is to blank the swearer and pretend they don\u2019t exist. Being 6\u20193\u201d and 285lbs helps keep most people at bay! \n\nI ignored Mr Shouty man and finished up with my customer. The customer said to me \u201c Ignore him, he\u2019s well known in the village for being a bit of a dick!\u201d I said Goodbye and got into my truck. \n\nAs I was putting away my paperwork prior to driving off , I happened to glance on the drivers side mirror ( the same side of the truck as the dyke) and saw Mr Shouty Man storming up the side of the truck with a tyre iron in his hand! \u201cOh Shit! \u201c thinks I and immediately hit the central locking button locking myself in the cab. Next thing I know Mr Shouty Man has climbed up onto the step, is hanging off the mirror arm with one hand and brandishing the tyre iron with the other all the while shouting \u201cOpen this door you four-eyed c**t!!\u201d (I wear spectacles for driving! Oh the wit of the man! Lol)\n\nCue Malicious compliance......\n\nHe told me to open the door.......\n\nSo I did........but, as I did so I kicked it open. He lost his grip on the mirror arm and was flung backwards into the dyke up to his chest in freezing cold, filthy water! \n\nI calmly started my engine and drive off! As I left I looked in the mirror to see this guy floundering around chest deep in the icy water, dressed in a business suit! \n\nI called the customer who had witnessed everything and happily they said that they would give a statement to whoever needed one confirming I acted in self defence. Then I made a fairly difficult call to my boss and told him what had happened and he said \u2018I\u2019ll await his call with interest!\u2019 No bollocking , nothing!\nWhen I got back to the yard that evening I asked my boss what had happened and apparently no call of complaint was made that day or ever!\n\nThat is my story, please be gentle\ud83e\udd74\n\nTL;DR Got threatened by violent motorist. Obeyed his instruction which caused him to fall into freezing water.",

        "selftext": "Like a lot of the stories here, my MC was due to scheduling.  \n\nI was a system administrator for a big, 3 letter telecom company in the one small(er) department.   There were two admins, me and J.  J was awesome.  Super intelligent, very friendly, and was great at his job.   He and I decided that I would come in early and he would stay late, so there was more coverage during the day.   It worked great for both of us for a few years.  \n\nI would get to work around 6:30 am.  I would review all the system generated reports overnight, check the health of the servers and database, and then generate the daily reports for various managers throughout the company (including my own manager and his boss).   After 9 hours (plus 1 for lunch), I would go home around 4:30 every day.\n\nJ would show up around 10:30 and would usually be the last person to leave around 7.  \n\nMy old boss left and my new boss, T, was a major idiot and a huge asshole.  He knew nothing about IT and should have never been put in charge of people.  (he was a nepotism hire)\n\nAfter about 6 months of T working there, he brought me into his office.  \n\nHe said that he was very concerned about how I would just up and leave each day at 4:30\u2026.so consistent that you could set your watch by it.  \n\nI tried to explain that I\u2019m there at 6:30 \u2013 3 hours before he showed up and 4 hours before J showed up \u2013 but T was having none of that.  I was leaving way too early.\n\nI asked him what my hours should be.  \n\nHe said I should be more like J.   He said \u201cJ is usually here long after everyone else leaves.\u201d    \n\nOnce again, I tried to point out that J gets there at 10:30 \u2013 4 hours after me \u2013 and leaves by 7\u2026an 8.5 hour day (with an hour lunch), where I get there at 6:30 and leave at 4:30 \u2013 a 10 hour day (with an hour lunch).  \n\nT just couldn\u2019t comprehend that.  \n\nSo, I complied.  I told him that I would be the last one to leave from now on.  \n\nT was happy.  \n\nSo, I came to work about 10:15 the next morning (which was a Friday).  I started my normal routine and about 10 minutes later, J came in.   We worked the day and the last person (with the exception of J and me), left around 6:30.  We both left at 6:45\u2026.and I made sure that J left the building before me.  \n\nThe following Monday, I once again showed up at 10:15.  This time, there was about a dozen emails and a few voicemails from managers and executives all over the company wanting to know why they haven\u2019t received their daily reports.  (These reports were used in various Monday Morning meetings all over the globe).   I explained to them that my hours have changed, and they would be getting their daily reports by 1:00 PM.  \n\nOne of those executives was my bosses, bosses, boss.  \n\nBefore the end of the day, I was in her office with T and T\u2019s boss.  \n\nI explained to her the same situation that I had explained to T before this all started.   \n\nShe immediately told T that the work I did between 6:30 and 10:30 was mission critical to the entire company and I was to immediately go back to my old schedule.  \n\nI then sheepishly pointed out that 6:30 to 4:30 was 9-hour work days and J\u2019s 10:30 to 7 was 7.5-hour workdays.   I said I would be happy to go back to a 6:30 start time, but was going to limit my hours to 8 hour days (since I didn\u2019t get OT).  \n\nSo, starting the next day (Tuesday) and every day after, I showed up at 6:30, did my work, and smiled and waved at T when I went home at 3:30 later that afternoon...so consistant, you could set your watch by it.  \n\n------\nEdit to add 3 things  \n\n1.  I don't get OT because I was salary...but my salary was based on a 40 to 45 hour week.  \n\n2.  To those who say I threw J under the bus - he was well aware of the situation and supported me.  Plus, (as I said above), he was absolutely amazing at his job.  They wouldn't touch him with a 10 foot pole.  \n\n3.

T was too unintelligent or rigid to see your arrangement.\n\nWhereas people who come in late and stay late are almost always golden, because they're still slaving away while everyone else leaves, and that satisfies any nascent resentment.\n\nAs you say: managers need to be better than this.\n\nEdit: \"also leave early\"\n",

Production will go down and they will blame the last guy for leaving it a shit show. They higher ups will believe it or not care as long as the new guy gets numbers up by any means. Life will suck for awhile until he finally gets a \"promotion\" and they promote someone from within who actually knows what's going on. \n\nI see it time and time again.

        "selftext": "Back when I was in nursing school, we were supposed to wear black, non-porous, close-toed footwear with non-skid soles for our clinical rotations that weren't Crocs. Most of my fellow female students wore classic nursing clogs like Daskos and Sanitas. I tried wearing clogs like this in the past and had rolled my ankles too many times to recall, so I decided to not go that route for shoes. \n\nI'm a military spouse, a vet myself, and have aforementioned shitty ankles, so my footwear of choice was a pair of black leather tactical combat boots. As a show of support - and to make sure I always looked sharp at clinical - my hubby always shined up and edge dressed my boots every evening before clinical the next morning. The boots always looked professional, they were comfy as hell, I could bump my toes into beds without breaking a toe, and I could wear them all day without having back pain, foot pain, or rolling an ankle. The same could not be said for my classmates wearing more traditional shoes like clogs. \n\nDuring the first week of my first semester, I had an old-school nurse as my clinical instructor. I say old-school because she believed female nurses should still be wearing crisp white uniforms with the stupid starched hats and that our profession lost prestige when we transitioned to scrubs. This instructor got such a bee in her bonnet about my boots and decided that my boots were out of regulation that she threatened to take it up to the director and have me tossed from clinical thus failing the program. \n\nThere was nothing in the handbook specifically stating I couldn't wear my boots since it just stated 'footwear' which was black, well-maintained, non-skid and non-porous. Check, check, check, check. Furthermore, the pair of boots that I wore were meant to be worn by EMT's, so they were waterproof, bloodborne pathogen resistant, puncture proof, oil proof, non-skid, and had reinforced toes. They were just as expensive as Dansko clogs, and could handle lots more abuse. I knew I was in the clear, and so I decided to keep on wearing them. \n\nThe day after the instructor commented on the inappropriateness of my boots she did a uniform/shoe inspection to make sure we were appropriately attired. I, of course, was wearing my nicely polished combat boots. She failed me for the day based on my boots, so I politely objected, stating that my boots fell within the definitions of acceptable footwear in the handbook. She literally marched me to the directors office like I was kid caught stealing cookies and demanded I get tossed for the boots, failure to follow program rules, and disrespect because I objected to her failing me. \n\nThe program director, upon further close reading of the program regs, determined there was nothing that was wrong with the boots, they adhered to the standards set forth by the program, and that they were honestly safer than most of the shoes the other students were wearing because they were waterproof, puncture proof, non-skid and had reinforced toes. She rescinded my fail and allowed me back in clinical. After that, I heard not a peep about my boots from any of the faculty the rest of my program.\n\nFast forward to graduation... \n\nI had been my wearing combat boots since I started and had no intention of stopping, especially since many of the vets that I cared for during clinical always reacted positively to them. Our nursing pinning ceremony - the event where we receive our nursing school pins and are officially recognized as nurses - has an all-white dress code. White uniforms, starched white hats, white close-toed footwear. The word 'footwear' is key: the dress code did not state shoes specifically, and I knew this. \n\nSame bitchy old bat nurse sees me in the hall and makes it a point to tell me I'll have to get some 'real' white nursing shoes to wear to pinning since I can't obviously wear my black combat boots because we needed to have white footwear. I politely smiled, nodded, said that I'd have white footwear, and went on my merry way...\n\n...And then wore the all-white Doc Martin combat boots my linfantryman husband bought me as a graduation gift to pinning. The instructor stopped me after the ceremony and complimented me on actually getting nursing shoes... At which point I pulled up the leg of my white scrubs and showed her my boots. The look on her face was priceless. \n\n\nTL;DR... Nursing instructor tries to fail me for wearing combat boots, nursing director okays it, I wear black combat boots the whole program. Same instructor tells me to wear white nursing shoes for the pinning ceremony, I wear white combat boots instead.\n\n**EDIT: So this post kinda blew up, and a lot of people are asking what kind of boots I wear. I wear ATAC 2.0 8\" Defenders by 5.11. You can get them directly from 5.11, or at Galls. Thank you for all the love!**",

            "We were required to wear all white shoes (no logos or other colors) throughout clinical. I was excited about starting nursing school so I \u201cinvested\u201d in a pair of Danskos that cost me something like $100. Then I got a hard lesson the first couple weeks of working as a real nurse when a) I looked stupid with white clogs and b) I looked REALLY stupid with a limp after I rolled my ankle in the damn things. Glad you were able to find something that worked for you that could carry you through to your nursing career! \n\nAnd to anyone else reading, yes, this is a normal nursing school experience. You make far more money as a bedside nurse as opposed to teaching so nursing school staff always features a great cast of characters. Very commonly staffed by old school nurses who physically can\u2019t keep up and have rigid ideas of How Things Should Be. Most of the things they try to impose have not been relevant for about 20 years. \n\nThough after one or two class sessions without scrubs I totally understood why they did have some uniform regulations. While I wouldn\u2019t expect professionalism from everyone all the time, some of the attire worn by my classmates to school was inappropriate even for bar hopping in the middle of summer. We definitely had a few awkward skills practice sessions due to one or two classmates bending over in really short skirts or low pants so I get why they didn\u2019t want to deal with it and just wanted scrubs for most things. The weird restrictions were an easy way for them to size people up in regards to following rules and regulations, like the M&M riders for bands. Which is why it\u2019s so illogical she came down on you, since clearly you were following both the spirit and the letter of the rule. That\u2019s just plain incompetence.",

My mother was also conscious that by wearing that hat along with her white outfit, she looked what people expected a nurse to look like and because she worked in the ER, anything to help calm people presenting often on the worst day of their lives, was something that she chose to continue doing.
