        "selftext": "I'm in a senior roll at a service desk and like everywhere else if we see a ticket come in that has already been done or is a duplicate request we just cancel the tickets and move on with our day.\n\nWell we have this one user who is a vice president and they are the type of person who thinks the world revolves around them, so they would be the person to send in a ticket, then 5 minutes later send another ticket, and so on and so on until there is like a dozen tickets in the system.\n\nWell a few weeks ago we introduced a new password policy (18 characters, etc) with an additional policy that makes you change your password after a reset and you can't use a password you used before, and this was a big change considering our previous policy was no requirements. Most users figured it out pretty good and even the VP. Now this is where the Malicious Compliance comes in, with that new password policy it was also introduced that ALL tickets must be actioned before resolving them and you can guess who brought this change in...\n\nSo the VP went on vacation for a bit then came back and forgot their password and like normal they would send in a dozen or more tickets. Now in the 5 minutes or so between their tickets we would get 1-5 other tickets come in and it takes about 10 minutes to go through those. So my team and I went through every ticket like we are told to do and we were counting the number of times we reset the VP password because we knew this was going to come back on us.\n\nSo low and behold in the span of about an hour we reset their password 11 times. This is when our manager comes in and says \"I just got an email from the VP and they say you keep resetting their password\". My manager is a good guy and I remind him of the new ticket policy. He chuckles and heads back to his office and he forwards us an email with the subject \"STOP RESETTING MY PASSWORD!!!\"\n\nIn the email it says they had to change their password 12 times and they are running out of passwords they can think of and to stop resetting their password. I reply all to the email and say \"due to a new policy of tickets where we have to action each one before resolving it, we had to reset your password a number of times\".\n\nNo less than an hour later our department gets an email from the president that says \"we have reviewed one of your new ticket policies and believe this to not be the best use of your time so we are going to ask you recant this policy\". Needless to say we stopped the policy because it was dumb from the start and surprisingly the VP actually started sending fewer and fewer tickets.",

Eventually someone in IT management screwed up the courage to tell the rest of the organization to calm the F down and give the Help Desk a chance to respond before claiming that the sky was falling, and some reasonable expectations were set, but it made me very happy I no longer was on Help Desk duty by the time I started that job.\n\nOf course, I still had to deal with the fact that there was no downtime allowed on production servers (again, no expectations set) until eventually a server that we'd been asking to do maintenance on blew up and we could prove it was because we hadn't been able to do maintenance on it...",

        "selftext": "This happened a few years ago. I was the junior person in an office of mainly people older than me. As such, I was the geeky type person and the go-to guy for people to get advice on technical stuff. One day I found a great deal on laptops in Costco. They were selling some really nice Sony Vaios for a really cheap price. I bought one and would have bought more to sell on but I didn\u2019t really have the cash. My irksome team leader overheard me telling this at lunchtime in the office and then immediately went to Costco and bought about 5 laptops and immediately put them up for sale on places like craigslist, Ebay and gumtree (a UK second hand selling site), all the while crowing that today\u2019s youth liked to waste their money whilst the canny older generations saved their money for lucrative investments. \n\n\nHe sold one immediately for almost double the price he paid in Costco. This emboldened him to put the rest at 2.5 times the price he paid for in Costco. For about a week there was no update and then one day there was a cornucopia of excitement from where he sat. He had arranged to sell them all to someone in Amsterdam for the inflated asking price. He talked about what an absolute wheeler dealer he was and kept on telling people what profit he was making and what he was going to do with it.\n\n\nI told him that it was quite sketchy to ship goods privately abroad and it would be difficult to get any recourse if things went south even if it went to places in Western Europe. Of course, this was me \u201cbeing jealous\u201d of such a big shot and that I knew nothing and I should keep my mouth shut as I had no idea what I was talking about. I tried to warn him again but then I was called into the Assclown manager\u2019s office about \u201cprying\u201d into other people\u2019s financial affairs and that I was not to talk about anything that wasn\u2019t work related with this guy, as he had obviously complained about me. I received a verbal warning and warned that if I did it again then I would receive a written warning despite my protestations that I was merely reacting to what this guy was saying and I was trying to help him.\n\n\nOf course the buyer at the last minute changed the shipping details to Lagos, Nigeria and the irksome team leader started to show everyone the paypal email confirmation that he had received of the money. I should have told him to log into paypal to check that the money had arrived and it wasn\u2019t just a fake email. But I would have received a written warning. So I didn\u2019t. He packs up the laptops and sends them airfreight to Lagos. \n\n\nNext day the teamleader wasn\u2019t quite so full of bombast as he had been previously. It took a few other people to pry the story about how he had been completely ripped off and had received nothing via paypal. I was exerting a herculean effort to keep the tiniest of smirks from appearing on my face but my efforts were in vain. \u201cYOU FUCKING KNEW WHY DIDN\u2019T YOU TELL ME!\u201d he screamed into my face. \n\n\nBut I carried on with my work and didn\u2019t say a word. \n\n\n\nEdit: Quite a few questions in the comments so let me clear up a few. \n\n* Yes, it was a very toxic machismo workplace with lots of shouting around sales guys trying to outdo each other. \n* Assclown manager and Irksome Teamleader were very good personal friends. \n* Assclown manager was the local HR in effect.

        "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nA  little over a decade ago I worked for the local hardware outfit as the  storeman/stores manager. I took the job because it was local, paid ok  and was supposed to be relatively stress free.\n\nUnfortunately  the reality of it was that the assistant manager, Collin, was a  dickhead with an inferiority complex who had it in for me because I was  more qualified than he was (although I had absolutely no interest in  climbing the corporate ladder or taking his job), the job itself was  over tasked and understaffed and things were only getting busier as  there was a building boom happening in the area at the time.\n\nAs  a result I quickly ended up being run off my feet every day trying to  keep up with the constant influx of goods and outgoing orders. To make  matters worse the overall manager, John, decided to reassign my two  offsiders as delivery staff leaving me on my own. When I protested I was  told to \"solve my own problems\".\n\nI  somehow kept up with the workload, just, but knowing this was not going  to work in the long run I continued in my attempts to get more staff in  my area. Even just one offsider would have made a huge difference. I  tried reasoning with John saying \"what if I get sick or injured, How  will you get the orders done then?\" His solution was that he would have  some of the casual staff from the front retail area fill in if that  happened. I laughed in his face and suggested that they could not find  their own arses using both hands. Probably not the best way to handle  things. Once again I was told to \"solve my own problems\".\n\nOk  then, fine I will do just that. The situation continued becoming more  difficult each week. The incoming goods were increasing in volume to  keep up with demand (think two semi trailers per day) and as outgoing  orders were to take priority the incoming goods began piling up. Collin  decided to rear his ugly head and make a fuss about stock not being  checked in and stored on time and in one of our more robust discussions I  seriously considered rearranging his face and told him so. He decided  to go on an early lunch (run away) and hid from me in his office for the  rest of the week. That was the day I realized I need to get out of this  place.\n\nAs for solving my  problems, well obviously I was looking for a new job. I answered an Ad  for Correctional officers and attended a meeting for applicants, then  sat the psych tests, interviews and was finally accepted for the  training to begin in one month. Perfect timing.\n\nThe  next Monday I walked into Johns office and gave two weeks notice. John  was absolutely appalled that I would consider leaving such a \"good job\".  He tried offering me a raise of $1000 per year, I laughed and said my  starting pay was already $15000 more than I was getting here and walked  out.\n\nNow you would think a smart  manager would immediately take steps to cover my position and begin  training a replacement. Nope. Nothing happened for the next week and a  half until on my last Thursday John finally showed up with a  replacement, some entirely forgettable teenager who plainly had no  chance of keeping up. I trained him as best I could and the next day  said my goodbyes.\n\nTwo months later  I walked in as a customer, flush with my new job money. The place was  an utter mess! There was shit everywhere, unprocessed goods still in  sealed boxes, pallets of sheeting just dumped in the truck yard and no  one could find anything. The original guy I trained was no where to be  seen and four new young guys with haunted looking faces were madly  scrambling about trying to sort their shit out. No one knew where  anything was, where anything goes or even how to do a basic invoice  check. Total disaster which brought a warm glow to my evil black \"told  you so\" heart.\n\nUpon seeing me John  quickly pulled me aside and asked if I can help out and show the new  guys what to do. I took great pleasure in reminding him that I had  repeatedly warned him this could happen and than not only did I no  longer work here but that he will have to, and I quote, \"solve your own  problems\".",

            "This story reminds me when I quit as an IT and helpdesk manager for a large company with 450 computers and 22 agencies. All because of the shitty boss I had,  that shouted everybody no matter how hard and good we worked.    Then two months later I came across to one manager who told me everybody misses me badly, the guy who replaced me was an absolute jerk, incompetent , solved nothing and hides in his office.  Soon later my outsourcing company lost this large account, because nobody could fit my position after I left.  This made me smile wide.",
            "I mean if he wants to hire you on as a private contractor at 20 times your original rate...",
            "This was like my last IT job, which was actually my first IT job. I'll hand it to the guy, he took a risk on me and then... let me train myself. Ok, that's fine. Whatever. I googled my way to being a halfway competent tech. But he'd keep me in the office answering calls and would need me to dictate whether he thought I'd be able to handle it or not, which of course almost all the time was \"No, you're years away from that.\" So worked piled up on the two field techs we had. Oh, yeah, this company was 5 people. That's it. Our entire company could take a trip together in a mildly large SUV.\n\nI got tired of answering calls, having to check in with him on whether or not I could do the call, and having him pile it on the techs who hate me now for \"not doing anything\". One of the techs was the owner's kid, too. Smart guy, he bailed on the company for greener pastures. Now we're down to 4 people. I started looking around elsewhere and found my current job, so I applied thinking there'd be no way they'll take me. They took me, immediately. I put in my notice with Grumpy Gus and he lost it. Was devastated because he thought the other field tech and I would \"take over the company\" when he retired in \"a few short years\". Problem was, the company was bleeding out money, losing clients to more modern MSP's (like my current company) and the business was *tanking*. He wanted to retire and have it employee-owned, meaning we'd pay him for the business when he retired through profits of the business, meaning there is ZERO chance we'd see a profit on it for years.\n\nSo he started sending me out on field calls in my last two weeks. \"Finally,\" I thought. But yeah, there were some times I got stuck on an issue and I had to call the other field tech for help. I was new, after all, and hadn't received any actual training despite almost a year of being told I would. Boss calls me and asks why I'm calling the other tech while he's busy, and to just ask Boss for help. I do, and he gives me incredibly vague, intentionally bad information. \"What is the computer plugged into?\" \"Cat5e plugged into a Cat5e wall port.\" \"THERE IS NO WAY YOU CAN KNOW THAT, YOU'RE TOO NEW.\" \"Uh, the cable says Cat5e, the wall port says Cat5e.\" \"But what is the computer *plugged in to?*\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Oh, you'd better not be this stupid for your new job. They'll fire you in a minute.\"\n\nSo I walked out right then and there. I was very respectful to the clients and advised them that they will need to call the office and a new tech will be able to come out and fix the issue. Obviously I was not going to get support on any calls I went on and he'd send me on calls he knew were over my head. So I wasn't having any of it. I called my new place, told them what was happening and asked if I could start the next day. They happily agreed and almost a year later, I've never been happier at a job. Ever. My previous place? It's now closed permanently. He cut his losses after I quit and the office manager quit (she emailed me and told me he threw the nastiest temper tantrum when I left and destroyed about $3,000 worth of computers he was trying to sell.)\n\nNow I have plenty of support on every ticket, I work from home every day, we use more modern methods to manage networks and systems, and they're paying for a boatload of certs for me without any contract dictating a length of employment required afterward. I actually have health insurance now, I'm getting paid far more than I was before, and life is pretty good inside this home. Outside is still a dumpster fire but inside is good.",

            "Aha. I, too, worked for one of those. His go-to line was \"do your deal\".

Fortunately, I took the day shift desk clerk (also a friend of mine) with me as a witness to this meeting, because two weeks later, when I went in to give the boss my documentation, she said \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you tell me earlier? We need you to train your replacement!\u201d She shut up when I asked her if she\u2019d like me to go get my friend who would verify that I did, indeed, tell her two weeks earlier that I\u2019d likely be written off. \n\nI miss that job (this was over 16 years ago now, as said baby is now 16) but I most certainly do not miss that particular boss.",

It wasn\u2019t until I left and came back for dinner a month or so later that I finally got a \u201cthank you\u201d and people who said how much they missed me and had no idea how much I had been doing while I was there.

        "selftext": "So I'm working for a low-level corporation, about 450 employees. I've been there for 5 years and have risen to the top of my department's productivity levels. I mention this as it does pertain to the story. Management had a policy that latecomers would be penalized, but that lateness could be excused under some circumstances.\n\nI was good at my job, and I actually loved doing it, so I was more or less a dream employee. I always showed up to work 20-30 minutes early because I liked to sit in the lunchroom and prepare for my day. Management knew I was almost always early, so if I was late from time to time (and such instances were rare) they'd let it slide, as there was always a valid reason.\n\nNow for some other employees this latitude wasn't applied. Chronically late employees would get written up and not have their constant lateness excused. They'd complain, of course, but management was firm. They ran an actual meritocracy, where more-productive employees would experience preferential treatment.\n\nThen the business gets sold and we get new management. An international corp only interested in buying us up, stripping us down and selling off the company. Of course, they denied this constantly, but the fact that over the next 2 years they stripped us down and sold off the company proved they were lying.\n\nNew management comes in and has to make a bunch of idiotic changes. One of those changes is that no reasons for being late are accepted, regardless of validity. Anyone 5+ minutes late for work would be written up. So at the team meeting where this is explained, I asked, \"So if someone is 5 minutes late, and someone else is 3 hours late, the punishment is the same?\" And they said yes.\n\nFrom that day on, I stopped coming in early. I'd still head to work at my usual time, but I sat in a local coffee shop instead of my work's lunchroom. This meant that my work missed out because in the past I would often help out by answering questions, even start work early if needed. Because I loved my job, and the old management were wonderful bosses.\n\nNo more of that under new management. In fact, if something happened (like unexpectedly bad traffic) and I was going to end up being a few minutes late, I'd just say \"fuck it\". If being 3 hours late is the same punishment as 5 minutes late, I'd just decide to come in later. I'd call work to tell them I was delayed, then go out and have a leisurely meal in a restaurant, or run some personal errands, go shopping, even see a movie, etc.\n\nDepending on my mood, and how shitty the new management had been lately, what would have been, say, a 7-minute lateness on my part would end up seeing me roll in 3 hours late. Sure, it cost me a few bucks, but I made almost as much in bonuses than I did in hourly salary, so missing out on a few hours here and there didn't bother me too much.\n\nI'd come in 3 or 4 hours late and my new bosses would be fuming. Nothing they could do though but write me up for the basic tardy, same as they would have if I was 5 minutes late.",

But being so late they would have to shift and make arrangements to cover my job it could not go unattended for so long.  The supervisor asked why I was so late. Told them traffic. They were like for 1 hour? Nope I could have been here 50 mins ago but it's the same as 59 mins and there is this one store I always wanted to check out so I stopped by there first.

            "Yeah, a similar rule was implemented in my school, it did not matter if you were 5 minutes late or 2 hours, you still got a hour detention.\n\nSo it got to the point where if I see I will be 2 minutes late, I slow down, go drink a coffee, go to the park and then come in 1-2 hours late.",

My boss said that she didn't care when I showed up but I should try to be there at least by 10:30 in case I need to talk to other people.\n\nSince then I have not tolerated any jobs that demand a specific start time and yet still expect me to accept the salary.

            "I love the idea of a leisurely pace for a 7 minute delay!\n \n I worked at a place where it was better to take the day off instead of being tardy.\n\n Never understood why because it put the company in a bad position trying to find my replacement for the day rather that wait for me to come in 10 minutes later.",
            "My workplace has a \"points\" policy for attendance. 1 point per 4 hours.

            "Did similar myself. Got caught by a train, arrived <10 min late, tried to get it excused before punching in. They were stickers for the 5 min rule, but I was a solid employee who had minimal absences and almost no lates for years. They wouldn\u2019t give me the ok, so I turned around and went home. Came back, punched in 2 min under the half way point of my shift where the penalty would have gone up after, but at that point was the same as my 10 min. So I lost a little pay, they lost 3.5 hours of staffing, oops.",
            "Similar thing happened to me working at a call center, what schedule you got was partially based on attendance. Being late and absent were equally waited against your score. Similarly I was always there 10 to 15 minutes early, the late policy was 15 minutes and under were at manager's discretion. Showed up 5 minutes late one day manager said he was going to write me up, I explained how I am always early but he wouldn't budge. Told him just write me up for the full day and walked I went home.",
            "I used to stay back for 20 minutes at my retail job (as a stupid naive teenager who idiotically thought that hard work would be rewarded) to make sure my department was perfectly tidy as well as helping finish work other staff didn't get done, and then one day I was docked 15 minutes pay for being 2 minutes late because of a crash on the freeway and then again about 3 months later for being 3 minutes late because my first train was cancelled (as I was coming straight from uni that day). When I questioned it the store manager insisted that pay was done in 15 minute increments so there was \"nothing he could do\".\n\nFrom then on if I got to work and saw that the sign-on machine said it was 2 minutes past my start time, I'd sit on the bench out the back and play on my Nintendo DS til quarter past. Manager saw me once and threw a tantrum demanding I get out onto the sales floor and start working and I just said that since I wasn't going to get paid until 5.15, I wasn't going start working til 5.15. He threatened to write me up about it and I was like \"Yes, I'm sure the union will love it when I tell them about you writing me up for not working for free.\"\n\nThat shut him up. Not only that, but I also made sure that I left right on the dot when my shift finished. My department manager noticed that some areas of my department weren't being recovered as thoroughly as they used to and that there were a lot of returns from other areas being left in the fitting rooms (when previously I would have done them before I went home) and asked why I \"wasn't going above and beyond anymore\" so I just asked \"Why would I keep putting in more effort? Not only did I never get any recognition or reward for it, I was getting penalised for things that weren't even my fault. I'll do what I get paid to do from now on but that's it.\" She wasn't happy but there wasn't anything she could do about it (and sadly even me doing my bare minimum was still more than most of the other staff in that department did).",

I get in 10-15 minutes late. I\u2019m told I can take a comp day & go home or get a tardy.

Doctor's notes would prevent you from getting points for an unexcused absence, however.  \n\nThen, a couple of years in (pre-covid), they decided it would be a genius idea to revamp the system.  Same basic premise as above, except for one (admittedly big) change - Doctor's notes no longer prevented you from getting points, they just reduced the number of points you would get.  If you missed work without scheduling a day off, you were going to get at least one point, but if you had a doctor's note, it covered you for three days' worth of absences.  Basically, if you had to call out for three days in a row, without a doctor's note, that was three points, but with a doctor's note, it was only one point.  \n\nSince the consequence of calling off for one day was the same as the consequence for calling off three days, you can imagine what happened.",

I *did* do my best if the person was interested and I made some sales, but I'm not gonna try to convince you that you \"need\" something if you don't want it...\n\nI only took that job because of the decent pay and the fact that I didn't have a car at that time, so I had to find something close to my apartment. I was, like, 19 at the time, so I didn't have as many options...\n\nObviously it had the opposite effect and staffing levels plummeted. Why bother showing up late for a job if your record will show that you missed the entire day whether or not you actually worked it? The only people that still showed up were the ones who literally couldn't afford to miss an entire day. I doubt anyone showed up out of 'loyalty to the company' or any other such BS.\n\nI eventually got fired when I was unable to come to work for an entire week after I ended up injured on the last day of a 3-day vacation I'd taken. They were completely inflexible and refused to budge whether or not I had a doctor's note.\n\nFor some unknown reason, my mental health got so much better after leaving that job, lol... Even if my next job was a slight pay-cut.",
            "I worked at a place that said if you were going a minute or more late, you needed to call ahead to advise you would be late. But you had to call two people, in case one of them was going to be unexpectedly out for the day.\n\nI commuted with my husband, dropping him off downtown on the way to my work on the far side of the city. So traffic being what it was, most days I couldn't predict if I was going to be my usual 10-minutes early to the office.\n\nOf course I couldn't dial and drive, so I'd have to make the call when my husband was still driving his leg of the commute. Almost every day, about 35 minutes before I was due to arrive, I'd make those calls and say that traffic was questionable and I might be late. \n\nI think over the course of 6 months, I was actually late two or three times.",

            "Oh I love this shit. My job has one of those automated \"point\" (no fault) system. They claim they can't erase or change any of the records. A point is a point whether you overslept or were in the ER. They say, \"Oh think of it like a metric rather than discipline\". Yet I know for a fact they've told employees that the \"system\" automatically terminates an employee when they accumulate 10 points. They can override it, but a meeting has to take place and they won't reverse unless there is good reason. Well that is a boldfaced lie. I checked and I have 37 points. A month ago I had my evaluation, and points were not even mentioned. In fact, I was told I had one of the best evaluations in the company and got a raise. So it was all fine and dandy when I'm being a good little worker bee, but when I refuse mandatory overtime that gets scheduled on the spot because I have family visiting from out of state its a different story. \"Your point based attendence record has been raising some eyebrows. Are you sure you cant stay and help us out? I'd hate to see anything happen to you, we love having you.\"\n\nWell I had been waiting for something like this. I carry a list of occurrences and dates of my points. I showed him right there how I received points on days when the company dismissed us early. On days that we werent scheduled at all. Days I had to punch in using an alternative method because the main clock was down. Several days where I left for an appointment that was close by, so I chose to come back to work after. Well, on those days the system issued me 1 point for clocking out early even though it was approved, and 2 points for clocking in \"5 hours late\" when I came back \ud83e\udd23. So id have been better off just going home. I gave him my adjusted points that only accounted for true infractions, which brought down the total to 3. I then told him its a bullshit metric used as leverage to intimidate when they see fit. I will not be staying for overtime because right under your point policy outline in the handbook it says all schedule changes on the company's part must occur no less than 48 hours in advance or it is not mandatory. I was told about the overtime 30 mins before I was about to clock out. Even so, the penalty for clocking out early would bring my point count to 4. I'll take the risk. My uncle is here from Montana, Ive only seen him twice my entire life the last being when I was 16. Im going home.",

So, as the lingo goes when the calls came down I was Dr. Strong. I was in my office though when a LTC/Lieutenant Colonel came in.\n\n\"Hey there Captain, need you to take care of an issue for me.\"\n\n\"Oh course sir. If it is within my area and power I'll see what I can do.\"\n\n\"Well the general's driver's wife is in the maternity ward having just had her baby and she has a problematic room mate. Always closing the curtain and blocking her line of sight to the window. Also messing with the tv. I need this woman moved to another room.\"\n\n\"Uummm, that's definitely outside my area of control sir. I don't oversee or control anything with patients unless it is an issue of security, safety or\"\n\n\"Yes yes I know but you know everyone and the doctors and nurses will listen to you more than me. You are one of them now and they rely on you.\"\n\n\"Sir really\"\n\n\"I know I know no promises. This would really make the general happy though. His driver is like a second son to him so I would really owe you. It's room number XYA. Just give it your best for a fellow Infantryman okay?\"\n\n(breath deep, wait a minute) \"What room number again sir?\" He smiled.\n\n\"XYA.\"\n\n\"Roger sir. I'll look into it and do my best. I've got a couple favors I might be able to use.\"\n\n\"OUTSTANDING! Thanks.\" and he left.\n\nSo on up I went to maternity to find the head nurse. She was not pleased as apparently the LTC had been up there earlier trying to sling his weight around and came to find me when it had no effect. I pointed out the room though and she smiled. We both chuckled a little bit and I asked \"So, can you help me out with making this all be good? Please.\"\n\nGiving me a big friendly smile \"Well, the corner room is open. We could move the bothersome lady in there though she will likely have a new room mate later today. Then again once the bed is clean and reset we will likely be putting another lady in with the driver's wife too. Matter of fact\" she paused looking over files. \"It will probably be Mrs. Hispanic lady having her fourth kid. She was likely to be going in the corner room but with the move, she would have to go in with the driver's wife.\"\n\nMe- \"Well if that's how it has to be. As long as we can accommodate the LTC's request.\"\n\nHead nurse \"Okay but you are helping move the lady out of the room.\"\n\nMe- \"Yes ma'am, of course.\"\n\nThe lady who had been causing SUCH disturbances for the driver's wife was quite calm and gave no issues with the move nor even asked any questions. I called the LTC once it was done and made sure to tell him I had no concrete knowledge if or when a new room mate might be moved into the room but that the staff was really not happy with the move and extra work. He thanked me and I never heard anything of it again.\n\nThe entertaining part of the whole thing? The bothersome lady who got the room with the better view, the woman who had kept closing the curtain for some privacy and turning down the loud crap the driver's wife kept putting on the tv, was my wife who had just had our first kid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: Okay wow.  I did not expect this to blow up like this.  Work nights and went to bed only to return and find it had exploded.  Thank you all so much.  I'm glad so many of you enjoyed and I will try to respond as much as I can but there are over 200 comments so if I miss yours I'm sorry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2nd edit, from my wife:  I have been instructed to stop trying to apologize and explain things to the folks calling out the term \"Hispanic\" as racist.  My wife is from \"Little Havana\" in Florida.  She said \"If the \\*deleted\\* think it is racist then they probably have some bigoted and racist issues of their own to deal with and need to go to confession and deal with their shit.\"  So, from now on all such posts will receive a \"go see edit 2\" response if I run across them.  I might also let you know this is here just to give you the additional information if you don't fit the afore mentioned category.   \n Anyone else is also free to give such posts the same response/reply.

            "Having had some troublesome hospital roommates, I can understand how one would prefer to have more congenial ones. I never asked for anyone to be moved, nor did I complain if they were too loud (even if it was the middle of the night and they woke me up with their loudness). I guess I figured none of us actually *want* to be here, so let's all just work on getting *out* of here. \n\nOnce there was a small family visiting one of my roommates, he was the husband's uncle or something. Anyway, they were standing at the foot of my bed while they waited for the nurse to get the uncle ready for visitors (he had some mental problems). It was after my first brain surgery, and it was obvious that I had just had my head worked on (all bandaged up). \n\nThe wife looked over and asked who my neurosurgeon was (correctly guessing that I had to have one). I told her, and her reply was, \"Isn't he great? He did my back for me!\" (Yes, neurosurgeons often do back surgeries, in fact, if you're getting your back worked on, better have someone do it who knows what all the nerves do.)\n\nThe point is this: she treated me like a person, not a brain damaged victim, and even found something we had in common, which happened to be a brain surgeon. I'll never forget that little act of kindness, after all, she could have said nothing. \n\nI hope you and your family are doing well and that she enjoyed that corner room (for however briefly she had to stay there).",

Corporate still hasn't kicked on our air yet, despite it almost July.\n\n Our back room was almost 100\u00baf (~97\u00ba but the thermometer is a bit hard to read), 100% humidity. I was unloading the truck with three other people, and my boss was standing there yelling as usual. I started to feel symptoms of heat exhaustion and asked my boss if I could quickly get a drink of water. She told me I couldn't until the truck was completely unloaded, which was another half hour or so. She said something to me thirty seconds later, and I perfectly-timed projectile vomited all over her. She started yelling at me and the rest of the team because we weren't helping her get cleaned up, to which they all responded along the lines of \"well, you told her she couldn't go!\"\n\nYou won't let me go get water even though I'm having heat exhaustion?  That's cool, I'll just puke on you, instead!

Next time, just inform them what's going on, and do what you need to do to keep from getting sick, injured, etc. Any manager worth a damn will be well aware of how expensive and time consuming a workers compensation claim is for a company on top of the loss of a worker and what needs to be done to mitigate the labor shortage that goes along with it.\n\nAs for the current situation. I would formally report the manager to HR. If there is no HR rep or department, immediate supervisor will do. Though you can go over them as well if needed, it's more of a courtesy to talk to the immediate supervisor first, but I don't know the office culture where you work.\n\nIf reporting the unsafe working conditions or reporting on the bad manager gets you no traction, you can go up the chain farther, or threaten to report the company to the labor board for unsafe working conditions. This is also a sound tactic for any repercussions that may be coming your way for the vomiting incident or if your manager tried to punish you for just informing them you're feeling the telltale signs of heat exhaustion and went to get the drink your body needs. \n\nLabor laws are pretty clear on this, but I would recommend you also read them, as well as any labor laws or regulations in your state. Also, if you need to make the labor board threat, that tends to make an HR reps anus pucker up, as the labor board will be quite heavy handed with their judgements on a situation. However, any company/manager/HR rep worth a damn will never need to have this threat made. Lastly, this threat can also tend to be a nuclear option, as a shitty managers/etc will look for other reasons to let you go that are unrelated to the specific situation the threat was made for. \n\nSorry for the Tolstoy. Hope you're feeling better and good luck!\n\ntldr; Report the shitty manager to the appropriate authority in your company, and also report the incident that put your health/life at risk. Use reporting to the labor board as incentive to get the issue resolved if you get resistance and prepare for possible other repercussions as a result.",

        "selftext": "TL/DR at the bottom.\n\nOnce upon a time, there was an evil witch...\n\nThis all happened my senior year of college, spanning about 6 months.\n\nI lived in a duplex where the main floor and second floor were occupied by myself and friends. Often times, we\u2019d throw parties in our incredibly large attic. One of these times, we got a noise complaint. Everyone was very respectful when the cop asked us to shut things down, and left no problem. All residents were 21/22, and we were the only ones asked to ID ourselves. Had a fine conversation with the officer, and he went on his way. Probably one of the easier incidents in a college town.\n\nWhile we lived off campus, any incident like this does get reported to the school. All 6 of us received a letter stating we had to go to a class about drugs and alcohol because we \u201cthrew a party where drugs and alcohol were supplied to minors\u201d. We could of course appeal this, and we did. The school only needs 51% certainty that the event occurred how they thought it did. Seeing as everyone ID\u2019d was 21 and there had been no drugs, we thought we had a strong case.\n\nThis meant all 6 of us had to meet with the ass. Dean individually to go through the events of the evening so she could ascertain what really happened. First 4 went fine, my female roommate was 5th, and I went last. \n\nShe came home in tears. The ass. Dean apparently tried to rip her to pieces, said she had awful friends, why not just admit we had drugs and given alcohol to minors. \nShe stuck to her guns but it sounded awful.\n\nI can handle that stuff, but I HATE seeing people I care about go through situations like that. I went in prepared to my meeting, already hating this woman. I even had my phone recording the conversation in my shirt pocket. (Single party consent state in terms of audio recording) the conversation ended with her saying \u201cwhy can\u2019t you just follow the rules and act like a grown up\u201d.\n\nA few weeks later, we all received another letter. They had dropped the drugs alcohol bit due to lack of evidence, but had decided we had \u201ccreated an unsafe environment with only one exit\u201d. There were a few lines in the letter where \u201cstudent X said in the event of a fire, guests would\u2019ve been asked to jump out of the rear window\u201d and other completely fabricated statements. Sure, there was only one flight of stairs up to the attic. But unbeknownst to the assistant dean, we had one of those fire escape ladder window things. \n\nWe appealed yet again. But the second time around, you meet with a board of peers (teachers, students, assistant dean, and the police officer that had responded to the complaint) \n\nBeing a law nerd, I volunteered to go on behalf of my friends. That being said, we were allowed one person as council that couldn\u2019t say anything to the board, but could write things down to pass on to me.\n\nCue MC and \u201cfollowing the rules\u201d just like the ass. Dean had asked.  \n\nI showed up early, as did the officer. He was totally chill, and was getting paid OT to show up to a meeting to do nothing instead of the usual route.\n\nEveryone shows up, and the ass. Dean immediately questions why I have someone with me. \u201cWell per school code 14 subsection B etc. I am allowed to. This is my friend X, who has a law degree. Just following the rules.\u201d We get into semantics and how dangerous our party could\u2019ve been blah blah. I get to speak last, without any interruptions, until I yield. \n\nTime to drop bombs.\n\nI pull out printed sheets for everyone in the room of my Amazon account showing I had purchased the fire escape ladder thing months before the party had happened, proving we had indeed had multiple exits. \n\nI then passed out copies of the letter we had received written by the ass. Dean, and had highlighted all of the fabrications and lies about the previous conversation I\u2019d had with her. \n\n\u201cI recorded our entire meeting. I\u2019d like to take time for you all to hear that.\u201d\n\nAt this point she\u2019s FUMING and blurts out that what I did is illegal. The cop butts in and just gives that a big ol\u2019 NOPE. Single party consent for audio recording.\n\nWe all listen to the full 15-20 minutes. \n\n\u201cSo as you can see, all rules were followed by myself and my peers, and nothing unlawful happened. Not one of the highlighted sections was actually said. The only thing that worries me is how the ass. Dean openly lied as well as brought my roommate to tears. I\u2019d ask that all charges be dropped at this time against us\u201d \n\nShe then tried to backtrack saying she had made \u201cgrammatical errors in the letter\u201d, but everyone was smart enough to see the difference between the wrong form of Your and telling people to jump out of a window. \n\nA few weeks later we all received another letter stating that we were good, and no further action would be taken. \n\nI then went out of my way almost daily to walk through the admin offices where the ass. Dean\u2019s office was to give her a wave and a smile. \n\nTL/DR: Threw a party, got in trouble. Appealed the ruling, ass. Dean made my friend cry and I took it personally. Followed all rules and made her look like an absolute fool during the hearing.",

We got into a very pedantic discussion over the percentage of rounds that were \"all-play\" rounds where people would be yelling and trying to get the first right answer, I don't remember the math but we were right and they were wrong.  \n\nThe more serious charge was alcohol (we were underage).   We were allowed to question our accuser, and as a science major and a bartender, I just asked him \"You said you smelled 'alcohol', right\"?   \n\n'yes', he answered.\n\n\"Was it beer?\"\n\n'alcohol.

            "I thought you were saying ass Dean (which seems fitting) but then half way through I was like hmm that's weird why is there a period here.... OOOOHHHHHH",
            "Congrats on sticking to such a slimy person, and I'm glad the officer was helpful! I wish there was a storybook ending where the Dean got demoted or had to make a public apology and give you and your suitemates some prestigious award for Honor and Service or something.",
            "Just curious, why would a Dean of a Uni even care about students partying? As an English person this is baffling. I thought you guys were 'in the land of the free'?  \n\n\nAt our Uni, there were parties pretty much every single night in most of the dorms.",
            "at the end you should have asked her....\n\n \u201cwhy can\u2019t you just follow the rules and act like a grown up\u201d.",
            "This was a fucking awesome read, thanks for that.",
            "Not following the punctuation well. Is \u201cthe ass\u201d and \u201cthe dean\u201d the same person, or two different people? Otherwise, way to beat them at their stupid games!",
            "I hope you are in law school!",
            "What kind of totalitarian dictatorship is this taking place in?\n\nWeird mock trials on a school about adults doing obvoisuly legal stuff on their own property on their own time?\n\nSounds like North Korea.",
            "The \"ass. dean\" reminds me of an almost malicious compliance story myself.  I once had to mail a special tax form to my county board of assessment appeals.  To fit it on the envelope, I mailed it to MY COUNTY BOARD OF ASS. APPEAL",
            "Good job. \n\nReading this I realize people like this Dean become politicians and decide how our life is run.",
            "I love you for this!  I was bullied as a kid so this kind of well-handled situation is golden in my mind.",
            "Should've sued for defamation. Solid case before it even began.",
            "Am I missing something? You lived off campus? How is anything that happens off campus any of their business? (Except criminal charges that could impact the school.)",
            "Why the fuck would a noise complaint during a party where everyone is 21 years old or more be reported to the school? Why and how could the school force you to take classes on drugs and such!?",
            "College disciplinary systems are FUCKED. The absolute worst things in the world. The only rules are what the ass deans and their ilk make up. People get unjustly accused, and real offenders get off scott free. That\u2019s what happens when educators try to play law enforcement.\n\nUniversities should have a system for academic integrity violations, but turn all suspected criminal offenses over to the cops and courts. Have real investigators. Have real trials. Have students deal with real-life consequences for their real-life crimes.",
            "Why would you have to provide proof of a secondary exit for your private residence? If there is a city ordinance that would require an attic to have an exit, it would not be enforceable by the university.\n\nI'm glad you won your case. Shit like this is absolutely bonkers!",
            "oOH ASSISTANT DEAN NOT ASS IM SO SLOW",
            "I really wish you had just written out assistant dean. FFS for the longest time I thought it was just the ass. I mean COME ON, a capital D right after?? SO MUCH CONFUSION till I figured out what the hell was happening. lmao",
            "You were \u201cstudent X\u201d in the letter? Maybe change it to \u201cStudent Gldn_cocktails\u201d - I wasn\u2019t sure how your recording was going to help until I read it over again.",

            "was there any other repercussions to the assistant dean? because if she lied once about that imagine how many times she did it priory and got away with it",
            "Ass. Dean was probably the one that never got invited to parties when she was in college.\n\nWith such a nice personality you can just wonder why.  \nThis was her attempt at revenge.",
            "Ass. dean needs to be gone.  Could you have pushed for that somehow?",
            "*chef\u2019s kiss* Bravo! This made me so happy.",

            "So, how many of the people who didn't show ID actually underaged? :)",
            "Great job, OP. A timeless tale to tell for decades! We have so few opportunities to shine like this when we are in 'subordinate' roles.  I'm glad this experience worked out for you so well.  I'm hoping referring to her as the 'ass. Dean' was purposeful. (winky-smiley face)",

            "Sounds like she\u2019s been pulling this kind of shit for a long time.",
            "I love this SO much. As someone who went to a tiny university and dealt with SO MUCH administrative bullshit and bullying, this makes me incredibly happy. Our ass deans must have been related.",

            "\"ass. Dean.\" looks like their job matches them",
            "Unfortunately academia is FULL of petty human beings who haven\u2019t advanced beyond high school socially. Good for you for calling her out publicly and having the data to back it up.",
            "At first I found \"ass. Dean\" weird but then I realized you'd done that on purpose. GG.",
            "for the whole recount i thought ass. Dean was calling the dean and ass but it actually meant assistant dean. talk about not getting the context",
            "This needs to a movie or short video cause that was amazing",

            "Sounds like the abbreviation of ass. Dean is accurate.\n\nSeriously I'm glad you came out okay. That situation sucks. It never hurts to cover your butt and stand up for yourself.",
            "Good on you for standing up for yourself! I think it's very comical how university disciplinary committees will go through so much trouble trying to nail you to the wall for minor noise complaints, but will do the exact opposite for predators on campus.",
            "AND I TOOK THAT PERSONALLY!!!",

            "I'd enjoy this if this was a movie. Reminds me of \"Ferris Bullet's Day Off\" for some reason",
            "Even though you followed due procedure and proved the ass. Dean wrong (kudos for that btw) sounds like you're in for a backlash. These people are petty and high on authority, making a fool out of her will make her miserable but she will also constantly look out for a way to make your life difficult.",
