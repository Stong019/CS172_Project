        "selftext": "I want to state there are no good people in this story. Only pure, 100% unadulterated malicious compliance. \n\nI'm at Costco trying to order a pair of glasses. If you've never been to Costco, the optical department is usually either next to the entrance or next to the Membership desk on the way to the exit. If it's the latter, the entire area is pandemonium from people trying to exit/return things/get memberships/order optical lenses. My local Costco is the latter. \n\nI'm standing there with my ticket waiting to be called. My ticket is like 54 and they're on number 48 and there are only 3 guys so this is taking a while. I notice a woman in the area hold a fussy toddler, I suppose just on the verge of being able to talk, looking for the first available employee. It just so happens that one of the optical guys was done with a customer, so the woman goes up to him and they have an exchange like this.\n\nWoman (W): \"Excuse me, I--\"\n\nOptical Guy (OG): \"Ma'am, you need to take a ticket and wait.\"\n\nW: \"But I just--\"\n\nOG: \"Ma'am, take a ticket. There were other people in front of you,\"\n\nW: \"Yeah but I just wanted to--\n\nOG: \"Ma'am! Take. A. Ticket. That's the last time I'm going to tell you. You can wait in line like everyone else.\"\n\nAt this point, the woman accepts \"defeat\" and her toddler is getting fussy. She grabs a ticket and puts her child on the ground. The kid is crying at this point loudly but I have my headphones in, just trying to wait for my turn.\n\nAnd then it happens.\n\nThis kid unleashes a torrent of shit that basically explodes his pants and gets all over the AC display shit they try to sell you on the way out. I'm amazed that much poop came out of this little boy. He's crying up a storm and his mom is trying to comfort him but it just keeps coming and coming. At the same time, he's waddling around and getting it all over the place. The entire area, myself included, jumps back and is giving this lady some space. \n\nFinally, after what seems like an eternity, it stops. The kid is crying, his mom holding him, shit running down her arms. There is fecal matter in about a ten foot radius everywhere. All traffic to the exit has stopped as horrified shoppers look on. The optical department, including OG stare at this woman. She marches herself, son in tow, up to the man.\n\nW: \"I was wondering if you could tell me where the bathroom was.\"\n\nOG sheepishly points to an area behind the registers and W walks away. I decide to come back later when the area doesn't smell like a raccoon fucking died, trying to stifle my laughter the whole way through.\n\nTL;DR: Lady took a number and it happened to be 2. \n\nP.S. Before you ask, there is no big sign pointing to the bathrooms visible from the Optical Department at my Costco. I imagine that will be changing soon. \n\n",

            "I can understand the sentiment of the doctor.  Customers all think they are the most important person in the world.  \n\nI work self checkout sometimes.  There are 9 registers that I have to babysit people on.  Sometimes it's legit stuff like they're buying beer and I have to override them.  Usually it's stupid stuff like telling them for the third time \"no, you can't scan an item and simultaneously remove an item from the bagging area before putting the item you scanned into a bag first\".  Occasionally it's a void and it takes about 10 seconds per void because of how shitty the software is (not a hardware issue, it's got a bad Interface). \n\nSo of course while I'm helping one person with a void, in that ten seconds it takes, people will begin surrounding me in so I can't escape and take a second to think to see who has priority for the next fix that I have to do (for example, in the five seconds it takes to do one ID override, or to explain to a customer that \"you didn't hit the card button to let it know you want to use your credit card, yeah I know you think you hit the button, but just humor me and press it 'again'\", I could throw in two or three overrides for \"customer removed bags from bagging area\" so that three people are done by the time I've helped the one beer person (or finished debating the intricacies of whether they hit the card button or not - spoilers, they didn't.  I've watched people multiple times go from scanning items to hitting \"pay\" to sliding their card and then just staring at the machine and then claiming they also hit \"card\" when I clearly saw they didn't). \n\nSo yeah, it's gotten to the point where when I finish a customer, I take a deep breath, wince, and then slowly turn around and immediately say \"yes, I'll be with you in a moment\" almost before the first \"SIR SIR I NEED HELP\" can even be formulated.  Like, holy shit, give me a chance to get to my podium so I can see what the other 8 people are up to so I can see if your emergency is truly life threatening or not.  \n\nI probably would have \"HOLD ON\"'d that lady as well if she was one of mine, just because of how my customers are.  After all, the problem is that if you don't train the customers right, it teaches them that it's ok to skip the line or whatever.  \n\n\nLike today I had to tell a customer six times \"please go to the line because your turn will take longer if you don't get in now\" after she skipped the self checkout line that I was managing and thought she gets special privileges because she wanted cigarettes.  I told her I'd get the cigarettes, but she'd have to wait her turn on a self check out register so I could sell them to her.  Instead, she followed me around as I was looking for the keys to the cigarette case (my coworkers have a habjt of leaving them in one of four places, so I often have to play where's Waldo with them), as I kept insisting she stop doing that and get in line.  After like the sixth time, she was like \"oh I go line for self check?\". Yeah, no shit.  That's what I told you five times, and now what would have been a 15 second wait is now like 3 minutes.

We worked for a chain of English-language schools in Japan, and, if you're a sub, you're likely to be dispatched in many different directions, to various schools.\n\nOne day, Alex was riding the train, when he received an international call from his family. The call lasted only a moment, but he didn't realize there was a student on the same train who recognized him, and was offended by the conversation. It's not illegal to talk on your phones while on trains, but it's considered bad form and a faux pas. Anyway, the student complained to school staff (without saying anything to Alex himself), and word eventually made its way back to Personnel at HQ.\n\nNow, the personnel coordinator at the time was a dick, and he decided to flex his managerial muscles. Rather than sending a simple email asking Alex to refrain from using the phone, he called Alex in on his day off, talked to him for a great deal longer than was necessary, and made Alex write two statements-- one, a letter to the (unknown) student apologizing for the incident, and a promise that would go into his personnel file saying he'd never answer his phone on the train again. \n\nFast forward a couple of months, and Alex, working as a substitute teacher, takes the train to his base school, where he'd be stationed in case of emergencies. The train arrives, and he steps aboard-- but then gets a call. Caller ID shows it's personnel, and the only reason they'd call at this time is if an emergency arose, and he needs to get to another school ASAP. \n\nAlex ignores the call, and enjoys the 40-minute train ride to his base school (while on the clock) with a nap. When he gets off the train, he calls back personnel, who's livid and demands to know why he wasn't answering his phone.\n\n\"Why, Mr. Coordinator, you told me to *never* answer my phone on the train, and I would *never* think of contradicting you. You made me promise, after all,\" Alex says.\n\nThere's an angry silence and a gnashing of teeth on the other end of the call, with the coordinator probably holding back an angry tirade. \"Just get on the damn train and get back here; we need you at [another school location],\" he says, and hangs up.  (This was 40 minutes back the way Alex came from, plus a good 20 minutes further)\n\nAlex shrugged, and grabbed the next returning train, where I like to imagine he enjoyed another good nap (while still on the company clock).",

We only had home phones in our apartments and mine had a message blinking on it but no one had explained how to access it.

I lucked out with my first school and have never had to change, but it's not unusual for me to be turning down job offers almost weekly; if someone abuses their native, they're going to lose them pretty easily..\n\n\nI guess more people go for Japan and finding a westerner just isn't all that hard?",

Everyone in this office had the same job, we worked desk side IT support.  This required a lot of walking, crawling under desks and carrying equipment. Each of my coworkers had an assigned area that they were responsible for and pulled their weight.  All except for $blondie.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne day at work, we had a large project.  My manager required everyone to pitch in to get this done by the deadline.  Everyone, except $blondie.  Every time there was work to do she would say she couldn't because of her heels or skirt.  Someone else would have to do her share.  Normally I do not care what she (or anyone else) does or does not do.  I do my work, she does hers.  On this day, I was tasked to do the work she was assigned.  I was not happy.  The next day another coworker of mine (also female) was assigned the work $blondie could not do because of her wardrobe choices.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat day at lunch we come up with a plan.  We will wear kilts the next day and the other 2 women will wear skirts and heels to work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next day at work, we show up to our morning huddle to get our assignments for the day.  My boss is visibly uncomfortable, half of his team is in skirts or kilts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI get my assignments for the day and immediately tell my boss I can't due to my wearing a kilt.  The rest follow my lead.  I feel bad for my remaining coworkers having to pull my weight but they think what we are doing is funny.  This day was amazingly unproductive.  No one can say anything about it because they have let $blondie do this for literally years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 2 my boss is even more frustrated and pulls me aside.  I hand him a well written dress code policy that another office uses that has already been approved by legal.  He spends the day fast tracking the approval this policy.  At the end of another horribly unproductive day, we have a surprise team meeting.  There is now a dress code that requires long pants and closed toe shoes for \"safety\" reasons.  $blondie's look of rage directed at me made no mistake that she knew I was responsible for this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote:  I do not care who you are, what you look like or what gender you are.  I care about the quality and quantity of your work.  If you are hiding from pulling your weight intentionally, I will put a stop to it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I hope I tagged everyone that asked.",

I had just gotten out of a work environment where women had recently been allowed to wear pants, but wearing them was a serious political statement and required meetings with a supervisor.\n\nSo I switched to dressing like my department coworkers and supervisors, who were required to wear business clothing and wore jeans anyway. Cue six fucking months of department-wide meetings about why I wasn\u2019t conforming to dress code.\n\nNow, maybe my coworkers came in so drunk they were insensible. Maybe they ignored jobs to openly read hardcore pornographic magazines. And maybe they\u2019d lied about their qualifications for the job and were barely literate.\n\nBut every one of them threatened to quit in solidarity if the company decided the dress code was more important than the work just because they\u2019d finally hired a woman.\n\nAhh, IT in the year 2000.

There was a dress code in place that allowed skirts but no shorts. I think that's reasonable, considering we were seeing patients all day. But the place I worked at had no AC and the IT, the equipment we used as well as the lighting emitted quite a significant amount of heat. In summer we regularly had above 30\u00b0 C in our offices. Due to our customers being mostly elderly, we canceled a lot of appointments since ambulances picking up patients with a heatstroke really aren't good publicity. There weren't many people coming in these days anyway and nobody would have bothered if I had been wearing short chinos and docksiders. That was forbidden though.\nHaving to sit in this sauna for a whole day wasn't pleasant, wearing long trousers made it worse. I was sick of it.\nI've asked HQ for an AC multiple times and it was always denied. I didn't get it. They were losing money because we had to send people away. But since that obviously wasn't enough I decided to take it one step further. I wrote an email saying I'm just informing them I'll be wearing a skirt on the next warm day since the temperatures inside the store were unbearable wearing long trousers.  If they would prefer me wearing shorts they should say so and if they want neither they should reconsider their decision not installing an AC.\nI didn't have to deliver on my threat, 2 weeks later they installed an AC.\n\nTL-DR Blackmailed my employer into installing an AC by threatening to show up in a skirt (I'm a guy)",

        "selftext": "This was originally posted as a comment to another thread but some said it needs to be its own post so, here ya go: \n\nMy work (aviation) was on a no OT at all rut for awhile in 2021. No biggie to most of us but the bosses were strict with every single minute because the higher ups were watching the time charging as well to make sure no OT was being clocked. \n\nI got a new job within my company that was requiring me to move. I was working second shift (1400-2300 M-F) at the time so when I\u2019d get to work and answer all the HR emails, I would be behind on the check list I\u2019d have to complete prior to moving. So I did the logical thing and emailed my then supervisor and asked to be transferred to day shift so I could be in the building during the day time to talk to HR otherwise I was going to miss my transfer date. My supervisor emails me back and says \u201cyou have a company laptop now, answer those emails from your house. I\u2019m not swapping you to day shift.\u201d I responded \u201cok.\u201d \n\nSo I began my day at 0900 so I could email and Teams chat with various HR reps during the day and then go to work in the afternoon. I logged every minute and being that I had a company laptop I know they can see my login activity so I would have back up if they tried to claim I was stealing time. \n\nFast forward a week and the site manager (supervisors boss) pulls me into his off and wants to know why I have almost 20 hours of OT for the previous week when we aren\u2019t allowed any OT. I explain to him I was given permission from the supervisor. Site manager calls the supervisor in. Supervisor says he gave no such permission. I tell them both about the email response, offer to send it to them and print it up should they need. My supervisor got as red as fire truck, site manger said your OT is approved and kicked me out of the office asking me to close the door as I left. I received a text message two hours later informing me I was to start day shift immediately. \n\nFuck em all.\n\nEdit: to clarify some things for those who are questioning the 20 hours of OT dealing with HR. I was being transferred to an international site with my company. So it wasn\u2019t just HR I was dealing with. Some of the time was HR because I was swapping from hourly to salary, some of the time was with was legal (briefing on trade agreements), some of that time was the tax consultant briefings, some of that time was the moving company and coordinating with them a time to come survey my house for pack up, some of that time was spent reviewing documents for my new job as it was a different contract and I needed to be familiar with it since I was dealing with an international customer now. And some of that time was filling out the work visa info to return it to my company so they could process that shit because that takes a lot of time so the quicker you get done the faster you can get a visa. I didn\u2019t want to drag out the story with this info and make a super long post so I simplified it with \u201cHR\u201d. \n\nAdditionally, and lastly; my company has a rule for hourly employees (which I was at the time) that if you required to do any work outside of your normally scheduled shift, you charge four hours minimum. So even if it\u2019s answering an email outside of that second shift hours I was on, that was four extra hours on the day right there. (Some have mentioned to me that this rule could be a state law and I\u2019m not sure if it was or not tbh nor do I care to look into it right now because I\u2019m not in that state anymore lol. I just know it worked to my benefit greatly and in doing so I got to \u201cstick it to the man\u201d)",

            "I used to work part time on a railway. It was one of the few places that also had the signal box so it was a joint role, customer service and signalling.\n\nNow. There was a hiring freeze, so whilst employed part time I was doing a full time roster, and as it was a union job the rules were \"x many hours your shift was extended, a part timer is paid OT for all extra hours\".\n\nThe barrier was... two hours over IIRC. My contract has 5.5 hour shifts (part time) but I'm regularly working eight, ten, sometimes twelve hour shifts - hiring freeze.\n\nSo it'd be 2.5 hours OT for every eight hour shift.\n\nI'm logged into the signal panel, on OT as per usual. Only qualified person on duty (there was a non panel qualified station officer doing customer service). I get this call from a functionary in HR who castigated me for the OT and says \"I'm not gonna pay it it\".\n\nRemember, I'm on the line. So I log out, call train control as to why, they won't pay me, better organise buses for the line.\n\nControl asks when. \"Now, as I'm already three hours into OT\"\n\n\"Please, wait.\" Some big controller on six figures has just asked part time person to wait. \"Who said that?\"\n\nI told him.\n\n\"Is there someone else there?\"\n\n\"Yes.... but they're not panel qualified yet. They want to be, but, training freeze, remember?\"\n\nPanic. I go and make a cup of coffee.

            "This story happened years ago. While I was working a 4pm to midnight shift at a TV station, management distributed a notice to all employees requiring them to attend a staff meeting, held, of course, during the day, at like 11AM. Which I did, coming in outside my schedule, and then put one hour of OT on my time sheet. Wow, did that hurt their feelings! In fact, the general manager, asked by a friend why he looked so sad, responded by actually naming me and complaining that I had asked for OT (to which his assistant GM quickly chided, \"Talk about a team player!\"). This was in the TV studio while preparing for a taping, with about forty people there who came from outside the station. Being pretty far down the authority structure, I was amazed that something I did could be so important that he would blame me so freely.\n\nI eventually backed down, IIRC, because it seemed petty to get HR (a completely separate department, which usually only came around during union negotiations) involved over one hour. But c'mon, you managers watch TV at night, right? You know you have second shift workers required to be there. Why schedule something for the whole staff without considering the guy who doesn't work a daytime schedule?\n\nI actually should have claimed 3 hours of OT, because that meeting really should have been counted as a callback. I don't recall asking the union steward about it, which I should have at the time. I continued to work there for years, in various capacities, until I retired a few years ago. But how this made me feel is not something I've forgotten.\n\nEdited to change \"totem pole\" to \"authority structure.\"",

That's only recent I know with the only reason companies giving the smallest shit being the threat of fines, but between the two family companies I worked and the two bigger chain supermarkets I've tried after COVID, the supermarkets were every bit as strict about clocking in for 10 minutes to talk to a manager as they were about coming back from break on time. Again, it was a CYA measure for them so they couldn't be accused of asking for unpaid labor, but I like that the threats of real consequences are at least getting to bigger companies a little bit even if it's still happening at some locations I imagine.

To get started I'll explain their report process, when something goes wrong in the factory that's directly tied to quality ( such as bad coloring or defects) I as a QA lead would have to write a report. These reports were very detailed and extremely time consuming. Now when something went wrong that wasn't directly tied to quality but effected it ( such as a machine breaking or foreign material getting in the machines ) the lead in charge of the machines were supposed to write the report. Somehow all the reports ended up being written by me even though I had my own time consuming job to do. I had been fighting to not do others reports for months and my boss told me to remind other leads when a report was needed.\n\nOne day I'm doing my reports plus my data analysis duties and I hear over the radio that a refrigerator unit has gone out and all the product was coming out as boiled mush instead of frozen, so I call refrigeration and tell them \"you need to do a report on this I'll send out an email counting how many pallets of product we lost\". So I send the email and continue on with my day, two weeks later my boss calls me into her office and asks me why I didn't write a report on the incident, I say \" you told me to remind the other leads to do it and not write their reports\". She responded \" well if you have time to send an email you have to to write a report\" then she makes me sign a write up for failure to do my duties (which I did placidly cause she had written up everyone else in my department and had been looking for something to write me up for, so I decided to let her have it and get it out of the way).\n\nWell a couple months later and the exact same thing happens and all I do is tell refrigeration over the radio to write a report. I did nothing else knowing that refrigeration wouldn't write it. Because there was no report or helpful emails the product was almost shipped out two months later but it was caught by one of my QAs who mentioned the incident to my boss. Boss calls me to her office and tells me \"this incident is going to cost the company Millions in storage fee's for the time it was already stored, disposal fee's, lost product and a fine from Walmart for not meeting contract. Why didn't you email me about this\" me \" I didn't have the time but I did tell refrigeration to write a report\".\n\nShe couldn't write me up for it cause I had emails from her telling me how to handle these situations.",

        "selftext": "I (25F) am engaged to my fianc\u00e9 Joey (26M). He recently had surgery on his leg and hip, but there were complications, and he has been sick and weak since. We try not to ask for help, but this has put a big financial strain on us, to the point where we\u2019ve spent our wedding savings on his recovery. We are fine with this because if we need to have a courthouse wedding, we\u2019re cool with it. We just want him to be healthy. But we did set up a temporary donation page to help with some of the expenses.\n\nA friend of mine, Karla (25F) donated $10 about a month ago, and I reached out to her to thank her. Last week we posted an update, not asking for more money, but just to let people know that Joey has had another setback and the doctors are creating an all new treatment plan for him. Karla commented publicly and said the following: \u201cI\u2019m beginning to question if he has actually been sick this long or if y\u2019all are just trying to get more money for your wedding. Who takes this long to recover from surgery especially when you\u2019re an athlete?\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cI am very offended and appalled that you would accuse us of faking anything. Maybe you\u2019re just having a bad day or a moment of bad judgement, but how shamefully low of you.\"\n\nShe replied, \u201cI want my donation back unless you can show proof that he\u2019s sick. In a hospital bed or sitting in a doctors office\u2026 anything?\u201d\n\nI sent her $10 to get her off our backs, but I also sent her a video (with Joey\u2019s approval), the proof she asked for. One of the concerns Joey has had is that he will get severely nauseous if he eats protein (which is what he\u2019s supposed to be doing) and when he over-exerts himself (which he does sometimes). I sent her a video of him dry-heaving into an emesis bag in the middle of PT. Now, one of his doctors asked us to record his PT so they can see the progression of him not feeling well to hopefully make some adjustments, so I didn\u2019t take this video just to send to Karla, but to me it seemed like solid proof since she was asking for it.\n\nShe said, \u201cWTH? I have emetephobia [I didn\u2019t know this] and this just triggered me so bad. I hope you\u2019re happy with yourself, I feel like I\u2019ve been traumatized.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cSo now you have ten more dollars to process this trauma in therapy.\u201d",

Also, I never thought I'd ever be one of those people, but due to the response on my previous post, no one has permission to recreate or retell this story on any medium whatsoever. Please do not bother me about it. Also, once again apologizing for the English, I'm not a native speaker.\n\ntl;dr if you didn't read the last post or are looking for a refresher: Boss is most likely bi-polar, or has some crazy anger management issues. Boss flips his lid on me after I make a simple mistake (remedied within a few hours) and tells me \"Pack your things up and go home. Think about whether you want to keep working here\u201d - which is in essence an illegal termination. After asking for a raise for nearly a year and not receiving one, I decide that No, I don't want to keep working there.\n\nAnd now the story continues. \n\nWhere I left off, I was waiting for his pre-dismissal hearing, after he tried backtracking from his illegal termination. I decided to play along, because the longer I was there the longer I had to stay on his payroll and keep collecting salary. \n\nTHE HEARING \n\nThey originally tried to schedule the hearing immediately (against the law, hearings require giving the employee a minimum of 24 hours to prepare), I told them to bite me. They tried to schedule for the next morning (still illegal), I told them to get bent. Finally agreed for the morning after. Fuckup 1: My direct manager (the CEO) wasn't present in the hearing. Fuckup 2: The HR lady who held the hearing belonged to another company owned by the CEO, but held at arm's length (legal term?) from my company. She was not eligible to hold the hearing. Fuckup 3: The dismissal needs to have at least 2 people from the company's side - the direct manager (who was not present) and a witness to the meeting to record and create a written record/protocol of the meeting. I was met only by the HR lady. Fuckups 4 & 5: No recording or protocol was taken of the meeting, and I was not provided a protocol of the meeting to sign and verify authenticity (this is probably the biggest fuckup on their part). \n\nThe hearing went as expected, the HR lady really had no idea why I was there (in two years never had any disciplinary issues), and I read out a prepared statement outlining the CEO's illegal and verbally and almost physically violent behavior. I told them that by law I considered myself to have been illegally terminated and was at the hearing to hear what they had to say for themselves, not to defend my own actions. \n\nA few hours after the hearing I received an email saying they were terminating my employment. This is Fuckup 6: It shows they did not give me a fair hearing and had determined the outcome ahead of time. I took all of this and went straight to my lawyer, who (at least in my telling of this story) lit up with a nasty grin on his face. He was working commission and he said their actions during the hearing pretty much quadrupled the amount he was now going to demand from them. He immediately prepared everything, with all the legal statutes backing him up, and sent it off to the CEO. \n\n<Insert SpongeBob Three Months Later> \n\nTHE FALLOUT \n\nWe never made it to court, but only because they realized I had them over a barrel and going to court meant the judge could potentially award me with even MORE than what I was asking for. I was eventually paid out for the entire 30-days notification period they were required by law to give me (without having worked a day during that period), and all my vacation and sick days were paid out at 100% (another month's salary right there). They agreed to pay me one year's salary, at pre-tax rates, in order to keep this out of court. They even covered my attorney's fees! Finally, CEO was prohibited from giving me a negative review if called for a reference about me. In turn, I agreed to not mention the lawsuit to any potential employees of the company (I checked with my lawyer who went over this post, it's OK), and to not take them to court now or in the future. For the money I got, it was worth it. \n\nFollowing this entire fiasco, two other people also left, essentially shutting down their departments as well. They left and weren't fired, so things went smoothly for them. \n\nIt took CEO 2.5 months to find a replacement for me, and since I was a one-man department, nearly all of the activity (aside from tasks I had automated to execute before the blowup) ceased, including at least one event with one of the world's largest tech companies. Being that my field is a specialized one, I'm still in touch with many of my vendors, and they all tell me my replacement is nowhere near up to the task, which feels good on a professional level, but on a personal level, I shudder to think how she is dealing with CEO. \n\nMy new position is very similar to my old one, but I'm now making nearly double what I made (pre-tax). \n\ntl;dr, the second - living in a country with employee's rights is awesome, CEO had to pay out my fair share and another 12 months' salary to stay out of court, I found a job doing the same exact thing at almost double the salary. Life is fairly good, all things considered.",

            "A few years ago I had an okay job that I was planning to stay at for a while, when my boss announced that he was leaving. In my field (computer programming) this is a bad thing and usually means \"the company will hire an idiot and the department will go to hell.\" All of my coworkers told me that if I took the job, they'd stay. I was qualified for the job, as I'd had it before at other companies, so I thought about it and decided I'd take it - IF they compensated me for it. I did my research and found out that it \\*should\\* come with a $35,000 (or more) raise. \n\nSo I applied for the job, interviewed, and at the final interview they asked me what I wanted to earn. I presented my research, showing that I should be getting a raise of about $35k if I got the job. \n\nThe next day they offered me the job... with a $6k raise. So I turned it down. This was shocking to the boss who offered it to me, his jaw actually dropped. I said \"no thank you,\" and turned to leave. He said \"what are you doing?\" I said \"I'm going back to my desk to do my job. I'm still a senior programmer, I've got work to do. I want things to be in good order for the new manager when you hire one.\" And I went back to my desk.\n\nI had a new offer with a $35k raise on my desk within the hour.",

Eventually I was told I couldn\u2019t have overtime and I brought up just how much work I actually had. \n\nTheir response? Manage your time better, you can do it - you\u2019re the best! I inquired about being a supervisor since I had already been managing the largest team in the region for months, why not just promote me and hire another adjuster? Nope, they got some jackwagon off the street that knew NOTHING about the job and didn\u2019t care to know. Instead I got written up for messing up paperwork I was never trained on because it was supervisor level responsibility and I had been filling in for months.\n\nI left my company car and all my gear at a partner shop. Years later I\u2019m still salty about that whole situation. Not a word of gratitude for the work just a write-up for something that wasn\u2019t in my job description.

It was eventually offered to me, along with the raise ... \"to be started soon.\" But soon never arrived. Meanwhile, they made no moves to replace my position, and shit got super busy. So while I was balls to the wall on my current position, still waiting on official word of my new job description, word came down that they were revoking the promotion because I had not shown them satisfactory performance *on the job I did not yet have.* Fast forward a few months, and the position has completely disappeared, with all its duties spread to my coworker and I, and zero raises. He left, and I inherited his, mine, and supervisor duties. I asked them to reevaluate my salary and job description. They stalled, I put in my notice. And they had the audacity to ask me \"Can you stay long enough to train your replacement?\" I laughed and reminded them that they needed to hire 3 replacements, which would take 3 - 6 months to find, hire and train. \n\nIt's going to cost them at least 10x as much to replace me vs the raise I requested to keep me.

They ended up bringing in the store managers sister to do it and still had me doing her duties and I said fuck it I\u2019m gone. Now I\u2019m currently in another situation where I was offered a promotion after being there two weeks and because I was new the other staff retaliated and rioted till they said nvm forget it then it\u2019s too much drama and I\u2019m fucking livid, can\u2019t seem to get out of this cycle of shitty job bullshit.",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone. Long time lurker, first time poster. This MC comes from my time working at a bank, in their contact centre. I literally have hundreds of stories about that place and its customer\u2019s, but today I\u2019d like to share a story that has always bought a smile to many a suffering customer service co-worker\u2019s face about the time we got one back for the good guys. \n\nBackstory: I was employed as Customer Service Officer. I\u2019d been with the bank for about 18 months at this point, mostly working afternoon shifts, but recently the bank had moved to a 24 hour customer service model, so while most of the bank would be closed (Head office, Complaints, Credit etc) \u2014 we were still open. \n\nCast: Me, Night Manager, Customer, Head of Customer Relations and Retentions\n\nLet me set the scene: ~10pm, midweek, fluorescent lights flicker overhead, the call board empty and I\u2019m literally counting the seconds left in my shift, ready to go home.\n\n*phone call pops onto my screen*\n\nI think \u2018Shit! I always get a call just before I finish\u2019\n\nMe (mustering my best customer service voice): \u201cHi, thanks for calling (bank), you\u2019re speaking with u/Absurd-n-Nihilistic, how can I help you?\u201d\n\nI hear nothing but dead air, so I start to repeat myself. \n\n\u201cHi, you\u2019re speaking wi\u2014\u201c\n\nWhen I hear the tone of voice and words every contact centre worker has heard at some point. It just lets you know you\u2019re in for a great call (not!). \n\nCustomer: *loud sigh* \u201cYes! I\u2019m here! God, what takes YOU people so long to answer?! What are you doing?\u201d\n\nAs noted before, there was no calls on the board, this customer didn\u2019t wait in queue. He would have dialled, gone through to the IVR to enter his customer number and pin before being put through to me. Max 60 seconds. \n\nMe (trying to not provoke any further and get this customer off the phone as quickly as I can so I can go home)\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry about that. Our system doesn\u2019t show a queue, but I\u2019m sorry that you had to wait. What can I do for you this evening?\u201d\n\nCustomer seems to settle down and starts explaining that the reason for the call was the interest charges on the most recent credit card bill. He was sure they were a mistake because \u201cI always pay my bills on time\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t like paying you blood suckers anymore than I have to\u201d. Charming, I know. So I place him on hold to look at his account. I started looking at the payment history, when payments were due/received, what the balances were etc. Then, I quickly looked at the customer\u2019s interaction notes. This is where the bank records any contact with the customer as well as, any fee waivers, special interest rates etc. and I see an interesting series of notes from colleagues of mine stating things like \u201ccustomer advised interest was charged due to full payment not received by due date. Customer threatened to close all accounts with bank. Manager approved interest waiver\u201d. Notes like this went on for months, until there was a note from the head of customer relations and retentions stating \u201cif customer threatens to close accounts to seek waiver of fees, interest or other charges, please process immediately. No retention authorised\u201d\n\nI was a bit shocked because usually the bank would do a lot to keep existing customers, like they told us in training, \u2018it\u2019s cheaper to keep a customer, than it\u2019s to gain a new one\u2019. So I call over my night manager to read the notes and give him a heads up I\u2019ve got a feeling the customer is going to be demanding another interest waiver. My cool night manager said \u201cwell if he does, do what the note says\u201d. \n\nTotal hold time: maybe 2 minutes. \n\nI take the customer off hold and thank him for waiting. \n\nCustomer: \u201cAbout time! My time is very valuable, you know. So have you fixed it yet?\u201d\n\nI start explaining that the interest charges are valid because he didn\u2019t pay off his balance before the due date. \n\nHe goes ballistic!\n\nHe starts calling me every conceivable name under the sun and mid sentence stops, he plays it like he\u2019s just had an idea \u201cfine. If the interest charges are valid, I\u2019m going to close my accounts. I want to close my accounts with you now!\u201d\n\nAt this point I\u2019m excited about putting him in his place but I also want to cover my ass, so I ask:\n\nMe: \u201cSo, just to be certain. You are instructing me to close all of your accounts with us, including your credit card, savings account and transactional account?\u201d\n\nCustomer: \u201cAre you stupid? That\u2019s what I said!\u201d\n\nLady\u2019s and Gentlemen: We got him!\n\nMe (Grinning my ass off): \u201cOkay no problems. I\u2019ll just place you on hold to do that for you.\u201d\n\nI hit the hold button fast just as I heard him say  \u201cno I\u2014\u201c\n\nWith my night manager\u2019s help we close his accounts. His savings account was a term deposit so by breaking the term early he had to pay an early access fee of 10% of the balance. We used the money in his transactional account to cover the outstanding balance in his credit card (including the interest) and sent a request for a cheque to be issued for the remaining money. \n\nI took the customer off hold. \n\nMe: \u201cagain thank you for your patience. As requested your accounts are now closed. Was there anything else I can help with tonight?\u201d\n\nIf I thought the customer went ballistic before, oh boy! There was talk of suing the bank, suing me, suing my night manager, suing head of customer relations and retentions. That we were guilty of discrimination. That I didn\u2019t have the authority to do what I did. He\u2019s going to call the police. We\u2019re thieves. Some other ways of telling me how useless I am and how I can kill myself. You get the picture. \n\nMe (still smiling because I know I nor anyone else at my bank will have to deal with this asshole again): \u201csir I understand you are upset. However, on a recorded phone call you instructed me to close your accounts. I\u2019ve complied with your wishes. As there is nothing else for us to speak about tonight. Thank you for calling (bank) have a good night!\u201d And hung up on him before he could say another word. \n\nMy night manager created a incident report and sent it to head of customer relations and retentions with an attached a copy of the call recording. I later found out head of customer relations and retentions sent the customer a letter telling him he was banned from our bank for life due to the \u201cvile and disgusting\u201d way he had spoken to me! We would never do business with him ever again and if he called or visited a branch, we would be the ones calling the police. \n\nDo you want to know what the total interest charges were that started all this? ~$30. \n\nHis term deposit had $20,000 in it. He cost himself $2000 in early exit fees because he thought he could bully his way out of ~$30 in interest.\n\nEdit: Wow! Thank you to everyone, the response has been amazing. My god! Thank you for the Gold and Silver! I just wanted to blanket answer some questions/assumptions made in the comments. \n\n1. I\u2019m Australian, not American. Our banking laws/code of practice/terminology are a bit different. \n2. Normally no, I wouldn\u2019t close an account or a suite of accounts. That\u2019s something customer relations and retentions would do, but it was outside of their hours of operation and  with the note from the head of the department stating not to retain the customer, I was authorised in the situation to close the accounts. I needed my manager to approve the closures with his RSA passkey. \n3. If you close an account with any bank and you owe the bank money best believe, if you have another account with money in it with the same bank, you have authorised them to use those funds to clear your debt. Check your terms and conditions. \n4. I can\u2019t remember why the exit fees on the term deposit came out of the principal balance rather than the interest earned. I do remember if the bank created a tailored term deposit for a customer (usually an unusual length of term, higher interest rate or pays interest before term) it can come with added conditions from the bank. I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s what happened in this case. \n5. I say \u201clong time lurker\u201d because I\u2019ve read Reddit stories for years without an account and finally created one to contribute instead of just consume. \n6. I\u2019ve removed a lot of the acronyms seeing as it annoys sooo many of you. \n7. Thank you everyone for suggesting I should cross post this to other subreddits.",

            "To everyone questioning this story's validity, you all bring up good points. However, from someone who spent over 10 years in the branches in the United States, I can tell you that this story sounds a lot more legit than you believe:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) Regarding that CD penalty rate: I don't know much about Australian term deposits, but with US Certificates of Deposit, that's not quite as crazy as you'd think. It IS a bit high for American standards, but the concept behind it is the same. It depends on the Annual Percentage Yield and the term. A 5 year CD, for example, might have something like 3 years' interest as a penalty. The interest is forfeited and then the principal is eaten into to cover the rest. For those saying that CDs in the United States are guaranteed and that you would only forfeit interest, that is simply not true.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) Regaring disclosures and dissent: This one is a bit of a grey area. People are saying that the customer in this story has grounds to sue the bank because the employee never read the disclosures regarding fees and because the employee clearly heard the customer withdraw consent for the accounts to be closed. And this skepticism is not unfounded.\n\nHowever, the customer's standing to sue, as far as I can tell, may not be as strong as everyone imagines.   First, consent. On a recorded line, assuming the OP's story is true, the customer would have given explicit instructions and authorization for the representative to close all accounts. And not just once, but on a minimum of two separate occasions. A \"no I--\" may not simply be enough to override this, especially if the employee can maintain that he didn't catch the customer saying that. Especially if the customer is using a ton of extraneous verbiage in his answers (when the OP confirmed the customer's instructions to close the accounts, the customer's reply was  \u201cAre you stupid? That\u2019s what I said!\u201d. It's not unreasonable for the employee and the bank to argue that they were legitimately unaware that the customer was withdrawing his consent).\n\nAs far as disclosures go, that's a tough one. Disclosures are supposed to be read in situations regarding account closures, and that apparently wasn't done here. That said--and I'm no lawyer--the bank might be able to make the argument that it would have been improper for the employee to have engaged the customer further given the intense verbal abuse he was enduring. Between that and the multiple instructions from the customer to close the accounts, and it could fairly reasonably be argued that this customer understood and accepted all risks and consequences of the closures. If I were a judge or jury in a case like this, I would accept this line of reasoning from the bank as reasonable.\n\nAnd ultimately, it may not have mattered. Given the manner in which the customer was allegedly abusing a bank employee, virtually every bank in America would fully close these accounts and permanently end the customer relationship. Trust me, I've witnessed this personally. If you curse out an employee, most managers WILL have all your accounts closed. Yes, branch managers do have that authority, and I imagine the call center managers do too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo all in all, is this a true story? No idea, I wasn't there. But it sounds plausible enough and, more importantly, it's cathartic. So enjoy!\n\nI left my own story after reading this.

            "This reminds me of when I closed my internet service account. \n\nI called because my building had a special deal posted if paid for the whole year up front, and I\u2019d been vaguely annoyed for a while that my sister was paying less than me from the same ISP for better service. I thought I\u2019d see if they could give me the posted deal on a month-to-month basis (we rent and weren\u2019t sure at the time if we\u2019d be here another year). \n\nBut my plan had also just jumped up after another promo rate ended and they had told me I could call and renew the rate I already had after 6 months, so I figured if all else failed, no problem, I would just do that. \n\nI had a friendly chat with the customer service rep and he said he couldn\u2019t do the special deal at all by himself because it\u2019s not one of their regular ones, so he\u2019d transfer me to a customer retention rep. No problem. \n\nQueue customer retention rep. He can\u2019t do what I was hoping for so I ask if I can renew my current plan instead as I\u2019f been promised. \n\nBut he has a special deal for me: instead of paying $35 per month like I have been, he\u2019s authorized to offer me 6 months for only $246! Great savings according to him! He actually quoted me some random amount of savings too, like \u201cyou\u2019ll save $48\u201d or something. This was years ago and I don\u2019t remember his exact phrasing (or the exact values, these are all examples) but he was telling me an outright lie. \n\nI confirmed the monthly amount with him, then basically said \u201cyou\u2019re telling me that your $41/mo plan is cheaper than my $35/mo plan.\u201d \n\nI was so angry he would lie outright in an attempt to trick me into a more expensive plan that I closed my account on the spot. \n\nThe part that reminded me was OP\u2019s \u201cjust to confirm, you\u2019d like to close all your accounts...\u201d \n\nThis guy put me on hold for nearly 40 minutes. I threw it on speakerphone in the background, fully aware he was doing it out of spite. Doesn\u2019t matter, I found a better ISP that doesn't force me to call in every six months for a decent rate, so I won.",
            "Something I don't get about his thinking:  This guy is clearly well-off, and also in the habit of paying his credit card bills late every month, then calling to get the interest fees waived.  What could he possibly be doing with his money in the extra few days he gets that's worth the cost to him in time of calling to get the fees waived?",

            "I had the same job for a large national bank here in america.\n\nIt was a horrible job, but it did have its perks. It beat standing over a hot grill during the hottest parts of summer.\n\nWe were rarely slow enough where we had no calls, but our bank was smart. But also a bit evil. When you are a business lowering costs is always important, in conjuction with products and good customer service, but sometimes there are people who call their bank every day, or every 3 days, all the time every week. We were the frequent callers center, so we spoke with the people who knew what to say because theyve been saying it several times a week forever, it was hard emotionally to know there wasnt much i could do during hard circumstances, i mean a bank wont just give you money if they dont think they will get it back. But we would have all kinds of Notes from the other departments before they would get to us.\n\nThere was a guy that kept calling and got our center, in one day he called us 8 times, and by the last time one of our site managers took the call after the first escalation and told the guy to stop calling, and that if he calls one more time about x problem that he would personally close out the accounts and send the check.\n\nA few differences in american banking. When you close your accounts you dont have to pay off your debts like a credit card immediately, i mean, i guess its the banks right to do so, but generally from a customer service stand point we would ask, but i believe legally they have to at least get their bill before being required to pay the unbilled portion, but we would just submit the closure and the customer can work it out.\n\nNow if it was a regular checking account most banks have their terms and conditions and inside is what is called the right to offset, and that is where if a savings or checking account has a shared owner the money is considered equal for each owner, and say if your spouse has a negative balance checking or savings account, and a shared account has money in it, the bank can and will transfer the money over to cover the negative balance from the shared account, now if the accounts are seperately owned they cannot. And the bank will move the money before they tell you they are moving the money, most of the time the bank will have already tried to let you know.\n\nI would always feel bad for the legal orders that get placed. Took between 3-5 days after you squared away with whatever govt agency got a judge to screw you, to then get your money released. I mean one big part of bank indoctrination is the brainwashing that it is essentially these peoples fault, but in some ways everyone is being ground and chewed through the machine that was built to keep us poor and them rich why give the billion dollar bank the benefit of the doubt that mayne they do charge too many fees.",
