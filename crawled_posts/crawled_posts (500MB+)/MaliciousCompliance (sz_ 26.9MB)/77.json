        "selftext": "So once upon a time I was living in a (not legal) basement apartment of an old Hungarian woman's house. I was poor, the place was cheaper than what was around, so I took it. \n\n\nHow bad could it be?\n\n\nShe. Was. Horrific. \n\n\nAt first she was an okay landlady, but then things started to turn. First I noticed that things were, off when I got home from work. Ever get that feeling someone was in your room? That. \n\nSo I asked her if she'd been in there and she denied it. Then I set up a camera and caught her on camera. Asked her again and she denied it, saying she's never go in my apartment without telling me. Then I showed her the video and she got mad at ME. \n\nI worked nights. One time she came in during the day time and I was there. In bed, naked under the sheets. I woke up when she came in and asked if I could help her, she said no and left. \n\nAfter that she would call me \"lazy boy\" when she saw me, assuming I didn't work since it was at night. \n\nThings kept getting worse. She'd sometimes shut off the water when she thought I was using too much or when I refused to share my wifi password with her other tenant. \n\nFinally, one night I had some friends over for a birthday. There was six of us total, it was around 11pm and trust me when I say, we were not being loud at all. Literally just hanging around the coffee table eating cheesecake talking and laughing. \n\nShe came into my apartment and started yelling that I was having a loud party with too many people in the middle of the night! She actually came and grabbed my shirt telling me everyone had to leave. \n\n\nOh hell no. That was it. \n\n\nSo I pushed her off of me and the police were called. \n\nThat Monday, she left a really poorly written eviction notice on my door.. seriously, hand written. Telling me to be out by Saturday by midnight. \n\nHere's the MC.\n\n\nBy 11:59pm that Saturday, I had all my stuff in the U-haul. My friends and I were just working on bagging up the trash and other stuff for the dump, when she came in and yelled at me that it was past midnight. \n\nNo problem. I got up, and left. Leaving a huge pile of junk in the bedroom and storage room. Easily 2 pickup trucks worth of crap I wasn't taking. \n\nShe actually called my father, who was my emergency contact on my application to tell me it cost her $400 to haul it all away and that I owed her money. He blocked the number. \n\n\nTHE END\n\nBonus story\n\nShe was showing the apartment when I was still living there. She didn't tell me. So when she lead two strangers in the daytime, waking me up again, I stood up. Fully naked, full staffed and said I wouldn't rent from her if it were the last apartment in town. The couple quickly left.",

            "I went to see an apartment with a friend. The tenant was still there and it was awkward as hell. The tenant and this lady did not seem to like each other. We took a brief tour and on my way out of the door the tenant leaned closer to me, looked me right in the eye, and whispered, 'She's crazy.' \n\nThat's all I needed to hear. We didn't pursue the apartment and I probably owe that tenant a huge thank you.",
            "IMHO; She's been collecting money on the rent without reporting it as income. City and federal authorities would like that information. Could be considered a public service to put a stop to that, and her renting to the next victim.:)\n\nBonus is, You may just also get all your rent back.",
            "I had a very similar experience in my last place. I had just gotten hired in the area after college and didn\u2019t want to sign a long term lease to an apartment yet. So I signed a 6 month lease to rent a room in a condo. I was one of 4 dudes, all engineers in automotive, and we all got along great. Seriously a great bunch of dudes. \n\nThe landlady was an absolute raging control freak though. This condo was actually her home she raised her children in, so she was still psychotically attached to it. She made unreadable demands nonstop. Stuff like telling us to spend 3 hours a night cleaning, or how to arrange our silverware. \n\nRight before I moved out, she actually had the basement door removed because \u201copening and closing it caused enough  wind to blow out the furnace pilot light\u201d. The furnace was about a good 60 feet from the door and separated by two walls. \n\nI could go on all day about her shit.  But when I moved out I filed a complaint with the city hall. This city code requires all rented rooms have an egress point in case of emergency, and half sized basement windows don\u2019t count. The city actually followed up and fined her. I also imagine her rental insurance premium now sky rocketed. \n\nI really hope it fucked her entire world up, but but for the petty nonsense she did to me. She was a certified predator. All the other tenants were non-citizen Indian guys working here in a visa. They had been long term tenants and she had been doing this shit to them for years. She threatened them \u201ccriminal court\u201d to force them to comply with shit like how to clean toilets, simply because she knew they were scared about losing their visas. I\u2019m sure she picked her tenants specifically for this reason, and according to her words she accepted me as a resident \u201cbecause I made so much more money than they rest of the guys\u201d. She also went by Karen. \n\nKaren if you are reading this, I hope your life sucks and your daughter still refuses to go to college for what you want. \n\n\u2026I also intentionally left a huge pile of trash for her to clean up :)",

            "I also rented an unsanctioned basement apt from a selfish controlling woman. After staying with her for a year she announced she would have the heat fixed because it looked like I was staying a while. The apartment was just warm enough to  prevent hypothermia because the rest of the house was heated, but I probably survived only because I\u2019m fat. I assumed the heat just didn\u2019t work well, not that it was completely broken. She was obnoxious about the rent like paying in afternoon was an outrage and when she traveled once she made me pay rent early.\n\nOnce, when I was the sickest of my life I put out trash and left the outer door ajar. She burst in to scream at me while I lay in bed and I apologized profusely or as much as I could  being so ill. When I was upright for a short time I decided to crawl into a pharmacy for some OTC meds. She locked me out in retaliation (the outer door for which I had not been given a key.) I tried banging and ringing the front door and could see her smug poker face watching tv a few feet away, no response. I was so sick and I went to the police, it was very late at night. I death coughed so uncontrollably I couldn\u2019t hold urine and stood there shaking while the cops called her about access to my place. I could hear them saying, \u201cdo you REALy feel safe having THIS women in your house?\u201d She told them she did not lock the door. It was miraculously open when I tried again. Months later when I moved out (notice given- all legit,) she turned out the lights to my entrance through the back yard. It was motion sensitive, so again, I know it was intentional. This, because she was upset I didn\u2019t complete my move during daylight. \n\nI just have to mention I took this women to the doctors more than once and to Kmart on demand. I also cleaned up a shit ton of shit dung when she took her medicine incorrectly and screamed for my help.\n\nBoth her children where in DC in the military. I can imagine this woman who didn\u2019t believe in excuses; not illness, not unfortunate events, not coincidence, not catastrophic weather was the perfect person to prepare men for military discipline.\n\nApologies for postal length.\n\nSummary: Rented from a sanctimonious, ungrateful, sneeky senior.",

        "selftext": "I was working for a child care center while I was in college. We staggered staff in and staggered them out so that we were always fully staffed when all the kids were there and they all had various arrival and leaving times. So staff could be scheduled to arrive anytime between 7:30am and 2pm. \n\nI worked M-F 8:30-4:30. Even though my schedule was fairly permanent, I would check the schedule that got sent out every Sunday evening (it would always get sent between 6 and 9 pm and it would be for that current week so we had less than 24 hours notice for our weekly schedule, a hot mess express if you ask me but I\u2019m not in charge and my schedule is set so I don\u2019t raise too much hell about it). \n\n\nOne week I get the schedule and it says that my arrival time is 9am instead of my usual 8:30 for the entire week. I figure they\u2019re just trying to make minor cuts and they really like having everyone under the full time threshold so I just assumed they were barely  cutting my hours so they could get away with it. No big deal, but I knew that most of the kids arrived at 9 so I would need more time to set up. I get there at 8:45 on Monday and set up quickly and go about my day, I do a little prep Monday night so I don\u2019t have as much to prep In the morning. So on Tuesday I get there at 8:55 clock in and begin my day. \n\n\nMy week goes on like that with me prepping in the evening and getting there at 8:55 until Thursday when my boss calls me into the office and reprimands me for my \u201ctardiness.\u201d I tell her the schedule tells me that my arrival time is 9 so I\u2019m actually arriving early everyday. She says that the schedule says 9 just to indicate that you are the morning shift but if you\u2019re scheduled for classroom time, you need to arrive at 8:30 regardless of what the schedule says so you have time to set up the classroom. I don\u2019t agree with this at all and it\u2019s obviously not true because not everyone arrives at 8:30 anyway, there has to be more distinction than just morning crew versus afternoon crew on the schedule. But she admits that she\u2019s \u201cpartially to blame for the mixup\u201d and doesn\u2019t turn it into a formal write up. \n\n\nI start arriving at 8:30 every morning (just like I had been before the week in question, I\u2019m not a late person). One week I was going to be scheduled for the 1-6:30 shift because another coworker needed to switch with me and we had both agreed to this. So the schedule comes out and says my arrival time is 1pm. I arrive at exactly 8:30, clock in, and sit my pretty butt in the office chair, and wait. Well eventually my boss notices that I\u2019m just hanging out in the office and asks what I\u2019m doing. I say \u201cwell I was told to arrive promptly at 8:30 no matter what the schedule says, so here I am.\u201d She says \u201cwe don\u2019t need you here for the morning so you can clock out and come back when your shift begins.\u201d Um nope. I say \u201cyou can find a task for me to do until my shift at 1 starts or I can sit here, but I\u2019m staying clocked in. You were the one that said that I have to be here at 8:30 no matter what. I\u2019m just following your instructions.\u201d \n\nI had to deep clean the entire school until my shift actually started, but it was so worth it because I still got paid for the whole day and my boss had to admit to me that she was full of it.

He handles a lot of complaints regarding servers and general IT stuff. For the past three years he has worked overtime for free. (It's difficult to say no to family). He answers his personal phone and has to drive long distances to fix problems clients are having, sometimes at 10 at night. \n\nRecently, we've been trying to save money to make a life together. So my bf decided to ask the boss to finally get paid for all the overtime hours he will be working from now on. The boss is livid. He states that he will not pay my bf overtime money and he shouldn't ask again and that he should be grateful for his job. He concludes by saying that there is NO SUCH THING AS OVERTIME IN THIS BUSINESS!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan you see where the malicious compliance comes in yet? ;)\n\nSo my bf now does not answer any calls after 5 or before 8. The boss now has to take all those calls and drive the ridiculous distances himself. BF gets called in and is asked why he isn't picking up his phone because the clients are getting really upset at him.  Bf's answer \"I'm sorry, but you said.... there is no such thing as overtime\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've never been more proud!! ",

I burnt out after a few years. Between the constant on call and underwhelming salary, its a no brainer that I don't work there anymore.

            "Having worked for an uncle myself in a similar field, I can attest to this scenario. However, my malicious compliance was of a different variety. You see, I had a lot of company data on my personal laptop (company desktop was available to me at the office, but it was old and slow, and I had an i7 so you better believe I used my own computer). I made sure the raw data was on my laptop and only the compiled versions of information were sent to the office. This included updated stock & price lists, inventory management files, price calculation algorithms, compilations of company transaction history for the new EMS (Enterprise Management Software) that I was in-charge of implementing, the like.   \n\n\nNow after 8 months of working for him, I had enough of the 3-5 hours staying back at the office compiling data in Excel, and sometimes just staying back to drive home \\*even though he used to come to office in his car\\*. One day I went up to him, told him I'm leaving the gig because it's not fulfilling at all, and I'd rather pursue prospects elsewhere. I had a few interviews lined up and was feeling confident. He seemed unusually calm and with a stern face said the uncle equivalent of 'all good mate, catch you on the flip side'.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe above conversation took place in May. I get May's pay in June. Imagine my surprise in the first week of June when I got 60% of my usual pay, because \"You're leaving the office abruptly and in a mess. We need to employ someone else and train them to take over your position. That's where the rest of your pay will go.\" Bear in mind, before I joined, this position at the office didn't exist. I only joined because the job market is terrible out here and I wanted some experience of how a company works. Being the nephew of the GM, I figured I'd get an inside view. This was also NEVER MEANT TO BE A PERMANENT GIG. And now, my pay gets cut due to the costs of employing someone else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I just stopped working on the worksheet I was compiling at that time (oh yes, I was still being given assignments), and with all the raw data said fine, don't pay me, you don't get your data. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's been 10 months, me and my uncle don't speak anymore. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\#DontWorkWithFamily\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR : Work for uncle temporarily for experience. Decide to leave coz excessive unpaid overtime. Last month of working, pay is cut due to costs of hiring a replacement. I take all raw data of the company with me, leaving new guy to start over in nearly all aspects.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. : Sorry if the formatting sucks, first time sharing anything, and I don't know how you guys construct such well-worded, perfect flow anecdotes.  \n",
            "As somebody else in IT that deals with client servers, there absolutely is such a thing as overtime in his business. If he's been there for a year or two, he should get out and find himself a real company to work for. Family or not, that's a shitty boss, and a sign of a company that barely scrapes by money-wise.\n\nI worked for a small company once in this field that was great because it was super low-stress but also only kind of paid okay. The CEO acted like he was a millionaire, showing up at random times in the day in his tennis clothes with racket in hand. But he also struggled to pay our wages on time. Eventually it got worse and he didn't pay my last two weeks at all before the company closed up shop without notice. I'd talk to him about getting out of that company.",

            "I was going to say that there's nothing worse that working for family...\n\nThe I remembered a friend who worked for family who did really well.\n\nSo I'll re-state it as \"there's nothing worse than working for family that treat your time as nothing else but a way to make money\"\n\nLet me give you my story.\n\nI was born to be a machinist. My dad owned an engineering company that I ALWAYS wanted to work at. It helped that I'd been working there since I was 9 ish. Drilling PCB holders, or stamping a different pcb holder on a fly press.\n\nI loved that he wanted me there. \n\nI was of course supposed to be paid a fiver a week, but I never saw it. I didn't care, my dad saw me as someone worthwhile, so I was happy.\n\nI get my gf pregnant, I'm not happy, so I leave working for him.\n\nSeveral months later, I've been doing a HND (EITB based) in college which included CNC programming, so he comes to my flat and says \"I've got a job on, he shows me the drawings and asks if I could program his Bridgeport Series 1 CNC mill (basicly a manual mill with HUGE control boxes). \n\nI saw it, proper 3d milling, but on a limited machine. Saw I could program it, said \"yeah, i can do that\"\n\nhe asked how long it'd take to produce 100 pieces, I said about a week. He offered \u00a33 piece work. I did it in 4 days.\n\nTurns out the material was supplied by the customer, all he had to pay was electricity (and of course al the normal things for a business like public liability insurance, but forget those for now (he already owned the buildings))\n\nA few years later, I was in the office of that particular customer and the manager I was trying to get a cheque off for something else asked me if I'd programmed a particular job. Well yes I sure did. \"Man, that was beautiful, we didn't think your dad's place could pull it off.\". Through further talking I found out that he had supplied them to the customer for \u00a3296 each. \n\nHe paid me \u00a33 each.\n\nI'm sure he remembers this as the time he got a great deal. I remember that time as when he lost my trust. OK, so he earned \u00a330k ish. I'm sure he was made up about it. However, I've learned that my dad has one objective in life, and that's to have more. It doesn't matter so much where it comes from, as long as it's his, and he doesn't share.\n\nShit thing to learn, but I learned it and I promised to make sure my kids didn't learn the same lesson.",

I had actually been planning to become a Catholic priest (and therefore to be celibate) when I was in high school, so my mother saw my first girlfriend as having ruined my life's plan when we first got together. Now naturally, my girlfriend and I wanted to spend as much time together as possible at that early stage of our relationship, but my mother did everything in her power to try to limit this. As such, one day I asked if it was alright for my girlfriend to come over to our house, but my mother said \"no, not today\". I was not particularly happy about this, especially because it was so obvious she was just being vindictive and had no good reason as to why. So I pressed her about it and eventually, after much discussion, she agreed that my girlfriend \"could come over tomorrow, but not today\". Again, this was vindictive because she knew that neither of us had as much free time the next day as we did on the day in question, so it would have meant way less time together for us. Nevertheless, I agreed to my mother's offer. \n\nSo right on the stroke of midnight, my girlfriend arrived at my house and I brought her inside. Immediately my mother called me away into the kitchen and started getting very intensely angry that I hadn't done as I was told because she said that she couldn't come over until tomorrow...to which I replied while gesturing to the clock \"but mother, it *is* tomorrow.\"",

        "selftext": "I run an anime/geek store and we are really lenient with pre-orders. We used to not require a deposit to make an order, and in case you needed more time to pick-up an item, all you had to do was ask. We could also hold the items for as long as needed in our storage if you wanted to gather a lot of items so you could save on trips/shipping.\n\nBack on February, Funko released a special edition [Vinyl POP of Naruto Hokage](https://gameskeysaustralia.com/image/cache/catalog/data/2020/Funko/AA47097-500x500.png). This one in particular had a 1 in 6 CHASE variant that ended reaching up [to a resale value of $130](https://www.hobbydb.com/marketplaces/poppriceguide/catalog_items/naruto-hokage-glow-in-the-dark). But the way I do pre-orders is that, if you order 6 of the same piece, you are guaranteed a chase. But if you only order 1, you still get a 1 in 6 chance of getting the chase, I just mix them up in random boxes and do a public stream raffle on social media, so everyone knows who won the chase, and I get good publicity that way\n\nA client ordered just one and left $5 as deposit, the piece was $15. This particular client won the riffle (Along several other clients), but he wasn't that interested in picking it up or paying for the rest of it. I send him a message letting him know that he had won the special variant and had a week to pay it or he will lose his pre-order. At first he was angry because he wanted the normal version, no this \"yellow thing\", but we explained we could change it if he wanted but that this one was far more valuable. He said he asked his son and his son wanted it anyway, but asked for more time to pay, so we gave him one more week. Then he asked for another week. And another.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen we had to close the store for a time for, you know, 2020 reasons,, and we told him we had to close but we could still schedule an appointment to give him his item or wait until the worst passed. He never answered.\n\nEventually we were able to re-open the store with regulations in place and send him another message telling him we can save it for as long as needed in this strange times. He still didn't answer the messages, but at this point he arrived at the store and demanded for his money back, citing how we were on the middle of what was going on (Fair) and he couldn't waste money on frivolous plastic (Also fair). I asked him if he was sure, and even showed him the price the figure was selling for (at that point in time the chase figure was selling closer to $150, and he just had to pay retail price, so about $10 more for it).\n\nHe said he was sure I had made up the numbers, that he had ordered the figure for his son but he didn't deserve it (harsh) and just wanted, no, demanded his money back.\n\nI just said \"Fine, I'll give you your money back. Also, I'll just put this figure out for sale.\" He just said \"whatever, just give me my money\" I made a point to grab a post-it note (That I use to put prices to not damage the box), write in big black letters \"$90 bucks, last one\", and put it on the glass window that leads to the street. I could see him turn his eyes while I did this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile my employee was giving him his 5 bucks back and giving him a receipt, a young man knocked the door, I gave him some cleaning goo, checked his temperature and let him in. He immediately asked to buy the Naruto CHASE figure. The angry man eyes went wide open over his mask as I picked the POP and guided the young man to the desk, where he handed me the bills one by one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe angry man stood there shocked as the younger man was gushing about how hard to get that figure was and how he was getting it for half the price other places where asking, and in such perfect condition too. I couldn't have had a better reaction even if I paid him for it, lol. The young man completed his purchase and leaved as fast as he came. The angry man looked at me, almost as if accusing me of taking advantage of him.\n\nI just said: \"Well, you got your money back, I'm happy you are happy, if you need anything else please let me know, and stay safe out there.\"\n\nThe man just didn't have much else to say and left. Kind of a small and silly thing to feel good about, but 2020 hit us so hard that any unexpected profit was cause for celebration, so we celebrated that good sale with some (instant) ramen, Naruto style.\n\nTL:DR- Man ordered a toy, got lucky and got the rare valuable variant, refuses to buy it even when told of its value, demanded money back, as he is given his money back he gets to see it sell for 6 times what he was going to pay.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the kind words! My store is in M\u00e9xico and I really appreciate everyone asking me how to support it, I didn't mean to self-promote and I'm not 100% if it's against the rules, so I won't, lol, and also I can't ship to the US right now due to the situation (I'm not american so I can't cross the border since I'm not essential, also I'm trying to go out as little as possible). I want to answer all of you directly but I just can't!",

Once or twice a year we would get a heavy snowstorm, but we were far enough south that the local government wouldn\u2019t plow or salt anything other than the main roads. The power plant has a \u201cpolicy\u201d during inclement weather that no matter how long it takes you to get to work if you make it in you get paid for the day, otherwise you have to take vacation. Note: I, like a majority of my coworkers, live in the closest large city which is an hour away.

I head to a local store about a half mile (0.8 km) away and pick up some snow sleds. I\u2019d like to note that the roads were bad, I was driving a 4x4 and had some trouble getting to/from the store. \n\nThe wife and I do some sledding in the neighborhood, have some hot chocolate, and other classic \u201csnow day\u201d activities. \n\nAround 11:00 I get a text from my supervisor, \u201cOP, are you able to come in to work, hardly anyone showed up because of the snow.

Denied. Take a sick day.\n \nI protested that it's gonna be at least a week before I can even fit my foot into my shoes. Nope, take sick time. Not allowed to work.\n \nOk then.\n \nA couple hours pass and HR called me for help with an IT issue. Apologized and said I'm not allowed to help because I've got a broken toe.

They told her that she had to find a way to cover up the tattoo cleanly or she would be fired. Keep in mind she works in a building where she is never seen by the customers. She just answers phone calls and writes messages for people. \n\nSo she tried putting a bandage on it. They said that made the area look like she had tried to slit her wrists and told her to find another way. So finally she comes to me with this problem. \n\nI\u2019m very petty.

At that time, it cost $3.70 to rent a movie, sometimes for just two nights and the late fees were insane as most who were adults at that time remember. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nWe had this barcode on the side of the register we could scan to give a dollar off a movie rental but only when it helped us make \u201can additional sale\u201d. The idea was to help push the overpriced candy and give a dollar off a movie rental. So Blockbuster started a fundraiser for Saint Jude\u2019s (no incentive at all for employees to get donations, but of course as it was for a good cause I wanted to ask everyone), I got annoyed because people would spend a ton of money on late fees and more movie rentals and crap they didn\u2019t need but I asked everyone on a Saturday night in the busiest Blockbuster in the entire state, to donate and got 2 people, out of several hundred, to donate a dollar. \n\nThe next day, I realized I had to scan a piece of paper so the dollar donation would ring up\u2026hence the donation was technically an \u201cadditional sale\u201d, so I started a new campaign of my own\u2026anyone who agreed to donate a dollar to charity got a dollar off their movie rental. For the next 3 weeks until the charity partnership was over, with the customer\u2019s permission, I took $1 off the movie rental each time and scanned the barcode for the $1 additional sale that went right to charity. The customers were happy they could pay the same price and help a good cause and I got to help collect a few thousand dollars for that cause, putting Blockbuster\u2019s own up-selling methods to work against them. \ud83d\ude2c\n\n\nEdited to add: This was the early 2000\u2019s when you weren\u2019t asked about donating at every store. I was 18 years old and just frustrated by the lack of donating because I watched so much money wasted on stupid late fees that could be taken off so easily for anyone but you had to complain. I couldn\u2019t fathom why anyone wouldn\u2019t want to help a kid for a dollar. I\u2019m sorry some people see this as thievery and/or don\u2019t understand my frustration.

This is when new movies were 5 bucks and older ones either 1 or 2.  The coupon would apply to the lowest value movie because of course it did.\n\nHe almost always had the most sales and I was basically always second.  But that's because I knew who to pitch it to and who not to (he had no shame over selling it).  \n\nWell one day looking at the history of a customer of his I noticed the coupon had been used several times for a customer.  They had rented a new movie and 4 old ones.  So he scanned it 4 times.  Looking into it he had used it 2-3 times a lot when they would get a new movie and some older ones.  Doing this was supposed to be a big no-no.  We ratted on him and he eventually got fired thankfully.  \n\nHe I think sued or fought the termination, won and eventually got hired back.

As a part timer I was making 300% more gift card sales than full timers. Their default assumption was I was somehow \u201cstealing\u201d these \u201crestaurant bucks\u201d (no good anywhere else\u2026) and told the store to let me go.\n\nAnd that was the end of it.

Many people are very judicious with the money they donate only going to specific organizations they've vetted rather than handing out money to everyone who asks.\n\nI, for instance, will never donate to Red Cross. While working for an NGO in an impoverished country, I observed the Red Cross with their fleet of $80,000 vehicles cruising around but doing very little. If one of these broke down, I learned that it was their policy to burn them rather than leave it for someone in the area to benefit from. Some sense if you're operating in a country run by a warlord, but still. [Charity Watch](https://www.charitywatch.org/charities/american-red-cross) lists them as spending $24 for every $100 that goes into their budget, and then 90% of the remainder goes to actual program costs (*so $68.40 if you donated $100 actually going to program costs, which as described above can still be quite wasteful*) rather than administrative overhead. And they're one of the less-crummy ones on the list.\n\nPlus, the only reason businesses handle some of the fundraising for charities is for the good PR, and they get to claim the amounts people donated against the company's taxes.\n\nHard pass, I'll choose who to donate to on my own, thanks.",

I was hosting, and we had a family of 8 due in for a birthday. \nAs I was making my way back to my station, a group of 8 people walked in, (for the purpose of this story, the big idiot will be referred to as 'BI' and I shall be 'me') the exchange went as follows:\n\nBI  'table for 8'\n\nMe 'No problem, Sir, do you have a reservation?'\n\nBI 'No, I don't think so'\n\nMe 'Ok, well I'm very sorry, but we are fully booked for tonight, but I can take a reservation for another night if you wish?'\n\nBI 'No, if I wanted to eat here another night, I would have come here another night'\n\nMy back got RIGHT up\n\nMe 'I understand Sir, I do apologise. I'm afraid all our tables are reserved for tonight, but you're more than welcome to take a seat at the bar if you like, while you choose if you would like to go somewhere else?'\n\nBI 'What about that table over there, (pointing to the birthday table) that's got 8 seats, we'll just sit there!'\n\nMe 'Sorry, that table is reserved for another family, they're due here any minute, if you wait at the bar, we have a 30 min policy, so if the family doesn't turn up, you can take their table'\n\nBI 'Well none of these empty tables have 'reserved' signs on them, so how are we meant to know? Can you not push those two together for us? (Pointing to two tables that weren't even in the same area!)' \n\nBig Idiot then spots my manager walking past, and grabs her arm to speak to her (which went down about as well as a fart in a lift!)\n\nBI 'EXCUSE ME, there is a table over there that we would like to sit at, but this GIRL here won't let us sit there, we travelled half an hour to get here, and I'm not happy! They don't have any signs on to say they are reserved, so I don't understand!'\n\nMy manager, without missing a single beat says 'I'm sorry about that Sir, please wait a second while I sort this out, I won't be long'\n\nBig Idiot is looking pretty pleased with himself at this point, puffs out his chest and gives me the smuggest look he's probably given anyone. Until he spots my manager walking out, with the little reserved signs in her hand (our restaurant used to be self seating), she walks over to my station, checks the diary, and walks over to each empty table, and places a sign on each one, and walks back over to the station.\n\nManager 'I'm sorry our system confused you Sir, I have now rectified it, I see we have have a free table tomorrow evening, at the same time if you would like to come back then?'\n\nBig Idiot turned the most putrid shade of puce you've ever seen in your life, and stated he will sit at the bar and wait to see if the table cancels, and as they're walking, the birthday table of 8 walks in.\n\nBig Idiot huffs, and beckons his family to leave, at which point, my manager calls over 'If you would like that table for tomorrow, please give us a call, have a nice evening!'\n\nOh sweet, sweet Karma...\n\nTL;DR Idiot thought he could bully his way to a table, my manager took matters into her own hands",

I once had a group of 30 walk in right after another group of 30 while both our side rooms were already full. So I quoted the second group a 45-60 minute wait and the guy (I guess leader of the group) complained the ENTIRE TIME. He complained to his group, to other guests, to me. To everyone.

(*because that's what happens when you push little square tables meant for 4 together, two of the sides disappear and there is only seating for SIX people, not eight, unless two of the customers are willing to eat squeezed between two other people and with table legs between their own legs, if the tables have 4 corner legs instead of one middle leg.)\n\nSo yeah, your manager is awesome!

            "My wife and I were eating dinner in a tiny little restaurant in a small yet popular town on the north shore of Lake Superior.  It was Saturday night, the place was packed, and it was something of a 20 minute wait.\n\nIn comes a loud mouthed dude with a woman in tow.  He asks about the wait, she replies that it'll be about 20 minutes, he makes a snide comment in response and then they wait.  He spends the entire time time complaining loudly to no one in particular just how he feels about the situation he is in.  A table opens up, the couple in front of them sits down, and now loudmouth and his date are next in line.\n\nLoudmouth: \"Why can't we have that table right there?\"\n\nHostess: \"Sir, that's our only table for 8.  We're a small restaurant.  If a large group comes in there will be no way for us to seat them. \n If you'll please be patient with us another table will be opening up very soon.\"  \n\nLoudmouth: \"I don't care, I want that table and I don't understand why we can't have it.\"\n\nThe hostess then explains the same thing again with different words and Loudmouth tells her he would like to speak with the manager.  The manager steps over and explains exactly what the hostess said.\n\nLoudmouth goes \"I'm a customer!  If you won't give me what I want I'll go someplace else!\".  He turns and storms out the door.  It takes his date a moment to realize what just happened then she follows after him.  Moments after they leave a different couple steps in through the door.  In as much time as it takes the new couple to ask for a table for two, a table opens up and new couple gets to sit without waiting.\n\nFive minutes later (because that's how long it takes to walk the downtown and see there were no other options for fine dining in this tiny town) Loudmouth and his date return.  The hostess tells him it'll be about 20 minutes.  Seeming to have accepted his fate he stands quietly.  They were still waiting when my wife and I left a short time later.",

They actually had to stop serving shots before I worked there to curb that attitude. But people will still try to walk in and just grab any open table to drink at. Then they get pissed that they messed up our seating and we ask them to move for people who are actually eating. I don't get it. We have a few big tv's, but aside from that zero drinking atmosphere.

        "selftext": "This was fun for me and I was shocked how long it was allowed to go on for.\n\nI\u2019m a high school teacher of an elective subject that lots of kids take and enjoy. I build great relationships and generally have the same kids for multiple years, so I get all of the tea spilled to me.  \n\nThere was an incident during and after school event.  I was in one space doing my thing and some students who had been in another part of the building came in and said, \u201cMr. Taaronk, there are people having sex in this other room.\u201d  I follow them to the scene of the crime and there is nobody there.   I do all of the appropriate follow-up to see if anything actually went down, but no body no crime (and no one actually saw anything, they just said they saw the couple come out of the room and it smelled like sex when they went in after).  Also, no cameras in the part of the building in question - a thing I had pointed out as a problem multiple times in the past.\n\nFast forward like four months and the principal calls me down to their office.  They proceed to chew me out for not reporting the incident, it having finally made its way through the rumor mill up to the top.  I tell them all of the steps I took to follow up at the time and that it didn\u2019t seem like there was anything to report \u2014 the room didn\u2019t smell like sex to me, so it didn\u2019t occur to me to tell anyone about it (to be fair it was early in my career, so maybe I was wrong).  I ask them (in what I assumed would be received rhetorically), \u201cso where is the line on what unverified, evidence free rumors I should be reporting?\u201d  And they respond: all of them.\n\nCue malicious compliance!\n\nI proceed to call and email them after. Every. Single. Conversation I have with a kid that could be even remotely construed as problematic.  We are talking a minimum of 3 times a day, usually more for THREE. WEEKS.  STRAIGHT.  Including weekends. The most satisfying was on a Friday afternoon at about 4:45.  The principal picks up the phone and before I can say a word they say, \u201cokay Mr. Taaronk\u2026you\u2019ve made your point.\u201d\n\nUPDATE:\nSome clarifying points, particularly for those in the profession who think my initial reaction was problematic:\n1) I (the teacher it was reported to) didn\u2019t actually SEE the couple in question, nor could anyone involved point them out to me in the building. \n2) I DID seek clarification as to why the principal didn\u2019t think I handed it appropriately and when seeking clarification on what unverified reports come to me should go up the chain and she said \u201call\u201d - this is where the MC came into play, not because I objected to the notion but because my legitimate question for guidance was a non-answer. \n3) It was a Friday after school \u2014 I didn\u2019t think anything of it due to the complete absence of anything actually occurring and so I forgot about it come Monday.  There was literally no one on campus to report it to and as a young teacher it simply didn\u2019t occur to me that I could/should call the admin on a Friday evening to report an event that had ZERO evidence of being true.\n\nEdit - yes, I made a typo in the title. It should read \u201crumor\u201d not tuner.  \n\nTl;dr - a rumored incident wasn\u2019t reported due to lack of evidence it happened. Boss said report every rumor. So i did multiple times a day for several weeks until they got sick of it.",

            "\"the room didn\u2019t smell like sex to me, so it didn\u2019t occur to me to tell anyone about it (to be fair it was early in my career, so maybe I was wrong).\"\n\nYou have since learned what sex smells like? \ud83d\ude09",
            "Well-played and great story but I need to call out one little thing:\n\n> Also, no cameras in the part of the building in question - a thing I had pointed out as a problem multiple times in the past.\n\nWe managed to educate each other for thousands of years without constant video surveillance. I know a bunch of people with advanced degrees who managed to get them without living in a panopticon. You probably do too. \n\nIt\u2019s bad enough that now we\u2019ve normalized surveillance and taught kids that violating their privacy is to be expected. Now we\u2019ve got teachers objecting to the existence of places where privacy is not violated? Please think twice about that.",
            "It\u2019s always better to over-report than to miss a potential safeguarding issue. There will be colleagues, who have all of the other pieces of the jigsaw, who will decide if your report is inconsequential or actually significant and/or part of a wider picture.\n\nYour school should have made this crystal clear to you on day one. If they haven\u2019t, this is on them.",

            "Malicious compliance makes me\nlaugh because 99% of the time you\u2019re just making your own life harder in the long run. Sure you might have \u201cmade a point\u201d or something, but now you\u2019ve at best proved to your boss that you\u2019re an annoyance who is vindictive, and at worst have made a professional enemy of your boss who will now try to sabotage you at every turn. Well played? \n\nWhereas if you had just said \u201cThere are a lot of rumors, so if we could get some concrete guidelines as to what to report that would be helpful. Otherwise I\u2019ll have to call you up all the time and neither of us has time for that.\u201d \n\nBut if you want to play obviously passive aggressive games, don\u2019t be surprised when you win said prizes.",
