        "selftext": "Mobile format blah blah\n\nThis past Christmas my Mom just told me her malicious story. She was looking for stocking stuffers for the whole family and found a Lindor chocolate coupon online. 150 pieces for like 40 bucks - which is a pretty good deal. She did not read the coupon but screenshot it and brought it to her local outlet store to pick out the treats in person.  \n\nIt was a tad busy in the store so she waited in line, when it was her turn she showed the coupon. The conversation went as such.\n\nMom: \u201chi I have this coupon, I\u2019d like to pick out my chocolates.\u201d\n\nClerk: *inspects coupon* \u201csorry that is for online orders or if you call it in we can package it for you.\u201d\n\nMom: \u201cOk so I can\u2019t pick out the chocolates, I will need to call it in? I\u2019m here now\u201d\n\nClerk: \u201csorry that\u2019s what the coupon says, next in line.\u201d *again it\u2019s pretty busy inside*\n\nMom: *side steps out of line and pulls out phone*\n\nClerk: *turns around answers the phone.*\n\nMom: *Audibly so she would hear her twice through the phone and in person* \u201cHi, I\u2019d like to place an order for 150 pieces of chocolate, can you please provide me with your full menu one by one\u201d\n\nClerk: *Turns around mortified and quietly says* \u201cplease just pick out the chocolates you want we will honor the coupon.\u201d",

            "There was a takeout place I liked and there was ALWAYS a long line. If I was at home I would call it in and by the time I had walked over my order would usually be ready. Sometimes it would be more spontaneous and I would decide that I wanted to eat there as the bus went by. So, I would get off at that bus stop and get in the back of the long line. Then I would pull my phone out, call in my order, and walk up to the front, bypassing the entire line. \n\nAITA? Absolutely. But I didn't do anything wrong, just inconsiderate.",
            "I used to work at a fast food place, and when people ordered to go I would give them a large drink no matter what size they pay for and then explain that I'm giving them their refills to go. Well, I was in the process of doing this once in the drive through with a customer who came there a lot. Right in front of the customer my manager came over and started scolding me for it, saying if she wanted a large she would have ordered it and then takes the large out of my hand, throws it away, and gives her the medium that she ordered. The customer, who was familiar with my line of reasoning, circled through the drive through about 5 or 6 more times for refills. I was the one who had to keep giving them to her, so it didn't really prove any points. Just thought it was kind of funny.",

I walked off and left it by the checkout.\n\n...then walked outside, ordered it online for 'collect in store', and walked back in.\n\nSmug checkout guy wasn't happy when I went back to his checkout to collect my order and pointed to it sat next to the till already.\n\nWithin a few months they had made the prices the same everywhere, I guess I wasn't the only one doing this!",

And it was busy! She chose to act like a complete child. Shame on her.",
            "I mean, this feels more like a Karen move.\n\n Employee at a retail chain following the rules and being made to suffer by a woman with a coupon?\n\n I get that they weren't super helpful but also it's store policy and they definitely shouldn't be expected to violate that just because your mom didn't read the coupon.",
            "I work in retail. Our online and phone orders are taken and processed by a specific worker, that is their job in the store. If people who were serving out front were continually taking calls and looking at computers to see the orders coming through, the customers actually in the store wouldn\u2019t get served, not in a timely manner anyway. \nWhen you place an order over the phone or online you\u2019re given a time frame too for pick up, so the order can be ready when you walk in store. One of the reasons people prefer online orders, as well as some specific discounts that come with it. \n\nNow, this might not be how this store works, and the poor servers might have to do everything, as well as serving a busy store, which make this situation worse. \n\nThe thing that Karen\u2019s don\u2019t realise, is that at the end of the day, that worker goes home and when asked how work was, doesn\u2019t say \u201cthis woman customer sure showed me, I was so wrong in this situation and I\u2019ll be more lenient next time\u201d \nThey say \u201ctoday this bitch comes in....\u201d\n\nRead the policy, and don\u2019t take it out on a server. You say it would have made the servers day easier, but she still had to answer the phone and leave other workers to pick up the slack. She probably agreed to let your mum pick the chocolates in store because she didn\u2019t want to leave the other servers in the lurch by being on the phone with someone who demanded the full menu!  All the while putting her employment at risk because your mum didn\u2019t read the coupon. I can guarantee you, that incident would have left a sour taste in the servers mouth for the rest of the day and make working and smiling just a little bit harder.",

            "imagine just taking a random picture of a coupon without reading it and then going to a store and getting upset that they didn't honor the conditions that you made up in your own head so you just try to waste their time until they just give you what you want to get rid the nuisance that you are.",
            "They probably want it ordered in order to prevent customers from coming in and cleaning out what is stocked in the front, thus, having to constantly restock if lots of people come in with coupons for 150 chocolates. \n\nIf an employee fills the order then they can pull from the back stock making their job easier as they don\u2019t have to constantly be restocking the front. The part that makes this sound like a Karen moment is that she spoke loud enough to be heard by the employee...and everyone else in the store. And also by the request of reading every menu item when she was there. \n\nThe only way this would not be Karen, but still malicious compliance is if she placed the order while standing in the store. Guaranteed the employee just let her go ahead and do it so she wouldn\u2019t cause more of a scene then she already was. \n\nBeing hateful to the employee for just following company/store policy isn\u2019t funny. And purposely making their job harder by requesting the entire menu  vs just placing the order while you are looking at the chocolates is a total Karen move.",

We just opened up a new store and it was the worst.  The job paid well for mall retail and the people were nice.  But you couldn't have your phone out (which I understand the thought process) even when nobody is around.  We were a new store this summer we would go and hour without anyone coming in.  We didn't have anything to restock ect.  Ok no phone, fine.  You couldn't lean in counters and I am not talking bent over with your arms in the counter or leaning back far.  You can't even stand with your ass against the side. On top of it all they watched us.  We didn't cover something the way the DM liked and she called and said she saw it on camera. This is a mall retail part time job.  I have no customers nothing to do and you expect me to stand in dress shoes like it's the military.

The art teacher was going over painting and drawing and we were getting bored and begging to do something else.  OK, he says, we'll do some other stuff.  We had two months of pottery, carving sculptures out of bars of soap, all sorts of fun stuff.\n\nWhile we'd work on our projects, the teacher always told us stories.  Some true, some not, but his favorite kind were ghost stories.  Eventually he figured the stories about ghosts in the school were the scariest.  Pretty soon he started telling (made-up) stories about the ghost that lived in the school. Over the course of the weeks, while we shaped our pottery and did our carving, the stories grew to include sightings of the ghost in the school's basement.\n\nThis basement was really a cellar.  Perfectly safe but the floor was usually a bit damp, it was dusty and dingy, etc.  We only ever went there for tornado drills.\n\nEventually he started telling us how HE saw the ghost down there.  Then how the ghost was even there DURING THE DAY.  All in a way designed to intrigue, and perhaps scare, 4th graders.  Pretty soon my classmates were DEMANDING to go down to the basement and see the ghost.  He'd say, \"no, it's too scary\".  That made people more demanding.  Finally he said, \"Do you want to see a ghost in the basement?\"  \"YEAH!\"  \"Are you SURE?\"  \"YES!\"  \"It's pretty scary.\"  \"LET US SEE!\"  \"You'll scream.\"  \"NO WE WONT!\" \"OK, OK, have it your way.  But don't say I didn't warn you\".\n\nThe boys in class were all bragging about how they weren't scared.  The girls were all huddled with their friends.  Finally the day arrived.\n\n\"Now, this is going to be scary.  It's OK to scream, but don't try to run -- I don't want anyone to fall down there, OK?\"  Nervous laughs and nods from the class.  \"Does anybody want to stay in the classroom instead of going down?\"  No raised hands, but some apprehensive looks.\n\nWe all went down to the basement.  All was normal.  Then the teacher suddenly switched off the lights.\n\nAnd that was when we saw a ghost, shimmering in the distance, with its eerily human-like face peering at us.\n\nThere were screams, from both boys and girls.  It was loud.\n\nThen he switched the light back on and we heard the teacher laughing.  Loudly.\n\nAfter some badgering, he pointed to the large white towel hanging from a pipe at the far end of the basement, gently waving in the breeze.  \"Is there where you saw the ghost?\"  \"Y-y-yes...\"  \"Was it glowing?\"  \"Y-y-yes...\"   \"Did you know that you can buy paint that glows in the dark?\"\n\nCue the predictable responses from the 4th graders, and demands for him to show us how he did it and let us try.  It didn't dawn on me until yesterday, when I told this story to my kids a couple of decades after it happened, that this whole thing was a 2-month windup on the teacher's part.  Because after we saw the ghost, of course we demanded to know how he did it.  We demanded to try the glow-in-the-dark paint ourselves, and did.  We got a lesson on using paint you can't see very well (similar to glaze).  We learned about unusual mediums (including cotton towels).  We then went back to other painting-type items in art with excitement and demands to the teacher to try all sorts of kinds of paint and painting.  Which was probably his plan all along.  I'm sure he covered everything in his lesson plan that year, just slightly out of order, and with much more enthusiastic kids.\n\nWe were had, and good.",

            "That's a clever teacher! I had a teacher in 2nd grade that had lined up finger painting for art class one day and the whole class was complaining that finger painting was for babies and also complaining that all the paints were weird colors. This teacher was a little eccentric (she always played Simon and Garfunkel during art time...Art Garfunkel) and we usually had a good time during art.  \n\nAnyway, we all grumble and start finger painting. Everything is going along, and then I get a nudge from my neighbor - I look up and she looks over at the teacher, so I look too - annnnd the teacher is licking finger paint off her fingers. My classmate and I look at each other, and then look again. More students are starting to notice. I mean, this teacher is weird, but eating paint? The teacher waits until we're all looking and eats some more, but doesn't say anything. Finally one kid tentatively puts a finger in his mouth and then laughs. Turns out, the teacher made all different kinds of jello pudding and that's what we were using for paint! Another clever teacher showing us not to take the world at face value  :)",

I really credit him with my love of science and getting my degree in that field. \n\nWe had a lab on liquid nitrogen, and he had the usual safety talk of \u2018don\u2019t put anything in or near the nitrogen that you don\u2019t want to lose\u2019. We\u2019ve all heard this before, since it was day 3 or 4 of the lab. He suddenly plunged his hand into the liquid nitrogen container, pulled out an, obviously frozen, gloves hand, placed said hand on the lab bench, and proceeded to shatter it with a hammer. \n\nAfter we finished screaming, he told us he\u2019d made a fake hand with a burger and 5 hot dogs, and had purposefully worn gloves beforehand to play said prank. We were all a LOT more careful around the nitrogen after that. \n\nWe also had a 2 week microbiology lab, and when we got sick of all the microscope work halfway through, he rubbed black powder around the lenses so we had Harry Potter style \u2018glasses\u2019 for days.

            "Neat story! My school malicious compliance isn\u2019t as sweet. My school was tiny and ran from pre-k to 12. It had started as a Christian pre-school and added a grade each year. I was the second graduating class. We had a strict dress code. But fashion in the early 2000s made complying difficult. It was hard to find decent mid rise pants and tops that didn\u2019t show your belly when you raised your hand. The solution to this was uniforms my 10th grade year. Sounds good? Nope. \n\nWe had to shop at actual stores for uniform- like clothing. It was a joke. To further make it difficult, the French Toast brand didn\u2019t fit at all. This brand was the most affordable at Kmart and Sears. Most kids just bought button downs and khakis from American Eagle. Guess what happened? Same problems. Girls skirts were still too short and their bellies still showed when they raised their hands. \n \nIt didn\u2019t end there. The problem worsened. The administration got fed up. Especially with my class since by then we reached grade 12. Two years had passed and the uniforms were doing nothing, as predicted. \n\nAdministration decided that they would revoke the senior high banquet (our version of prom, except with no dancing). \n\nThis didn\u2019t go too well. We wanted a banquet and many had already spent hundreds on dresses.  Then we realized that we could just have a prom. An ACTUAL PROM! \n\nAdministration got wind of our plans (which were being planned outside of the school) was were furious. They decided that they would hold an assembly on how awful dancing was and \u2018encourage\u2019 us to not have it. \n\nWe had a prom that year. Administration couldn\u2019t do anything.

Except that we never left at midnight.  It was always later.  I was told by the guy with me that with no exception to never clock more than 40 hours in a week.  And because I started on Monday, and was shadowing someone I was alone on Thursday & Friday night not knowing what to do.  I went ahead and worked late each of the remanding 2 days, because it look me even longer to do the work alone than with help.  I was suppose to get all of the paperwork done the next Monday.  I also had to turn in my timecard.    \n\n\nI met with the boss at the paperwork meeting.  He asked for my time card, noticed I claimed more than 40 hours on it and told me I needed to amend it to 40.  I told him that I didn't see how I could achieve the tasks set before me in the time allotted.  He told me I would get faster as I got more experienced. (I have plenty of experience cleaning from the military FFS) To which I replied that I wasn't going to get it thoroughly cleaned in that time.   What corners was I suppose to cut.  He says none, do it all, take all of the time needed.  Just don't clock more than 40 hours.  The paperwork meeting was about to start.  So faced with the prospect of being abused and manipulated into working OT without OT pay on a regular basis and being made to feel like an idiot.

            "This remind me of when I used to do in home assembly. I had a work order to go deliver and assemble a rather large all in one gym set for a school once. It meant driving for an hour or more and spending 30+ minutes setting the thing up, then dragging the box to a dumpster. This particular all in one gym system didn't take much time to assemble and paid well due to it's weight and size. I called the school 30 minutes before getting there asking for them to send a person from maintenance to assist me in lifting it with a dolly since it needed to go down several halls to get to its forever home. Now I made up my own schedule but I wasn't in any real hurry so when they made me wait for an hour and no one showed up at the bay door to help me with this thing, I decided to take matters into my own hands i did not get paid by the hour but per assembly so I didn't plan an extra hour into my schedule. I had to literally drag this huge heavy box down the hallways of this school until I got to the room it was to be assembled in. It left very noticeable scratch marks in the vinyl flooring. I assembled the item, got a gym teacher to sign off on it and left. I also told them about the drag marks at that time, explaining to them no one met me with a dolly for this thing.\n\n A whole week later I get an angry email from some teacher there at the school about how I didn't assemble the thing right and it was missing some parts. I also left drag marks up and down the hallway according to them. So my company paid me to deliver another one of these monsters, pack up the one that was \"incomplete\", and reassemble a second one. I happily complied, as it turns out i was met by the principal and her \"security team\" who helped me load the second one on a dolly, scrutinized my every move while i was there waited for me to complete assembly and disassembly. They were missing a single piece of equipment that one of the kids left on the floor behind some mats I noticed, to bad they had to pay for the same thing twice , then pay for the floor that got damaged and, pay me for wasting my time.

Mainly clearing garbage and mopping up office buildings.\n\nI think everyone should have to spend some time as a custodian for at least a summer. You really get a new respect for the job and how much they do. I find I'm much more aware of any messes I'm leaving when I'm in a public space and make sure to always clean up after myself.",
            "I went to an alternative school for my entire elementary level. One of our task as a child was to clean up before going out in the afternoon. We would be assigned a task (broom, chairs on table, blackboard, table cleaning, ...) and it would be done every day of the week. Even there, the custodian/janitor had a lot to do in its day. But we were to respect its job and make sure to help as much as we could.\n\nEvery school should do that.",
            "I tell you what, when I was in the classroom, I took care of my custodians. I knew they took care of me. When I coached, I always orders them sweatshirts or t shirts when I got team shirts. One of my students threw garbage in the floor and I told them to pick it up. They said, \u201c that\u2019s what we have janitors for\u201d. I jumped all over that kid and made them sweep the classroom every day for a week before the custodian came in. They learned really quick it was not fun when people just threw things all over. But, when I asked for something to be done in my room, they always made sure it was done. I have deep respect for the people that make sure I have the environment to do my job correctly.",
            "I'm very irritated at the kindergarten teacher for being so thoughtless, by the way. I was an elementary teacher and if we used glitter I would ALWAYS clean up as thoroughly as I could because our custodian was the best. Custodians and secretaries typically have more power to make a teacher's life better than anyone else in the building. ",
            "I am a kindergarten teacher and I teach my children that our custodians do not clean up our messes from art projects, food, etc. I keep a dust pan handy that\u2019s child size so they have to sweep. It makes me sad that glitter is misused. There shouldn\u2019t be tons of it scattered in large amounts. To me that is poor management of whatever craft supplies is being used. There are so many ways to prevent it from being spread. Custodians help classroom teachers in amazing ways. I\u2019ve had them clean up poop, pee, vomit, blood, old milk, and mice from my classroom. We are all a team and need to pull our weight. ",

But I haven't thought much about what my interactions with them will be like as a teacher since I got to uni. Thank you for reminding me that there is a responsibility for the teachers here. I will now be thinking about that when I'm in my teaching placements and as a teacher after I graduate. ",
            "When I was in college to become a teacher, more than one professor said that we HAVE to make friends with the custodians. And they were right.\n\nIt\u2019s baffling to me that a principal would behave that way toward you. ",

They aren\u2019t allowed to get their things for the end of the day if they haven\u2019t cleaned up. Also, our custodian was out for a couple of days due to illness and since we are the oldest in the school (8th grade), we took care of emptying trash and help ing out.

I mean that at every level - literally from the top down its a shit show. There's no SOPs on how to do anything in the whole district. Some locations do it one way, while others do it another. Which leads to a whole lot of work that really has no oversight. I guess maybe this worked fine in 1960 but I'd do just about anything to have this job unionized. \n\nWe collectively get shit on by everyone. Literally from our buddies in maintenance to pta, to teachers and office. Any time there's an issue it's the custodians fault because everyone just hands us their work and issues. Definately getting out of this job ASAP. My hats off to the guys who do this for decades. Ive been here around 3 years and I feel ive aged 10. Where I live It's truly a thankless job, where people arent afraid to throw you under the bus in a second. Our district doesnt even offer a livable wage either. Yet DO sits and wonders why they havent been able to hire a single custodian for nearly 11 months now. Which at least gives me job security.",

I took the lunch room job bc I wanted to have the same days off as my kids when they were younger and I loved it honestly-summers, holidays, snow days, and weekends off! Who wouldn\u2019t?. That being said, I definitely know the feeling of being looked down upon by other personal (teachers, administrators) because they consider your job position in a school to be below theirs. However, sweet karma came when my kids were older and I started my career as a Sheriff\u2019s deputy. I have since seen two teachers who acted in this exact manner behind the same bars of the jail I work for (for stealing school funds nonetheless) and I have to say it made me smile perhaps a little bit more than it should of.

I always have my students clean as much as they can and we only ever do glitter in small groups at my teacher table. Plus, the vacuums they are given to use are shit - not electric and basically just push everything deeper into the carpet. \nI love my custodian and we make her birthday cards and thank you cards to try to show our appreciation. I explain to my students her role and how much of a help she is to our classroom.

My area is a complete outside stadium includes a full size football field 3 baseball fields 2 locker 2 large restrooms 4 tennis courts and home and away stadium seating. On top of that I have the new side of the school that has 9 classrooms and 4 restrooms. When I say restrooms I mean 6 toilets for women and 3 urinals and 2 toilets for men. So essentially my area is about 3x the size of the other custodians. We need extra help but our district allows custodian based off of class size not facility size.

            "I have a counterargument to your awesome story. I usually worked at  bank branch. Our main branch needed a personal banker to fill in so I was sent there. It. Was. So. Quiet. A funeral home would have been livelier and louder. I could not help any client because the 2 or 3 other personal bankers wanted blood if you dared to take their client. Well after they gave me a sweet old little lady who I spent 20 minutes helping to balance her checkbook, I made the horrifying mistake of ripping a piece of paper in half. No customer was in the lobby. Apparently 2 or 3 tellers fainted from my behavior, 5 other employees clutched their pearls, and one ran to the manager so fast to report me. I was taken to her office and lectured about 3 minutes on this unprofessional behavior. I refused to work there again. Later on I became a branch manager myself and had to go to the main branch frequently for meetings. I just walked past them as fast as possible. Funny thing was I technically had more clout than the bankers and tellers and was on equal ground with the manager who scolded me. Meanwhile my branch was in Walmart, we never got a break and half the branches called me for approval when most of the other branch managers left. But I worked right along and did the same things my staff did and supported them when a customer complained. And they would have killed for me. One time we were slammed and my regional manager stopped by and casually asked if he could help (You know he did not want to, he was beneath that) but my assistant manager said sure Tom, you can start waiting on the customers and answer the phones and sure enough he did!

Everyone here is in control over their own clients and book of business.

If I don't come in one day or am late it doesn't hurt anyone but myself, so I work as much as I possibly can. Being a little late shouldn't be a big deal, but it got to the point a large chunk of the office was routinely showing up 10-15 minutes after start (I agree being late shouldn't be a habit, but they are only hurting themselves, if they don't hit numbers they will just get fired). Living in a central state and having mainly east coast clients means I am in the office about an hour before most people anyway. Well, my team manager enacted a rule where if you are more than 10 minutes late, you have to bring breakfast for the team (my team is 16 people). So everyone showed up on time last week, then Thursday rolls around and I called him to explain how my dog is puking and I will be 30 minutes to an hour late. He just replies via text I better bring breakfast for everyone. Even though I am historically there well before anyone, I was to become his first subject and example. I called to say no I cannot do that, Christmas is coming up and I have travel plans I need the money for. Well, he pushes back and says to bring it anyway. Now I'm fairly pissed as my team originally thought the rule was a joke and in no way enforceable... So an idea forms in my mind, I was not going to take this. I call up Einstein Bros and order 16 double egg and bacon sandwiches and a 16 large orange juices. When I make it in about an hour late, the team loves the gesture and my manager doesn't say a word as he grabs his oj and sandwich. Now here's where the fun comes in, our expense reports were due the next day in order to receive it by the following paycheck. I expense the full ~180 and submit it without saying a word to him. The branch manager called me in the next morning (we are on extremely good terms, very chill guy) and asks what the expense is for. When I explain team breakfast and the rule, and show him the texts from my manager he gets red in the face and tells me okay no problem it will get paid and to be on my way. Not 5 minutes later my manager gets a call and everyone could immediately see on his face him getting yelled at. He goes into the branch managers office and proceeds to get a long talking to about what he can and cannot enforce on employees. Looking extremely defeated he sat down and didn't say a word the rest of the day. He had to send out an email to the team recalling the rule about breakfast and apologizing if he put undue pressure on us and that he just \"wants us to succeed, and being late is not the way to do so.\" The next week Monday morning, I brought in breakfast for the team again, a dozen and a half donuts for about $14.

We had white furniture that we sold, and it was so prone to scuffs and damage that it came with a little spray can of touch-up paint.

They sold for $90.  Well he starts nitpicking every little scuff and mark on the chair, doesn't care that's just how it is, he wants a discount!\n\nSo I go ask my manager, she says, \"Fine, give him ten dollars off\"\n\nI go back and say, \"OK, I can give you ten bucks off\"\n\nHe says, \"Ten DOLLARS?  That's not good enough!!  I want ten PERCENT off!\"\n\nSo I say \"OK you got it!\", quickly ring him up, take the 10% discount (which is $9.00) and hand him his receipt with a big smille and a \"Thanks so much for coming in today!\"\n\nHe walks out (dragging the chair, lol) and is halfway to the door when he reads his receipt and realizes he's played himself.  He turns back and I just gave him a big cheshire smile.  He left without a word.\n\nOh, and I \"forgot\" to give him his touch-up paint too.  Dang.",

I was in high school, had been a budding photographer for years already, and working in a small retail photo supply shop.\n\nI had a customer who appeared to be in his early 60s come in one Saturday and spend over an hour demoing just about every camera we sold.  I honestly looked forward to those customers because it made the time go faster and I generally enjoyed talking shop with people.  Eventually, he settled on one that we both thought would suit his needs and I rang him up.\n\nA few nights later, he comes back.  I've already been given a heads-up by the store's owner that this guy has called ahead, and he is *pissed*.  When the customer arrives, he immediately accuses me of selling him a camera that's either broken or simply not good enough for what he wants to use it for (taking pictures of his grandkids, who - like most tiny children - are not always sitting perfectly still).  It's too slow, it takes the picture after the kid's already done something, every photo is blurry, etc.  \n\nI take him at his word (I have no reason not to) and examine the camera, changing some settings and snapping a few pictures as I go.  I genuinely cannot find anything wrong with it at all.  As gently as I can, I try to tell him that it may be a combination of using the wrong settings on the camera for what he's trying to photograph (while teaching him the right ones), and maybe a bit of slow reflexes that will develop with practice.  Keep in mind that I'm young and terrified of losing my job, so believe me when I say I'm as delicate as I can be with the whole situation.  \n\nBut that was the wrong answer, apparently.  His solution: \"okay hotshot, let's see you make it work.  I'm going to wave my arms back and forth over my head, and I want you to take pictures when they're straight up.\"  He insists this will prove that the *camera* is too slow and can't take a sharp picture.  He hands me the camera, and starts doing his best \"wave your hands in the air like you just don't care\" right in the store.\n\nSnap, snap, snap.\n\nI hand the camera back and let him review the photos, each one showing the exact moment he wanted me to photograph, perfectly sharp and in focus.\n\nHe didn't say another word.  He huffed, hastily shoved everything back into his camera bag, and stormed off.  Sorry, sir.  Just doing what you asked me to.",

            "Oh boy. This reminds me of my ex's sister-in-law.  \n\nBackground: I've been into taking photos since I was around 10. I received my first \"real\" camera when I was 13.  It was just a spare point-and-shoot Pentax that an older friend had and gave to me. But, I loved it and I'd go through a roll of film almost every week. And use my pocket money to get the film's developed. I would rarely have a photo I wasn't happy with. \n\nSo, for my 21st I received my first DSLR. And I used it almost everyday. I took a lot of photos of my (ex's) niece's and nephews. And their parents loved having so many good photos of the kids. \n\nCut to a couple months later and SIL asking what kind of camera I had because \"I want to be able to take photos like yours!\" \n\nFlattering but, I had to try and tell her really nicely that it wasn't just the camera. I didn't want her spending $1200 on the same camera just to be disappointed.  So I explained which camera I had but also mentioned that I might have to show her how to use it a bit if she hasn't used one before. As the auto setting isn't great for taking photos of kids in action. \n\nShe was not happy. She took it as me insulting her ability to \"Point a camera at someone\". And proceeded to try and insult me by saying I don't actually know what I'm doing and that it's just the camera. \"Anyone can take a good photo if they waste money on an expensive camera.\" \n\nSo I left it. And she went and spent $1750 at a  department store, for the same camera but with a macro, flash and a full kit bag. They definitely saw her coming. \n\nShe came to me about a month or so after, saying \"I think I should take this camera back. I'm sure they've given me a faulty one. The photos are ALWAYS blurry and it keeps cutting the tops of the kids heads off in the actual photo, but it's not like that when I take the photo! They've ripped me off, I'm sure of it. Can you have a look at it? Does yours ever do that to your photos?\" \n\nMy response of \"Well, anyone should be able to take a good photo if they waste their money on an expensive camera. Especially with that flash. So, maybe you're right. Maybe it is the camera.\" didn't sit well. \n\n\nI know that sounds super conceited but, she was a massive shit. So, I don't feel bad about being cocky.",
            "As someone who has been a professional photographer for 13 years and simultaneously worked in specialist photographic retail for 10 years, this hits close to home, except I'm not as patient as you. I've had several of this exact same scenario happen to me and if the customer was rude or impatient, I simply told them it's not the camera's fault. It's yours. You're not skilled enough to know how to use it in the manner it needs to be (all totally true). A camera is tool that an artist needs to wield. Just like how a sculptor can't expect his chisel to make a beautiful marble statue by itself, you can't expect a camera to take good photos for you. You have to take the photos yourself. A great camera allows you to push the limits more than a bad camera, so a good quality camera is still important, but it's mostly the squishy bits behind the camera that matter. I have little patience when they're rude. If they're polite, I will literally spend hours with them showing them how the camera works in detail.",

And then I have my *ist D, a first gen Pentax Digicam, and that thing has significant lag before the shutter goes.

I was like, man Nikon sucks. I returned it and got a Canon.  Same deal!\n\nThen I realized the problem was with me and not with the camera.\n\nEventually I learned it was mostly because I was a combination of (a) DSLRs having shallow depth of field, and (b) the kit lens being a bit less sharp with wide open aperture (even aside from shallower dof with wide open aperture).\n\nI stopped it down a bit and switched to center focus so I had more control, and voila, pictures no longer blurry!\n\nThen I got a prime lens, and they were better still!\n\nLesson learned is that you couldn't use a DSLR just like a point and shoot.\n\nI think these days autofocus is a bit smarter at least...",

        "selftext": "During undergrad I worked at a deli in a major supermarket. Most of my coworkers were also in college, and we all got along and generally had a good time. We usually didn't have too much trouble, but for some reason a couple of managers had decided that they didn't like one of my coworkers. Let's call him Corey. They would nitpick his work and give him a hard time for things the rest of us never got in trouble for. One morning, they decided that his 5 o'clock shadow warranted a beard net. Now this was an unusual request considering that 1) no one without a beard had ever been told to do this before, and 2) he had barely any stubble, and 3) they made a big deal about it and seemed to be trying to make him feel bad about it.\n\nCue the malicious compliance.\n\nManagers aside, I was the only female employee in the department at the time. So I stroll up and ask what's going on. They point out his stubble. I respond that I'm certain that I have eyebrow hairs longer than that, and in mock concern, I ask if I should be wearing my hairnet over them. They sort of look at each other, and hesitantly say no.... you don't need to do that. I ask why not, because it's likely that my eyebrow hairs would be in someone's food if we're worried about chin stubble. They persist that no, I shouldn't worry about it. Then I ask about the fine hairs on a woman's face. What about those? Should I be shaving? They're catching on now. They tell him to put on a beard net and leave. He does... and so do I. Solidarity.\n\nI don't think I've seen so many people double-take and start laughing before. The customers and my indirect managers thought it was hilarious. When they would ask me about it, I would just say that I was protecting the food in the store from any potential hairs, real or imagined. By noon, when the original pair of managers returned, I was having a very good day. They begged me to take the beard net off, and I pointed out that there was nothing in the store policy saying that I couldn\u2019t wear PPE, which included beard nets. I wore it until the end of my shift that day. They never bothered Corey about his stubble after that.",

No graphics.\n\nThey were useless to us. \n\nWe needed something to run America Online. Encarta. Maybe Simcity.

They must be worth something. Figure it out\u2026because if you can\u2019t we\u2019re going to have to throw them away.\"\n\nHe thought he was threatening me.\n\nHe did not think I'd throw out 50 computers. After all, he worked hard to get them.\n\nI did not hesitate at all.\n\nMy next class, I had screwdrivers for everyone.\n\nWe disassembled everything. \n\nIf it had a screw we unscrewed it.\n\nThe class figured out what each piece was.\n\nAnd then the class activity was to take the pieces to the dumpster.\n\nBy the end of the day, there was nothing left.\n\nThe next day the director asked me where the computers were.\n\n\u201cOh, you were right! They were very useful. The students took them apart, learned all about the different components, and then threw them out. Just like you said we should!\u201d\n\nHis face turned all sorts of colors.

            "Back in the day (c. 1977) my father was a maths teacher, and because he knew a little bit about computers having been a student working on some of the very earliest valve computers at the University Of London in the 1950's, he found himself in the same boat of managing the school computers. A local laundry company were upgrading their computer and donated their old one to the school. It was a very early ICL George 3 mainframe (1900 model I think) that ran off punched cards, and consisted of 4 large boxes (think large chest freezer sized) housing a card reader, massive printer & processors, plus a teletype terminal. It basically took up a whole room. To get the thing up and running they had to rewire the whole room and install 3-phase electricity which was not cheap, and after much trial error they finally got it working.\n\nThe first thing you had to do every time was read in a set of a couple of hundred punched cards that effectively installed the operating system (called The Executive). Once that was loaded then you could read in other punched cards containing whatever programs you wanted to run.\n\nMove forward a week or two and my father is demonstrating the computer to a new class. He shows them the stack of cards that make up The Executive and explains how they need to be loaded first in order to get the computer up & running. Out of the blue the class headbanger thought it would be fun to pick up the executive and throw it in the air, so that all the cards came down like confetti. Unfortunately that was the point it was realised that a) they only had one copy of The Executive, and b) the cards were not numbered, so they had no idea what order they needed to be sorted back into. The computer never ran again, and sat in that room for about 10 years before my father finally sold it for the scrap value of the gold on the circuit boards.\n\nA few months after the incident the school got a Commodore Pet which sat next to the teletype for several years until the advent of the BBC Micro and a proper computer lab being created, and that Pet was way more powerful and usable than the mainframe ever was.",

They had little money for \"extras\" like computers or computer teachers.\n\n> I don't know much about computers but I knew how to plug them in and I know how to put one together, if you gave me all the parts. So naturally I got asked to be the director of the \u201ccomputer lab\u201d. It had two very old computers and naturally, it was a volunteer job.\n\n> I had very little money and a lot of time. They knew that I wanted a job. They told me that after I \u201cbuild it up\u201d, they would put a salary in the budget.\n\n> I taught classes [about] the difference between the components, some file structure, some BASIC, some DOS, how rebooting your computer usually solves whatever problems you have, and the concept of \u201cdrivers\u201d.\n\n> The thing is, the director of the school hated fundraising, so my salary never got added to the budget, and the director often kept himself busy doing other (useless) things. One sunny morning he finds me and tells me to wish him luck.\n\n> \"If today goes right, we're going to have a huge computer lab!\"\n\n> He comes back from his meeting with a huge smile. \"I did it! I convinced a bank to donate to us their old computers!\"\n\n> Ok. Great. Now I have to set up and maintain 50 new (for us) computers. I can\u2019t wait.\n\n> The computers got delivered the next week -- all terminals. These were Bank Computers. I had no idea how to get them running. They didn\u2019t have hard drives or operating systems. The keyboard and mouse ports were not the standard ps/2 (at the time). I think they somehow connected to a server, which did not get donated. Their monitors only did text -- no graphics. They were useless to us.\n\n> We needed something to run America Online. Encarta. Maybe Simcity. You know, educational stuff. I had no idea how to get these to work. I tried asking the director, telling him that the 50 computers were [not] useful. He got super annoyed.\n\n> \"I'm sure they can be helpful in some way. They must be worth something. Figure it out\u2026because if you can\u2019t we\u2019re going to have to throw them away.\"\n\n> He thought he was threatening me. He did not think I'd throw out 50 computers. After all, he worked hard to get them. I did not hesitate at all.\n\n> My next class, I had screwdrivers for everyone. We disassembled everything. If it had a screw, we unscrewed it. The class figured out what each piece was, and then the class activity was to take the pieces to the dumpster. By the end of the day, there was nothing left.\n\n> The next day the director asked me where the computers were.\n\n> \u201cOh, you were right! They were very useful. The students took them apart, learned all about the different components, and then threw them out. Just like you said we should!\u201d\n\n> His face turned all sorts of colors. And he stormed out. What I didn\u2019t tell him is that I saved the RAM from the garbage. I mean, after all, it was in the garbage. Right?\n\n> And [then I] sold them on the online classifieds (Remember Yahoo Classifieds?) for $20 apiece. There were two in each computer\u2026.so I got $2,000.\n\n> I guess they were useful after all.",

After testing, I determined that (a) The computers were OLD...about a decade each and  (b) Only 7 of them were working.\n\nI talked to the principal and was told there was no budget to fix the computers. That was all I was getting.\n\nSo then I went and tested every mouse, every keyboard, every monitor (some computers were still ok, just the monitor was busted) swapped the parts around and managed to assemble 15 working computers! As there were only 12 kids in the class I was very happy with this and told the principal.\n\nThe principal was aghast. Apparently all these computers are \"tracked\" by the school's parent company accountants, each part has a serial number, and you are not allowed to mix and match parts. He asked me to put all the computers back again.\n\nSo I examined the computers and yep each of them had a sticker with a serial code on it. So I put them all back.
