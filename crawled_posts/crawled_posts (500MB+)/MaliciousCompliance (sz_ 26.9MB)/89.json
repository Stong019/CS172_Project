        "selftext": "So I work at a school library, right?\n\nWe rent out chargers for phones and laptops upon request for a few hours, but they have relatively steep fines for being returned late. Usually I waive the fines, especially if it is returned less than an hour after it was due.\n\nIn comes one guy, let's call him H, who is a serial laptop-charger renter. Almost every day. Well, a few days ago, he accidentally brought the charger home with him. Now, our fines are $1.50 an hour, which was at about $20 total when he called in the next day.\n\nHe asked me if he would be fined. I knew him, so I was willing to waive his fine, but I couldn't tell him over the phone because he might come back at a time when I'M not working, and some of the other librarians are less lax about fines. So I tell him \"Currently your fine is at $25, but if you bring it in, then we can discuss it further. I'm sure we can figure something out.\" He hangs up, and I assume he would be coming in.\n\nTwo days later, H comes waltzing up to my desk and sets a laptop charger down in front of me. There very same one he took home three days prior. I scanned it in, and told him:\n\n\nMe: You have an $85 fine on your account.\n\nH: What? It was $25 when I called!\n\nMe: That was two days ago. The fine is by the hour.\n\nH: You didn't tell me that!\n\nMe: The fine info is taped to the side of the charger. Tell you what; I'll go ahead and waive everything but that first $25, alright? You'd just pay the fine you thought you'd pay.\n\nH: But the guy on the phone told me he would waive it!\n\n\nI didn't tell him that.\n\n\nMe: I'm waiving $60. So you only have to pay $25.\n\nH: I want to talk to your boss!\n\n\nNow at this point I should mention that we aren't strictly *allowed* to waive fines, it's just that the library can't tell the difference between a fine waived by a manager or just an employee. I was being generous.\n\n\nMe: If I bring my manager in here, you'll just have to pay the whole fine.\n\nH: I want to talk to him.\n\n\nSo I bring in my manager. After hearing the situation, my manager bluntly says:\n\n\nManager: It's an $85 fine, will that be cash or card?\n\n\nHe stammered and walked out of the library.\n\nIt's okay though. He just can't check out books or graduate until the fine is paid. C'est la vie.\n\n\n\nEdit: the charger is free for 5 hours. Most people don't pay anything. Also it says on the charger it's not allowed to leave the building. If they remember to turn it in before they leave, the maximum fine they could possibly get (if they rent the charger at the very beginning of the day and don't return it until close) is $16.\n\nHe took it home, kept it well past the 5 hour mark, hence the ridiculous fine cost. All library properties cap out at $100 or the price of the object (whichever is higher).\n\nAlso I feel like I didn't emphasize HOW rude he was. He was basically short of yelling at me, so hopefully that clears up some frequent questions :)",

Nothing about it for the rest of elementary nothing about it for middle school but come high school when I need to rent a book for class I get told you need to return the book from elementary school or else you can't graduate. I would also note that by the time I was told this most of my siblings had moved out and taken things with them and with the automatic descion that I won't be reading any books any time soon (they were right but that's not a story for now) a lot of books were taken. I had no idea who took the book no one had found the book where they live it could be in a dumpster in Toronto for all anyone knows.

Some where lying but some where also aware that we were deciding individually. Now we changed it so that we don't waive any charges at the counter. If someone want's to object or is saying they have a valid reason, we give them a form to fill out and always the same person looks over those cases. (We still usually waive a part of it because we are not monsters) But this way less people actually ask to waive the fees because they think the form is too much hassle.

Long story short I was told by head librarian school policy (and one he disagrees with) is each lost book costs $100 if another copy of the exact edition can't be provided. Due to some shady ass shit in the accounts department (NOT the library), the window for providing copies of the books disappeared prematurely and several months ago I began getting calls from a collection agency saying I owed $650. I stopped getting calls and my credit score's gone back up so god only knows what's happening now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know what I expected from a school whose president, during commencent, told people $10,000's in debt three different times not to forget about them now that we're successful alum.

        "selftext": "Quite some time ago I used to work at Walmart and honestly it was by far the worst job I've ever had. I could go on for hours about all the horror stories I have from that place. One story in particular I feel is a good fit here.\n\nYou see, the store I worked in had a rule that if you see a spill, you are to guard the area to keep customers from slipping and falling. You were not to leave the spill for any reason while you flagged down another employee so that they could fetch cleaning supplies (only managers and the cleaning crew had radios). I understand the logic here as a lawsuit would certainly cost much more than an hourly employee's time standing next to a spill until it was cleaned up. However there are a few issues with this in practice.\n\nI worked the evening shift in the Meat Department and most days I was the only person in my department. I was situated between Frozen Foods and Produce, which more often than not only had 1 person shifts as well but they also closed much earlier than my department. This meant that I was the only person in my corner of the store for about half of my shift. If I came across a spill there was no telling how long I would have to wait around for another employee to come by because there was literally nobody else working in or around my area. Also, being in the Meat Department, we had multiple cleaning stations all around. One was always a few steps away.\n\nOne day while working alone I noticed a small spill. So I stood next to it per procedure for about 10 minutes. In this time nobody, customer nor coworker, had even entered my view. I couldn't help but think how dumb this was as I could see a cleaning station just on the other side of a bunker. I decided to throw in the flag and just go get the cleaning supplies and take care of it myself because even if a customer did come around I could still see the spill and easily call out to them to watch their step. Unsurprisingly, I was able to make the round trip without any incidents. \n\nAs I was cleaning it a manager came walking up and took notice of me.\n\nManager, \"What happened here?\"\n\nMe, \"Just a spill. I've got it all sorted.\"\n\nManager, \"Did you just happen to have cleaning supplies on you?\"\n\nMe, \"No, but they were just right there. I was able to fetch them without losing sight of the spill.\"\n\nManager, \"That's not how we do things! Someone could have gotten hurt!\"\n\nMe, \"No, as I could have called to anyone that came near it. I was never more than a few steps away.\"\n\nManager, \"Doesn't matter. You should have stood next to the spill and waited for someone else to come by.\"\n\nThis when on for a few minutes but the manager was not budging so I conceded. That was not good enough for him as he then proceeded to write me up for \"Negligence and unsafe work practices\". I was livid, but I was also a college student and needed the job so I just kept quiet and returned to my shift.\n\nA week or two later as I was once again the only person working in my corner of the store, I happened upon another spill. This time I shrugged and decided to guard it as if my job depended on it. I checked my watch and noticed that I had about 3 hours left on my shift and had a small laugh at the thought that I might be standing in that spot guarding a puddle instead of closing my department.\n\n10 minutes passed.\n\n30 minutes passed.\n\n1 hour passed.\n\nAround this time I was bored out of my mind, but then I heard a call over the intercom system that made it so much more worth it. \"We need an associate from the Meat Department to the back for a truck.\" This was followed by a few other calls for other departments for their trucks arriving as well. I started laughing out loud at this because I knew that this meant that the very few people that were likely to come by my department were now at the loading dock unloading trucks while I stood guard over my puddle.\n\nA few minutes passed before I heard the second call, \"We need an associate from the Meat Department to the back for a truck\". I just stood there counting the lights on the ceiling.\n\n1 hour left on my shift and there still had not been a single fellow employee walk by. I assumed everyone was starting to finish up their own trucks by this point and would likely soon have to start unloading my truck as well. I was watching the minutes go by in anticipation trying to decide if someone would come find me before my shift ended or not.\n\nI got my answer 15 minutes before the end of my shift as the very same manager from before came storming through the Meat Department furious. We made eye contact and he stormed over to me and started yelling about how they have been calling for me to unload the truck and how they are now behind schedule and so on. Once he took a breath long enough for me to speak I asked simply, \u201cCan you go to a spill station and grab something to clean this up? I\u2019ve been here a while now.\u201d He glanced down at the puddle next to me and I thought he was going to explode. \n\nManager, \u201cYou mean to tell me that you didn\u2019t unload the truck because you were watching a spill?\u201d\n\nMe, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nManager, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just clean it up?\u201d\n\nMe, \u201cBut leaving the spill would be unsafe for any customers. Besides, you wrote me up for doing that very thing recently, right?\u201d\n\nThe manager tossed his hands up in defeat and walked the 15 steps away to the nearest spill station and returned with supplies, that he promptly gave me to clean the spill myself. \n\nManager, \u201cOnce you are done go back to the loading dock and start on your truck.\u201d\n\nMe, \u201cSorry, I have only about 10 minutes left on my shift and as I\u2019ve been standing here guarding the spill I never got my second break. So I\u2019m going to the break room for a bit before clocking out. You\u2019ll need to find someone to close down my department as well.\u201d\n\nAt this the manager just stomped off in a rage. I cleaned up the spill, played on my phone in the breakroom for a bit, and clocked out with a smile on my face. I know that the manager just made someone else do all the work and wasn\u2019t personally affected by this, but knowing that I could be a thorn in his side was enough for me.",

I still have to send the box back with the old account AND they sent me a new box for the new account.\n\nTLDR: Rep couldn't add the package to my  account created just 13 days ago because AT&T so I cancel the current account then immediately setup a new account to get the promotional offer of HBO and HBO Max for free for a year.\n\nI know they have to follow certain steps but wouldn't it have just been easier for them to add the package to the existing account.

The system gives a list of available retention offers and that list is a function of billing history, age of account, time elapsed since a previous offer was applied, the level of service on the account, and the CSR\u2019s access level. For a new account, there\u2019s next to nothing available to even offer. Each CSR has some dollar-value limit for discounts and retention offers that they can add to an account in a given interval and, if we exceeded that limit, we would have to walk over to our supervisor and pitch the case to them so they could apply the discount. Those CSRs have no meaningful degree of autonomy or flexibility and they get screamed at all day every day for terrible pay. Please be nice to them; it\u2019s a terrible job.",

            "I was in business assurance for a cable provider - it\u2019s a finance role but a bit broader.  We had automated audit reports to \u201ccatch\u201d shit like this and come up with better solutions (like automatic escalation approval for customers who fall *just* outside the promo window and complain).  Those solutions take a lot of time / effort to implement business wide, though, so I doubt every business does that in advance.  It\u2019s absolutely not in the Rep\u2019s power (or best interest) to try to break the system\u2019s rules.  Corporate Marketing would be the one who sets these rules and they have to be veeeeery specific because they can\u2019t have promos without providing an estimated cost.  That cost is generally split by the provider, as well, so HBO has a $ they\u2019re expecting to shoulder.  The only way to get a cost is to specify who qualifies.  I hate that people think the Rep has any power or responsibility for setting the rules.  Sorry - long winded way of saying that I totally understand the frustration but CSRs shoulder far too much of the burden from customers for complying with this stuff.  It\u2019s not up to them.  It\u2019s not even up to their Managers or department heads.

It was run by a \"chairman\" who used to be a flight engineer, and who had no experience at all in the software industry. One day, in his expansive wisdom, Mr. Chairman decided that we were going to give his friend (a local pastor) an office. I was ordered by Mr. Chairman to make it impossible for anybody (\"Even you!!!\") to access any of Mr. Pastor's files (because, y'know, privacy and stuff). I attempted to point out a couple of problems with that scenario, but was immediately shut down and ordered to do what I was told.\n\nNow, this particular person had... well, let's call it a quirk. When anything went wrong with his computer, his solution was to format his C: drive. (Yeah, I know...) The inevitable happened, and Mr. Chairman ordered me to restore all of Mr. Pastor's files from the backup (which we normally did... ahem... religiously). I looked at him innocently and said \"What backup?\" It took possibly five seconds for steam to begin pouring from his ears, and for him to start screaming, \"YOU MEAN YOU DIDN'T DO A BACKUP??? WHY YOU....!!!!\" and so on. I waited for him to finish, and then asked him politely how he proposed that I do a backup of files that I'm not allowed to have any access to?

A whole room full of DEC PDP 11/70s, kinda the predecessor of the VAX.  Two notable events there.  First, the old multi-platter disk packs came in removable plastic cases, like old cake boxes.  You were supposed to put the pack into the drive, then unscrew the cover and remove it.  One operator failed to do this, and due to lack of any hardware safeguards, the arm with the read/write heads punched through the cover and scragged the disks.  Thinking this was a drive error, the op moved the blasted pack from one drive to another down the line until a senior op stopped him from destroying the rest of the drives.  Fortunately, there were redundant systems that failed over all the 1200 directory assistance operators and no interruptions occurred.  Expensive, though.  The second one had a little more impact.  They had massive backup power systems for the data center, starting with batteries that were good for a few minutes until the diesel generators could start and stabilize.  First power failure everything switched to the batteries just fine, and then everything went dark.  Turns out they had wanted to use above-ground fuel tanks for the gennys but the city or county or somebody insisted that they use underground ones.  Somehow those never got built so the generators couldn't start.

        "selftext": "Back at the beginning of 2021, I worked at a small community health non profit with an insane CEO. She would constantly call team meetings to put down and belittle employees in front of the entire staff. Often, she would throw around some variation of \"do I have to do everything around here?!\" and call everyone on staff incompetent. When we did do something right, she never gave us credit and always took the credit for herself. She threatened firing everyone constantly and would randomly call us to gossip and make petty remarks about each other, pitting staff against each other. \n\nOne day, the CEO called a team meeting. In a group text chat between some of the more chill employees, we immediately begin sending snake and eye roll emojis. Sure enough, we get on the call and she begins by bringing to our attention how \"Louise\" does not dress appropriately for work. Louise, who is also upper management (the COO), looks about ready to smack the CEO. The CEO viciously tears into Louise, commenting on everything from her hair style to her lipstick shade to how it's inappropriate for Louise to wear off the shoulder blouses that show her collar bone. She then tells everyone that we all had better start dressing more formally or there would be consequences. \n\nThe next day, the CEO calls another meeting. We all join and Louise turns on her camera. I immediately had to turn off mine because I did not want to be caught laughing my ass off. Louise was dressed from head to toe in what looked like something someone would wear to prom. Her hair was immaculately styled into an elaborate updo, her makeup was professionally done with lash extensions and everything. She was dripping with (what I assume were) fake diamonds... tiara, earrings, necklace, bracelets, and rings. And she wore the most ridiculous navy blue satin and tulle formal gown with a faux fur shoulder shrug to cover her collar bone. My best guess is that it was an old bridesmaid dress, but she never did say where she got it. \n\nThe CEO was immediately fuming. \"Why are you dressed like that?!\" she screeched.\n\n\"You told us to dress more formally. This is formal wear. Is something wrong?\"\n\n\"That's not professional for work!\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm sorry, I must have been confused! You said we needed us to dress formally, but I think what you meant to say was professionally.\" The CEO was livid, but Louise continued to rock the prom outfit all day, meeting with patients and clients and everything. \n\nLater that week, \"Tina\" texts our group chat and says the CEO is requiring her to submit and detailed time sheet with what she was doing and working on down to the minute for her entire day. She was going to bcc us on the email. Sure enough, it pops into our inboxes a few minutes later. \n\nTina had literally detailed her entire past 24 hour day down to the minute. 6:45 AM, awoken by husband's flatulence. 7:00 AM, peed and changed menstrual pad. 7:02 AM, began bowel movement. 7:10 AM, completed bowel movement. 7:12 AM, turned on shower. 7:13 AM, tested water temperature with hand. You get the idea. Apparently the CEO called her on her cell phone and berated her for sending such a detailed timesheet. Tina reminded her that she had requested her entire day down to the minute, and didn't specify she meant her work day only. \n\nFinally, my turn. My job was in IT and most of my work was as a database administrator, but I often helped with other tech problems. One morning, the CEO called me repeatedly at 2 AM. My phone settings have it so that if I miss five calls in a row from the same person, the do not disturb mode is turned off and the phone rings. I see who it is, silence my phone, and refuse to answer. \n\nAt 6 AM, she calls again. Again, I refuse to answer. 7 AM, refuse to answer. 8 AM, refuse to answer. Finally, at 9 AM, I call her back. She asks to hop on a video call. \n\n\"I've been trying to get ahold of you all morning! Where have you been?!\"\n\n\"*Loud sigh* Can I help with you something?\" I asked, not even trying to hide my irritation. I literally rubbed my temples and slurped on my coffee loudly.\n\n\"You didn't answer my question\"\n\n\"And I'm not going to. I was off the clock at the time you called\"\n\n\"You're salaried, right? That means it doesn't matter if you work 100 hours or 1 hour, you get paid the same. So I expect you to be available when I need you\"\n\n\"What do you need?\" \n\n\"I need you to reset all of our company usernames and passwords. We're letting someone go today and it's company policy to change all of that\"\n\nAt the same time, Louise texts me that she is being let go. So I read the company handbook and make a copy of the page that says the IT person must update the usernames and passwords and give the information to the COO. I changed all of the usernames and passwords to everything, from social media accounts to bank accounts to QuickBooks and emails. I send the usernames and passwords in an encrypted email to Louise and then send the CEO my two week notice.\n\nTwo weeks go by. It's the last hour of my last day. So what do I do? Change all those usernames and passwords again and send them to Louise, who was also celebrating her last day. I log out of my email, put my company phone and laptop in the mail, and spend the evening cackling at my malicious compliance.\n\nThe very next day, on Saturday, the CEO calls me repeatedly. Finally, she leaves me a long and howling voicemail to say what I did was unprofessional and she would make sure my reputation suffered and I would never work in that industry again. I wait until Monday to call her back.\n\n\"Hey, CEO, I saw you called?\"\n\n\"I need the usernames and passwords to everything!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, but I don't work there anymore. You will have to contact your IT person to help with that\"\n\n\"You are the IT person!\" \n\n\"No, I was the IT person. Now I'm a private consultant and I would be happy to provide my services at a rate of $100 an hour\"\n\n\"You changed all the usernames and passwords and didn't provide them to me!\"\n\n\"Correct. Per company policy, when an employee leaves the organization, the IT person is supposed to update everything and send the new info to the COO. I was leaving, so I updated everything. I provided all the usernames and passwords to Louise\"\n\n\"You knew she was quitting too! Why would you give them to her?\"\n\n\"Because the company policy says to transfer the new username and passwords to the COO, not the CEO. Louise was the COO when I left\"\n\nCaught in her own bureaucracy, she then had to spend weeks trying to gain access to all of the company accounts.\n\nOn Louise's and my last day, Tina and another employee quit. Another person announced her retirement. Once the five of us were gone, we were followed by several other employees. In total, 11 people on the 14 person staff quit within a few weeks. The best part? I got a new job making the same amount I did at the shitty non profit, but part time in a government position and with full time benefits. So much for my reputation suffering! I stayed in touch with one of the employees who stayed behind (she's only three years away from retirement and is basically Stan from the office). She said they've hired at least a dozen people, all of them quit as soon as they could find another job. \n\nAnyway, I'm bored in the hospital and started going through old texts. Stumbled on our old group chat and had a good chuckle. Thought you all might find it humorous too. Names obviously changed.\n\nEdit: I'm still new to Reddit, so I had to ask my husband about the awards. Thank you all, it's very sweet of you, but please don't spend your money on this.

Thank you. \n\nWith regards to the awards, a lot of people get them for free (if they\u2019re using the Reddit app, they get one free one a week or so; if they were given certain levels of awards they also get free coins that can then be used to \u2018buy\u2019 awards). Or they may already have a Reddit premium subscription which gives them a certain amount of coins every month. Or they may be straight up buying them for 3.99 or whatever it is. Basically, I\u2019m saying you can enjoy the awards instead of feeling bad about people spending money on them :) \n\nThat\u2019s what awards are for! To make people feel happy. They also give a post more visibility, so more people will get to read and enjoy it.",

            "Just a quick heads up, since you say you're new to Reddit:\n\nEveryone can see everyone else's post and comment history. Anyone (even people not on Reddit) can click on a person's profile and see that person's entire history of posts and comments (unless a user deletes their posts/comments). \n\nThere is no way to make a profile \"private\", so unless you're okay with Louise, your COO, being able to see literally ALL of your past and future posts/comments, you should probably create a different Reddit account and throw this one away. It's also possible that she could share your account name with someone else, and they would also be able to see all your past/future posts & comments. It's probably not very likely that anything bad will come of you losing your anonymity (to this person), but considering how easy it is to make another Reddit account, in this case it's probably better safe than sorry!",

We got on ok, would go out to parties together etc. Most of the stuff in the house was theirs, I only brought my fridge, and they had just thrown theirs out, considering it replaced.\n\nI'm about to get the week's groceries and ask my housemate if she wants anything, no she's good. I get lots of food to cook for the week and come home, to find her standing awkwardly with her boyfriend. She had \"weird news.\" They had decided to move out together! How exciting! Ok, so I guess that means I take over the lease? Nope, they considered themselves the last in a long line of friends who'd leased the house, and being the last to go, thought it fitting to terminate the lease. They had notified the landlord prior to speaking to any of us. They figured I could stay with my sister, jack was only in the country another month, and Sarah was hardly here anyway.\n\nOk so I didn't have a leg to stand on, legally, I wasn't signed on the lease, so I had 3 weeks to vacate. Househunting is like a part time job, and I already had a full time job. No time to cook all that food I guess. Would have been good to know before the shop.\n\nI got lucky and found a house just down the road on the same day. Nice people, good spot, and close enough that I could move my things in by hand, immediately if I like! I slept in my new house that night, but I always like to think you haven't really moved in until your fridge is in, and don't worry I had that sorted too.\n\nThe others in the house found new places quickly too, leaving the happy couple home alone.\n\nI came back to pick up a couple of loose ends 3 weeks later and got to see their fridge workaround in all its slumly glory. An Esky full of food floating in melted ice. The revenge was petty and small, proportionate to their actions.",

The third roommate who I barely knew as she was never there informed me that she and her bf would be moving in and resigning the lease, and that would mean I couldn\u2019t get back any of my deposit that I was hoping to get back (and she would get to rent our place without paying any deposit and pocketing the refund when she moved out later on). At first she refused to pay me the deposit I paid and told me the landlord said she didn\u2019t have to either. I was not ok with this so I put up a fight and refused to sign the addendum that would take me off the lease and let her and her bf resign for another year until she agreed to pay me my part of the deposit!",

It turned out she had never (ever) paid the gas, used the money to go clubbing and buy alcohol, and thought if she didn't pay it she could make me pay it. I refused, put a space heater in my bedroom, and started using the shower at work. That night I came home and found she had taken my space heater to use in her room. (I turn it off whenever I'm not there, so it's not a fire hazard. She turned it on and left.) So I took it back, heated my room that evening, and hid it (unplugged, of course) when I left for work.\n\nShe moved out two days later. The landlord tried to stick me with the rent for the whole place. I refused, on the grounds that my agreement with him was to rent my bedroom, not the whole place, the rest of the place was *his* problem. He then tried to get me to pay the next month's rent. (It was going to be the last month, the lease was up and I wasn't going to stay with a crappy landlord and no heat.) I pointed out to him that he had not asked for a deposit, he asked for \"last month's rent\", I had written that on the check, he had cashed it and not deposited it in a bank and given me statements as would have been required if it was a security deposit, so I wasn't giving him another dime.

She never should have been discharged with an active fungal infection in her bloodstream and she certainly would have died had she taken another dose of her heart meds.

At first it was horrible and I really grew to hate Sprint's customers, but at the end I became very used to all of their demands and all of the unpleasantries associated with the job. I saw everyone around me struggling while I managed to disarm most angry people and make them talk to me for a couple of minutes as well before leaving about trivial things, which is great, 'cause I'm getting paid and I could've gotten a worse call.\n\nYou give a good tip. Older men and women love to have a chat, especially if you adopt a very easygoing, nice, sweet tone of voice and talk to them with respect. I speak English at a native level but I am from Romania so I always used this as an excuse to get them to ask me \"Oh wow, really? Tell me more about your country!\" which would generally prolong the conversation by a lot.\n\nMost angry or upset people can be placated if you just stay calm, firm, and make sure not to offend them in any way as they're on a hair trigger. It's really important to find out what they want and to be able to tell them tactfully if you can't really help them. Then it just becomes a \"make them feel bad\" game so they feel a compulsion to spend a couple of minutes more with you on the phone.  I've learned thousands of tricks and ways to optimize my time in that hellhole of a place and to actually have fun out of it and I've talked with so many people over the phone, shed a tear with them, offered them support, encouraged them to do what they want, told them not to worry, etc. \n\nIt was really fun and it made me feel better and not go home a defeated, tired person from being yelled at all day. It works if you know what you're doing. A lot of people need affection and appreciation so even a weird \"Don't worry, everything's fine, I love you!\" from an unknown Sprint employee over the phone can mean SO much to some people. One of my most touching calls was with a bodybuilder called Hassan Banks which as far as I recall suffers from a muscle condition. It made me so happy to share my appreciation and support for him powering through his issues and we had a nice little chat afterwards, bro-hugging it out over the phone.\n\nThat was just one of hundreds of talks that were important to me and that I probably won't forget that easily. Call centres are so, so hard to bear with... but **there's a trick.** Love **everyone** and they'll find a way to love you back - and even if they don't, then you'll be in a better state of mind than you would be otherwise anyways if you would have been affected negatively by their energy.\n\nTry to thrive in a call center, not to get overencumbered. Corporate talk aside, putting a smile on your face always helps. Try to apply that to any social situation as well, as people are more naturally inclined to respond positively and to trust people who are easy to laugh.\n\nAnyways.",

We spoke for hours, guy had an old school charm to him that just made conversation flow. I spent the next few hours after the call reading through his memoirs as well, though his blog has now been replaced with some random garbage disposal blog. The fact that I can still recall his name shows how memorable he was.\n\nI decided to look him up just now and found an integral copy of his experiences, pictures and all, on a veterans page, but not much about him outside of that. So, I decided to look up his friend, Orme Payne. I found a blog post from a reporter who mentioned having met both men and penned an article on their friendship of 85 years. \n\nHe related his grief to Orme's passing in September of 2020. Orme himself had also gone through grief of his own, coming to terms with the passing of his great friend Gordie only 2 years prior, in 2018.

I get that it's not your fault though; I once worked for a company like this.\n\nI got laid off because of poor performance numbers, even though they never said directly that's what it was. My team handled computer assessment, cleanup, and repair for a major banking client. Me and one other guy took on laptop repair because we were technical enough and liked it. He only took on a few plus a more basic workload, per day, where as I at one point took on only laptops. The problem was getting parts from another department took an entire day. You'd essentially have dogshit outputs for one day, where you got a lot of prep and part ordering done, and really high outputs the alternate day when the repairs were processed as complete. Didn't help that a complex laptop repair was worth just a few \"points\" more than some really basic shit. My assumption is that they  thought I was slacking off, when in reality I was burning through their backlog of (relatively) highly technical repairs way fucking faster than everyone else on my team. The same team members that were like \"don't do too much per day, just hit this target\". They even laid me off after a particularly tiring day where I volunteered for a special project to set up some additional work benches for another department. \n\nNeedless to say things have changed for me since then lol. Everyone at that company was so miserable though, it was astounding. Some employees had been there as techs for like 15 years... day in and day out in boring conditions, getting $0.25 (hourly) annual raises.\n\nHow can companies create situations like that and not realize their policies and culture are actually ineffective, and even harmful. Like, one day that company, despite being massive, is going to get bought out or fizzle out on their own because no one wants to work there and they can't adapt.

It is such a waste of my time. Usually after a second call i either drop them or refuse to have another one. Sometimes they try to lock information from me unless we have a call and that's the moment i let them know we will not be compatible.

            "I lasted about 3 months at a call center for Sprint/T-Mobile in 2015. \n\nWe were trained for two months. Best easiest pay in the world the training was. \n\nThen came when we got out of training. \n\nI didn\u2019t last. It was nerve racking and shitty. If you had to take a shit longer than your 1 5 minute pee break it would be forced into your lunch. And working there made my stomach upset so I had to take shits a lot. \n\nYou get screamed at all the time. If it\u2019s a customer that has called before and there is no notes in the file, then your fucked and have to take the customers word for it. \n\nMy last day I forgave a 4000-5000 dollar bill. The dude was screaming at me the whole time, nothing I said could calm him down even though I was working diligently to see why his bill was the way it was. It was obviously some shenanigans on Sprints part. I just don\u2019t remember exactly but it wasn\u2019t his fault. I completely forgave the debt and wiped his account to zero. Dude still screamed and demanded to know my name. We aren\u2019t supposed to give out our names other than first name. He pressed for more I told him no. He said he was going to call back and hold me to my word and if the bill wasn\u2019t fixed, even though it was, he would have my job. \n\nI kinda laughed after the call cause my name is super duper common in the United States. And there was atleast 10 in our call center with that name. \n\nIt\u2019s also why I started smoking again. That job. Everyone told me I would be perfect for it because I was a super fast typer and my voice is super nice, calming and sexy apparently. (Other people\u2019s words, not mine) \n\nBunch of other shit happened that day too and I decided the hour drive to it, even though it was ridiculously good pay, the stress and abuse from the employers and from the customers wasn\u2019t worth it in the least. \n\nI\u2019ll never work for a call center again in my life again. I\u2019ll go back to McDonalds and work before that happens and I\u2019m disabled and can barely stand for more than 10 minutes if I\u2019m lucky. Rather drag my ass across the greasy floor at McDonald\u2019s than work at a call center again. \n\nI don\u2019t know how my brother did it for as many years as he did, and he was a debt collector.",

Like even down to saying my name 3 times on the call (don't ask why I don't know either). It was a retention call and the customer explicitly said: \"I Don't want to be sold anything. If you do I will cancel\". I Talked to this individual like a human, resolved all his issues and turned a really angry and upset customer, who didn't trust us, into a happy customer satisfied with his experience with me. \n\nI was put on a disciplinary as he was a \"candidate for our multi-service discount\" meaning, if I x-sell him a mobile service with us (ISP company) then he will be better off. \n\nHowever shortly after I received a \"well done\" from another agent (a recognition scheme where a customer can send a commendation about their experience) and the customer statement read \"I was delighted with your help, I was due to renew my mobile contract with a competitor company, but I am now joining your company all because of your service\". \n\nI still had that disciplinary on my record!",
            "Haha, I never spent 6 hrs on one call, but I used to do this all the time. My average handle time was always really low, because most problems could be solved in about 5 clicks. It doesn't take 3 1/2 minutes to do 5 clicks! But did my managers appreciate my efficiency? Noooooo... They wanted me to talk to the customers, be friendly with the customers.\n\nSo every shift, there were 1 or 2 old ladies who would call in and want to talk about everything under the sun. And I let them. I sat back, played stupid games on the computer, and let them talk for about half an hour. With 2 30-min calls, it balanced out my handle time very nicely. Managers never did catch on (or if they did, they never said anything to me about it).\n\nOf course, this is the same place that, on my last day, I gave the full credit I was allowed to every customer who was nice to me. Probably spent close to $1000 of the company's money that day, and I didn't care at all, because everything I did was totally within the rules, and what were they going to do?

        "selftext": "So a little short one, the problem of people taking smoke breaks during the work day, basically at my job on average the smokers take about 5-10, 5-15min (paid since they don't clock out) smoke breaks.\n\nThe non smokers which are surprisingly in the minority (7 out of 25) including me asked to take a break when the smokers do. Manager says that they are only for smokers and if everyone went on them then there would be too much of a lack in productivity and we would fall behind. \n\nAs anyone can realize, that is bullshit. So I went online to Amazon and bought all of the non smokers \"Herbal Smokes that are Tobacco, Nicotine and Additive free\" basically just a cigarette filled with tea leaves. And we started going on smoke breaks but hanging out in our own corner to avoid the secondhand. \n\nThe manager comes out and starts yelling asking what we were doing, he thought we didn't smoke, we should be working...to which we kindly pointed out that we had all decided to start smoking and that, well we were smoking along with everyone else there. \n\nThis lasted 4 days before the manager set limits to how many and how long smoke breaks are, and let the non smokers take the same breaks too.\n\nAlso: I am not sure about the health affects of Herbal Smokes, but considering we just lit the ends on fire then stood against the wall like some guys outside a club from the 80's, so I think we're fine.\n\nEdit: So it is an 8 hour shift. With two 15min breaks and a 30min lunch (but everyone including managers take an hour) so 1.5hrs of paid breaks. So of the 6.5hrs remaining people were taking 1-2hrs just to smoke.\n\nEdit 2: I appreciate the responses, I try to read all the direct comments. To summarize, a couple people say I ruined it for the smokers. A couple people with manager point of views. A bunch of similar MC and taking breaks as well, and a very large amount of people starting smoking to take smoke breaks.",

            "A little malicious compliance of my own here. I used to work in an office and at the time I was a smoker. I was expected to clear x volume of work a day. I easily cleared double. When a manager called me out about the OCCASIONAL smoke break I pointed out that since I did the work of two people did ten minutes twice a day really matter? He said no you can only smoke on your official breaks. So I reverted to meeting only my benchmark exactly. He ended up having to hire another person to cover the excess outstanding volume of work",
            "I always called my breaks fresh air breaks when I worked with smokers lol.  I\u2019d just go out with them and talk. I worked in an office setting tho.  Real estate. Commission only  and lots of free time.",
            "As a shift manager at a Taco Bell down in Georgia, I would often give my high school employees \"fresh air breaks\" when business slowed down. One of them mentioned how unfair it was for non-smokers when smokers got paid smoke breaks. \n\nWhen I would have people call in sick those kids would volunteer to come in and cover shifts on their days off. They wouldn't come in for the other managers, most wouldn't even answer the phones when they saw it was the work number calling.",
            "At one place I worked, many of my colleagues would regularly wander off for a smoke so I decided to have a cuppa at the same time (I don't smoke). The very first day I did this, the boss pulled me up and had an unofficial word with me: Don't Do It Again.\n\nSo the next day I grabbed my tea and went out with the smokers. Said hi to the aforementioned boss, and stood squarely in his line of sight. Not smoking, just drinking my cuppa.\n\nDay 3: Smokers went for their break, and I making a cuppa when the boss walked past on his way out for a smoke.\n\n\"Hi \\[Ich\\_mag\\_Kartoffeln\\].\"\n\n\"G'day \\[boss\\].\"\n\nAnd nothing more was ever said or done about it.",

            "My mom used to weave yarns about how she bitched about this same thing at a laboratory she worked at back in the very early 90s (1990/1991).  Management was being dictatorial about breaks, but smokers could still take up to 5 additional breaks, and my mom piped up about all of the smokers in the room and their frequent smoke breaks.  If they can take 5 smoke breaks throughout the day, 5 minutes each break, then she should be allowed 5 \"fresh air\" breaks.  Management realized how ridiculous it was to allow smokers extra breaks, and therefore said smokers may only smoke during the designated 15-minute breaks and lunch hour.",

But all of the smokers also got two 10 minute smoke breaks. Which was kind of bullshit because I figured it up that that equaled to me working an extra 100 minutes a week, or 5200 minutes a year. 86 hours, or a full two week, full time paycheck each year that I was working and every other person in the store was not.

            "I would take a break whenever my coworker came back from taking a smoke break. Sometimes I'd get coffee, sometimes I'd go visit my aunt (across the street) or my mom and her bff (diagonal across the street), since I didn't smoke.\n\nShe was supposed to be the office manager but was also an admin.  When I was promoted from project assistant (basically the person who did the stuff nobody else wanted to do, and relieved receptionist for breaks) to admin, she set all these rules for me, about dress codes and breaks. Until that point I wore jeans and nicer t-shirts and would have a sweater with me in case I had to look presentable, at the front desk.  Since I was usually tasked with moving documents, boxes and filing, I was often covered with dust and didn't want to ruin my nicer clothes. Anyway, I asked if the same applied to her, because she was standing there in a stained tunic with threads pulled, over stirrups (dating myself!) and a turtle neck.  This was her standard of dress, because she never interacted with clients, and I don't think most people there would have said much anyway, out of worry about being rude.  I didn't care that much but I also was not going to be held to a different standard than the \"office manager.\"   She got SO offended at first, but she did start dressing nicer and she also had to limit her breaks to the same she though the rest of us should, because the guy who DID actually run the office thought it was only fair that she should be held to the same rules, as she was technically an admin too. lol",

This was when I was 21 and all the non smoking drivers had to fold pizza boxes while the smokers congregated outside while waiting on deliveries. I got tired of folding all the damn boxes but wasn't as slick as you so I started bumming smokes from coworkers. One smoke lead to another then my own pack.

            "I had a gal get treated the same because she was the ONLY non-smoker in her work center.  When she told me I had her take a \"smoke break\" as soon as they came back and for the exact same time they did.  Her supervisor noted it but never came to talk to me, but they quit treating her like a mule simply because they're addicted.  \n\nI recommend to anyone facing a similar issue to do the same.  I worked a 12.5 hour shift, two half hour and two 15 minute breaks were all they allotted, they can figure it out.  And I am a smoker.  If they're leaving butts all over the place, as is common, point out to your management how unprofessional it is and get their smoke pit removed to the street.  Cuts your break down a lot, but they can always regain the priviledge if they can adult their butts into a receptacle.  Absolutely hate that behaviour.",

            "On my first job, I was the only non-smoker out of maybe 100-120. Everyone smoked. From the top boss to the apprentices. Some of the managers had smoker offices. (and they would of course hold as many meetings as they could in those offices so everyone could light up, but that's another story).\nSo, after any regular coffee or lunch break, they would add a \"quick\" smoke break outside on the terrace, which would easily stretch out to half an hour or so. Thing is, almost every decision would be made during those smoke breaks, and everybody else would know about them! And then they'd be surprised that I was surprised :)",

            "I worked hotel front desk for 3 years before getting promoted to reservations manager. When I worked FD everyone was constantly told/reminded they SHOULD take their 2 15s, especially on busy days because it can be extremely stressful.\n\nWhen I was promoted the FD got a new director of rooms who was the absolute WORST human I have ever personally met. I found out she was refusing the 2 15s to anyone that doesn't smoke and would go out to CHECK that people were in deed smoking.\n\nI LOST it. We didn't  keep a single new hire FD agent for more than 3 months and two if the three seasoned agents left within 6 months of her getting hired. Now they didn't leave JUST for the smoke break reason, but that was the only thing I could report her for to HR because it is state and company policy to allow those breaks no matter if they smoke or not. So I did. And the agents got to take their 2 15s. \n\nI'm sure she didn't know it was me but since I had experience I started getting pulled to the desk to cover these 15s since they were short staffed cause she's a horrible person and boss. She didn't like me because the desk staff I think liked me more than her. I also pushed back in some policies she wanted to put into place that genuinely would have made it harder for the desk to function. So I enjoyed the hell out of having her rely on me in a way so her staff could take their rightful breaks. Worth it.",

It actually seemed like a 50/50 split between smokers and non smokers (with another like 30% using that extra gross tobacco dip stuff, but they\u2019d just use that while working). \n\nEventually it caused the smoke breaks to be limited to 5 minutes an hour, but then we got our fresh air breaks too, just \u201cnot at the same times\u201d, which was fine with us.\n\nNaturally the smokers hated it, but it boggled my mind how the folks in charge did not/could not see the level of unfairness. Only reason we got our way I think is because the commanding officer was a non-smoker",
            "When I worked construction, we had actual smoke shacks on one site where the smokers could smoke, stay out of the weather, and had places to put their garbage.   I didnt really care but it was kinda annoying that they would disappear every hour or so for 5-10 mins when my breaks were a 15 min coffee and 1/2 hour lunch. After 6 months or so of this  AND being the hardest worker/most productive on my crew,   I politely told my Foreman that I would be taking sandwich/snack breaks Everytime they went to smoke.  His humorous response in front of everyone  was that he'd better see me eating something every time or ALL of us would lose our breaks.   Lmao, I was 23 and hitting the gym 4-6x a week so no problem.  I surely wasnt trying to fuck my coworkers out of their smoke breaks.  I carried a cooler with sandwiches, fruit, protein bars, and shakes, everywhere i went.

He laughed and asked if the smell was that bad. I said it was pretty bad. He asked if I wanted someone else to come in instead (and he wasn't offended or anything, he just wanted me to be comfortable). I said no, I still wanted him, because he talked with me. I also said that if he couldn't work it out so he could smoke after instead of before to just forget I even said anything. \n\nHe kept coming in.

The team leader office had three desks and one shared computer on its own desk (this was in 2002 or thereabouts). I let myself into the office, sat behind Boss's desk with the lights turned off, and waited the whopping thirty seconds it took for him to show up, turn on the lights, sit down at the computer, and start doing his own work.  \nCompletely unaware that he had company, I sat there for a solid minute resisting the urge to giggle. Eventually I said, \"Hi, Boss.\"\n\nHis head slowly turned around with his eyes popping out of their sockets. \"What the \\[redacted\\] are you doing in here?\"\n\n\"Just taking a short break. You know how it is.\"\n\nThe smoke breaks didn't really stop after that, but they sure got less frequent. Also, I wasn't allowed in the office by myself anymore.",

The system was self insured and related to decrease costs, all employees would have to stop using tobacco products.  One year warning was given and smoking cessation tools and classes provided free.  After one year if an employee was still a smoker there would be terminated.  Most smokers quit or left, a couple of people waited to be terminated then sued the health system and lost.",
            "Idk if it\u2019s an unpopular opinion but I don\u2019t think smoke breaks should exist, why would a company give out their time and money to people who specifically decide to smoke/ are addicted to it. Why make it their problem, if I was a smoker and my job told me no smoke breaks, and I couldn\u2019t during lunch, I sure as hell would have a problem with it and either wouldn\u2019t work there or decide I needed to fix my problem",

I was told by the Manager one day, as I was working on a particularly shitty set up, that since I didn't smoke, I should continue working through break so we can stay on schedule and not lose money on this job. I told him if 15 minutes was going to make or break the company, then someone else needs to be in charge of scheduling. Then I took my 15 minute  break.",

At my 8am-4:45pm job, I took one at the midpoint between start time and lunch break, and one at the midpoint between lunch and 4:45pm. My second job was from 5:00pm-10:00pm and I got one 15 minute break. All policy break times. As a smoker, I never thought asking for additional breaks was fair to my non-smoking coworkers, so I didn\u2019t ask for them or expect them. I also only smoked in designated areas or as far away from heavy walking traffic areas. I guess that makes me an apologetic smoker.\n\nWhen my nonsmoking friends accompany me on smoke breaks outside, I always hesitate to light up too, because smoking is gross. They always had to remind me to light the cigarette (non-work situations, since I had to watch the clock on work breaks). It was their choice to come with me, but my bad habit so I didn\u2019t like to force it on them.\n\nJust saying, my bad habits aren\u2019t a good reason to get special privileges. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve always approached smoke breaks. :)",

She doesn't help out on our department much, is often rude to the people she's supposed to lead, plus she doesn't even seem to know how to do her job... Drives me mad though that someone can be rewarded with more breaks because they're speeding up their demise with a foul smelling tube of sickness like that...

I noticed the imbalance immediately because not only would the smokers step out but they\u2019d often grab a soda or something to take with them thus making it more like a mini break. So I had a \u201ctake a breather\u201d policy for my non-smokers so they could step out for 5-10 minutes, get a drink, check texts, or whatever.",
            "We had a similar issue when I worked at a fast food chain. The smokers would take excessively long breaks and frequently throughout the day. They'd make themselves a coffee, some food and go to the staff room to get their phone and only THEN would they go out for a smoke. It'd easily end up 20-30m at LEAST 4 times per shift (between 6 and 10 hours) and they'd get their 30m/1hr break (depending on shift length) on top of that. Inevitably a clash between the smokers and non-smokers happened and they said you can either have your lunch breaks or smoke breaks, not both. Still worked out better for the smokers overall but it was close enough that everybody was happy with it.",
            "I had this argument with the GM. I started going outside with kids bubble blowing pots for 5 minutes every hour blowing bubbles. It was ridiculous. GM climbed down and stopped watching the clock so much.",
            "At the restaurant I worked at we had the same problem. As you may know, like 90% of servers smoke because its a crappy job. This one woman in particular whined so much about taking smoke breaks because she was a heavy smoker. She would also get other people to cover her tables while she smoked, which was too much. Every time she would ask me, I was \"too busy\". Finally some of the other non smokers were getting really pissed about getting stuck covering tables they weren't being tipped for, so whenever someone would go for a smoke break, when they came back, we would ask them to cover our tables while we took a smoke break. \n\nThis lasted like a month before one of them came to the back to find us sitting and bullshitting, but not smoking. They went and tattled to the manager, who then made a rule of NO smoke breaks during a shift.",
            "I had a job like this where smokers took a 5 minute break every hour in addition to their normal breaks and us non-smokers were left doing our actual job. A couple of us just started taking soda breaks. One manager said something and a coworker threatened to contact corporate about it. That was the last anyone said something.",

Though I had no desire to smoke, I thought it was unfair they could use it as an excuse to take a long-ass break so what I did is I would stand around or sit down and play on my phone for 10-20 minutes. \n\nWhen people would approach me about it (mostly smokers since like everyone there smoked) I would tell them \"well you get a smoke break so I get a video game break\" and I would mostly hear a lot of \"fair enough\" lol",

None of us were particularly ill-tempered to begin with, though many took \"getting punished before committing the crime\" as an excuse to behave accordingly. Not me though. \n\nAs the offspring of rebels myself, both my parents knew how to *subtly* break the rules. Kids would normally just wear a Marilyn Manson shirt, walking in with the expectation set that they wont get very far. I just started to wear plain black shirts. No baggy pants? Fine, dark jeans. No piercing? K. I was growing my hair out, but it wasnt enough. It wasnt *weird* enough. \n\nSo I sat down and combed through the entire dress code for the school district. I memorized the thing at the time. Turns out, there was absolutely nothing about hair color, or style, in the dress code, only that hair is to be kept clean. Nothing in the code about the color...*yet*.\n\nSo, of course, I went to school the next day with blue hair. I got lucky, as the principal was out that day. Got a lot of cross looks from the teachers, heads shaking slowly in concern, surprised looks from the students. I got home that day, and apparently the school had called the principal, who had personally called my parents, to express their \"concern.\" Evidently when my parents explained there was nothing in the dress code saying this was not allowed, my principal took this as a personal offense...which my parents took as a personal offense themselves. I took offense when I went back to school the next day and was greeted with a suspension notice. \n\nNATURAL COLORS ONLY\n\nOookay... \"Hey momma...yeah I got a letter about the hair...Jerry's mom is a stylist right? ...Cool. ...imma have her do my hair. Nope it says \"natural colors only\".....why no, no it does not specify *how many* natural colors are allowed...\"\n\nOf course, this quickly was also singled out (I say singled out for lack of a better term, I was quite literally the only one going to this much effort at this point), as people do not have naturally striped black, brown, blonde, and white hair. I was told as well that \"white\" isnt a natural color, which was incredibly odd considering the old bat that was in charge of that hellhole had white hair. ...\n\nI dont mean to hijack your thread. I'm sorry. I rarely get the chance to share stories like these anymore. The short version of this story is that this pattern of behavior continued for *years*. The only thing the school system taught me was how to maliciously comply with rules and piss people off constantly. If they would have spent half as much energy focused on what was in our heads, rather than what was **on** them...who knows, maybe we would've turned into well balanced adults instead of evenly balanced psychopaths.",

Please note that this was in the 90s and blue hair was not really that common back then here.\n\nSo I was walking out of a building when some guy, while talking on the cell phone passes by, looks at me in sheer shock and says to the other person on the phone \"This guy has blue hair\".
