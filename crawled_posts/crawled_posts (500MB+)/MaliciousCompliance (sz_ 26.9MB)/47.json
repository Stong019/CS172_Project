        "selftext": "This boss has since been fired, which makes this story so much sweeter, but this man was a Grade A Douchenozzle while he was there. Fired a coworker who's been there for years over petty shit. Constantly reminding people he was their boss. Asked me to do nonsense work and when I questioned it he just said he was in charge. Threatened to fire me multiple times for being \"disobedient\". Luckily I was trained to do a job only 3 people were trained to do and the coworker he fired was one of them. \n\nAnyway, he called everyone for a meeting about the dress code and said there were people not tucking their shirts in. Whatever, I always had my shirt tucked in so I thought I'd get left alone for a day. \n\nNope. \n\nHe comes over with the dress code printed out and says we have to talk. I asked what was up since I had a tucked in button up on. He said my undershirt was light grey and the rules say it has to be white or navy blue. You've got to be fucking kidding me. So I looked through the company rules and it said you can have 2 top buttons undone and if an undershirt is worn it must be white or blue. If. So the next day I came in without an undershirt and the top 2 buttons undone. I forgot to mention, I'm a hairy motherfucker. And I fluffed up my thick ass chest hair so it was poofing out like an Italian mobster. I sat directly across from him at the meeting and kept leaning forward. He looked visibly uncomfortable and after the meeting I saw him frantically looking through the rulebook. He must not have found anything cause he never mentioned it again.",

            "I work for Jimmy Johns and the only undershirts you can wear are compression shirts, either black or white. So I had been wearing a white one for a while and then just suddenly one cold winter day I'm told I have to take it off because now they only allow black compression shirts. Cool. \n\nJust random fucking bullshit that doesn't affect anything. ",

            "Stuff like this is one of the reasons I took a pay cut to work at my current job.  Dress code is \"do your laundry, don't let anything hang out that shouldn't be hanging out\".  \n\nThe VP of my department walks around in tshirts, shorts, and flip-flops.  I've worn long pants to this job exactly ONCE in a year and a half.  None of us deal directly with customers in person, so we wear what we want.",
            "Had a boss, Executive VP level come to me with a vague bit of information \"Hey, I heard a thing about this group, see what you can find out and let me know whether we should hget involved\".  I researched it and made a determination that we were already involved in a more active and productive way.  He disagreed ripped me a new one and asked me how I could be so irresponsible for saying it was nothing we should get involved with.  \n\nHe had me prepare a presentation to give to his boss, I and our entire team were there.  Slide #2, 5 minutes into the presentation and his boss asks \"aren't we already doing this in a more effective way?\" And stopped the meeting.  Happiest moment at that job.  ",
            "Good one. I've got more hair on my legs than my chest so I would have worn a kilt in that situation.  :-) ",
            "I had a HR person who did something similar, except casual day had to be on Friday or the day before a holiday, and T-shirts could only be industry related or from a college.\n\nSo, I bought a bunch of fake college shirts, from Miskatonic U and the Klingon War Academy, etc.  I also bought shirts from open source projects we use propagandizing free speech and the right to code.\n\nRequirement swiftly disappeared.",
            "I have a related dress code story  I had a boss that absolutely hated me (feeling was mutual and we'll known). We worked overnight at Walmart.  To give you an idea of how much of an asshole he was, he got a 70 year old man, that worked for Walmart for 30 years, fired for forgetting to ring up a Snickers bar someone was holding when he rang up all of their groceries. Real shit head. \n\nAnyway, I wore cargo pants because I had to carry my badge box cutter, headphones, all that sort of shit and I don't like cluttered pockets. So, he was always finding ways to disrupt my day. He wrote me up for going to the bathroom (abandoning my department), which I got taken off. One \"morning\" meeting (we had them every start of shift) he talked about how cargo pants were against company dress code policy and he would wrote up anyone wearing them. People looked directly at me, as I was the only one who wore cargo pants that shift. He was just being an ass. AND, I must add, he was a \"preacher\" so when Sunday night would roll around he would show up in zoot suits and shit. Like, Steve Harvey style purple suits with purple alligator skin shoes on. To work. At Walmart. And he is lecturing ME about dress code. \n\nWell I spoke to his boss about it and he assured me that he wouldn't allow any write ups for it. I also printed out the dress code and carried it in one of my many pockets. \n\nHe was overnight for two years. Then he transferred to Texas. He was there for 2 months and they flipped his truck with the forklift in the parking lot. That truck was his baby. He loved it more than his 10 children.  Sweet justice. \n\nFuck that guy. ",
            "Have something similar going on right now. My boss has absolutely no issues with me, I get all my work done and work my ass off.\n\nHis boss? Got a bug up his ass about which hours people are at work. Not how many hours, or how much work, the only thing he cares about is that people are there between 9 and 5. Doesn't matter that I'm salary and there  10:45AM-9PM and get more work done than anyone else, to him that's irrelevant. Doesn't matter that I'm almost completely useless before 10:30AM, or that it's hard to work with other people in the office. \n\nNope, doesn't matter if I'm the least effective employee I can be, as long as I'm there from 9-5.\n\nHe got really pissed Friday when all the servers went down at 4:59PM and I just left without saying a word. So when he called me 5 minutes later, I answered the phone with \"You demand I be in there at 9 with absolutely no wiggle room, so I leave at 5 with absolutely no wiggle room. Be careful what you ask for.\" and hung up without waiting for an answer. \n\nI'll find out if I have a job tomorrow. \n\nUPDATE: I still have a job, a very amused direct boss, and a very annoyed boss's boss.",
            "I've had a boss get on me about the color of my socks. It was at Office Depot and we had to wear black pants, shoes, and socks. I get that it looks professional, but I stood behind a register all day, why does it matter? Do customers notice these things? \n\nAt another job I was required to buy uniform shirts. They gave me used and damaged shirts. I wore them every day and refuse to buy more. The collar on one polo had completely separated and frayed into a fluff before they gave me a replacement for free. When I quit, the manager asked for my shirts back. I asked for my $30 back. Ended that real quick. ",
            "This reminds me of the time I was working for a design agency in Manchester UK. The Managing Director was generally okay, but he'd go through periods of micro managing the employees, to an insane degree. \n\nOn this occasion, he'd decided (on a whim) that everyone should be wearing shirts with collars. We'd never had a dress code as far as I'm aware. We all used to wear jeans, shirts, tshirts, whatever we liked.\n\nOne of my colleagues came into work that day wear a decent designer tshirt (plain, no slogans or anything offensive) and smart chino type trousers. He looked perfectly fine and smart.\n\nThe (somewhat embarrassed) studio manager has to asked the guy, who was relatively senior in the company, to go home and change as the MD had said he needed to be wearing a shirt with a collar... Argument ensues, as the guy lives over an hours round trip away. He eventually says \"Fine!\" and storms off home...\n\nHe returns over an hour later in a scruffy pair of jeans and a Manchester Utd top... the kit at the time had a collar. Legend.\n\nHe did get sent home again, but we're all salaried, so it was the MD's money he was wasting, and it was totally worth it to see the look on my boss's face. ",
            "I used to work in an office where shorts were not allowed, but dresses were.  There was no gender assigned to these rules so on a blisteringly hot summer day, my male coworker showed up in a dress.\n\n(yes, he had a change of clothes.  it was more of a joke than anything, the company tended to treat its employees pretty fairly)",
            "Had a boss just like this. Just. Like. This. Years ago. \n\nHe had fired *a lot* of people over petty shit as well. Napoleon complex and all. \n\nHe sent me an email that was intended for the woman whom he was cheating on his wife with. \n\nHe scrambled in screaming at me to delete the email 10 minutes later. But I had already read it and copied it for later use. He watched me delete it from my computer however, he looked relieved. \n\nYears later and many many people he had fired fired later (all petty shit) - I also find myself at the end of his boot. Why? I had a wooden #2 pencil tucked behind my ear - says I'm stealing. Fired me on the spot. All access codes and cards disabled he even tried to fight my filing for unemployment. \n\nI'd had enough of him. So since I knew the entire company blanket email address and that of his wife and all his friends, decided to forward that email anonymously and via a proxy on a throwaway email of that really raunchy and explicit emailing that he had sent using his work email accidentally to mine several years before. \n\nTurns out *all* his friends dropped him, wife divorced him and took him for a ride out of all money he'd acquired through all those Back door deals he was stealing from the company to make, she took half everything else and got the house. He was later fired as several people had come forward to sue the company over this \"boss\". \n\nLast I heard he had a measly simple job at a small company who's boss was ironically, just like he had been. \n\n\n\n",
            "That reminds me of when my old manager (that antagonized me) having already changed the uniform twice already said we could only wear polos or v necks fully intending for men to wear the polos and the women to wear the v's. What he failed to do was actually write it in the new rules so I wore a v-neck deep enough that it was between my nipples just to spite him. The best part is I'm somewhere between Robin Williams and Sasquatch on the hair scale. And corporate wasn't about to let him mess with uniforms again so I wore that until the day I quit. ",
            "I have a similar story but its the opposite of what happened to you. I had a manager named Dave back when I worked at a grocery store. One day, the district manager called and announced he was coming. Now for reasons, Dave liked to leave the top two buttons of his button up uniform shirt unbuttoned. The store manager told Dave that he had to have every button except the top one buttoned since that was the uniform and the store had to look good before the dm arrived. Dave flipped out, and started yelling \"But Sarah doesn't button both of her top buttons and you can see her CLEAVAGE. Jasmin doesn't button both of her top buttons and you can see her CLEAVAGE. Why do I have to do it?\"\nThe store manager told him it was just because he had chest hair sticking out and it was unsanitary. Now Dave did have a lot of chest hair, and he wore it proudly where that second button should have been. However, Dave didn't let this experience set him back. The next day I'm in the break room and Dave walks in with the second button unbuttoned and his chest shaven.  He proclaimed proudly that now they will have to let him unbutton the second button and says he's gonna go talk to the store manager right now.  I told him thats a great idea and we walked down to the store manager's office.  Dave walks in and says \"Hey Jeff, I shaved my chest so now you will have to let me leave the second button unbuttoned.\" The store manager goes quiet and stares at Dave for about 5 seconds and yells \"GET THE FUCK OUTTA MY OFFICE.\" Dave waited a few more months to push the issue again, but since the store manager was worried that Dave might say something he switched him off the mornings and into the evenings (Dave hated working mornings). I think they developed a pretty good relationship after that though so I guess it all worked out.",
            "Fraternity president back in college ranted and raved about people not wearing neck ties to meetings.  Said anyone not wearing a tie would not be admitted and fined for missing meeting.  One guy came down for meeting wearing a tie and nothing else.  \n\nI'm still looking for opportunity to do this at work. ",
            "In my youth (Early 1990's) I worked for a Marriott hotel. I progressed from host to busboy to waiter, to training waiter to bar-back and eventually to bartender. At one point when I was the training water, I was asked if I wanted to be an assistant restaurant manager. I was in college at the time with personal goals, so I declined. It was just a job to me.\n\nI was in my 20's. A clean shaven thin white guy, but with long hair, (not very popular at the time) which I always kept in about a 8\" ponytail. \n\nThe manager who was hoping to groom me for assistant manager was so beside himself that I declined his gracious offer to join their management team, that he whipped out the employee handbook and told me that I had to cut my hair or I would lose my job. It was straight up a spiteful move. It was right there, in print. After about 2 weeks of contemplation, I decided to cut my hair. Hell, it would grow back, and I had been working there for about 7 years.\n\nHowever... in the very manual that said my hair could not be longer than shoulder length, it also spelled out that male waitstaff had to wear black pants and black shoes. *Nothing* was said on any page about the color of the socks. Women's stockings were mentioned, but nothing about men's socks. So... I went out and bought a rainbow assortment of neon colored socks and wore them with my black pants and shoes. They were pretty hard to miss.\n\nSeveral times that same manager mentioned my how my socks weren't appropriate, and all I had to say was, \"Show me in the manual where I can't wear them, and I will comply. Just like I did with my hair.\" He looked, he studied and he came up with nothing.\n\nI graduated about 6-8 months later and left the company on my own terms, but it felt really good to at least have beat them at their own \"manual\" game for a little while.\n\nFor what it's worth, I'm pretty certain that I made that manager submit a modification request to the corporation about the employee manual to include sock color for future dress code compliance.",

            "I once had an unusually punctilious assistant at a start-up who spent a good half of his day digging through the employee handbook, seemingly for fun. The problem was that it was written hastily by our German investors, who understood that employee handbooks were something Americans considered mandatory to avoid being sued more than once an hour, and as such the level of detail was inconsistent. As a result, my assistant would occasionally come to my office and announce that he was taking one of his permissible twice-daily ten-minute breaks, for instance, or ask where he could find the water cooler to which the handbook claimed he was entitled.   \n\nEventually I got bored of his time-wasting, so I dug through the book myself, and discovered that (and I paraphrase) \"Employee clothing guidelines are dictated by that employee's superiors as per their preferences for that office's dress code.\" Since it was a ten-person company of which I was technically the boss, I informed my assistant that I'd decided that everyone in a non-technical role (that is, him) would be required to wear only alligator-themed shirts, beginning immediately.  \n  \nBeing a benevolent boss, I cut him some slack on that day, and the following morning I made it clear that there would be disciplinary repercussions (as per the handbook) if he failed to comply. On Monday he showed up in a t-shirt adorned with a grinning cartoon reptile, and asked if that would suffice. I noted that, due to the shape of the snout, it was certainly a crocodile pictured, thereby rendering the shirt non-compliant.   \n\nI never saw the handbook again after that.",

            "A consistent theme among all of the worst bosses I've ever had is nitpicking about dress code. I was waiting tables at this place awhile back where one of the managers had a huge stick up her ass about dress code. The restaurant itself was medium scale, most entrees were <$30, it even had the word diner in the name. So don't think this was some super high end establishment. Well one day I made the mistake of forgetting my black socks, I only had white socks on. I figured NBD I'm wearing an otherwise clean and pressed uniform of long pants and clogs, so who is even going to see my socks? Naturally the uniform witch is working that day and naturally she sees my socks and naturally she sends me home for the day. She'd rather understaff her restaurant than have someone on the floor with white socks on. Later they brought this incident up at my performance review where I got 3/5 stars on the \"uniform\" section. They docked me a star for wearing the wrong socks once 6 months prior and this placed me further down on the list for getting shifts in the off-season. But wait you say, the scale goes to 5 and you got a 3!! Yes, well, apparently the maximum that anyone can ever get in any category is 4 stars because \"there's always room for improvement! :)\"",
            "So one of my bosses at the place I worked did every like this. By the book, I mean. Even the little tiny things, just like you said the undershirts and what not, MUST be followed. Well, we work at Burger King so the shifts were opening, mid-shift, and closing (for managers, that is. I was a manager, but she was an assistant. I don't know where she's at now, but I left a few years back). *Anyway*, whenever she opened or closed, she didn't follow any of the rules until another manager came in, then she made the crew members fix everything she didn't do (like stocking and stuff) and quickly yelled at everyone for not following the rules and doing stuff earlier. She was a vial cunt and I hope she got fired at some point.",

        "selftext": "TL;DR at bottom\n\nThis story harkens back to ye olden days when Blockbuster and Hollywood Video were the things to do on a family friendly Friday and cellphones were still something most people didn't really consider necessary aka the 90's.\n\nI took a job at a video store near my house. It was a small family owned store with three different branches in town. The job was wonderful! I loved movies and games. It was close to my residence and school. I even got free video rentals and a discount from the sub shop next door. The video store was located in a beautiful old building from the 1920's. It had marble stairs and a really amazing cage elevator that lead up to the storage and employee lounge.\n\nThe job was perfect for me. The hours were flexible, the pay was decent but the one draw back to this was my supervisor, let's call her Amanda... because that was her name. Seriously, screw Amanda.\n\nAmanda was on the older side and seemed to not be content with how her life had turned out. As a result, she took all of her frustrations out on anyone she could... especially those people who she worked with who happened to be younger. If you were a college student like myself, you earned a special extra helping of disdain from her. I mean really, how dare you decide to actually have aspirations of making more than $7.50 an hour?\n\nWhile I'm generally fairly tolerant of people like Amanda, she really went the extra mile to annoy me as much as humanly possible. She was bitter, mean, petty, and did anything and everything she could to just be plain unpleasant. She wasn't even nice to customers. The only upside to this attitude was that she didn't let Karen customers get away with their Karen-ness.\n\nI might have been able to take more if she happened to be particularly knowledgable or good at her job. She was neither and only appeared to have the job because of good old nepotism. She was the daughter-in-law of the owner. She knew nothing about movies, or games, or gaming systems, or anything we rented or sold. When a customer had a question, she would pawn them off on another employee. When she had a problem with the computers, who did she call to fix it? Me. When there was a delivery that needed to be checked into the system, who did she call?  Me. When stock needed to be dragged up to the stock room? That'd be me again. Any unpleasant task that came up, she would always try to give it to me. Generally, she hid in the back watching tv or talking on the phone (which did tie up the store's land line for literally hours), or doing anything and everything she could to avoid doing her actual job.\n\nWhen I brought up Amanda to Ken, the owner, he simply sighed and gave a pained look and asked me to just try to bare with it and stay out of her way if I could. I got the distinct impression that Ken didn't much care for her either but she was his daughter-in-law. He did his best to try to make sure I wasn't scheduled to work with her but at least once a week, I had to work with this paragon of kindness and light.\n\nOne day, I was on the phone with a customer discussing the late fees on their account when Amanda wanted to make a call. This resulted in Amanda ripping me a new one in front of an entire store of people, it was a Saturday and we were packed to the rafters. She was yelling so loudly that the woman on the phone asked me if we were being robbed and whether she should call the police. Before I could answer, Amanda yanked the phone out of my hand and slammed it into the cradle, \"You are never *ever* to be on that phone, you understand me?\"\n\nWhile I was desperately aching to head butt her, I bit my tongue, took a deep breath, counted to ten. When that didn't work, I counted to twenty, then fifty. Instead of telling her I hoped that she'd be ravaged by rabid wolverines, I simply smiled and said, \"Alright.\"\n\nThis seemed to annoy her even more than if I'd gotten angry. She stormed back to the office and I took a stream of customers, all of whom asked me if I was okay and one offered suggestions on how to dispose of a body. I appreciated the suggestions but I had plenty of my own ideas and while evisceration with a pair of rusty safety scissor's might be a fulfilling immediate solution, it probably wasn't good for my lifetime goals, unless those goals involved a jail cell and becoming overly acquainted by a thick woman with one eye-brow named Big Betty.\n\nInstead,  I checked it off in my big book of voodoo curses and hoped I would have a chance to pay Amanda back for her thoughtful gesture of embarrassing me in front of half of the metropolitan area.\n\nStill, there were a few more pieces to be laid out for my malicious compliance and Amanda wouldn't disappoint me.\n\nThe next piece came, perhaps a month later. I had been at work for about seven hours of my nine hour shift and had only seen Amanda once and that had been when she left the store. Considering I only had two hours left of my shift and hadn't yet taken a break, I really needed to go to the bathroom. I told my co-worker I was heading to the restroom. This was however, apparently, not in keeping with Amanda's view for the universe. She actually began to bang and kick the bathroom door demanding I come out. I took my time, washed my hands, adjusted my hair, and calmly walked out of the bathroom. While she began to scream, I ignored her and walked up to the front of the store and took the cart of movies to be reshelved.\n\nShe grabbed the front of the cart and swiped the movies off of the top. She then informed me of my questionable parentage, told me that I liked to passionately hug mothers, and that I was a female dog. Really, I had no idea about any of these things about myself. I thought all that time that I was just your regular everyday college student. I could have probably gotten on television if I had known how unique I was sooner. Amanda told me that under no uncertain terms was I to ever leave the floor while I was on the clock.\n\nAgain, I summoned an inner calm that would have made Gandhi proud. I forced a smile and nodded, \"Alright.\"\n\nWhile I seemed calm on the outside, I had made up my mind that I would have my chance. No matter how small, I would have my moment.\n\nThat shining moment came on a lazy and blissfully quiet morning. As it was a morning, it would just be me and Amanda, hopefully she would stay in the office and I wouldn't have to deal with her at all. When I came in, there were workmen in the back working on the elevator. One of the guys came up and told me that he needed a part and he would be back tomorrow to finish up the work. Annoying as I would now have to schlep armfuls of heavy tapes up the stairs but it wasn't the end of the world. The light of my life arrived a few hours later without a word to anyone.\n\nI stood at the front putting 'BE KIND REWIND' stickers on a batch of new arrivals when I noticed Amanda through the back door getting into the elevator. After the man told me that he needed a part, it didn't even occur to me that the elevator had the power on and I had a moment of amusement at thinking that Amanda was going to have to take the hated stairs. She was, above all, lazy.  However, it seemed the elevator did indeed have power *and* worked. At least it worked *just* enough to go half a floor and then stop. It was just close enough to the upper floor that climbing out onto that floor was impossible and just far enough from the lower floor that climbing out was impossible.\n\nI couldn't believe my eyes.\n\nMalicious Compliance Activated!\n\nI couldn't entirely see Amanda as she tried to open the door and get out but I could hear her. The sounds of frustration increased until I heard the most beautiful sound I ever heard.\n\nAmanda: OP!\n\nA slow smile, reminiscent of the Grinch, curved my lips. I walked to the very edge of the sales floor and called out. \"Yes?\"\n\nAmanda: The elevator is stuck, can you open the door from your side?\n\nMe: I don't know, I can't see it from here.\n\nAmanda huffed in annoyance.\n\nAmanda: Well get over here and try to open it.\n\nMe: I can't do that Amanda.\n\nAmanda: Why the <enter colourful verbiage here> not?\n\nMe: I'm not allowed to leave the floor while I'm on the clock under any circumstances.\n\nAmanda: Are you <enter another even naughtier word here> kidding me?!\n\nMe: You said it yourself. Since I value my job, I can't possibly go against orders.\n\nA stream of curses came from the locked and stuck elevator. I'm pretty sure I'm still not old enough for all of the things I heard that day.\n\nAmanda: Call maintenance, the number should be in the office.\n\nTrying to sound as innocent and sympathetic as I could possibly manage while also trying not to burst out laughing: I can't do that either, I'd have to leave the floor to go to the office.\n\nAmanda: You think you're real <So many naughty words> funny don't you?\n\nMe: I don't know what you mean.\n\nAmanda: Call Ken then. I know you know his number.\n\nMe: Well I would but I'm not allowed to use the phone, remember?\n\nAmazingly, there were no curses. There were no screams. There was not even one word telling me that my parents were never married. It was silent. I think for the first time she realized that she might actually be in a little trouble. She was stuck in a position entirely of her own making with no way out of it for the foreseeable future.\n\nAmanda: Op, please? Just get me out of here.\n\nMe: I'm sorry Amanda, I'm just following orders.\n\nAll pretence of niceness was dropped as she proceeded to inform me of all of my imagined faults and those of my parents, friends, and any other relations I might have or think to have in the future. Then she sealed her fate, she yelled at me that I was fired. In truth, I really only planned on letting her stew for a few minutes but after that? Nah.\n\nMe: I'm fired? Okay, then I guess I'll head home. Oh, I should also let you know that Bill called and said he'd be in at seven instead of five. He has to pick up his brother from the airport. So... I guess you'll be in there for a while yet. I hope you've got a book or some thing.\n\nAmanda: What?!?! You <bleeping> <bleep>! How the <bleep> do you <bleep> think you can <bleeping> do this to me? When I get out of here, I'm going come <bleep> you in your <bleeping> <bleep> you <bleep> <bleeping> <bleeping> <bleep>!!!\n\nMe: Wow. Okay, yeah. Have fun with that, have a good one. I'll leave my name tag and shirt on the front desk.\n\nAmanda: WAIT!\n\nMe: Bye.\n\nAmanda: WAIT!\n\nMe: Don't worry, I'll lock up on my way out and I'll put up a sign so people will know we're closed.\n\nAmanda: OP WAIT! I DIDN'T MEAN IT! COME BACK!\n\nI walked up front, wrote out a sign that we were closed until seven pm due to unforeseen circumstances.\n\nThe very last thing I heard from Amanda before I opened the door was, \"BUT I HAVE TO PEE!\"\n\nStill snickering to myself,  I locked the door and drove the forty-five minutes out to Ken's house to let him know the shop was closed. Could I have gone the five minutes to my house and called? Sure I could. Did I? Nope.\n\nKen seemed a bit surprised to see me there.\n\nKen: I thought you were working today.\n\nMe: Oh, I was but Amanda fired me.\n\nKen: She's not allowed to do that.  All hiring and firing goes through me, she knows that. Don't worry, I'll call her. I think maybe it's time to talk to my son about her. I can't keep her on with her acting like this.\n\nMe: I don't think she'll be able to answer the phone.\n\nKen gave me a long sharp look as I tried very hard not to smile. Then I gave up entirely and just smiled broadly back at him.\n\nKen: Op?\n\nMe: Yes?\n\nKen: What did you do?\n\nMe: Me? I didn't do a thing, I only followed her orders.\n\nKen leaned down to meet me eye to eye.\n\nKen: What happened?\n\nI gave him the full tale from her telling me that I couldn't use the phone under any circumstances to her telling me that I wasn't allowed to leave the sales floor when I was on the clock. Then I told him about her being stuck in the elevator.\n\nKen: You didn't tell her the elevator was broken?\n\nMe: I didn't even realize it had power.\n\nKen just stood there looking at me gobsmacked and then started laughing. \"I should really go let her out.\"\n\nHe paused for a minute and looked down at his dirty hands and clothes, then up at me.\n\nKen: But I really shouldn't leave those flowers half planted and then I should probably take a shower. I don't want to make that drive covered in dirt.\n\nMe: Oh of course not. You've got a really nice car and it'd be a lot of work to get that much dirt out of your seats and carpet. Do you need some help with the planting?\n\nKen nodded solemnly back at me and gave another chuckle. It took probably another hour to finish planting the flowers. Ken told me I'd be paid for the day and sent me home with assurances that I did indeed still have a job and that he would deal with Amanda. I fully enjoyed the rest of my half day off. I did hear from Bill that when he got there the elevator repair guy had just arrived and that Amanda ended up spending about five hours stuck in the elevator.\n\nAfter that day, I only ever saw her one more time. She glared daggers at me as I waved happily to her as she carried a bag of her things out to her car. Whenever I think about it, I still get a little smile on my face. Besides, I only did what she told me to.\n\nTL;DR Sucky manager suffered being trapped for five hours because of her poor life choices.\n\n&#x200B;",

The cashier is a no-nonsense fellow. \"You're name?!\", he shouts.\n\n\"I don't have to give you my name!\", the customer responds.\n\n\"Your name is Dildo Baggins!\", the cashier asserts and aggressively points at the customer. He writes \"Dildo\" on the order in big black marker with an aggressive underline.\n\nThe food was ready very quickly (smaller order than mine). \"DILDO!\", the cashier shouts. \"DILDO!!\" he points the box of food at Dildo Baggins until Mr. Baggins went up and retrieved his food in silence.\n\nAfter he left, the cashier is just shouting a rant about he doesn't care if you want a name or not just don't waste my time with your bullshit.",

Every four weeks, me and the other operators rotate onto the maintenance shift where we work under this particular supervisor, we'll call him Randy. Randy likes to think he has more control that he does have, and honestly, the plant supervisor just lets him think that. \n\nAbout a month or so ago, I was working with him and he told me to pick up a 45 lb empty nitrogen cylinder. I politely reminded him that I was pregnant and shouldn't be doing that, to which he responded since I didn't have light duty paperwork, it shouldn't be a problem. I sucked it up and lifted the cylinder and carried it to the destination, but received a pulled muscle in the process. The next day, I informed the plant supervisor and an work injury report was filed. When my statement was taken, the verbiage I used that was corroborated with another coworker that was present caused Randy to get in trouble because he knew I was pregnant and essentially caused the injury to happen. They took me to a nurse to make sure that my baby was fine and that I was okay and was not experiencing any complications from the injury. I wasn't other than being in pain if I moved too much. They sent me back on my way and the plant supervisor put me on desk duty for the day.\n\nRandy was livid of course because he lost some of his manpower on the maintenance team. He made a fuss about me not having light duty paperwork saying that if I didn't have it then I should be capable of doing the work that is needed around the plant. I was capable, I just used common sense. Prior to this incident, I did my job to the fullest within the limitations of my body, which wasn't that much. I rested when I needed to, didn't lift more than my body would allow, and most importantly, I was the only female out of 7 employees so my other coworkers were more than willing to help me if I asked (which wasn't that often).\n\nSo the plant supervisor called me into his office and requested that I go get my light duty papers from the doctor ASAP. That's the only way he could protect me from getting further hurt at work. I told him I understood and made the call to the drs office and picked it up that afternoon. I got the paperwork that was supposed to keep Randy quiet and it restricted me as such:\n\n* No stooping more than 2 times an hour\n* No climbing ladders or poles at all\n* No climbing more than 3 flights of stairs a shift\n* No lifting more than 25 pounds\n* No standing more than 30 minutes out of each hour\n* And limited contact with chemicals\n\nThese orders of course make it very difficult for me to do my job fully as it basically limits me to either desk work, or general cleaning. Now Is know this list is bullshit, because I can definitely stoop more than two times in an hour. I may be out of breath coming back up, but I can do it. And the climbing more than three flights of stairs is ridiculous because that means I can't do all of my rounds. Someone else has to do the last set for me because you climb a set of stairs every time. \n\nUnder normal circumstances, I would be more than happy to bend the rules here to make everyone's lives easier, but honestly, since he's the one who bitched and moaned for me to get this paperwork, I plan to make full use of it. So far, since I've received this paperwork, I keep a checklist of all of the things I can't do and fill it like a bingo card. If I fill all of the things; to the office I go because that means I can't do anymore physical work on shift. And he has a bad habit of tossing a lot of work my way in the beginning of my shifts.",

I looked like I was carrying triplets.  My body made way too much fluid and I looked horrible.  It was comical.  \n\nBut, I felt fine.  I was just huge and carrying around an extra 75 lbs but I was good.  \n\nI was like you and just handled my shit.  Until, I got called to do police call.  Basically,  it was my turn to help pick up trash around the base.  My sergeant told me just to report for that duty and they will reassign me for after my delivery.  This was an unwritten rule that most folks followed.  Except for our Randy.\n\nNo, our Randy wanted a note.  But, I didn't have one and could got get one.  It would have taken about 30 minutes to get my doctor to give me a note.  \n\nInstead, he forced me to do \"my duty\" because \"The Army doesn't see female soilders.\"\n\nSo, I walked in the rain to do police call.  The other folks assigned helped me and understood why I couldn't do anything.   \n\nThe base commander sees me walking around , attempting to pick stuff up, and starts yelling at folks.  I get picked up in a nice car and taken to HER office.  \n\nOur Randy had zero clue what he was getting summoned for that morning.   I'm sure he wasn't expecting to see a drowned rat looking soldier being treated like freaking royalty.   \n\nOur base no longer put ANY pregnant soldier on pick up detail.  \n\nIt was glorious and it was epic.

Our manager typically showed up early around 7:30 or 8 and would leave the office at 3:30 or 4 to \u201cskip traffic\u201d.\n\nNow, at some point, our manager was on some sort of power trip and decided it was necessary to call a full team meeting to inform us that \u201cwork starts at 9, not 9:15, not 9:30, but 9\u201d. Me being a young smart ass decided to fight this tyranny and asked her \u201cwhat time does work end?\u201d , to which she very calmly stated 5. So I asked how come she leaves at 4. And she explained that she shows up early and therefore gets to leave early. I was on autopilot because the next thing I said was \u201cBut I thought work starts at 9 so how come you show up early?\u201d. She explained that she\u2019s made a special arrangements with the higher ups and therefore she is exempt from the rule.\n\nSo Lucy and I dropped it but we decided to show up exactly at 9 everyday, take a full hour for lunch, and leave exactly at 5. Meetings all day and work due tomorrow? Sorry but work ends at 5. Working on an issue where stopping halfway means it would take longer to pick it up tomorrow? Sorry but works ends at 5.\n\nAbout a month of this and our backlog is piling up, our clients are complaining, and my manager is fuming at our reduced output. She sits us down and asks us why this is happening. We calmly explain that with meetings, an hour lunch, and work starting at 9 and ending at 5, there\u2019s just not enough time in the day to get stuff done.\n\nShe dropped the policy the next day and instead issued a \u201ccore hours\u201d policy of 10-3 where everyone is expected to be in the office then.",

In the UK there are a few places where you are not allowed to strike by law (Emergency Services mostly), so instead of striking, these guys follow every rule to the absolute letter and without fail, it makes everyone suffer (which is pretty much the point).

Turns out that when showing up *outside* at 7 to unlock the back door and the process of accessing the building and turning the lights on meant that she didn't get to the time clock (NOT conveniently located by the door, but rather in the break room) until 5-10 minutes past the hour, and that corporate considered this to be \"tardy\" and a performance issue (never mind that she was logging overtime almost every week, so obviously putting in her full shift and then some). \n\nClearly some bean counter in corporate HR couldn't see the forest for the trees.

            "> Working on an issue where stopping halfway means it would take longer to pick it up tomorrow? Sorry but works ends at 5.\n\nHad a similar situation once. I worked at a very big storage place, and walking from one side to the other could take 10 to 15 minutes. \nOn an 8 hour shift we typically got 3 breaks: 2 short 15 min breaks and half an hour for lunch, or dinner if you had evening shift. (I know that seems short but it's not uncommon here. Most people brought their own food or bought some at the cantina).\n\nAnyway: When I started working there it was clear I could be more efficient if I sometimes took breaks a bit earlier or a bit later than the appointed times, depending on what I was doing and where. E.g. being ~10 minutes away from the cafeteria and my break is in 10 minutes, but it would only take 5 minutes to finish things up here. At the end of a shift I would save the company 20-30 minutes of me uselessly walking around and I'd be more productive. Everyone happy right?\n\nNope. Me and some other new employees who thought the same were giving a talk that we have to follow the appointed times. Result: 15ish minutes before a break some people wouldn't do anything anymore, because it could be a larger waste of time to start a new order and having to go back half way through. Great policy guys. Instead of us saving you 20-30min you added 20-30 minutes of doing nothing. They basically threw away almost an hour of productivity per employee.",

            "I worked for a place that didn't want to pay me as much... I was an engineer on salary, but didn't have a lot of work to do because of a local recession in like 2012.\n\nSo they switched me over to hourly, with a rate equivalent to my salary if you assumed I worked 44 hours a week (this is what they put in the employment contract, and it's the maximum normal hours of work you can ask from someone in my province.)\n\nThen a big project came in and I knew how to do it - it was just a copy of a previous one I had worked on. They needed it done two weeks ago because everything was scheduled poorly. I was directly asked to do overtime, and I didn't mind because I had the time. I ended up working a couple months of 55+ hour weeks. This, of course, put me way over what I was earning on salary because not only was I working 25% more, it was overtime thanks to being hourly...\n\nAfter accounting noticed this I got an awkward meeting with the people who switched me to hourly in the first place where I was able to point-blank ask them if they wanted me on salary or if they wanted me to keep working extra hours for this super-important job. They wouldn't budge on going back to salary, so I started doing the whole 'leave exactly at 4:30' thing. No one was particularly happy.",

My colleagues were similar with a flexible wfh schedule. \n\nAfter his powertrip, we stopped doing anything after 5.30. This caused a few issues with the quality of work from our team as we suddenly had less time to complete tasks.",

            "I had a boss who hired me to manage her Gelato shop in the mall. I had 3 years of management experience in the food industry but I made it clear I had none with frozen desserts. She wanted to start mass producing the popsicles we offered within my first 3 months. Cool, I can do that but I need to be trained on how to make them so I can teach the team. She never responded to my request for training at another store (there was another franchise making them where we had been purchasing them at the time to sell directly to mall patrons since we weren't making our own) and when an old employee came by asking what happened to the old team I explained that it was under new ownership and the old team left with the previous owner and managers. We talked and I mentioned that I wasn't sure how to work the machines and she said she knew from when she worked there and that she would be willing to come in and show me so we can meet her goal. I relayed the information to the owner explaining that she could do it in 2 days 4 hr shifts each day of training. She just emailed me back \"ok\" and never talked about it again. She had repair men come in to check the machines several times and each time they told her there wasn't enough ventilation in the tiny back room (dish sink, 4 popsicle making machines, all the dish storage and ingredient inventory was all kept in an area no bigger than a gas station bathroom) for the heat to escape and it was causing the machines to overheat during the freezing process. Well guess who still insisted that the technician who was trained by the italian manufacturer of the machines, had no idea what they were talking about. She insisted that we could produce them and I just needed to read the manual. I did and I followed each step as best I could (most of the manual was in italian or 2010 google translate english) but at the exact same point every single run, the machines would shut off and that would ruin the Popsicles and I would have to start over. But every day only allowed for one run of the machine so that the ice cream could come out before closing with enough time to wash everything. As my final weeks passed I did as she asked. I tried to run the machines, scrap the fucked up ice cream, log it as waste and go about the rest of the shift with nothing to give her. Well she wasn't having it. Since she couldn't come up with a legitimate reason to fire me (no need since California is an at will termination state where employers can fire you for no reason) she accused me of letting my ex sit behind the counter and eat her ice cream. I asked her to prove it and show me the video footage and she just said it would take too long because it was 2 weeks ago and I told her she should have brought it up then. When she realized she was caught in a lie she began saying I was wasting her time and money and that I dont do anything. Mind you, she had schedules set up for 3 weeks at a time on time every week because of me. Her stupid Koren fish waffle things were selling because I took the time after fucking up the ice cream to make myself fish shaped waffle cones. Why she was trying to sell Korean frozen dessert out of an Italian Gelato spot is beyond me. She was quick to pay for my Lolicup certification even tho we didn't sell boba or any of the items I was trained to make during my 4 hour training session. She also expected me to pick up items from a restaurant supply store 30 minutes in the opposite direction from work before I was on the clock (ex: shift starts at 1pm I have to be there at 1 pm with the items she asked for without paying me mileage or time taken to purchase the items and drive to work 45 minutes away before the start of my shift) I said fuck that to her and I started waiting for my shift to start before I even left my house. Idk how the place is still there 2 years later but that mall is expensive to even have a spot especially next to the new fashion district they added on the side the store is on. That was my last job in customer service. I currently own my own caregiving business and I make my own hours and make sure I have all the proper and necessary training and certifications and I get paid for every minute im not at home taking dabs and eating chipies.",

My boss also commutes long distance every week for work (flys into the city for the week, and out for the weekend), so I know he has nothing else to do here and because of that gets into the office early everyday and leaves late everyday, and doesn't understand why everyone else doesn't do the same.",

        "selftext": "This happened 20 years ago after i had just turned 18 and during my first adult job as a cook in a franchise that has a very creepy clown as a mascot.\n\nAfter working there for 6 months, i decided that i preferred to work as a bartender so it was known that I was looking to find some other job in a bar. This is a bit relevant with what happened.\n\nSo, I was  supposed to clock out at 4 pm. As soon as my shift ended, I punched my card (yes, we used to punch cards back then) and I was on my way to change clothes so i can leave. As I was leaving the kitchen a big group of customers (like 10 or 12) walk in the store, so one of the managers, demanded me stay to help. Note, she did not ask me if i can help, she demanded that i help even though i had already clocked out. Being 18 and nice, i agreed to stay to help.\n\nAround 20 minutes later and i was still in the kitchen with several orders still to do, so i was complaining to the second manager who is also working the kitchen at the time that i really needed to go.\n\nFor some reason, the other manager (the one that demanded that i stayed to help) overheard my complaint and starts yelling at me that i am useless and that i should be grateful that i have a job and that i shouldn't say these things as she knows i am searching for another job and she could fire me on the spot. Mind you, she was not working the kitchen she just entered the kitchen to grab some stuff. So i told her that i had already finished my shift and i was not getting paid for the extra time i was there, and that I was already late for the plans i had. So she yelled to me:\n\n\"If you want to leave now, i might as well quit\"\n\nCue Malicious Compliance. I followed her instruction to the letter. I told her:\n\n\"Yes, I want to leave now, so i quit!\"\n\nI took off my shirt and pants (as they were company issued), and went to pick up my stuff wearing only my underwear. Even after picking up my clothes i didn't bother to get dressed just walked out of the front door in my underwear. My shoes were also mine so i was not barefoot. I walked to my car, where i put on the rest of my clothes.\n\nThis happened in full view of the customers as the kitchen is in direct view from the whole store. She was dumbfounded and some customers even clapped and cheered because they heard how nasty she was being with me.\n\nLater i found out that she was reprimanded by the owner (probably because everything happened in view of customers) and i even got a small bonus on my last paycheck.  Within the next couple of weeks found a bar tending job that i kept for a few years. So in the end everything was for the best.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Because people are asking, I am not from the USA. In my country you can legally work in a bar at the age of 18.\n\nEdit 2: Because i see a lot of people hang up on the \"people cheered\" part. When i left the customers that were there told me that i did the right thing and clapped. I didn't say that i got a standing ovation and I never said \"everyone\". I just said some people. In my country people cheer and clap for all shorts of stupid things. Glasses fall down and break, people cheer. People get in a fight, people cheer. It  is more common than you would think.\n\nBut even if you do not believe me, that's ok :) I just wish that i was able to entertain you...\n\nEdit 3: Because people are asking, I am from Greece. Although from my understanding the same thing (cheering for things that break) is happening all around the world. I saw many people mentioning the UK and Australia.",

        "selftext": "When I was 15 I started working for a particular clown who owns a fast food restaurant.  When I first started working the manager assumed I was 16 and I was given a red polo shirt to wear during my shifts.  There was a hierarchy to the shirts at this restaurant, white was for anyone 15 and younger, you got a red shirt once you were 16 or over, black shirts were for crew trainers, and the full button down shirts were for managers.  All of the shirts were made of a decent fabric except for the white shirt, which was very thin and practically see thru.\n\nAbout a month after I started working there, the manager called me into her office and asked why I had lied to her about my age.  I told her I  had never once said to her that I was only 15 so I never really lied about it.  She told me I had to hand in my red shirt and exchange it for a white one, which I did.  I wore the white one for about a week and that's when I noticed after the first wash the fabric became even thinner and the shirt was practically see thru.  As a heavy set individual, if I were not wearing an undershirt, you would have seen all of my hairy manly glory underneath this sorry excuse for a shirt.  I asked since I had already been wearing a red shirt for a month, and the shirt colors really don't mean much, could I get my old red shirt back?  I was told that it was company policy to follow the shirt rules and I was denied my old red shirt.  \n\nCue the MC\n\nThere was a rule stating I had to wear my see thru company issued shirt for all my shifts, there was no rule stating what I had to wear underneath.  My dad had recently returned from Mexico, and had brought me the most touristy shirt from his trip.  There were four panels on this shirt, the first had a worm and a shot that said one tequila.  The second the same worm, second shot, much drunker and said two tequila.  The third, the same worm, third shot, very drunk and said three tequila.  And as I'm sure you have deduced the fourth is the worm passed out and it says floor.  I decided this was the perfect undershirt for a 15 year old register worker at the clown to wear underneath his see thru shirt.  I wore it for one shift before the manager came up to me.  She told me how much she didn't appreciate the fact that I wore such a vulgar shirt underneath my work uniform.  I politely told her nobody would know what I was wearing underneath my company issued work shirt if they weren't see thru.  When I went to clock out that day they had a brand new unused red polo shirt just waiting for me.  I was told to wear the red shirt from that point forward and to turn in my white shirts.",

The reason being, 15 year old 's and younger couldn't use certain equipment and couldn't work after a certain time due to local child labour laws. \n\nWe used to get random audits (CER/ROC) and the auditors had no way of knowing who was underage until after they did all the paperwork auditing and shitty managers that had under 15's using equipment would have them work up until the paperwork auditing then send them home so they didn't get counted as staff on shift and picked up for doing the wrong thing. \n\nThe colour shirts were implemented in our area as a test and didn't end up working for a completely different reason (didn't match the corporate identity) but it was very effective for the audits and managers from other stores covering shifts, area manager visits, etc.",

This is when jemma and the other bridesmaids stepped in, told bridezilla she was out of line, and that they would all leave if she forced the girl with glasses to leave; Bridezilla called their bluff and, being maids of honor, the bridesmaids left the wedding and decided to celebrate and eat at a restaurant before they head back home. Bridezilla called them several times after they left, telling them that she didn't care about the glasses anymore and begged them to come back to the venue, but they not only refused but also chose to end the friendship, with her, all together. Jemma said that the wedding proceeded as follows, just minus the bridesmaids and a few awkward stares because everyone heard the bridezilla's screaming from earlier.\n\nJemma told me that the bridezilla has always been like this, throwing a tantrum when she doesn't get her way, and that the meltdown at the wedding was just the last straw for them.

The only people who showed up were our parents and her now husband's parents. \n\nThe bridesmaids, groomsmen, and all guests didn't show up. But, in shock to everyone involved, she actually figured her self out. She's always been rude and bossy, so about a month after her wedding she contacted everyone that would have gone and profusely apologized. At first I didn't give it a thought, she's apologized before in the past but didn't change. Ironically this time it actually set her straight. Sometimes people need to be severely humbled and they realize they actually are the problem. We're very close now and she's fun at family gatherings.

But once the wedding happened they all reverted back to just being a group of equals. But the bride didn't.

Called my last day, at the end of my shift, and told them I was done and they could find someone else, giving them no notice at all. Panic mode ensued. Everyone else was at 40 hours for the week and they hated paying overtime. One of the salaried managers had to cover for me. \n\nI'm a teacher now, near retirement. My raises are still shit.\n\nANOTHER EDIT: The MC is the fact I quit since they told me to, and did it in such a way that they were screwed for covering the position. The fact a salaried manager had to cover my shift for a couple days was the icing. \n\nEDIT: There was a lot left out. I left that shitty job to become a computer network engineer after college. Did that for a bit under ten years. The 2001 tech bubble burst put a lot of us out of work. I started teaching to put food on the table. After that I felt a calling and decided to stick with it.

That will put me 55\u00a2 over minimum wage! And then I realized that 50\u00a2raise was because minimum wage just got bumped up by 50\u00a2. And that future raise?

            "My first job was with a security company. I was hired through a staffing agency. I worked as a radioman and security guard for a music festival. They were understaffed and worked us without questioning how much they assigned us. They worked me over 60 hours. I entered my hours correctly for the SA. The SecCo. had the audacity to cross out the 40 hrs regular pay and 20+ hrs overtime and writing 60 regular hrs. When I handed the timesheet to the staffing company, the lady looked at it and entered the correct numbers I had entered from the beginning. I was paid correctly in full for my time worked. I was in the company Facebook group. Shortly after the event, I started seeing posts about people saying they haven\u2019t received a check yet. This went on for about two or so weeks. Eventually, it came out that the company manager had fled the state and disappeared without any contact with anyone. To this day, I still don\u2019t know if everyone were paid. This is one of those rare occasions where working through the staffing agency was better for me than working directly through a company. \n\nTLDR: Security company sucked and didn\u2019t pay their direct employees.

I would push for my crew to get raises, the vacation days they wanted, extra shifts when times were hard to make sure the crew was happy. Giving a two week notice did not give any time for our terrible management and recruiting department to find a replacement so it still hurt the site (if thats what you wanted). It had the worst impact on the other workers or, in my case, the salaried guy who had to work extra for free at no fault of his own.\n\nPlease give notice when leaving a job.
