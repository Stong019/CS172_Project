            "I worked in a store that favoured commission-based sales and you'd usually end up with the customer for half an hour on average due to contracts. Online deals could be done in store but netted you nothing in return while basically keeping you busy so the system itself tries to discourage it, which is bs for the customer.\n\nIn that same job, I had one of the phone team contact the customer *I was in the midst of working with* and try to encourage him to split and deal with them in return for a discount. A member of the *same company*. I'm honestly impressed he didn't try playing us off each other to see how cheap he could get it.\n\nCompany price differences between store/phone/online and commission based work is bs and we all know it.

            "I worked at Walmart and  there are a couple of reasons why this happens. First off, TVs there are basically sold at cost, they\u2019re within a couple dollars. Some TVs you might make $10, some you might lose $6. They\u2019re not big earners. So whenever the store adjusts the price it counts against the stores bottom line. If it comes from corporate it doesn\u2019t count against the margins, but anything done by hand will. When you order something online for pickup, it\u2019s actually a positive for the store. The online retailer essentially buys it from the store. Store gets full price, you get your discount. It all has to do with accounting and how corporate determines margins for bonuses.\n\nEdited for grammar.",

I did an online order for the $20 set with pick up in store and received confirmation of the order and informed that the item would take 5 days to ship from the warehouse when there were literally pallets of them I'm standing next to in the store.\n\nI simply bought the $40 set off the shelf and watched it that night.  Five days later the \"pickup in store\" notification let me know the DVD set had arrived.  I went to the counter to claim it.  They handed me a bubble mailer with it inside, I ripped it open slid the DVD set and my in-store receipt across the counter and said \"I'd like do a return\" and got my $40 back having only paid the $20 for the online order which I had the set at home now.\n\nI haven't made an online Walmart order in quite awhile.

I didn\u2019t have time to wait for delivery and didn\u2019t know what size I needed (and I think online had limited sizes anyway), so we went to the store. Found my size, and while I was in the dressing room, had my husband go to checkout, told him how much it should be. \n\nHe went to the cashier and the price was significantly more, which he questioned and showed the website and they said \u201cwe don\u2019t price match our website\u201d so he left the register to come talk to me.

            "On the other hand. I saw a piece of jewelry on Amazon that was listed on the seller's website for half the price. I forgot about it for a while, then happened on it again much later. Same thing. A price on Amazon for a price that was twice the price that was on the seller's website for the exact same item. So I entered a question on the Amazon page asking why it was half the price on the seller's webpage. The answer was that the only way that would happen was if it was on sale somewhere. Just out of curiosity, I checked the website of the seller. Sure enough, the price on the website was raised to the same site as the price on Amazon.

            "Worked at a now defunct sporting goods retailer for almost a decade. We were not allowed to price match with our online store because we did not actually own the online store, we merely sold the rights to the company name for online usage. So for all appearances, it seemed like we were being ridiculous and not honoring our prices, but in actuality it wasn\u2019t even us that set the price, it was another company using our name (with our permission). It\u2019s why you can sometimes see a store with completely different merchandise online than in their brick & mortar locations.

            "This reminds me of my experience with the \"greatest purchase\" electronics store. I actually haven't shopped there since this happened. This was *years* ago. I feel like shop online/pick up in store was brand new. \n\nI was trying to help my mom buy a laptop and I found one online that I thought would do the job (she really doesn't do much with a computer) and was a reasonable price. The website said there were a couple in stock at my local store so I went over to buy one.\n\nOnce I got there they told me that I could *not* buy it without buying a bunch of software upgrades because it was all already installed on the laptop so I had to pay for it. I asked why they had the price advertised on the website as $xxx.xx if it was really $xxxx.xx? They couldn't help me with that, I was going to have to purchase the additional software. I even had the manager come over. No way were they selling me the laptop without the extra software *because it's already been installed*. \n\nSo I went out into the parking lot, bought the damn laptop with *no additional software* for in store pickup, then immediately walked back inside and picked it up. I know they work on commission so I asked the guy if it was worth losing the sale altogether. I was absolutely furious. I have a huge problem with bait and switch (and other sketchy advertising practices).",
            "Yeah, that's a stupid setup.\n\nBack in the day, Gateway computer stores, (the boxes that looked like dairy cows...,) would have prices on their website. you go into the store to try to get that deal, and the sales person would call up the internal sales person's version of the website and show you it was more. you basically needed a screen shot of the website to prove it was on sale.\n\nAlso, when buying appliances, 5 different stores would have the same identical appliance, (stove, dishwasher...,) but the end of the model number had an extension for the store. So, if you tried to get a store to price match another store, they would say it's not the same model and refuse to price match. (Like a 14 digit model number, and the last two digits were SE for sears instead of CC for Circuit City.)\n\nBasically, businesses in the US are out to fuck you! Any way the can, and as much as they can. If you find a local business that treats people right, support them, even if it costs a few dollars more.",

An online purchase has to pay for the warehouse bills and shipping. An in-store purchase has to cover both the warehouse, shipping, and my store's expenses. Online purchases can be made cheaper as a sort of reward top the customer for being willing to wait and cost the company less.

            "Wow, that's crazy.   I've been doing tech support for 30 years now and every time I've had to go on the road it was assumed that living it up a little bit was appropriate due to being away from home and my family.  So I would eat out for dinner every night, nothing nuts, but a nice sit down restaurant.\n\nIn fact, at one place I worked we had a facility in Mexico.  We only had production there, no management other than line level supervisors.  So every decision maker was in the US and they all had to fly down there from time to time.\n\nEventually I became the remote IT guy there and after years of struggling with phone support, I decided I wanted to see what I was dealing with.  I asked around and found out that most of the team was going down in November for inventory.  So I booked a flight and eventually November arrived and I went.\n\nThat first night we went out to the most expensive steak house around.  I got something that was like $65 and it was the most delicious thing I had ever eaten in my life.  So at the end of the meal, the highest ranking person there paid for everyone and expensed it.  I asked just for fun what the bill came to and it was like $850 for 7 people.  So right there, that told me this sort of thing was fine.\n\nAt the end of the week we went to some other fancy place, I can't remember the food type, but they had valet parking so it was clearly very expensive.  So we all got fancy food and one person ordered a bottle of wine for the table even though most of us were drinking beer, and at the end of dinner another manager ordered Grand Marnier for the whole table.\n\nI went by myself or with 1 other person a ton over the next decade and I never really took advantage, but I lived it up more than normal.  As I recall my favorite place to go was Joe's Crabshack, a locally own Mexican place, or Beni Hanna's.  So I was spending $60 or less on my meal each night.  I would eat the continental breakfast at the hotel and brownbag lunch or eat at the factory cafeteria that had free food for all workers so $60 dinner wasn't crazy at all.",

            "Way back in the late 80's when I was working on my computer science degree in college I applied with IBM for a summer internship job, completely anticipating that I'd end up working in some corporate office environment for the duration. Boy was I wrong...\n\nAt the time IBM had a division that was renting large swaths of hotels near me for training purposes. They turned some of the hotel suites into offices and brought in clients to spend a few days at the hotel and take various types of training courses that IBM offered. I ended up staffing an IBM help desk in a suite at a 5 star hotel.\n\nThe hotel treated all the IBM employees (as well as our visiting trainees) as regular hotel guests. In the morning the hotel had free continental breakfast, piles of newspapers, etc. for the guests and we could all partake. In the afternoon they set out snacks, sodas, and other drinks that we were also encouraged to consume. IBM also had the hotel provide a catered lunch when classes were being taught, and the IBM employees could eat that as well. Even though it was pretty much just catered cold-cut sandwiches, etc. it was still coming from a 5-star hotel kitchen so nothing to sneeze at.\n\nThe most amazing part is that for whatever reason IBM allowed the employees to have lunch in the hotel dining room on IBM's tab when there were no classes going on, and the food there was outstanding. I still clearly recall my first lunch in the hotel dining room because a handful of managers from another IBM hotel/office about 20 minutes away all conveniently had meetings at our hotel just before lunch. I later learned that the food at our hotel/office restaurant was significantly better than the other one, which is why they'd all come over for lunch when we were eating there.",

Usually my team would just book through booking.com or similar with the option to cancel free of charge up to 24h before. Because of that, we could book way in advance before approval. For some reason they decided, we had to use our company platform only, nothing else. So of course we waited to book hotels until everything was approved, which usually  took ages. As a result, on several occasions all cheaper hotels were completely full (mostly because of conferences or sikilar) and out only option was to book junior executive suites. Yes, we went way over the original budget, but as we could show that we requested the travel weeks before and hadn't received the approval until only a few days before travel, management couldn't argue.",

But if the place across the street was $150, then no go.  Very weird rules.

After a few stops a Karen enters, she had the haircut, the clothes, and the attitude. By now all the seats are filled, and there are already people standing around due to the lack of seats. Karen pushes through a few people, looks around, and loudly exclaims to noone in particular \"Will nobody offer a lady their seat?!\" Nobody responds. She then goes around, complaining to a few random people sitting down that she needs to sit because she's been standing for over an hour (oh the horror, try working retail) and just needs to put her feet up (.....on a full train. Okay). One person gets fed up and gives her his seat, right across the old lady from before. The Karen now has a seat, but still no place to put her feet up. She complains to the person next to her and to the old lady that these trains are always so cramped, and it would be good if people who didn't need seats just gave them up. The awesome old lady took this as her cue, made a point of standing up really slowly and carefully, grabbing her cane and clutching it tightly, and said \"You can have my seat, your feet probably need it more\". She then walked away very slowly, leaning heavily on her cane, and asking people to please step aside so she could fit through. \n\n\nKaren got many angry glares at this point, and she called out to the old lady \"You can just keep sitting here, I don't need it THAT badly\" and the old lady replied \"You just said that you really needed it, so take it.\" And walked to the next cabin. Karen couldn't see her anymore at this point but from my seat I could see the old lady stand up straight and pick up the cane, swinging it around again. \n\nI don't think many people saw it because everyone continued to glare at Karen until she got off at the next stop. \n\n\nThe old lady just really wanted to teach Karen a lesson by complying and acting her age, making Karen look like a bitch. She has been my hero ever since.",

            "Omg I sorta did this, but on my own behalf, lol. \n\nSee, my boys (young adults) needed groceries and I needed to go to the hardware store next door. Obviously in front of the grocery store there is a loading/crossing area (diagonal lines) with stop signs at either end. I stop briefly at my stop sign, and then roll up to the door and stop to let the boys out. \n\nI hear the shriek of brakes behind me and realize someone was following too closely. And not paying enough attention. Presuming that I wouldnt be letting anyone out (in the area designated for such activities) they had almost rear ended me. They laid o  their horn and I could see them thrashing and screaming about in their car. A younger lady. Dude next to her looks... unhappy, lol. \n\nBoys get out and I continue on my way and now shes swerving wildly back and forth behind me. I can see her in my rear view screaming and red faced. I make it to the stop sign before the hardware store and I make that fucker the full legal 3 second stop. Her whole car is rocking from her tantrum. \n\nAaaand she swings into the next available parking spot, two down from mine... as I pull onto the first handicapped spot. I see her barreling out of her car... and seeing me, I swear to god I have never gotten out of a car slower or with more difficulty managing my cane into position. \n\nAnd I got to watch her whole rage and demeanor collapse upon itself as she realized she would either be that cunt who attacked a disabled woman... or got her ass kicked by a disabled woman. \n\nTrust me. More likely the second one. Canes are excellent weapons. And I'm scrappy as fuck.",
            "My sister and I caught the train into university most mornings.  u/tarsha8nz was permanently on crutches at the time (it ended up being over 10 years).  There was a lovely lady who always gave her a seat.  The lady wasn\u2019t on the train for a couple of weeks and Tarsha would have to ask for a seat with people doing the old \u201cif I don\u2019t look at you then I don\u2019t have to do it\u201d.  She had to ask multiple times for people to give up their seats which were designated disability seats.  A couple of times she even had to tell people \u201cmy balance is really bad, if I don\u2019t get a seat I\u2019ll probably fall and these crutches will do some damage\u201d (they were gutter crutches for people who had wrist problems).  \nAnyway the lovely lady came back and didn\u2019t stand up until she realised no one else was going to.  When she stood up it became VERY apparent that lovely lady was rather pregnant and people were very willing to give their seat up for her.  It became a habit until she gave birth.  We\u2019d get on the train, pregnant lady would give people a chance to do the right thing and then give her seat to my sister and then someone would give up their seat for pregnant lady. \nI don\u2019t understand people.",

Some snotty twat sitting right across from me snarled at me to move. Just as I was getting up the old lady said it was OK she had lots of space, but I was already moving so I just sat next to the lady who told me to move. She immediately was like \u201cNot next to me you\u2019re too big to sit here!\u201d (I\u2019m fat, and tried really hard to always take up as little space as possible on public transit) so I moved back over beside the old lady and sat with tears in my eyes the rest of my ride home.

            "This might be really weird, but go see a cardiologist. It could be POTs. I recently got diagnosed after passing out multiple times. Basically my heart rate is was too fast and I have very low blood pressure. It gets worse if I'm stressed, stand for long periods of time, especially in one place, eat big meals, stand up or squat down and get up, or not get enough water or salt. (I mean a lot of water and salt)\n\nAnyway, I got diagnosed recently with it, I'm a little older than the typical age. I don't know if I've always had a problem and blamed it on weight (I lost over 60 pounds recently) and my thyroid, but then it became super noticable.  The fainting is quick. It's not spinning, it's literally everything just goes black and I feel like my soul is being sucked out of me. And it's quick. Once I come to, I'm feeling fine. \n\nI take medications to raise my BP and a beta blocker to lower my pulse now. I also have to make lifestyle changes and dietary changes.\n\nSome people are just fine by drinking more electrolytes and water. I'm unfortunately not one of those. :/ \n\nBut it's worth a shot. To get diagnosed is actually quite tricky. They have to watch your episodes while they happen and catch them in the act. \n\nI had to wear a heart monitor for a month (I also have an adhesive allergy, so even with the \"sensitive\" pads, I about ripped my hair out). Mine was a little monitor on my chest and I had to carry a phone around. \nThey also scheduled me for a tilt table test.\n\nBut anyway, this isn't really relative to the Karen, but if you do have it, it's not life threatening. It's a huge inconvenience though and it makes you very paranoid and really uncomfortable if it happens in public. I'm thinking of getting a wrist band for it, so people don't call 911 on me. :/\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to DM me. :)",

I was sore and cranky and really needed a seat because the weight of the baby was also playing havoc with my centre of gravity and sense of balance, which is crappy at the best of times.\n\nAnyway, there was also a pair of Karens waiting to get on. As I stepped onto the train, one of them seemed to notice my pregnancy and the fact that there were only two vacant seats left. She physically pushed me out of the way, made a beeline for one of the seats and put her hand on the other one to save it for her friend. Maybe they had invisible disabilities, I don't know.

            "I just can't wrap my head around how childish this woman acts just to get a seat. I normally don't have a problem with offering my seat if someone seems like he really needs it. But sometimes, especially when it's really warm outside I get really dizzy and so far some people offered me to give me their seats, because ,,you look so pale, here take my seat'', or one time I politely asked a young man if I could have his seat, 'cause I was feeling a bit dizzy and he didn't decline. One time I nearly passed out in the train because it was warm and there were so many people that I was squished between a wall and the other people. So I was having a light claustrophobic attack, that went worse every time the train started to move again, to that point that I was constantly feeling dizzy and already started to cry a little. Luckily a few students saw that, asked what was wrong and even demanded that one guy (who the whole time acted as if he was drunk, and probably was) should stand up. Another guy then was so nice that he gave me his seat and one of the students even gave me his breakfast bread because I didn't have enough time to buy myself something to eat in the train station kiosk. At the end I luckily didn't pass out, got to my father's car at my final stop safely and already felt better when I left the train, so we didn't have to go to a doctor. But after I got home I just fell in my bed and slept until 8pm maybe.\nGreat to see that there are still some people who aren't just focused on themselves.",

I can stand, even if I'm tired, so if someone needs a seat more than me, I'm happy to give it up.\n\nI let others rush into a train first to claim seats because they really want a seat and I don't care. I do this because some people need a seat and I won't know, so I'll let those people grab a seat first.

We also had an outlet store, so we often had to bring out unboxed appliances.\n\nOne day a customer came in with a receipt for a fridge he bought from the outlet store. So I grab it and bring it out. Turns out he has a pickup, with a very tall canopy over the back; and a bed that was absolutely full of construction debris. The crap was level with the top of the pick up bed; but the canopy was pretty tall and would accomate most of the fridge, laying on it's back (we gave him the warning about making sure to set it back vertically for 24 hours before plugging it in).\n\nAnyway, we shoved it in, but it didn't quite fit far enough to close the back doors. So I ran and grabbed some nylon twine to tie the two door handles together to keep it from flying out.\n\nAt this point the customer starts giving me crap for using weak-assed twine that will break immediately. I pointed out that the twine was absolutely as strong as could be and definitely would not break. But he started rifling around in the back of his truck and pulled out 10 feet or so of Coaxial cable; cable TV cable.\n\n\"Here, now THIS is strong\" he told me. I couldn't help looking at him like he was insane. You might make a case that it is somewhat strong; but there's no way at all you could tie it together to secure it. It would clearly unravel almost instantly.\n\nI tactfully tried to explain this to him, but he just got madder and madder.  I began to realize that I better get a witness to me explaining to this dude that he was on crack. So I called Loss Prevention (Security) and they came down and together we explained to him that we cannot guarantee that his jury-rigged bullshit would properly secure his load; and if something happens we would not be liable. And then Loss Prevention took some poloraid photos of the completely tied up job.\n\nFlash forward 15 minutes. The guy is back in are parking lot. There is NO fridge in the back of his truck.

So I call the manager, and then also call Loss Prevention; who came a little bit later.\n\nSo apparently he drove down the road, and about a quarter mile away, he turned right to get on the freeway entrance ramp; at which time the back doors flew open, and the fridge flew out. Apparently it was currently sitting in three pieces on the side of the freeway entrance.\n\nThe guy screamed the store manager, claiming I completely fucked up loading his car and he wants a new fridge. At this point Loss Prevention showed up; and explained to the manager; \"it wasn't quite the way he is saying it. lazespud2 offered to secure it tightly with our approved, super strong twine, but the customer insisted that he use coaxial cable instead. Lazespud2 made it clear that he felt this would NOT secure the fridge and in fact called us up to document the situation. And here's the photos of what it looked like and what the customer said he approved.\"\n\nThe manager looked at the photo, rolled his eyes, and told the customer, \"I'm sorry sir, this is completely on you.\" and then the manager walked away.\n\nI was stunned; Sears honestly would take ANYTHING back, or refund anything, as long as you pushed it a bit. But I guess this situation was so clear cut to the manager that he wasn't gonna give an inch.\n\nThe guy sputtered that he was gonna sue us; and in the distance, without turning around, the manager just says \"it's always your perogotive to throw away even more of your money.\"\n\nHe never sued.",

            "I saw something similar once about 15 years ago. \n\nI was working at a retailer that had, under one trading name, different franchised businesses under one roof selling different things. So one franchise sold whitegoods and browngoods, another sold furniture, another sold computers. You get the idea, none of the businesses are anything to do with each other except the name.\n\nI was working in the computer store and had just clocked off and left when I came up behind a ute that I'd seen a customer loading on the back dock. Had a massive (for the time) TV in the back, something like a 40\" plasma. Easy a few thousand bucks. He has it stood upright against the cab, with an occy strap across the front of it to stop it sliding backward. I'm sure you see where this is going.\n\nHe turns to get on the freeway and being in a V8 ute, decides to mash the loud pedal a bit. Bad idea. TV slides sideways, hits the edge of the ute then just kind of rolls up and over the edge, and down the embankment. What a mess.\n\nNever did find out what happened from there.\n\nEdit - apparently I used the wrong symbol for inches. As I'm in a metric country I'm not used to it. ",

            "When I was in high school I was highly active in the theatre arts department. We were getting ready for an upcoming show, and had to pick up some 4x8 stage extensions from another school across town.\n\nThese things are 4x8 sheets of 1.5 inch particle board with folding table legs in the bottom. These things could hold up to an entire Riverdance group. A good 175-200lbs of wood and metal a piece.\n\nLoading them up in the back of a teachers truck, I grab a couple ratchet straps out of the back seat and go to start tying them up when the whole group stops me and tells me not to bother, they\u2019re heavy enough to stay in. I try to argue, but quickly realized they weren\u2019t having it.\n\nWithout another option to get back from the far end of town, I reluctantly get in the truck.\n\nNow between the two schools there is a major road that is 10\u2019 higher than the side roads that feed it, and they go up 10\u2019 in probably 10\u2019 of road. We\u2019re sitting at a red light directly on the incline, and we hear metal scraping then a loud smash. We get out to find the decks in pieces on the ground behind the truck. Our saving grace was no one was riding our ass  because it was an easy 1000+ pounds of wood and metal that would have totaled the front end of a car or killed a motorcyclist.\n\nWe loaded the broken pieces into the truck and drove off. \n\nBet that teacher had fun explaining why they had to write off half the divisions stage decks. This was one of many safety violations I couldn\u2019t be complicit in, and I decided not to join theatre arts the following year. \n\nE: Formatting",

Guy comes in one day, stereotypical contractor look. Covered in paint and drywall dust, etc. Buys a full finishing package, (doors, mouldings, etc) and wants it loaded on his vehicle. Okay, cool. I tell him to back it into the bay, and I go grab a forklift and his order.\n\nI come out and find him backing in a goddamn Jetta. He gets out, ignores my look of wonderment, and tells me to toss it on the roof rack. I, of course, refuse and tell him that it's complete lunacy to put this lift on a rack that's only intended (or rated) for a couple hundred pounds, let alone what the car can handle. He informs me that I'm an idiot, and if he can haul 40' ladders on the rack, then the 8' pallet of doors (with 16' mouldings, btw) can obviously fit and demands to see a manager.\n\nBoss comes out, nearly drenches the guy with his coffee when he sees the car, and says (in nicer terms), \"fuck you buddy\".\n\nAfter a ten minute screaming match, the guy decides that if the forklift won't do it, he'll just dismantle the skid and stack it on the car himself.\n\nOnce he finally has it stacked, and it looks like his suspension was going to blow out, he pulls out a set of electrical wires. The kind you find supplying power to your wall socket, behind the drywall. Pre-cut to various lengths, already blackened (white cables) in places from tying other shit down before this.\n\nI stand up from my viewing spot amongst my fellow amused coworkers to offer some very sound advice when my boss holds me back and shakes his head no.

At this point my supervisor wasn't the best person. I dont know if she didnt like me because i didnt take her garbage like everyone else on the team did or if it was something else entirely. We butt heads a lot.\n\nAnyway, a few months ago in April, the desk chair at my home office broke while i was noting an account (im not the lightest guy, as my username might imply, and it was a really old chair i got from my ex). My back was injured really badly, parts of the chair were dug into my skin, i had cuts, and parts of my shirt were stained red  and cut up from the injuries. I messaged my supervisor immediately about this, telling her i would be clocking out to go to the hospital.\n\nNow, i have never been late a day in my life, and i almost never use time off, even when it's offered. There was no reason for me to be 'skipping work' that day either, especially since the office was so slow.\n\nAfter im in my car with a towel on the drivers seat, my supervisor texts me, somehow offended that i was going to the emergency room. She later said she didnt believe me, and that if i wanted any kind of workers comp i had to prove it to her. Cue malicious compliance.\n\nOnce i was home from the ER i snapped a photo of my freshly stitched back, my stained shirt, and a picture of the broken chair. I sent a photo of these things to her, as well as a screenshot of the texts to HR and the site director, just to make sure nothing got lost.\n\nI later got reimbursed for my time, the medical bills, AND a $400 replacement chair to use moving forward. The day after i came back i was called by the site director who told me i would be changing to another team, and a week later i was told my old supervisor was no longer with the company.\n\nThe moral of the story: dont take guff from anyone and always keep the reciepts.",

This is very important on \"spec jobs\". \n\nOur company uses a routing and tracking system I will call the Terrible system. If there is a good route or less than good route it chooses the worst route of all routes possible. Ater working with it a short time this was noted. During training new drivers are told to use it for final part of route only. Problem is every time one doesn't follow a route an alert is sent to management.  Early in using Terrible system managers found a way to turn off these alerts. \n\nNew manager starts. After a year he brings up in meetings drivers are not following Terrible system routing. Multiple times we tell him it gives us the worst and longest routes. He doesn't listen.\n\nAfter six months he states drivers will be written up if we continue to not follow Terrible system routing. Drivers don't listen. A few days after this pronouncement a fellow driver is written up. This is talked about. \n\nCue malicious compliance! Next day on my second load I have a load to a location I had before. It is 15 miles east of the pant and then a 10 miles north leg. Following that route takes about 45 minutes or less. We had been going to this job site for three months by this time and knew Terrible system gave a much longer route. I was first truck of four and noted on the radio we needed to follow Terrible system route as directed. Off I go! \n\nRoute it takes me is southeast 13 miles. North on interstate highway 35 miles (including a chicken coup...weigh station for non truck drivers...trucks are chronically overweight for interstate). East through a large metro area for 20 miles followed by last leg south of about 15 miles. Takes 125 minutes for me (Terrible system gave estimated travel time of 140 minutes so I did well). I arrive and I'm timed out. Rejected and that costs company $1000 for the concrete not to mention 20 gallons of fuel I burned. Second and third truck are the same. Fourth truck was stopped at chicken coup and company had a $500 fine. \n\nCustomer is pissed! Calls manager screaming! Manager asked to talk to me. I tell him we followed the Terrible system routing as directed and he can check that easily. Next day in break room is sign posted stating drivers are to use professional discretion in choosing best/most expeditious route to jobs.",

That road happens to be the fastest way to get from the highway to the suburb of Liverpool. BUT - it has a low clearance bridge. \n\nThere are signs everywhere that trucks should take a different route. The signs post the low clearance. Sometimes drivers decide to disregard the signs and they take the short cut.\n\nWell, that low clearance bridge is 10' 9\". It's an actively used railroad bridge, and it's not going anywhere.

        "selftext": "I used to be in charge of the printer room in a rather large company. We shipped a shit ton of product every day, and everything shipped had to have the accompanying printed label/documents. Nothing can even be loaded onto the trucks without this paperwork. Now this was in the olden days of the 90s, so we had seven massive, 4-foot tall dot matrix printers that did all the work.\n\nThese printers were temperamental bastards, and if the paper jammed, the printer did not automatically stop printing. It would just keep pushing/jamming more and more paper into the machine until, if left untended, it would break down.\n\nRunning the printer room was a 2-person job. When I started I trained for 2 full weeks with the two current printer room employees (one was being promoted, I was replacing him). It was a rough f'n two weeks, let me tell you, getting the hang of the job, the various things you had to learn, do, etc. One thing that made it even more complicated was the fact that each printer had it's own personality with it's own problems. Another was the fact that a problem in one printer could have a different fix than the exact same problem in another.\n\nThe job would be quiet for 45 minutes straight, during which we did routine maintenance and such, but was really slow and quiet and restful. Because this company processed it's shipping orders in batches, once an hour. And then boy, on the hour, every hour, the batch of orders would go through and thousands and thousands of orders would come spitting out.\n\nNow, if you were on top of things and kept everything running smoothly, the orders would print out very neatly and quickly. But if you didn't know what you were doing, if you didn't maintain things just right, you'd get a back up and things would go to shit very, very fast. And when one machine went down you had to fix it FAST, before the next one jammed, because guaranteed those machines would jam up multiple times on every batch print job.\n\nSo I've been working the print room for several months, and things were great. Then my coworker gave his 2-weeks notice. We tried to train my replacement, but he was incredibly lazy and got fired fairly a few days after the end of his training. Which left me in the printer room alone.\n\nThen the bosses inform me that my \"position\" is being phased out, and I am going to be replaced by two employees transferred from a different department. So not only am I losing my job, but I have to train my replacements. And I desperately needed a good recommendation from this company, so I couldn't just quit or half-ass it.\n\nI quickly learn that both of these transfers are lazy and useless. They'd been with the company for decades, had friends in the head office, and knew their jobs were safe. I'd show them how to do something and they'd flat out laugh and say, \"Yeah, I'm not doing that\". Every day I'd be trying to train them and they would ignore me, chat with each other, leave to go sit in the cafeteria. Leaving me to do a 2-person job alone. Luckily I was good enough to handle the workload, but it was annoying.\n\nMindful of the fact that I needed a reference of this company, I kept extensive notes on each day's progress. I clearly documented every single instance of the replacements refusing to learn, even listen to my instructions. I also followed up daily with my direct supervisor, and he knew what was going on. And my notes went into the company files and were passed up the line.\n\nDespite my scathing reports, head office did nothing.\n\nNow it's my last day. This is the day the training process assigned for letting the newbies work alone, with no help or supervision allowed, to see how well they handle the job and the pressure. I was, in writing, **forbidden** to help them or answer any questions.\n\nAs I expected, things fell to shit pretty much immediately, minutes into the first batch of orders. One of the biggest printers jammed, and the clueless twats had no idea how to fix the printer jam. Because they ignored me every time I tried to show them how.\n\nSo they turn to me, and demand that I fix things. I'm sitting on a desk, coffee in one hand, an apple in the other, and smile and say, \"Yeah, I'm not doing that\". So one of them is yelling at me while the other is basically thumping uselessly on the printer like a gorilla that just found a candy machine. Then a second printer jams.\n\nPaper starts spilling out of the back of the first printer (which, if you knew the job, was a really, really REALLY bad warning sign). \"Well, I'm going to go to the cafeteria, good luck!\" I say as I stand up. As I'm leaving a hear a third printer *cccrrrruuunnnch* and jam up.\n\nI went to my supervisor and let him know what was happening. He said he not only expected as much, he had predicted so repeatedly to his superiors. He once once again specifically forbade me from offering any help. So I went to the cafeteria and read my book for a little over an hour.\n\nThen my supervisor comes to me to let me know what happened. The entire printer room is down, every single printer either jammed up or actually broken. The company is losing thousands of dollars every single minute. One of the shipper/receiving supervisors finds me, all in a panic, begging me to get the orders printed.\n\n\"Sorry, I'm not allowed to do that,\" I replied. Now several people are running around outside the cafeteria, all in a panic, running from place to place to figure out why they don't have any shipping orders.\n\nThe chaos took HOURS to resolve. And I wasn't allowed to fix the problems. Any time someone started giving me a hard time, my supervisor would intervene and show the memo from the bosses stating that I was forbidden to help in the printer room that day.\n\nI spent my entire last day at work drinking coffee, chatting with coworkers, and reading my book. The whole fiasco ended up costing the company tens of thousands of dollars.",

            "Good on your boss!\n\nI worked in a shop like that. Every printer definitely had its own personality and quirks. \n\nSome geniuses in upper management decided to do dispersed printing instead of consolidated. This meant new cheaper printers were placed in specific departments and operated by the department personnel. \n\nI'm sure you can imagine how that turned out. We had a hotline that had to be answered by the 3rd ring. Now, with dispersed printing, we had to leave our area whenever something went wrong with the cheaper printers. \n\nThe cheaper printers were more finicky, and since the personnel had zero experience troubleshooting, we were leaving our work area multiple times each day. Of course, we were always short-handed. \n\nA department head would call demanding we come immediately to fix their printer. While that was happening, the hotline would ring and ring. The solution was to get us mobile phones. \n\nWhen we left our area, we had to transfer the hotline to the mobile units. The units had bad reception and lost their charge quickly. Then, personnel who called the hotline would get angry that we weren't at the mainframe consoles to immediately fix their problems. \n\nIt became clear that the new, \"improved and cheaper\" solution wasn't working. Printing was once again consolidated, and the hotline was answered in a timely manner. \n\nTwo years later, the crappy new printers were completely decommissioned. We held a fund raiser, and anyone with $5 could take a swing with a sledgehammer at one of the printers.\n\nBest $20 I ever spent!",

I yanked it out of its wires and launched it out of my door.

After this, I took it back of to my room and repeated the process.\n\nFunnily enough, it still sort of worked, so I put it on eBay as a bit of a comedy listing.\n\nI had a ton of messages from people with similar stories, most just thanking me for the chuckle.\n\nAfter that, it found it's home on the second landing in the rubble from the hole in the wall, next to a couple of traffic cones and a road work sign which appeared one night.

Never failed that the checks would get pushed off all week and those responsible for the checks would try to force the duty people on the weekend to do the checks.

        "selftext": "Another tech story: I\u2019m a contractor at a big bank in New York City. No benefits but I\u2019m paid by the hour. I like the people I work for and while I realize I get paid well, I try to make sure they get their money\u2019s worth.\n\nOn the Friday before last (start to the three-day weekend), I was told by one of the managers (mine is out on vacation) that one of \u201cmy\u201dapplications was malfunctioning in production and that it absolutely needed to be fixed pronto. This application was tested to a crazy degree, so the first thing I did was call up the server admin and ask what was different between our test and production systems. After some prodding, I figure out that the production system consists of two clustered servers whereas the test server is all on its own. On the theory that the data isn\u2019t transferring between the paired servers fast enough for the next web page to be rendered (it\u2019s a survey application where the answer to one question determines the next question to be asked), I suggest checking the \u201csticky bit\u201d (which would ensure that when a person uses the application, they will \u201cstick\u201d to one server, to eliminate the data transfer problem.) \n\nThe admin (who\u2019s a friend of mine) tells me she can\u2019t make that change without *her* department\u2019s manager\u2019s approval, a kind of know-it-all guy. \n\nFine. I tell my substitute manager what I think the problem is (thinking he\u2019ll go to bat for me) and instead, he tells me to \u201cstay as long as it takes, including giving up my weekend to ensure it\u2019s working\u201d and he tells me I\u2019ll have to work it out with the department manager for the server group.\n\nLong story only slightly shorter, that guy proceeds to make my and his two employees\u2019 lives miserable all weekend. I keep suggesting the sticky bit, he keeps telling me \u201cthere\u2019s no way that\u2019s it\u201d and suggests dumb strategy after dumb strategy. I keep telling my substitute manager what\u2019s happening, he keeps telling me to work it out...and stay as long as I need to.\n\nFinally, late on Columbus Day, my admin friend says \u201cI\u2019m just going to try your idea without telling him.\u201d\n\nFixes the problem...less than two minutes effort.\n\nWhen my manager got back from vacation last week, he called me over to his desk. He had just gotten the bill from the contracting firm. He seemed pissed. I had billed for three extra 8 hour days.\n\nHim: \u201cI just have one question: where did you sleep?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the couch in the waiting room.\u201d\n\nHim: \u201cOK. Thanks.\u201d\n\nEarlier today, my manager came over with an envelope and when he handed it to me he said \u201cI\u2019d tell you to thank [substitute manager] and [server group manager] for this but since it came out of their budgets, maybe best not to. Don\u2019t spend it all in one place.\u201d\n\nCheck was for my regular pay plus, um, almost $18,000. My manager socked their budgets for time and a half from the end of business of Friday to open of business on Tuesday.\n\nWhen I told him later that I felt bad, he said: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t, you taught them a very valuable lesson in server technology and business management that they obviously missed.\u201d\n\nDid I mention my boss used to be a programmer himself?\n\n**Edit:** Gee, so this is transitory, temporary, low-level Reddit quasi-fame! ;-) I figure I\u2019d get a few comments at most, really I just didn\u2019t know who to tell besides my mom and all she kept saying was \u201cgood for you, honey!\u201d Weird week all around. To wrap up my couple minutes of quasi-fame and week of self-indulgence, here\u2019s the update:\n\nMy boss called me last night to say that his boss\u2019 boss would like to have lunch with me. I didn\u2019t think she knew my name but it\u2019s not really about my long weekend...that just reminded her I exist. :-/ In any case, they\u2019ve asked me to think seriously about coming on staff and they want me to create a position for myself. They\u2019ve proposed coming on staff before but the create-a-job thing is new. Mostly I\u2019ve resisted because the idea of managing others \u2014 and becoming one of *them* \u2014 makes my skin crawl. My manager said they\u2019ve been talking about it for a while. News to me.\n\nSo, that happened. \n\nAlso, apparently the \u201cbonus\u201d was my boss\u2019 idea but his boss and his boss\u2019 boss signed off on it because they didn\u2019t think it was fair and because it was a way of rewarding me for \u201ceverything I\u2019ve done\u201d (been here 5 years.) It\u2019s not the first favor they\u2019ve done for me either. Two years ago, they were told to cut consultants and they classified me as \u201cessential\u201d (I\u2019m really not, they just seem to like me) to keep me around until they could figure out how to keep me. So, anyway, I\u2019m a bit more comfortable with how things went down.\n\nI wasn\u2019t really expecting advice from everyone but it did get me thinking and just to wrap up this horrifically self-indulgent story, I decided to start a \u201cpotential future offspring\u201d investment account. My parents did a lot for me and if I have kids one day, I\u2019d like for them to feel lucky in this world. If I never wind up having kids, I\u2019ll gladly help someone else\u2019s kids feel a little lucky. It\u2019s not millions of dollars but it\u2019s enough of an unexpected windfall to start saving for that off right.\n\nLastly (and I was planning to do this anyway, now I can do just a bit more), once the taxes are figured out, I figure I\u2019ll give a generous but not crazy [donation](https://hispanicfederation.org/unidos/) to hurricane relief in P.R. bc it\u2019ll make me feel better about how fortunate I am generally and bc they\u2019re freaking Americans for God\u2019s sake (...and not trying for applause or sainthood. In fact, I have given much less to charity than I could...and I\u2019m superstitious enough to feel like after this week, I really have to avoid tempting the Fates.)\n\nThanks for sharing my weird week with me, Reddit. :-)\n\n**TL;DR**: Was told to spend my weekend in the office arguing with an uncooperative manager.

        "selftext": "This happened a couple of days ago in Hollywood, FL. I traded up my phone for the holidays on AT&T's website and arranged a pickup in my nearest store. The receipt I had for the pickup said that the phone was being held until Dec 30th, so I go in on the 29th to pick it up. I needed to get to work and I wasn't going to be available to leave work during business hours, so it had to be then. I was hoping the whole process would take 15 minutes. It didn't.\n\nI get there and the individual, Alan, tells me that my phone wasn't available because I had waited too long and they had canceled my pickup, even though I had until the next day to do so. I show him the email that says that and he shrugs his shoulders and he says that they canceled the order because they counted the day I placed the order as one of the days towards cancellation, which is obviously stupid.\n\nThen he offers to sell me the phone that I was trying to pick up because it's impossible for me to pick up the phone that was being held for me. I just want my goddamn phone so I agree to go through the purchase process, and as it turns out, I will have to pay for the phone again and let AT&T refund the funds for the original order. Major bullshit but again, this is all the time I have to pick up my phone. I asked him for the phone number for someone I can speak with about what is going on and he tells me I need to speak to customer retention and gives me a phone number he pulls off a list.\n\nSo he goes through the process and by then I'm late for work, and he tells me he's having problems selling me the last unit of the phone I wanted to purchase. He tries to upsell me. I tell him that I want the goddamn phone I ordered and tells me that he's having some trouble because the system is not letting him sell that unit. It's the last unit he has, so he needs to take extra steps to sell it to me. So now he goes on his phone and makes some phone calls to try and unlock this unit. Meanwhile, he leaves me alone long enough to find out that the phone number he gave me was bullshit. It led to a non-working extension for AT&T and it would just stay on hold. I went on google and discovered this by finding the \\*actual\\* customer retention phone number and calling it.\n\nSo now I'm speaking with a customer retention specialist and I explain to him what is happening over the phone. The retention specialist confirms that, yes, my phone is available for pickup and has NOT been canceled. MEANWHILE on his phone, I can hear Alan speaking with someone at AT&T and the person he's speaking with says over the speakerphone, \"I can't allow you to sell that phone, it's being held until tomorrow for customer pickup.\"\n\nSo I asked the person on Alan's phone to repeat that and confirmed that yes, Alan was trying to sell me the phone that I had already purchased and was there to pick up. Then I ask the Customer Retention person I'm speaking with if he heard the other individual's comment. The customer retention rep confirms that he heard what the other AT&T rep has said, and the retention rep asks me to confirm the store number I'm located at and the name of the person I'm speaking with.\n\nAt that point, Alan, upon realizing I'm speaking with Customer Retention and Retention heard everything he's trying to do with \\*my phone\\* tells me to leave the store and tells me he's going to call the police if I don't. Customer retention rep on the phone hears him kick me out of the store.\n\nSo I didn't my phone that day, but I did have it delivered to my house next day UPS, which was nice, and I did get to have a conference call with a regional manager from AT&T, along with a supervisor at customer retention, and a manager for third-party dealer locations, while the customer retention specialist confirms everything I was telling them.\n\nI didn't get my phone that day, but I did ruin someone else's, and that was waaaaay more satisfying.\n\n<EDIT> Dispute over ownership of a property during a sale is NOT a police issue. If I had waited for them and refused to leave, they would NOT have taken my side, they would have arrested me. Ownership of a paid-for item *at worst* is a civil court issue and no cop is going to arrest some dude at an AT&T store for not giving me my phone unless he had lifted it out of my pocket. Please stop suggesting I should have waited for the police. I was already on the phone with corporate and late for work. ",

            "I went to an ATT store to trade in two phones.

The store manager told me that wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d done something like that in order to gain more commission. \n\nI also got a couple months of free service.",
            "Makes you wonder how many times he has pulled this stunt.  I\u2019m guessing if he can convince the customer to cancel their online order and re-purchase the phone in store it counts towards his sales quotas.  The only reason it didn\u2019t work this time is because the only stock he had was the one being held for your order.",
            "He was trying to get credit for the sale (and I\u2019m sure commission).  I worked in cell phone sales.  When a customer orders and delivers to store like this, the associate has to go through the whole process like they sold the phone (activation, setup, etc.) but without getting any sales credit or commission.  So he was trying to cancel the pickup and turn around and sell it to you to get the credit.  Backfired though.",
            "Fuck Alan",
            "Alan was trying to pad his sales numbers.\n\nHe knew if you bought the phone from him and ATT refunded the initial purchase price, he would get the sales credit\n\nPretty sure Alan probably got fired",

            "I worked for ATT Mobile and an ATT Call Center. This is extremely common.

            "TL;DR: AT&T are just dedicated to assholery. \n\nEDIT: Thanks for the silver, kind redditor. \n\nOn my phone, sorry for misspellings and formatting issues. \n\nAT&T tried something similar with my family.\n\nPhone under warranty stopped working. They sent us a new one. It never arrived. Like...over a month later. So I call in and say so. They send another one. \n\nI am told SPECIFICALLY not to accept delivery of the first phone should it ever show up. Just to hand it right back to the delivery person saying \"refused.\" And if the delivery person leaves it instead of waiting for a signature, to write \"refused\" on the package and take it to any place that handles however it came (USPS, UPS, FedEx, etc.). \n\nA few days later, the first phone shows up. The delivery person dropped and ran, so I write \"Refused\" on it and take it to the UPS Store, which handles USPS as well, since that's how it arrived. UPS hands it off to USPS and I think we are done. \n\nNOPE. \n\n2 months later, my account was suspended. I couldn't even call customer service from our account, and like a lot of people, we don't have a landline. So we go get a cheap T-Mobile so I can call to deal with this. \n\nTurns out, they hadn't gotten the first phone back. So I say \"how is that my problem? You can see that I didn't activate it. You can use the original tracking number to track it on it's way back. This is your issue since I did as I was told.\" They rebut with I need to pay over $900 to turn the account back on. So I say that I need to talk to a manager, because that's trash. \n\nManager tries to tell me the same thing. But the people I'm talking to are NOT the people who sent the phones. So I ask to talk to the people who shipped out the phones to clear this all up. I eventually get to that department and am told that there are no notes about refusing the package. I say \"doesn't matter, that's what I was told to do. Do now it is your job to find the package and fix my account.\" \n\nThey agree to turn the account back on because we had been paying the monthly bill. \n\nAfter 2 more months of collection calls and me just repeatedly saying \"check the notes on the account\" I finally get fed up and I go to the post office to ask for help. \n\nAs I told the reps, the tracking number was still active. The USPS rep was able to pull up the full tracking for that number. It had been delivered to the watehouse - and signed for - THREE DAYS AFTER IT WAS AT MY HOUSE. They got that thing back in record time. And for 4 months had been hounding me. \n\nSo I take this data and the name of the person who signed and call AT&T. They insist it's not there. I say it was signed for. This woman gets all indignant \"will, how do you know THAT?\" I replied \"I went to my post office and asked. I have a copy of the tracking data in my hand. I'll send you a scan of it, if you'd like. But the fact is that it hit your warehouse 2 months before this all started. So now you have to fix it.\" She gets further huffy and says \"I have to look into this.\" I said that was fine, but I expect the charges to be removed from my account immediately. She literally just hung up. \n\nThree days later, the charges are gone. But um not done. I call back and ask to speak to the head of the department that spent all this time fucking with me. I'm told this person will have to call me back. I say fine, how long? They take my info and I'm called back about an hour later. \n\nThe head says \"I see this issue is resolved. What else can we help you with?\" I say \"You used the word \"resolved\" imappropriately.\" Then proceed to tell this whole story. I think we are owed an apology from the department, at least. We've been harassed and chided and told we were lying for 4 months. And half the people I spoke to were unprofessional or straight up accusatory that I'd stolen and sold a phone they had literally had in their possession thr whole time. This bitch says \"well, what do you expect?\" I think I Karen'd a little because I said \"I've been a customer of AT&T since pagers were a thing. I've never stolen. I've never had my service cut off for non payment. I've never been a bother to the company. And suddenly, I'm a liar and a thief. So I expect an apology. I'm not asking for money. I'm asking for AT&T to accept responsibility for this situation.\" She says that's not going to happen. That's it. No apology. Nothing at all. Just fuck you without a handshake.",
            "There's a lot of scumbags in mobile sales, unfortunately. The commission system incentivizes it. I was glad that, when I did phone sales, we actually just had a flat commission rate, meaning it didn't matter if I sold someone a $100 phone or a $1000 phone, so there was no pressure on my wallet or from my boss to upsell.",
            "These small phone shops in Florida are scandalous. \nI took my Samsung in to fix the port a couple of years back in south beach. \nThey kept the phone and were giving me the run around saying they'd sent it somewhere to get repaired etc... we've on for about 3 weeks. \nFinally I demanded my phone back, they tried to give me someone else's phone!! 3 times! (3 different phones)\nI ended up calling the carrier, who said they're not a licensed repair shop for them. The lady sent me a phone for my trouble, and told me go to the shop now... they have your phone.\nI said, no it's in the shop in Hollywood.....\nShe said, oh no honey, go there now, they have your phone. \nIdk what she said to them (probably threatened them with criminal investigation as a large corporation with a lot of $$$) \nThey gave me my phone back, not fixed, the right phone instantly... so shady",

They have authorized retailers as well as corporate stores and there is an authorized retailer not too far from my brother's corporate store. \n\nThey pull shady crap just like that all the time. The corporate stores complain about them all the time apparently because they'll sell the phones to the customers and set up an account to get the sale, but then tell them they can't activate it and they have to go to a corporate store.\n\nThe biggest commission they earn is on the activation, so the auth. retailer gets it, then has the corporate store do all the work and get nothing in return.\n\nOr they do an activation, but then say *oops, sorry we don't actually have the phone here, but they have it the corporate store up the road.* \n\nJust shady crap",
            "I take Adderall, a drug that is infamously hard to obtain legally even if you have an ADHD diagnosis (Have that diagnosis but stop taking it for too long? Sorry, no meds for you even though you literally need them to function).  So, anyway, the Walgreens app said I had till the 30th to pick up my prescription.  I called ahead of time with like 10 left so, with my ADHD brain, I procrastinated picking it up.  I got a call on the 28th from the pharmacy saying if I don't pick up soon, my order will be canceled.  I made it a plan to pick it up that next very morning after class.\n\nI show up, and it's the 29th.  I hate being in public so I'm already nervous, and what the tech tells me makes me go down with anxiety: They threw my meds away.  I panicked because I know how hard it is to get this medicine in at my location, and I only had three left.  I'm not addicted btw, I just need these as my ADHD ruins my life otherwise.  \n\n  \nIn my panicked state, I got a little angry asking why would they throw away my medication?  The app said I had to the 30th for pickup.  She accused me of lying and told me next time to pick it up early.  And while I wasn't early, I definitely wasn't late.  It took another 2 weeks to get my meds in, and I was the most unproductive foggy-brained person to ever exist.  Just had to deal because it's a controlled substance and all.",
            "I\u2019ve always avoided partner stores, but if you ever do online orders to the carrier corporate att stores the sales people get comission for just processing the orders so they will want to just quickly get through giving it to you(though they probably will try to get you to add protection etc because just plain upgrades look bad on them)",

            "As someone who knows more than the average person about this situation in particular, I'm honestly not sure why Alan did what he did. There's 2 scenarios where I can kind of understand: 1. He saw an opportunity for a better sale beforehand but you had reserved his last unit so he had his manager cancel the order so he can help the one in the spot or 2. He didn't realize that online sales that are rung out by reps still pay those reps as much as if he had done the sale himself, its not all positive as there are sales metrics they need to hit outside of just the sale of the phone itself but it's an easy sale. It could be a different version of scenario 1 where he knows he has a customer coming in at a later time for the unit you purchased, which was his last. \n\n\nIn the end, it's really dumb to try and lie to a customer like that, especially when the order hasn't even been cancelled and it can be easily proved its still there.",

This is a very common practice for ARs and even some retailers due to commission.\n\nDespite the fact that retention shouldn\u2019t have to handle these calls, we often did just because ARs didn\u2019t know the products. They often tried to steal our sales and offers. We are retention because we are handling cancel calls.

Retention had more tools and was able to do these things.\n\nIf you\u2019re with AT&T you better be well versed in fine print and understand nothing is free, and if you\u2019re at the store and they\u2019re having to make a call to help you better just pack it up and leave.

            "I think I actually understand most of the issues Alan had in even trying to set up your \"new\" already-purchased phone. I had a job that dabbled in cellular sales, including AT&T, and the company I worked for allowed AT&T presales through them. As other comments have noted, Alan was probably lying to you to pad his numbers, but he painted himself into a corner by not being honest or, alternatively, a better liar/salesperson. AT&T, to the best of my recollection, only allowed presales on unallocated inventory - inventory that was sold or in process of being sold wasn't considered viable for presales whatsoever, and it seemed the only model of phone OP wanted was already sold to him viable presale. Alan likely lied to get credit for the sale, but because the store had no more inventory of the OP's model, he was forced to attempt an upsell, because he clearly didn't think ahead. When the OP refused the upsell, Alan had to call sales support because he already started the upgrade process in the system from the phone OP *already bought* to something else. AT&T's system required (at least when I was using it) devices to change once that 'upgrade' button was clicked, sales support was gonna need to be called because Alan needed them to reverse out of everything he just did.\n\nIn all likelihood, the phone that was sold and attempted to be resold was probably able to be activated via swapping SIM cards and turning it on, but Alan seemed to have completely fucked that situation.",

A couple months later I noticed that I was still getting charged for the old phone on my bill and I went into the store to look into it and thankfully the manager was the one helping me. After I explained everything she had a funny look on her face and I knew something was wrong. She had me point out who helped me (he wasn't in but she pulled up his FB page and I confirmed his face), apologized for the error and said she would have the charges for the old phone removed.

I\u2019ve learned about a ring of sales contracting firms under a larger parent company known as SmartCircle.  It\u2019s a giant MLM that generates about 20% of AT&T\u2019s gross new revenue.

They have no idea how to sell and are desperate to make a livable wage, or 2. Their numbers aren\u2019t high enough and their job is being threatened by their management.\n\nIt\u2019s an incredibly deceptive business approach with an extremely high turnover rate.

This was several years ago, but I was in the OnStar program (customers could hook up the phone in their OnStar equipped cars just like an additional line on their VZW account). The thing with that program was, we had to use special price plans only available to reps with OnStar access. Store reps couldn't do much with the account other than upgrade phone lines - and could not, under any circumstances, upgrade the OnStar line.\n\nSo. Many. Reps would go to that line on the account and use its \"upgrade\" outside of policy.

Speaking up consists of the vendor asking us to provide info, which I know we have readily available and state I can provide. Another example was clearly defining vendor responsibilities vs our companies responsibilities. After one of these times, she called me and said if one of these examples occur again she will write me up. We discussed how even though I was taking the correct action or providing the correct information, it is the principle of me doing it which she said is disrespecting her in front of her peers because it is not my place to make those decisions. I responded by acknowledging this fact and how I have failed her as a follower.\n\nSince then I have remained ghost quiet on meetings and only speaking when spoken to. This has resulted in the vendor having to repeatedly ask for information across multiple days before my boss comes to me for help, which has delayed projects and pushed out deadlines. \n\nNo fallout as of yet, but if things continue to run like this shit is gonna hit the fan to which I will post a pt. 2 of this story.\n\n-EDIT-\nPt 2 - I left the company for a higher paying and more senior position.",

            "I was fired in a similar situation.  That was in 1999 and to this day it still bothers me.  I worked with a no-compete clause as well so I could not work for the competition for 2 years. I applied anyway and told them the situation and that I knew that someone who had worked for my previous company had been hired despite a no-compete clause.  They had made use of a loophole making him a corporate sales manager with no region specified.  But they did not go for it likely based on what my manager had told them.  I ended up on unemployment for 6 months and eventually took a job in a plastics factory filling orders in the warehouse.  A year later I was able to get a job in Development at the college I had graduated from.  And a year after that I actually used my degree and taught at a junior college.  I know an self-employed doing freelance Q.A for tech companies.  I make ok money considering where I live but I still think that I could be working for Verizon in their corporate office as an executive making close to 6 figures with good benefits and stock options.  The manager who fired me had been having an affair with one of her bosses.  He happened to be who and had with her when I was fired.  I had won an award as top office manager in the Midwest for the 4th quarter 1998.  I was q Senior sales rep meeting 175% of monthly quota. I had fixed problems with missing inventory including phones which are identicied his an electronic sales number which shows up anything they are used to make a call. I had been able to end a culture of sales reps lying to customers about coverage and costs and had retained those customers by working with the Corporate customer service manager for our area who made sure they were repaid any costs that were due to the lying and offering to let them out of their contracts of the competition was a better fit for them.  So the woman who fired me lasted less than a year and left to sell cars.  In 2001 the company who owned the Cellular One franchise in our region sold their license.  There are 2 cellular licenses in each region.  The A side and the B side. The A side is now owned by U.S. Cellular.  The B side is now owned by Verizon.  I would have been in the thick of that transition had I not been fired.  U.S. Cellular had briefly owned both licenses.  This allowed them to switch from the B side to the A side and they sold the B side to Verizon.  The A side had previously been the better one for coverage in the most populates areas. The B side had coverage on in the southwest corner of the state near Arkansas which was only an advantage for truckers who traveled through their almost daily. Verizon immediately put up a new tower that and U.S. Cellular followed suit and with the roaming agreements that followed after the smaller companies were all bought out there is no roaming anywhere in the country.  I have gone and on because I wish I knew what to tell you to do to not end up having to leave for being too good at your job.  It sounds like you should have your bosses job.  And it sounds like she is the kind of manager that I do not understand companies wanting.",

            "Quick questions.\n\nDid she threaten a write-up or did she say that she was giving you a verbal warning that would lead to a write-up? \n\nThose are very important questions. It will determine the length of your employment with that company.\n\nIf it was a threat then you need to go to HR right away. Write it all down in a letter and then copy it submitted into the human resources department immediately. You are being browbeat at your job. it is making you uncomfortable and it is causing you to not work effectively because you have to be quiet. The company hired you for a specific reason, they saw your skills on your resume whether you're newbie to the field or old hand at a new job, they hired you specifically because of your resume.\n\nIf she was giving you a verbal warning that would lead to a write-up. Then she could be following protocol but even a verbal warning must be in writing. \n\n You are working for a company and the company always wants to make money and continue selling to the vendors she is stopping cash flow. You must report to the human resources department ASAP! don't wait any longer. This is how you get documentation. And if the human resources does not seemed to make this an important issue you must go over Human Resources head.\n\n Your future is at stake here because most companies talked with other companies, there's at least one person within the company who is talking to another person within another company and this could stall your career. You don't have time for that b*******. The company wants to make money and you need to be employed. Logical economic heads will prevail.\n\nAdd-on throw away:\n\nMost companies have long-time employees or employees that have been working within the field for a long time. Most times they are ready to get rid of that person but they don't quite know how to do it without getting themselves in trouble. So they hire different kinds of people for the sole purpose of throwing a kink in this particular person's employment. They're just waiting for that one person to Buck and complain so that they can start the process of getting rid of that person. That one person we call a game changer. You could be the game changer. So don't wait any longer take necessary steps right away you just never know what's going to come of this. That position she's holding could be your position. Or it could be a lead to your next step in your career.  \n\nDon't be afraid. If you are an excellent employee and doing an excellent job and your skills are above and beyound then even if this company lets you go other eyes are watching and you will get another position somewhere else relatively quickly.

The right thing to do here would be to explain to her that you're seeing pieces missing and it's going to cause a loss in business or cause problems, and then ask if it would be okay for you to participate in those areas of the call.\n\nI worked at a bike shop as a salesperson and I would always hate it when my coworker would jump in on a conversation with a customer. They had no idea what I had just been saying to the customer or which \"track\" I was pursuing, and half the time would come in an contradict what I had just said, confusing the customer and turning them off.
