        "selftext": "When I was a baby my mother was home full time with me and 3 siblings under the age of 6.  According to my mother, one day my father comes home and is mad because dinner isn't ready and waiting for him.  Mom tells him she's been busy and it'll be ready soon.  Dad says he doesn't know why she didn't do it sooner (and here's his mistake) because it's not like she's been doing anything all day but sitting around 'babysitting'.  Foolish, FOOLISH man.  Game on.\n\nMy mother decides she will show him what life is like when she sits around all day 'doing nothing'.  For the next few days Mom lets the kids run wild.  She picks up nothing.  She doesn't tell the kids to pick up anything.  She doesn't stop the kids from getting into anything.  Mom said she just sat around making sure nobody was doing anything dangerous.  She doesn't clean, do laundry, etc.  BUT dinner was waiting!  LOL After several days of a HOT MESS at home my father couldn't take it:  he apologized and admitted he was wrong.  Quite a milestone in our family.  Dad was NOT known for admitting he was wrong OR apologizing!  Mom 1, Dad 0.\n\nEdit: Just wanted to say this happened 1967/1968.\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for the awards!  Glad some of you got a chuckle out of this family story.  ",

            "Good for your mom! That reminds me of a story I read (the book was about the history of vanilla) where the wives of farmers in South America liked to have their hot chocolate- not any hot chocolate either as it had to have spices and vanilla etc.-  during mass and the priest was pissed about mass being interrupted by their servants running up and down the aisles with their drinks. So he bans it and all the women move to have mass in the local nunnery instead. Well wouldn't you know mass is now empty because they've banned the men from attending or they're sleeping on the couch so to speak. It was a great moment to read about, even if the priest did end up relenting in the end.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the upvotes!",

            "My mom got mad at my dad once and took off to her parents' for two weeks. I had to get up, fix a *hot* breakfast for my dad, sisters and myself before school and dinner at night (three *hot* meals a day on weekends). Dad expected a packed lunch every work day, too, but that ended after two or three days of sandwiches. \n\nA few days in, he informed me that he was out of work clothes. I informed *him* the laundry was caught up (everyone but Dad who could reach the washer did their own laundry, but a few sisters couldn't reach, so I'd had to do theirs and mine). He told me they were in his bedroom. I told him I wasn't cleaning his bedroom...then ran. \n\nWhen I got home from school, Dad had managed to put his dirty clothes down the laundry chute which was *two steps* out of his way to the breakfast table. I had his laundry done by the time he got home...I even ironed his work shirts (I wasn't *that* brave).\n\n*But* I didn't put his clothes away because I *refused* to go through his bedroom to find out where things belonged. Fortunately, he was a private enough person he found that reasonable!\n\nWhen Mom got home, she was absolutely flabbergasted when Dad kept putting his clothes down the laundry chute!",

            "My mother went on strike once. I was always a very self-sufficient child and once I hit my teenage years I was out of the house almost all of the time. At one point when I was in high school my mother complained cuz I wasn't doing any chores around the house. I suggested that if she wanted me to do chores she would give me an allowance. She agreed and I began doing chores around the house. After two weeks of washing dishes and vacuuming the carpet I got no allowance so I stopped doing my chores. My mother took all the dishes and silverware with the exception of one plate one cup 1 knife one fork and one spoon and put them in her bedroom. She stopped buying groceries ( or so I thought).One day while she was out I broke into her bedroom and discovered that there were 16 bags of groceries in her bedroom and some of them had food that was molding. A month later she told me that if I moved out she would give me my father's child support. So I moved into an abandoned trailer. But again, she didn't give me the money so I end up having to move back in.\n\nI know this sounds horrible , but it wasn't really a big deal to me. I pretty much only came home to sleep anyway. I was either working, at school or hanging out with my friends.",

I cleaned the bathroom once and then didn't enter it for the entire duration (toilet was in a different room). I didn't tell anyone I wasn't using it anymore. 3 days it took to become a mess again.  \nAfter 2 weeks I get shit again because I make the bathroom dirty, I explain I haven't used it for a while and nothing changed because my family doesn't know how to admit to mistakes... infuriating.  \n\n\nSame with a roommate and the kitchen. She complains I leave the kitchen a mess when I cook, so I clean the kitchen really well, stop cooking. 2 days later the kitchen looks like a warzone and doesn't get properly cleaned for a week. She invites someone over, tells them \"please excuse the kitchen, V1nchent doesn't clean up after he cooks\"...  \nI tell her I cleaned the kitchen and haven't made food for a week, so it's all her mess.  \nShe just tells me I am lying.

            "I just came across your story through a 'best of' site, and I've had the exact same experience as your mother \n\nI am the stay at home mum, while also working part time on the farm we rent on while my wife is the primary bread winner doing a 9-5 job. I do all the cooking, cleaning, running grocery errands, sorting 6 dogs, two kids and their schedules all the while keeping a huge house clean and a massive garden mowed and looking nice. \n\nI'm typically up and running at 7AM, (sometimes as early as 4 depending on my work schedule), and won't sit down again until 7pm once all the dishes are done again and the dogs are settled for the evening. Because my wife gets done at 5pm and isn't home till 530, at most she only sees the food come out the oven and then the time I do the dishes afterwards. This translated in her mind that all I do is tea and dishes once a day and since the house is clean, I must surely just be sitting around all day doing anything since there isn't anything to clean. She would fuss at me asking why I didn't clean all day if she found anything put on a counter. I sort of created this as I recognise her work is difficult (eye doctor) and that she provides for us, so I have never had a problem being house mom and just doing everything myself so that she could enjoy her time off with the kids. \n\nUnlike your mom, I didn't go on strike intentionally. Instead, I got covid and it hit me like a freight train. I was unable to move or function for well over a week.  I was so bad that I spent 5 days laying on the floor unable to move or eat and lost nearly 20 lbs. Because I had covid the whole family was on quarantine.edictably, and predictably the house fell apart. \n\nAfter a day, you couldn't find a clear surface anywhere in the house, the kids rooms disasters, the bathrooms were nearly classed as bio hazards, no clean clothes, dishes, the floors were nasty and you couldn't walk through the garden without stepping on piles of dog shit scattered everywhere. The worst part for her was when she realised I wasn't going to make food as I was completely out of commission, and she hasn't had to make a cup of coffee, much less a meal herself in nearly 15 years as I am the queen of the kitchen.\n\nAfter I got better, she watched in amazement as I put the whole house back together in a matter of hours over an afternoon, and had a specific home for every single item and was able to zip around cleaning disaster rooms in a fraction of the time she thought it would take me. The next day I tackled the garden, from mowing to trimming the hedges to clearing all the crap, with tools she said she had no idea we even owned.\n\nEver since our quarantine ended, she hasnt uttered a word that she thought I didn't do anything.",

            "This isn't new though. Unfortunately happens all the time. Men develop a mentality that childcare is beneath them and that they are doing all the work by going to work and bringing in a paycheck. It can happen in reverse but typically women are the ones who give up their careers to take care of children. \n\nThere was a big enlightening discussion on it in one of the child free subreddits I believe. \n\nI've also seen couples that have way too many kids like it's going out of style. Typical relationship again where the woman is home and during lockdown the guy went crazy. As soon as the office was partially opened he was there. He couldn't stand to be home with his kids. Its like... Hmm guess you shouldn't have had that many then huh? Most ppl don't think about that though if they can find ways to not deal with their kids. Daycares, sitters, etc. I even have family like this who come home too tired to deal with their kids...and I'm just like...they are your kids. You choose to have them and that comes with spending copious amounts of time with them and actually taking care of them. Doesn't stop when you birth it into existence.",

            "That story (the title, at least) reminds me of the time, probably 1962 or 1963, when my mother ran away from home. We kids (there were four of us old enough to be problems that way) had no doubt been too rambunctious for her to handle, so she told us that she couldn't take our behavior anymore, and was running away from home.\n\nWhen my dad got home from work a couple hours later, he was met at the door by four children who were *very* upset and tearful, and *very* sorry, and we promised to be good, and could Daddy *please* find Mommy and bring her back. It turned out that she'd gone to a neighbor's house with the youngest (who was 1 or 2 at the time), and had asked the people next door to keep a quiet eye on the rest of us.",

            "I learned a long time ago to not rely on others. If I came home from work and dinner wasn't at least cooking, I'd do it. Our kids loved that cause they knew I was the better cook. Originally, my wife was a \"empty the can in a pan and heat it up\" type cook. The only thing she'd add was salt. (Like canned food needs more salt)\n\nCame home from work one day, the day before payday. I asked her what's for supper. She replied, \"Nothing. We don't have any food.\" (she thought I was holding back my paycheck and could just go to the store whenever I wanted. Nope) I went into the kitchen and, for not \"having any food in the house\" I showed her that the cupboards weren't empty. Found some instant mashed potatoes, milk, margarine, a couple cans of soup, and a half container of sour cream. Made the mashed potatoes, added the cans of soup and mixed it in. She took one look at my creation and refused to eat it.  She picked up the baby (he was about 2 months old) and announced that she wouldn't eat that garbage and went next door to her friend's house to bitch about my cooking. (mind you, I'd spent 10 hours unloading trucks when this happened) I had our girls sit at the table and gave them a little bit to see if they'd at least try it. I put some sour cream on mine. Not bad, really. They thought the plain was pretty good, and I recommended the sour cream. I gave them a bite of mine and they loved it. Our 2 little preschool girls and I ate every bit of it, wishing that I could have made more. Ex comes back and says she's willing to try it, and got pissed because we didn't leave any for her. Well, she said she wouldn't touch it, so...\n\nThe ultimate revenge? The girls spent the next hour talking about how good my dinner was, stressing how yummy it tasted. Meanwhile, their mother's stomach started growling. I pointed to the kitchen and said I'd found some oatmeal she could make if she was hungry.\n\nWhy didn't I do the typical, \"I'm the breadwinner and expect food on the table when I get home\" routine? It was easier to make supper myself. I used less energy to make supper than I would have arguing with her. \n\nBut, to add insult to injury, I stressed that regardless of me cooking or not, HER job was to clean up the kitchen.",

        "selftext": "Hey folks! I have a story of malicious compliance that I think you'll appreciate. This happened at my previous job, where my manager was the definition of a micromanager.\n\nAt this job, we had an hour for lunch, but the breakroom was small, so people usually staggered their lunch breaks. It was an unspoken rule that as long as you didn't take more than an hour and your work didn't suffer, no one really cared when you took your lunch. That was until our new manager, let's call him Dave, stepped in.\n\nDave decided that he needed to control when everyone took their lunch breaks. He created a strict schedule, assigning each person a specific lunch hour. My assigned time was right in the middle of my most productive part of the day, which was super frustrating.\n\nI decided to follow the new lunch schedule, but I also decided to take full advantage of my rights as an employee. You see, our company policy stated that any work done during our lunch break was considered overtime and needed to be compensated.\n\nSo, I started to \"accidentally\" schedule meetings, calls, and tasks during my lunch break, making sure to meticulously document every minute of work I did. Then, at the end of the week, I'd submit a detailed overtime report to Dave, showing him all the extra work I did during my lunch hour.\n\nDave was furious, but he couldn't deny my overtime requests without violating company policy. After a few weeks of paying me extra for work that I would've gladly done during my regular hours, Dave scrapped his strict lunch break schedule and let us go back to our old system.",

I was working 60+hrs a week trying to stay ahead of all the problems she created because she wouldnt listen.  One of the last straws was being summoned to a meeting where I was written up for not completing a couple tasks that she assigned months ago.  No mention of how much work I had done, how much of HER work I had done, nor any mention of how much money I'd saved our department. I just sat there kinda dumbfounded by it all....and then I hatched a plan.  I took a voluntary demotion all the way to the bottom of our department which was the furthest I could be a way from her.   6 weeks later without me covering for her sorry ass, she was terminated. I'm still here and have worked my way back up the chain a bit, but they can keep the managers role to themselves.",

            "Similar thing happened to me. Was working at a small company and the employees used to just finish what they were doing before going to lunch, for efficiency. That meant that we were often beginning our lunch hour later, thus returning to work a bit later in the afternoon. Once the owner of the company saw us in the break room just after 1pm, ran to her office and wrote us an email, saying that the lunch time was from 12:00 to 1:00 and we were expected to respect those times. So we just left whatever we were doing at 12:00, even if it meant that we would have to redo the thing after lunch, cause some things just couldn't be left half-done.",

This table of 4 people walk in and they're all relatively nice and I give em the good old casual greeting and seat them down. They do their stuff and order their meal and for drinks they only get table water which is normal. When I bring out their food the old man (hence forth OM) asked for a bottle of the red wine. Now we don't serve alcohol nor do we even have a byo. I'm not yet 18 so I can't even handle alcohol if we did. I told him we don't have any alcohol, and he goes on this rage pointing out a bottle that was on our shelf. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI knew what he was pointing to. It was our Chinese vinegar. Now these bottles look remarkably like Asian alcohol. They're green with red on it and all the writing is in Chinese. And I told him that, \"sir that's vinegar not wine\" He went on an alcoholic rage yelling about how I couldn't know what alcohol was cause I was underage and how I was hiding alcohol from him and he would make a complaint on our Facebook page. His children and wife look embarrassed and are trying to hide themselves, and his wife gives me a look that just says \"do it and he'll regret it\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I went and got a bottle of the vinegar and put it on the table. OM makes a really big deal out of it saying shit like \"AH wasn't that EASY\" \"waitresses in MY DAY would have done it in 2 seconds\" I walk away and when I turn around to check, he'd spat a mouthful of vinegar out and onto the plate and was trying to wash out the taste of CHINESE VINEGAR with water\n\nTo be fair the wife did come up to me later and apologise for his idiocy. They never made that Facebook post, and paid $20 for the bottle since we couldn't use it again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Most likely alcoholic old man demands a bottle of Chinese Vinegar thinking it's red wine.

Keep in mind that there were mandatory 2 week at-home quarantines in place for anyone coming back to my state, but my boss fully planned on ignoring those quarantines and demanding we all would return to the office as soon as we got back. \n\nI was carrying a heavy workload and pulling a lot of the weight around the office, and I had some rank. So, I felt fully comfortable expressing my deep concerns to K, telling her that it was peak covid season, and that I had a newborn to worry about now. I expressed I simply didn\u2019t feel comfortable going in the middle of a global pandemic and asked if there was a remote training I could attend instead. She firmly, ADAMANTLY insisted there was no remote training, and informed me that I could quit if I was that upset with her decisions. It\u2019s important to note that she insisted this for weeks, even claiming to have contacted the training organization to make sure. I decided on the spot after that meeting that I would be quitting. But I needed to check my boxes first, which took me a few weeks to figure out. \n\nSome time after this meeting and her incessant insistence that there was no remote training, it finally occurred to me to check with the organization putting on the training and ask them to clarify if there truly was a remote training or not. I did, and lo and behold, there WAS - and they had been offering it for months. I asked them to email this information to me. \n\nNow to figure out how to use this valuable information, right? Wrong. As soon as I stepped back into the office, K starts fake-empathizing with me out of nowhere, in front of all our coworkers. saying she really wished she didn\u2019t need to force me to go to this training. So, I said, \u201cif you feel so bad, let me go to the remote training.\u201d She looked at me in surprise, and her face turned beet red. Before she could fight me, I pulled up the email with the information and read it aloud in front of all our coworkers. No one said anything, they just stared, wide-eyed at her while she blubbered like a fool. \n\nLong story short, after pulling that fast one on her, I pulled her into a private meeting a gave my notice. She was horrified because, as I stated prior, I carried a lot of the work around the office. \n\nBut, like she said, I could quit if I didn\u2019t like her decisions \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nETA: for privacy reasons, I can\u2019t go into why I didn\u2019t rat her out, or why she was intent on going out of state. But I DO believe I know the reasons why.",

Most of those projects were postponed, but others continued and we were required to drive to and back from the job sites daily (my major project at the time was about 3 hours one way). However, travel for personal reasons was limited to a very specific radius from their HQ. No overtime was allowed without direct supervisor approval, and most guys **lived** on the OT. Masking was \"required unless the customer says you don't need to while on premises\", which many were vocal about *why* they did not and would not require masks.\n\nIn January of 2022, they released a company-wide email mocking the executive requirement for weekly testing for unvaccinated employees, and vowed to \"protect our freedom\".

        "selftext": "This is my sister's story, but it's too good to not share. This was back when she was in second grade, and this girl was the perfect child. I wish I was kidding, but no. You know that ONE kid with the halo and the sweet smile, the manners to make a parent proud, and cutesy little voice? Yep, that's her. But, she DOES have a mean streak when you push her. You would think that ALL the teachers loved her, right? Nope, not her second grade teacher. This woman was hellfire personified, and she for some reason hated my little sister. More often that not, my little sister came out of that classroom trying to hold back tears. Two more very important things about my sister - she has always had lips that would get so chapped they would bleed, and she always carries around Carmex with her.\n\nSo, one day, she's sitting in class with Hell's favorite teacher when she pulls out her little tub of Carmex and the teacher immediately starts screeching at her to see her after class. End of class, and the teacher tells her that she MUST keep the Carmex with the school's office because it says \"medicated\", and back in the day you had to be literally dying just for the office to give you your things (no joke, I'm asthmatic and it took almost dying on the office floor for them to hand my inhaler over but that's another story). My sister tries to explain that without the Carmex her lips will bleed, but the woman does not care. Well, Hell hath no fury little a sweet baby scorned.\n\nVery next morning, she doesn't use any in the morning, doesn't use any for the ride to school, doesn't use it before sister hands the little tub of Carmex over to the office lady (who looks at her very confused but just does not give a shit) and she heads off to class. She does her best to keep calm when she starts to feel her lips get chapped, keeping her lips as drawn in and neutral as she can. She spends most of the day with her head down and not speaking, until finally the teacher calls on her to answer a math question. Now, I should probably warn everyone this might get a little graphic. Sister lifts her head up, looks this woman right in the eyes and smiles as wide as she can. Tears are rolling down her cheeks as she can feel her lips splitting open so badly that they're not just bleeding a little. It's rolling down her chin, mixing with her tears, down her neck and onto the collar of her shirt. This woman screamed so loudly that us third graders across the hall could hear it. She ended up ripping her lips so badly they had to page little third grade me to call my mom to pick her up, and she had to stay home for a couple of days to recover.\n\nWhen she came back, however, not only did the teacher personally hand her Carmex over, she had bought her a few more little tubs of the stuff for \"just in case she ever ran out\" and never bothered her again. I don't know if it was coincidence that year was the last year she taught, but a little part of me likes to think that she met her match in my little sister.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I really, REALLY didn't think I was going to have to add any of this, but here I am.\n\nMy sister has tried every lip balm under the sun, has seen a doctor, ect ect ect. All other lip balms either never work or she has an allergic reaction to them. All medications, all products react to people differently. What works for you does not always work for someone else. I'm finding some of these comments rude and snide, and it's really all unnecessary. There's trying to be helpful, and then there's trying to be right. Please stop.\n\nThe school itself didn't care that she had Carmax. Perhaps I should have elaborated on \" hands the little tub of Carmex over to the office lady (who looks at her very confused but just does not give a shit) \". The school NEVER needed to hold onto the lip balm, this was purely the teacher - the HELL teacher that I keep referring to in a NEGATIVE and NASTY light to emphasis what kind of woman she was - on a power trip with my little sister.  The next person I see remotely begin to defend the teacher, you're an asshole.\n\nEDIT 2: Against my sister's request, I removed the small hair color jokes . I'm tired of getting death threats - actual death threats! - in my direct messages and right fighters in my comments. ",

            "In the late 90\u2019s I was a junior in HS and my family moved from one state to another. In the process of doing so, a lot of household things had to be moved out of storage. The amount of dust that had accumulated was enough to cause me to have multiple sneezing fits. To the point where, by the time we got everything unpacked in new state, I had blown a blood vessel in each nostril of my nose. After copious nosebleeds, I go to the doctor and get them fixed by chemical cauterization.\n\nA friend told me that she overheard our English teacher telling other students that I had to be making up the whole thing, or was grossly exaggerating the truth, when I had to miss a class one or two times.\n\nWell, a day or two after the cauterization, I was in class (NOT English) and started sneezing and the dam broke. I head up to the main office to call home so I can go back to the doctor. I\u2019m sitting there trying to staunch the bleeding while I wait, and guess who walks right past me? My English teacher was waltzing through and literally did a double take when she saw me... probably because in a desperate move to prevent recreating the elevator scene from *The Shining*, I had used my own shirt until an alternative was acquired. I looked like a deranged murderer. Part of me really wanted to say, \u201cYou should see the other guy,\u201d but instead opted for the dejected waif look, to really nail home the shame. It must have worked, because she actually apologized and never brought it up again.",
            "I think the keeping the inhalers at the nurses office is one of the stupidest ideas ever. So you make a child who is *having difficulty breathing* walk to the office so they can start breathing. Kids die of asthma at schools who do this.",
            "Some teachers are just so jaded, they really should have some kind of testing to see about relocating some away from kids. \n\nI too was one of those innocent kids who followed all the rules, and never got in trouble. Around the 4th grade, I suddenly started having spurts of low blood sugar, that actually had me passing out if I didn\u2019t get some oj or something in me quickly. Since the 4th grade teacher witnessed me drop, and the 5th grade watched as my poor old grandpa had to fireman carry me from the room to see a doc, I didn\u2019t have many issues. I would tell them I was lightheaded, and they would have me sit in the corner with graham crackers and oj till I could take my seat. \n\nBut one day, we had a sub. We also had some lame pop quiz, and wouldn\u2019t you know it 3 questions in I feel the darkness pulling at me from the corners. \n\nI got up quietly, and whispered to the sub about what was happening. She straight up wasn\u2019t having it. She has subbed a few times before, so I knew her to be bitchy, but again, I was a kid who never lied or got in trouble, so it didn\u2019t occur to me she wouldn\u2019t believe me. She reamed me about trying to get out of the test, which I assure you was more distracting than me whispering about feeling dizzy, and sent me back to do my work. \n\nSo add in desperately thing to hold back tears, while fighting off the darkness, and you can guess what happened. I was leaning my face on both arms, trying to at least look like I was working, when the darkness took me. My arms slipped, and my face slammed hard into my desk. Worst bloody nose I\u2019ve ever had. I was out cold during the first part of the gushing, so it basically just went where it wanted. Other kids desks, and if I remember right, some kids were hit with the spray. I woke up to the sub desperately screaming for help, and cramming tissues or something to my face. \n\nIn the end, I missed the quiz (drenched in blood as it was lol) and was sent home early.

            "I get really chapped lips during winter. One year, I was really into using those EOs lip balms. You know how people tell you that lip balms were designed to make your lips more chapped? Come winter, I started believing that. My lips were so dry, the corner of my mouth split. For weeks, no matter how much lip balm I'd apply, I would keep ripping it open when I'd eat, no matter how careful I was. It was miserable.\n\nThen I realized there were medicated lip balms. I bought a blistex one. By the end of the week, the corner of my mouth was healing. Now I swear by medicated lip balms and refuse to use others.\n\nGlad your sister is okay and didn't cause some permanent damage. That's some dedication! Ouch... \n\nAlso, screw the whole 'medication must stay with the office' bs. My nephew had an asthma attack at an after school activity and he didn't have his extra inhaler because the school confiscated it despite his parents saying he was old enough to carry it with himself. He was okay, but scared having to take an ambulance. My brother threatened to sue to school district. SUDDENLY he was allowed to carry his inhaler with him.",
            "In the early 2000's, kids' high school did not allow students to keep ibuprofin, acetominophin or aspirin on them. They had to go to the nurse's office to get them - and the office had to have a parent-signed permission form to take them. (Part of the war on drugs.)\n\nOne day one of my kids (still a minor) came home and informed me that he had donated blood that day when the Red Cross had set up in the high school.\n\nWhat???? They can stick a minor with a needle to draw blood, but can't give someone a bit of acetominaphin? Sometimes laws make no sense.",
            "I completely know that feeling. I don't always have chapped lips, but when I do they go from fine to cracked and bleeding in no time at all. I left the house one day to drive to see a friend about 40 minutes away, through the middle of no where. Half way through the drive I can tell that if I smile or talk my lips will crack. I stopped at a random gas station (the only place as far as the eye could see) and bought whatever lip balm they had. I didn't care that it was over $5 for a little tube of whatever. It was a necessity. \n\nNow I keep them all over (but mainly in bags I use when I travel, because planes seem to trigger it) so I'm not caught without.",

            "My first-grade teacher was an evil hag with a better-than-thou complex. She had a hate-on for me from day one because I corrected her when she would say my name wrong. I have two last names, and she would *only* call me by them rather than by my first name like the rest of my classmates. However, if my last names were \"A-B,\" she would call me \"B-A,\" so I corrected her.\n\nNow, my first-grade teacher and I both loved art, so my six-year-old self thought that maybe, with my passion, I could win her over. I was sorely mistaken. Whenever she would make us do paintings, she always had me do a self-portrait, even if all the other kids had to paint trees, or a house, or a vase of flowers. She would circle the room, making comments on how to improve their work, which paints to mix to get the desired result. But then she would get to me. \n\nShe would take my paper and loudly remark at how horrible and ugly my painting was, and encourage my classmates to say what they hated about me- \"Ah- no. Her *painting*.\" But my classmates knew what she meant. She'd go around the room and have every classmate say something like, \"She's too ugly. She looks stupid. She's too fat. She sucks. She's no good,\" and other such things. \n\nWith every comment, she'd have my classmates rip a piece of the painting off and by the end, I would be left with nothing, and I would have to start over. \n\nThat wasn't the only thing wrong with my shit school, but I have a deep hatred for that woman. Fuck you, Mme. Nadeau. Also, jokes on you, hag; now I'm a better artist than you ever were.\n\nMoral of the story? Some teachers absolutely suck ass and should NOT be allowed to handle children.",

            "Schools can be horrible for things like this. Years ago a friend of mine, whose son needed to be given medicine at school for epilepsy, took the medicine in and gave the instructions to the school nurse. When it was time to bring in a new bottle of medicine, the nurse was confused, looked in her cabinet, and found the first bottle my friend had given her. It was unopened. She laughed dismissively and said \"Oh, I must have forgotten.\" She just plain forgot a child's epilepsy medicine and blew it off. This was a very good school district, but that didn't matter here. Or maybe she felt like a big shot so maybe it did matter. In any case, my friend went off on the nurse, went off on the office, and told the whole story to her son's doctor, who contacted the school with a complaint of his own. Nothing happened to Miss Whitney (some parents used to call her Miss Witless). Some people said Miss Witless was having an affair with the Vice Principal and would go unpunished because of it. I don't know. But I do know that I heard another mother tell about how she went into the school for something and saw a little girl throwing up horribly in the hallway beside the school nurse's office, in full view of Miss Witless, while Miss Witless sat in her office laughing with a friend while she saw but ignored the little girl. If anybody doesn't believe OP about how these things happen, the examples are countless. If you have a child in school, find out what you can about what really goes on there, just in case. Obviously not every school nurse is witless. But it's always a good idea to check your own school out.\n\n  \nEdit: I know that OP was talking about a teacher, not a nurse. But if even a trained nurse can screw these things up, a teacher can too.",

With stuff like asthma inhalers and epi-pens, isn\u2019t it an actual safety hazard that the stuff isn\u2019t with the student but instead in some office far at the other side of the building?\n\nI live in Finland and as a teenager I used to have really bad period pains that I regularly treated with ibuprofen (Advil in the US). The other option was to go home, miss school and cry in pain for a couple of days per month. So, I carried these regular otc painkillers in my purse or backpack everywhere I went. Then I went on a high school exchange in the US, and everyone was freaking out about a 16-year-old being able to correctly recognize her own monthly symptoms and medicate them safely in a way that didn\u2019t interrupt her education. I had to turn the ibuprofen in to the school nurse, and my host mon had to come in and specifically fill a form to allow the nurse to give them to me when I independently say I need one, without calling her first.\n\nComparison: next year back in my Finnish high school the school nurse got me started with my contraceptive pills (I was 17 so still underage) and wasn\u2019t legally even allowed to call my parents because my health, specifically my reproductive health, is my private matter and children have rights, including privacy, here. That same year, I had a geography teacher who got a really bad headache one day. He looked in his own bag, realized he had run out of ibuprofen, and then just asked the class if anyone has any. Half the class raised their hand and someone gave him one, and teaching resumed regularly because he didn\u2019t have to leave the class to find the nurse\u2019s office, wait if there was a line, and possibly have the headache get so bad he\u2019d have to go home.",

Her boss, the Head of Finance was a sleazy guy, and despite being semi-wealthy (it was a BIG company) and married with kids, he always tried to pick up younger women in the office.\n\nEventually after a few years, my Mom, being the amazing accountant that she is, noticed small irregularities in several statements. I don\u2019t know the technical terms, but Mom realized that someone was embezzling the company\u2019s money for at least a couple decades. Concerned, she brought it up to the Head of Finance... who proceeded to demean her, call her names, botch her claim and basically threatened to fire her if she brought it up again.\n\nMy mother is not one to start crying, and instead sought to prove him wrong. However, a couple of months later Head of Finance brought in a new lady (young, she was legit blonde, fresh out of college) to train under Mom. My mother instantly knew what this was, and started putting out feelers for a new job. In the meanwhile she trained the younger lady, who, to quote my Mom, was \u201cnot the brightest bulb\u201d.\n\nNow, Company W had a policy when an employee was going to be fired. If the employee was being fired (for reasons other than rule breaking, violations, etc) they would be allowed to say that they \u2018quit\u2019 to be able to give their weeks notice and get pay. A fair policy.\n\nSo one day Mom was summoned by Head of Finance and told that he was firing her. She quickly counteracted and used the policy to her advantage, which angered Head of Finance but he had to comply.\n\nThe Malicious Compliance I know you\u2019re waiting for?\n\nHead of Finance told my mother in a, rather rude way, that since she was going about it that way, she might as well do an exit interview.\nMy mother literally had a lightbulb moment, and said to him that in that case, she would.\n\n(To note: an exit interview is a formal way of leaving a job, akin to an interview for getting the job. It's a way for employees to share their experience, and why their leaving for records, including HR (Human Resources). You can see where this is going).\n\nSo, she was scheduled for the exit interview. When she went in, my mother had to, of course, bring in files relating to her work (I can\u2019t recall the exact reason, other than it having to be relevant to her reason for leaving), and show it to the interviewer.\n\nMy Mom brought in three large boxes of files, each one containing evidence of the embezzlement. She then presented it to the interviewer, who my mother told me was rather stunned, and proceeded to hand over all the evidence and proceed with her exit. Including talking about the Head of Finance\u2019s reaction and how not long after the new lady was brought in to replace her. Mom then left the company that day, got new employment, and moved on.\n\nIt was a decade later that she learned what happened. My Dad was a delivery driver at the time and actually made a delivery to Company W. While there he talked with an employee, mentioned my Mom had worked there and how she left, and the employee told him quite the juicy story....\n\nIn the year following my mother\u2019s departure and interview, her evidence was brought to HR and the CEO, who ordered an internal investigation. Hidden cameras were placed in the accounting division, every file made was screened ave photocopied, tiny details scrutinized and bank records triple checked...\n\nI think you can see where this is going. Yup, the Head of Finance was embezzling from Company W. But... it gets better. They got him, on camera, making out with the new lady inside the main office after hours. To add insult to injury, the cameras also caught him being cruel to those under him, touching other women, etc.\nBut the biggest thing was still the embezzlement. Head of Finance managed to, in over thirty years, steal over a *million dollars* in Company W\u2019s earnings. From his days as a mere accountant and all through his promotions. Now the exact way he was able to get that much over time wasn\u2019t told to my dad (I doubt the employee knew), but he did know the fallout.\n\nHead of Finance was summoned to the Big Cheese\u2019s office the day after the evidence was complied... and let\u2019s just say Head of Finance wished he had simply been fired. He was arrested for the embezzlement, and for sexual misconduct (or something like that), as well as a few other things my mom can\u2019t recall. The new lady who came in actually revealed that he had brought her in after starting to date her and even revealed to her what he was doing. Her job basically had been to help him cover it up so they could live the rich life. She didn\u2019t even know what exactly accounting was, other than managing money. The perfect cover, so to speak.\nAnd if the now ex-Head of Finance thought being arrested and charged was bad enough, when his wife found out...\n\nThe employee who told my dad this hadn\u2019t been present when the wife had come in while the ex-Head of Finance had been led out, but a friend of his had seen what happened. She had just went up, smacked the now ex-Head of Finance, screamed obscenities at him, before saying she\u2019ll be seeing him in court for a divorce.\nWhile my dad couldn\u2019t learn what exactly happened next, what was clear was that the guy\u2019s life was ruined. And my mom, while not a vindictive person by any means, did feel somewhat joyful over the outcome.\n\nLesson to be learned here: *never* screw with an accountant who actually knows what they\u2019re doing.\n\nTL:DR My mother discovers signs of embezzlement, gets demeaned and then slowly replaced by her boss. He offhandedly \u2018tells\u2019 her she might as well do an exit interview while quitting. My mother does so, but shows evidence against him that ends up with him being changed for embezzlement and getting divorced by his wife for being with another woman.\n\nEdit: Wow, this really blew up! I told my mom and she was in disbelief! Thanks everyone, you made her day!\n\nTo clarify, the malicious compliance is that at the exit interview, my mother *has* to submit paperwork relating to why she left. So when the Head of Finance sarcastically told her she might as well go for it, she did. And presented all those files of evidence against him, stating why she left (including what he had said to her). This is not revenge because my mother never intended it to be, she actually didn\u2019t realize how deep it went or that he was such a scumbag. She simply did exactly as she was told!\n\nAnother thing to clarify: the CEO got involved because one; Head of Finance was leeching from their funds for a long time, and two; ...they *had* been friends according to mom. Yikes. Also please note she didn\u2019t learn of the fallout until a decade later, and from my dad who was told by an employee from the company, and mom told me. If I did get something wrong, well... telephone effect anyone?\n\nWow! Just saw the notification about the gold! That\u2019s insane! And that upvotes! You guys really made my mom\u2019s day! Thanks all!",

Even got my honorable discharge.  \n\n\nHowever,  as part of my departure stuff, I was accused of cheating at doing a outbound task.

I didn't understand the strange look she gave me, at the time.  \n\n\nA little later a friend joined the table.   Seems he had been in the admin area in the afternoon after my exit interview.

Spite empowered me and I managed to get to a hospital with the last of my strength (and my boyfriend's help) to get my fluids drained. I felt a lot better, but I was in so much pain in the beginning that my doctor seemed to take pity on me and gave me 5 days rest, and he told me to just contact him if I need more.\n\n\nI was only planning to rest it out for a day or two more, but I ended up having a whole week (or more if I feel like it) to myself feeling much better.

            "Here in Brazil, you get 2,5 paid vacation days for every month you've worked with a company, for a grand total of 1 month paid vacations every year. Companies usually make you work the first full year and then you can get vacations, depending on the company and what it works with, you can split it in smaller periods, no smaller than 10 days according to the law. Lots of people take 15 days during winter and another 15 during summer. My previous job just flat out gave me a full month of vacations whenever my turn to take them came up. Oh and if you don't want to take the vacations, the company can buy them out, but only if you agree to it writing.\n\nOh yeah, and on top of that, when you go on vacation you get a +33% bonus pay for that period. \n\nAs for accumulating vacation time, it's not a thing. It takes a year for you to acumulate 30 days paid vacation, and the company, legally, has to give you that vacation time within 1 year of you acumulating that vacation time. If you haven't taken those vacations by the time you've acumulated another 30 days, then the vacation pay for the first period is doubled. Mind you, this is in our labor laws.\n\nAs for sick days, the company is responsible for paying you the first 15 days of your sick leave. If it happens that you doctor says you need more than 15 days for sick leave, from the 16th day onward, the company will send you off to Social Security to see about getting you in disability. Two important details though:\n\n1. If your disability leave is due to a workplace accident, or a work related illness, the company, legally can't fire you for a year when you'e back from disability;\n2. If after you're back from disability and you get another illness or health issue, for a completely different cause, the whole process starts over again.\n\nI don't get it what's with the US and this fetish of working overtime, and weekends, and not being able to take sick leave or vacations or anything. Say what you will about Brazil and it's crime and general chaos of things and all that, but our labor laws are really biased towards workers.",
