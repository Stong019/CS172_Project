        "selftext": "So this story is going to be very short, as it didn\u2019t happen to me, but to a fellow professor last year.\n\nLast year, the university I teach wasn\u2019t particularly strict on attendance. The only thing not attending would get you was a call asking if you want to keep paying for the class if you\u2019re not using them at all. (there are no refunds, but they could sign you out midway through so you didn\u2019t pay extra).\n\nAside from that, it was up to the teacher to control how they wanted attendance to affect their class. This one professor decided to be incredibly strict about it and the students hated him for it.\n\nHe would physically lock the door once 5 minutes passed, and would not open it again for any reason whatsoever. If you were 5 minutes late, you lost that lesson. Some students started sitting on the hallway and talking notes while looking through the glass doors when that was an option.\n\nOne day I arrived to teach my lesson and all the students are gigly and happy. It just so happened that the professor himself arrived five minutes late that day, and the students locked him out of the classroom.\n\nFor an entire hour.\n\nI suspect he was too embarassed to ask for a key and in the process having to admit why he was locked out.\n\nNeedless to say he never locked the doors again.\n\nEdit: I guess I should have mentioned it in my post, but I was reminded of this story after reading another post in this sub. This happened around may of 2019 and at the time it was very minor so I forgot about it until today.\n\nEdit 2: english corrections lol\n\nEdit 3: More english typos. I didn\u2019t mention in the post that it wasn\u2019t my first lenguage. I teach calculus in spanish, and portuguese is my mother tongue so english is a distant third lenguage. Sorry if anyone got confused by that!",

            "Reminds me of a stats professor I used to have as a sophomore in college. The class was split into lecture and \"lab\" sections.\n\nLab was basically 80 minutes of doing lots of arithmetic by hand, designed to be long enough that most people wouldn't be able to finish in class and the rest had to be done at home and handed in next lab if needed.\n\nI happened to be extremely fast at simple arithmetic due to some natural proclivity, and having going to an elementary school where we were drilled hard and often on it.\n\nSo it took me about 30 minutes to complete. I handed it in and walked out silently.\n\nHe stopped me and asked me where I thought I was going.  \n\n\"I'm done, so I'm leaving\".\n\n\"Lab time isn't over though, do the work again\"\n\n\"No, I did the work, I get the material, and I'm leaving\"\n\n\"You need to redo the work\"\n\n\"No, I don't. I did it. The syllabus doesn't require that I sit in here for 80 minutes, just that I complete the labs. I'm paying for this class, and there is no value in me redoing simple arithmetic that I clearly know how to do.\" And I left.\n\nNext lab he gave me the paper with something like a 98%, and told me I probably would have gotten 100 if I redid the work.\n\n\"What was the top score?\" \n\n\"98\"\n\n\"Good enough for me\"\n\n\"That's a terrible attitude, what if this were real life and real people depended on these?\"\n\n\"Then we'd be using doing this on spreadsheets or something?\"\n\n...\n\nProfessor Tucker (though we didn't call him that) and I did not get along at all.\n\nHe even tried the same garbage on my final...  3 hours to do an hour of mostly rote arithmetic. Yes, I double checked my work, twice, that's why it took so much longer than normal.\n\nWhat if you missed something because you were in a hurry?\n\nDude, I could get a 0 on this and still walk out of here with a B, before the curve. I'm fine with the results.",
            "I turned up 5 minutes late for a new class when I was at college. As I walked in the lecturer looked at me, looked stunned and bellowed \"YOU! IT WAS YOU WHO GOT MY DAUGHTER PREGNANT AND RAN OFF!\"\n\nThen a moment later, calmly, \"oh no, my mistake, he was much taller. Welcome to the class.\"\n\nHe turned out to be one of those awesome teachers who would go out if his way for you and give us really unusual and interesting lessons including afternoons out around town teaching us some local history. Just don't mess him around, it was his way or the highway.",
            "When I started uni I had my economics professor who used to lock the door even If we were a minute late, once she made me in charge for making sure that all students had received the study material for her class. Guess what I was 3 minutes late for class and she locked the door, I kept banging at the door but she wouldn\u2019t open it. So I took the original notes she had, and bunked her class for the entire semester(my college didn\u2019t monitor attendance that much). She had to remake 1000 pages worth of new notes for the entire class. Moral of the story - don\u2019t be a bitch to someone who has the original copy of your notes that are gonna be used for an entire semester.",
            "I also had a professor that did this only we didn\u2019t have the 5 minutes. His class was required to obtain my degree area.

One accepted absence only. \n\nI remember trudging across campus in the dark and snow watching my friends headed home doing the obligatory walk of shame, lol. \n\nThis professor also ran a consulting business in my degree area, and our projects were all on copyrighted forms owned by him. He maintained the right to utilize any of our submissions/final project in his own business. That always chapped my hide, personally.",
            "Attendance grades in college shouldn\u2019t exist in the first place. The punishment for missing class should be me not receiving the lecture, which in turn should effect my grade. If I can get an A in your class without even attending then why am I even paying you?",
            "Used to teach organic chemistry. In general, attendance isn't really a thing for regular lectures and seminars at our university. Lab work is different, you get your lab hours and either you're there or you fail the lab course, but that's just because we have limited lab space.\n\n\nI only ever cared about people understanding the material. The lectures, seminars, problem sessions, office hours, worksheets and the book are all just opportunities to get to that point, and I think someone who has graduated highschool ought to be trusted to be able to decide themselves what works best for them. Attend everything and take vigorous notes, but never open the book? OK! Go only to the exam and the labs, but read at home? OK! As long as you learn it, I don't care how. And I don't understand teachers who do.",

She talked to me after class, and I explained my bike had a flat tire causing me to be late, still only slightly, and she still tried to argue, but I don\u2019t remember her ever doing that again to anyone.\n\nI don\u2019t get it.

He made it clear at the beginning of the class and in the syllabus that if you missed three classes, you were dropped from the class regardless of excuses. I had a friend who emailed the prof before the semester started letting him know that he would have to miss the first two weeks (4 classes) and asking if that was okay - professor refused him. The reason my friend was late? They delayed his return trip from Iraq. Fuck that teacher.",

            "I had one class first year where I either always showed up a bit early or not at all. \n\nOne day in the middle of class I got a nosebleed and had to go to the bathroom to deal with it. I took my phone because I guess it\u2019s a habit to take my phone with me. \n\nSo I fixed up my bloody nose and went to go back to class and the doors were locked. I texted my friend who was also in the class but she didn\u2019t see the text.\n\nI was terrified of disrupting the class even though the prof was super nice and probably wouldn\u2019t have been mad. I ended up tugging the door a few times to clink it against the lock and the person sitting near the door heard and opened it for me. \n\nAnd that was the only time I\u2019ve ever encountered a locked door at uni.

If anyone can get from <my previous class location at the extreme other end of a very large campus> to here in less than 7 minutes during lunch rush hour, then they should be in the Olympics.\u201d He started blabbering something but I just shoved past him and sat down.\n\nI remember this pretty clearly because I\u2019m not typically confrontational but the injustice of being locked of a class that I was paying for just pissed me off to no end.",

            "I once had a professor lock me out of a classroom because I had an allergy attack and went to the bathroom to blow my nose. When I got back I had no idea why the door was locked -- no other professor at my university had ever had problem with somebody stepping out to go to the bathroom -- so I assumed it must have been some kind of mistake. As a graduate assistant, I had a key that would open all of the classrooms in the building, so instead of knocking on the door I simply let myself back in. I was a bit shocked when the professor interrupted his lecture to ask where I'd gone. When I explained, he told me I was rude and disrespectful and not to do it again, so the next time I had an allergy attack, I stayed in the classroom, sneezing loudly and wiping my nose with my hands.\n\nI knew other students that he chewed out for alleged rudeness, including one that interrupted a social conversation to alert the building manager to a potentially dangerous situation in one of the labs -- apparently politeness was more important to him than lives. As high strung as he was, I don't think anybody was shocked when he died of a heart attack a couple of years later. I don't think he was even 50 years old.",
            "Fuck teachers/professors like that. God forbid people have other stuff to do besides be to class at an exact time. I have a job that sometimes runs late, but pays for that fucking class. (Sorry I almost failed a course because of a teacher like this)",

            "This story reminded me of the time our prof in uni used to lock the doors... from the OUTSIDE. He'd literally ask the security guys to lock the door after 5 minutes. Admittedly a fair number of students would sneak out after attendance, but pretty much everyone found this too extreme, apparently including the HR, and after a few classes the practice stopped. \n\nHe left the university a few months later for different reasons, and again tried re-joining it like 7-8 months back. There were some students in his interview presentation (or whatever it's called). Unsurprisingly, he wasn't re-hired.",
            "There was a story from my university in the 60's about a professor who would tape record his lectures. He would show up, start the tape playing and then leave, coming back at the end of the allotted time.   \nOne day he came into the classroom to find no students. Just tape recorders on each desk set to Record.",

Needless to say i was not super excited to be forced into a science class when i had no intention of studying in a science field.\n\nThe teacher did NOT like me and my friend for this reason and decided to refuse us entry to the class until we \"wanted to be there\".\n\nHowever, it was clear she had no intention of letting us back in, even when we asked to return, clearly trying to run out the clock and fail us for the semester after missing six lessons.\n\nWe took our grievances to the principle and once he knew this was not our elective, and that we were being refused entry he went off!\n\nHe called the teacher into his office while we were there and chastised her right in front of us with a line i still remember today.\n\n\"You are a teacher, your job is to teach! You do NOT get to choose who learns.\"  He laid into my friend and i as well for wasting our schooling and told us to buckle down and maybe we would find a love for science.\n\nTeacher let us back into the class again and never confronted us publicly again...we did however get suspiciously low scored on all assignments, but that very well could have just been our quality and not a bias.\n\nWe didn't gain a love for science education, but we both graduated with double majors in different fields.",

            "Haha, in middle school I had a teacher who did the same thing. Grades 6 through 8 called her 'The Witch.'

The next time she was late, we blocked the door with all the furniture we could get our hands on in the class (it required a key for both inside and out) and she ended up forcing her way through, but it was fun while it lasted.",

At the time I offered to buy a new door and help install it ( he is a self proclaimed mechanic and had the know how) the project fell to the way side, the door was never purchased and never brought up again. \nThat is, until his duaghter and I had a falling out and we divorced 5 years later. So I got served and taken to court for $2,000. A made up number that he felt was adequate. During mediation, I offered him $1,500 and to never contact me again. At which he scoffed. So I told the mediator I'd like to go before the judge. I informed the judge of the original deal, and found a matching door from a scrap yard for $400. The judge took my side and granted my father in law $400. It was incredibly gratifying  hearing him throw a fit in front of the judge to \"go ahead and file an appeal now\" and have the judge tell him that wasnt his job. And  walking out if the court room as he angrily yelled at me that \" he would be seeing me again.\" Still havnt heard back :)",

He is clearly pissed at her for the same thing since, frankly, she was in the wrong and would be liable for any claims I might make up afterwards. It was funny. \n\nNo joke.

            "Here in England & Wales a party can make what's called a \"Part 36 offer to settle\".\n\nBasically, when you win a case the normal rule is that the loser pays the winner's **reasonable** costs. The judge has absolute discretion on the costs to award, and these are either assessed on the \"standard basis\" or the \"indemnity basis\".\n\nCoats can be high and are one of the main barriers to people pursuing or defending litigation - and a big weapon to use to pursuade people to drop shitty claims. \n\nStandard basis means that if there's uncertainty over whether or not an incurred cost (say, paying an expert witness) was \"reasonable\", the judge will decide in favour of the paying party (the loser) i.e. they won't have to pay for that thing.\n\nIndemnity basis however means the other way round - the decision goes in favour of the receiving party (the winner). This overall means the loser has to pay *more* costs and is saved for where the loser has after unreasonably etc.\n\nSettlement offers can be made by either side to the other, and is made \"without prejudice save as to costs\" which means genuine offers/attempts to negotiate a settlement can't be presented to the judge to say \"LOOK THEY OFFERED SETTLEMENT THEY MUST ADMIT FAULT.\" The offers are only shown to the judge *after* judgment has been made, *if* costs are disputed.\n\nAnyway, a Part 36 Offer is a specific mechanism where one party offers a settlement, specifically says it's a Part 36 offer, and the other side has a fixed amount of time to accept that offer.\n\nOf they accept it then fine, settlement is paid and it doesn't go any further in Court.\n\nHowever, if the winner declines the offer but the Court awards them a similar amount to, or less than, the offer (or, if the winner made the offer - like, 'pay us or losses of \u00a310,000 and we'll drop things' - and the loser declines the offer and judgment is for a similar amount or more) then **the party who declines the offer has to pay all the legal costs on the indemnity basis**.\n\nThis is beautiful because it forces the party to actually consider the offer and the likelihood of getting more or less, rather than just barrelling on on whatever chance of getting more.\n\nSo here, if there were lawyers involved, even though your ex-father-in-law \"won\", because he was awarded less than you offered then he would have to pay all his own legal costs plus yours, incurred after the offer, which would likely be more than the award \ud83d\ude01",

Like he wanted to pay her X% in child support when he changed jobs but she wanted more so they went to the judge and the judge went with what he was legally required to pay, which was less than he originally offered.  He loves his kids so he paid her what he offered anyway so they were taken care of.\n\nAnother time, she said she was moving to our state so he went through all the trouble to buy a house here so that he could be closer to his kids but then she changed her mind so they had to sell that house and buy a big one back in his home state so his kids could visit easier.  Then she got pregnant and decided to move again because she wasn't married and didn't want people asking questions.  He complained so she took him to see the judge and sure enough, the judge sided with him and gave him more visitation rights including ALL holidays.\n\nAt least now they are all old enough that they can choose for themselves.",

I had been given two promotions in my time there and been moved to several domains in the IT department. I learned a lot. \n\nA role came up to be a Sr. Business Analyst within a new domain and for various reasons I was denied the promotion. Not a big deal. I understood the reasons. I really did. I wasn\u2019t bitter. A more deserving external candidate 100% got the position. I was still given the opportunity to work in that domain. Great learning opportunity. \n\nA few successful projects later in the new domain I asked if I could organically be promoted to a Sr. Business Analyst. And by successful delivery I mean my business partner going to another director in IT, who had a stake in that domain \u201cWhere has he been all of my life\u201d so I had definitely done good if not great. \n\nMy manager spoke with my Director and the response was \u201cwell he needs to prove himself\u201d \n\nI had to laugh. Don\u2019t get me wrong again. My director was a great guy. He after all did promote me twice and gave me the opportunity to learn all these various new domains of the business. Nothing against him. \n\nThe explanation just pissed me off. \n\nI would\u2019ve been satisfied with \u201cthere\u2019s no budget this year\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get approval for an in place promotion\u201d.

Otherwise I was and still am happy here. The money is hard to turn down though.\u201d \n\nIn hindsight I am glad they denied me the promotion.

            "A similar scenario happened to me. I was very good at my job and I really liked it. However, everytime I would ask about raises, promotions, or cross training, there was some excuse as to why they couldn\u2019t. So after 5 years there I started looking. After a month I found something better. 39k to 63k. I succeeded at the new job but they kept up with the same excuses. 3 years later I decided to look for the greener pastures. It also helped motivate me that over the 3 years I was there, the place became pretty toxic. Found a new gig and went from that 63k to 89k. Decided I would always be looking, at least passively. Companies are no longer loyal why should I? 9 months later I found a work from home job for 105k. Here we are now two years later and I just accepted a position for 145k. Between Apr 2018 and today I have had 4 job changes and increased my salary 106k. Job hopping is the only way to truly increase you income.",

            "I love stories like this. I was hired for a job where I quickly learned that the actual responsibilities went well beyond what was advertised, which included doing nearly all of the functions of multiple people at a higher pay grade for approximately 1/3 of the year while they travelled. My boss, correctly, flagged this for review by HR and wrote a proposal asking for a pay bump for me and noted that \u201cwe are going to continue losing good people to our competitors if we don\u2019t pay them fairly\u201d. \n\nFast forward three months. HR turned down the pay bump request and they did, in fact, lose me to a competitor who paid me 40% more to do a comparable job.

They also lost my manager who wrote about losing good people to competitors.

            "I'm running into this right now.   \n\n\nI was hired on at a new company almost five years ago. For three years, I was the only one in my department. Eventually, we hired someone else, at my level. He got promoted to Lead after a few months and... I didn't mind, not too much. He's better at management than I am, but I'm more technically skilled, more of a problem solver.\n\nA year later, we hired another guy. He's my level of experience. Then we hired two more, bringing our department to five people. Due to the economy, our raises just kept up with inflation. I always good great annual reviews. Eventually, the company announced that significant raises would be tied to position- the only way I could get a raise better than inflation would be to be promoted to Primary. I figured that I'd get that position at the next review.\n\nWell, I didn't. Other people in other departments did. I asked for a meeting with my superiors, and asked why I had been passed over. They said that they wanted me to prove myself for the position. I was a little upset (I mean, I'd been there longer than anyone else, and had always gotten great reviews- why didn't that count as \"proving\" myself?) But, I agreed, and started working even harder.   \n\n\nMy next review was glowing. I figured I'd gotten the promotion, so I waited. And waited. I saw other people get promoted in other departments. Finally, I asked again, and I was told that they still wanted me to work on some things- different from what they'd said before. I agreed to work on those things.\n\nThree months later (just a couple of weeks ago), I found out by accident that the second guy they'd hired after me had been hired on as Principal. Apparently, he'd been in that position for two years and nobody had ever mentioned it to me. I was fucking furious. After all, how many Principals does a team of five need?  \n\n\nI've got a phone interview at another company this afternoon, and I'm talking to another company in email right now.  \n\n\nIt pisses me off. In many ways, this is my dream job. But I'm ten years from retirement, and I'd like to end on a high note, not a whimper. All I can imagine is the other people in my company wondering why two people had been promoted over the guy who'd been in the company since it was founded.",

As we were mostly a call center, the emails (called web tickets) would back up as everyone was busy on the phone.

We needed someone to work the night shift to help the night guys. I gladly volunteered. We got maybe 3 calls a night and that was for general tech support. I helped with maybe 1 thing a week.

            "Another graduate of the Anatoly Dyatlov school of Middle Management. \u201cJust do what I say, your protests are delusional!\u201d",
            "Update/Edit for all those asking:His \"well played\" came with a smile that said \"I understand we are playing a game, and now it is my move\"\n\nEd seemed like a really cool manager for a while, He would swap D&D stories with me, he would joke around and seemed like my kind of boss, someone who could be light hearted and serious enough to get stuff done. That's my style, I am a hard worker and top performer who likes to crack jokes to co workers but build rapport with customers.\n\nbefore the story above I had asked Ed to place me on a special project as my numbers were through the roof and I wanted a challenge to break up the day. Boy was I in luck, that day upper management asked if they could downsize the Telephony Engineers and break down what they do into a script for employees to follow. He added me to this initiative as 3-4 telephony engineers were fired. Everyone over there wanted the project to fail, because if we succeeded we would justify letting them go. After a few weeks of this the head of all IT (My Bosses' bosses' boss) was walking around asking how the merger was going. Everyone was singing praises and false lies about our progress. Truth is we were doomed. I was the only one who told him \"It is not working and it's going to fail, but if you give me 30 minutes of your time in a meeting I can tell you exactly how to fix this\". Luckily for me this guy worked his way to the top and understood that lowly people like me could have valuable input. In the meeting I explained that those in the department wanted us to fail because it justified firing them and we just cant boil engineering degrees into scripts.\n\nMy solution was simple, give me unrestricted access to speak with each engineer separately. I will ask them every scenario on the books and off the books to fix anything telephone related. I will create scripts for all the basic troubleshooting and develop a procedure to transfer complex issues to a smaller team of engineers we can keep on board instead of letting them all go. He loved it. He placed me in charge of the project and gave me everything I asked for. During this time I was solely dedicated to the project and Ed would ask me to do Regular Service Desk stuff, I would politely decline and let him know the project deadline was approaching and the big boss is expecting things of me. It didn't sit well with Ed that I was slipping out of his grasp. When the telephony team moved me to nights I was even more out of Ed's grasp, if he wanted to meet with me he had to come in early. This is when the web ticket story starts.\n\nAfter the web ticket story (see above) Ed decided he would swap me out with another employee. I had finished all my policy writing and script typing. So the big boss was no longer watching over me. Ed informed me he was immediately swapping me with another employee in his words \"you're going to go sit back at your desk and take calls like a regular employee\" seems like a normal sentence but he added an inflection as if I thought I was better than everyone else.\n\nI called a meeting with his boss to explain that we just weren't seeing eye to eye (there's more to the story but there is not time, Ed and I butted heads on a lot of things). His boss sympathized with me and told me not to worry, the position I temporarily held was going to me solidified in 30 minutes to make it where I no longer worked under Ed, but worked under his bosses boss. I immediately let her know that I was taken off that position and it was handed to a new guy. Her face sunk, \"what? I didn't know about this\". because the switch taking place was tied to a position, not a person, it made it where the new guy got the new role. Because of big corporations there was nothing to do gears were turning and they could not easily rewind.\n\nI didn't mind too much, I went back to doing my Job and getting top numbers. Ed wanted me to grind out calls all day, but his leads (authority below him but above me) saw that everyone did 19 web tickets a day, I would do anywhere from 40-90. So they would ask me to work on web tickets full time. Ed demanded I stop doing this and take calls. I shrug \"sure thing boss\", hours later the leads ask \"Why aren't you doing web tickets, the queue looks awful!\" I told them Ed wants me taking calls. I have never seen so many leads walk over to Ed's desk and demand he put me back on web tickets. Ed came back over \"hey.... uh... we're going to need you to jump back on web tickets\". I replied \"sure thing boss\".\n\nthese are just the highlights, in reality every day was an antagonistic fight between myself and Ed. I just wanted to do my job, and I was the best at it (according to all numbers). My friends at work were all top performers as well and we formed a bit of a bond even meeting after work for cookouts, going to each-others parties etc. But Ed had it out for us. I loved working for Safeway, I took pride in what I did and I loved seeing those high numbers, but working with Ed was petty and infuriating, he would call me to his desk for not reason at all, fish for a reason to write me up, luckily I new our business and policies better than him and would explain and highlight written facts for him to interpret. He would dismiss me back to my desk, and now I was worked up and frustrated and all I wanted to do was sit down and do my job. He began to do this will all my friends.\n\nThe last straw was I had found religion and told my boss I needed Sundays off for church. (I was going to be a Sunday school teacher at my church). He said no, I filled out a religious accommodation form to HR, something they offer for employees like myself. The form was in the final stages of being approved until Ed came out of nowhere and said \"I've changed my mind, you can have Sundays off\". He switched my shift which made my religious accommodation form invalid. after 1 week, he held a mandatory shift bid and suddenly I didn't have Sundays off again. So I put in my two weeks. He asked me \"So you're going to quit because God is more important to you than this job?\" I said \"Absolutely\". A mass exodus kicked off and all of his top employees started to find new jobs. As his department was bleeding he walked up to my friend Mario,  who still works there and asked \"Why are so many people leaving?\" Mario replied \"We don't want to play games Ed, we just want to do our jobs\" Ed asked \"how many more people are leaving?\" Mario replied \"I can't tell you, but if I was going to show you the number on my fingers I would need both hands\". Ed gulped \"Is there anything I can do to make you stay, do you want anything a coffee or soda?\" Mario stated calmly \"Just leave me alone and let me do my job\". I heard from then on Ed sat quietly at his desk and let employees work.\n\nI would go on to be a manager and work directly under VPs and CEOs, so I was doing just fine.",

I told him point blank, listen if we don't get a phone call all shift, its great as it means nothing broke.  He replied what the hell are we paying you for?

My \"team\" is me and one other person, between us we have to cover 07:30 - 19:30 Mon-Fri and weekends as well. Because of this, and the fact that the company won't invest in call waiting for us, we can only take one call at a time. Our voicemail quite clearly states that we're a small team but if you leave your name and number we aim to get back to you within 5 minutes.\n\nNormally people are rather understanding of our situation and are happy to wait for us to call them back but, as the world is full of impatient a\\*\\*holes, we often get voicemails just criticizing us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, this happened today and I've been wanting to react this way for a long time and finally got the opportunity to!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe = Me\n\nAsshole Caller = AC\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAC: (Voicemail) *This is bl\\*\\*dy ridiculous, I was told to call this number but what's the f\\*cking point in telling people to call if there's nobody to answer the phone!?*\n\n\\-AC calls again-\n\nMe: *Hello you're through to -company name- CrackB3ar speaking, how can I help?*\n\n*AC: Oh, so now you answer the phone. What is the point of having a number if you never bl\\*\\*dy answer in!?*\n\nMe: *Ah, did you leave us a voicemail? I've just listened to it but unfortunately you didn't leave any contact details so I was unable to return your call. Thank you for calling back, how can I help?*\n\nAC: *You should answer every call that comes through!!*\n\nMe: *Well unfortunately there are only two people in my team, including myself and there tends to only be one of us in at a time so if I answered every call I'd end up having to keep putting people on hold and that really doesn't seem fair. Regardless though, you're through at the moment and I'm happy to help you however I can.*\n\nAC: *You can help me by doing your job and answering the phone when it rings!*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this point I'm like, f\\*ck you lady. So sod it, I'll comply.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe: *Ok, sure. I'm sorry that I've annoyed you, I'll make sure to answer the phone whenever it rings. Now, how can I help?*\n\n\\-AC starts to describe her problem-\n\n\\-Phone rings-\n\nMe: *Oh, I'm sorry, the phone is ringing. I'll have to place you on hold.*\n\nAC: *Wai...*\n\n\\-Hold-\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI then help the person calling, taking my sweet, sweet time. Like going above and beyond just to keep this other b\\*itch waiting... plus, y'know it's nice to help people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-Take AC off hold-\n\nMe: *Thanks for your patience, now you were saying?*\n\nAC: *How dare you put me on hold, especi...*\n\nMe: *Oh, I'm sorry, the phone is ringing. I'll have to place you on hold.*\n\n\\-Hold-\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can see where this goes.

We both explained that we were short staffed and it was very busy but we could help her at the counter right now. Not good enough apparently. She said she'd been calling for ten minutes and again asked why we couldn't answer the phones. So I told her again that we were short staffed and busy and she again asked why we couldn't answer the phones and I reslly didnt know how to keep dealing with her so I just went on with what I was doing. She didn't even end up ordering anything. This lady was calling us for ten minutes and then walked into the store to yell at us and leave without food.

On this particular day, No one was using the TV -- it was turned off and everyone was on their phones, so I figured that there was no harm in plugging in my Switch and sharing the fun of letting people have a go at it.\n\nWhile Im watching people play, my supervisor walks in and sees the setup. She informs me that \"this is the company's TV, so you cant use it for personal entertainment.\" Big bummer, since people were having fun, but I cant lose my job, so I pack up my Switch.\n\nThat day on my way home from work, I pass by a house that has a massive honking old school CRT TV out front that theyre giving away for free. Its bigger than the TV that we have at my job and it still works!\n\nThe next day I haul this massive TV out of my car and into the breakroom. I get a few odd looks but I dont care. Too focused on complying with the rules. I plug this sucker into the wall right underneath our company TV, now tiny in comparison to the CRT and hook up my Switch to it for people to play.\n\nSupervisor walks in and sees people playing on a bigger monitor.

She tries to say something about how Im blocking the view or causing disruption in the breakroom, but the other TV is turned off anyways and people are watching intensely as two coworkers are racing around in Mario Kart, so I dont really think it was that big of a deal. Not really sure if Im gonna get a strike for this or not, but Itll be worth it if I do, and I think i might be able to argue that I followed the rules.\n\nPart of me expects that this TV will \"mysteriously\" disappear and that security will have \"no footage\" of who might've taken it, which will be funny since its so big, but its the thought that counts.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the Platinum!! What do I do with it?",

But since it was a slow night the bartender walked over, and served them. \n\nBartender - Hi, what can i get you?\n\nMale - What wines do you have tonight?\n\nBartender - (Reads off wine list)\n\nFemale - Ooo, a Rose wine would be just perfect.\n\nMale - Make it two.\n\nBartender - Sure that'll be $15\n\nMale - We're going to open a tab.\n\nBartender - Unfortunately we don't do tabs here, you have to either charge it to your room, or pay cash.\n\nHe throws his room card on the table.\n\nMale - Ugh, Fine. Charge it to that.\n\nThey laugh as bartender grabs the card, and heads back to the bar. Bartender pours their drinks, and brings them back over. The first thing they did was hold up the glasses. \n\nFemale - Hmm, these are rather small, do you have any bigger glasses?\n\nBartender - Unfortunately those are the standard glasses.\n\nMale - Really? We're paying $7.50 a glass, and you're going to get chinsy on us? Surely you have bigger glasses, come on.\n\nBartender (clearly annoyed) - Ok, I'll go check.\n\nHe went to the bar, and came back out with two glasses that I think were supposed to be for margaritas, but were atleast twice the size as the wine glasses. He held them up for them.\n\nBartender - How are these?\n\nFemale - Oh, those are perfect.\n\nMale - Yes, thank you.\n\nSo bartender puts the bigger glasses on their table, then takes the smaller glasses and dumps them into the bigger glasses. \n\nBartender - is there anything else I can help you with?\n\nThey didn't say anything, just sat there dumbfounded.\n\nBartender - Great.\n\nMy parents and I start losing it. We tried not to laugh, but we were all a bit inebriated I guess. Bartender looked over at us and smiled.

        "selftext": "I, (17F), am a waitress/server/cashier at a semi local Italian chain. (Not going to say which, but it's considered a \"specialty\" of the DMV area.) I recently had to take a month off of work for health reasons, since I was in the emergency room and then had to spend time in inpatient. While I was away, there were huge changes at my job, including new managers and two new employees. \n\nI've only been working there since last June, but I picked things up pretty quickly, barring the first day I had to deal with a packed dining room by myself while still in training- I'd messed up pretty badly with the computer system and needed the Manager's help. Still, it happens. \n\nYesterday, I met the new girl for the first time (it was her third day, still in training.) She's my age and a complete sweetheart, and as the dining room slowly became more and more packed, we made a great team - she got to practice working with the computers and talking to customers while I took down the orders and showed her how everything worked. It was her first time \"properly\" serving there, and she really did great considering that, certainly at first. \n\nThe other two people who were working was a manager and one other hourly employee. The managers at my job will also serve and work the counters (basically, all waitresses have to do double the work, and we still get paid dirt but that's another story.) I was running between the dining room and the counters to try to keep up (although we can only serve max two people at the counters picking up or placing orders at a time.) It was to the point where my manager and her friend had bundled up and complained about how cold it was, while I was flushed, with my coat off, covered in sweat (cleaned myself up when dealing with the food, of course.) The manager and her friend were sitting down together, alternating between scrolling on their phones and talking, only getting up to answer the phones when they'd already rung 5+ times and having people wait at the counters to be helped for 10+ minutes. It was massively irritating, but I didn't have the time/energy to confront them. \nWell. \nAbout halfway through my shift, my manager told me that I can't just go in between the dining room and the counter, and if I didn't pick one or the other she'd withhold my tips for both, since I \"wasn't fully invested in either.\" Ouch. She gave me a choice on paper, but in reality made it perfectly clear that I was stuck behind the counter and the new girl, the trainee, was on her own. There was nothing I could really do, so I just stayed at the counter, though that was plenty slammed in and of itself, and I really, really could have used my two coworkers who were screwing around on their phones. I didn't have time to answer phone calls, pack up orders, check people out, and take to go orders all at once, and I had one particularly angry woman call me a \"lazy bitch\" for leaving her on hold for about two minutes (that stuck with me.) While I was doing all this, the new girl was stuck with a packed dining room and no help. \n\nAbout twenty minutes into it, my manager approaches me looking both angry and sheepish. Basically, the trainee had messed up and charged the wrong orders to the wrong cards and needed help- though the way she phrased this was, \"you know, you don't HAVE to stay by the counter the whole time, that's not what I meant.\" I looked over and could see her friend on her phone still, and the manager herself still had airpods on and a show playing on her own phone screen. I responded in my sweetest, most respectful voice, \"I'm sorry, but as we only get paid $10/hour, my tips are too vital for me to forfeit them, so I'm going to stay put.\" (Context, minimum wage is 15.65 where I live.) She was floored and instead of helping either of us herself, waddled back to her seat and resumed her show. \nOf course, I ended up checking in with the trainee and asked if she needed my help, and if the mistake was sorted out. She said that she had things back under control and a lot of the people dining in were headed out, which was great because the counter was still slammed. \n\nThe kicker? This morning apparently a customer called in and complained that \"the blonde girl (me) and the girl with braids (trainee) were so busy that they were sweating, while the two other women (manager and her buddy) were sitting on their phones.\" I only wish i saw her face when she heard about the complaint. \n\nTL;DR- manager told me to leave the new girl floundering because she and her buddy were busy on their phones, so I took her seriously and literally- even when she tried to take back what I said because there was a big mistake.\n\nUPDATE #1-I really wasn't expecting this to blow up, wow! It breaks my heart that a lot of people can relate. I'm having a hard time keeping up with comments, but I'm reading through as many as I can. I'll update after my shift tonight...for clarity: I'm 17, my manager is middle aged. I have other applications out, but have yet to hear back- and am definitely planning on reporting to the state. \n\nI guess they cut corners here after all (iykyk...)\nI'd also like to say, yes, I am really seventeen- English isn't my first language and I was raised largely by my Ukrainian grandmother, so if my vocabulary (almost said \"vernacular\" just to mess with people) is a little dated or odd. Apologies!!\n\nUPDATE #2- I've been looking into ways to try and get things sorted out. I'm still trying to figure out the best way to report it, as I've been applying for other jobs but haven't heard back and I can't afford to be fired in retaliation. As I've mentioned in some of my responses to comments, I'm a self-supporting seventeen year old who has bills due regardless and is trying really hard to not drop out of school (so close to graduation...) I've been put in touch with social programs and assistance but they all take a really long time to hear back from. Some folks suggested starting a GoFundMe so I could afford to quit my job and still survive in the interim, but I'm not reakly comfortable doing that as I don't feel I'm a charity case (yet) to that degree. I do have a Venmo, if anyone's feeling particularly *giving,* though I'm not expecting anything obviously - @H-ann-pik23 . I'll keep this post updated. \n\nUPDATE #3- Nothing much new to report, as there's no way to do a state audit without the name of the employee (me!) being revealed. Will keep this updated.",

            ">Some folks suggested starting a GoFundMe so I could afford to quit my job and still survive in the interim\n\nGetting help that levels out the hardship you're facing good and just and everyone does it\n\nLiterally no one is getting through life without help. Everyone else are accepting help on a daily basis. I promise you. Everyone's getting help all the time\n\nIt's only those of us who've been neglected that have been taught that we're not supposed to receive help. That we're supposed to do everything on our own, no matter how heavy the load\n\nI lived through that until I reached 30. Please believe me when I tell you that it's a lie. You need more help, so you feel like more of a burden. But the reason you need more, is because everyone else are covered in help already\n\nSome have parents who keep them fed. Since have never been forced to spend mental energy worrying about losing housing. Some have their own cars. Some have parents who make them for and drive them everywhere into their 20s. Some actually get paid close to how much money they make the company they work for. Some make more than their labor produces\n\nYou won't get anything from refusing help. Help connects people, it's valuable, it's meaningful, it makes us feel like we make a difference, that there are things in this world that matter\n\nDon't live your life on hard mode. Accept all the help offered to you. I promise, it'll provide you a better life with better relationships. The people who genuinely care about you and would like to help places where it would make a big difference to you, but would cost them little, are the ones you want around. Where the respect and help is mutual. The ones who prefer you to do everything yourself and would be offended if you asked for help - you don't want them around\n\nYou are so far from taking advantage of other people, it's gonna take a lot of effort to rewrite and unlearn before you have to worry about falling into that camp\n\nYou deserve as much grace as the rest of us. Don't live life on hard mode. Life is a marathon, not a sprint. Give yourself breaks. Learning to reach out for help is the most important tool to acquire. When you've got that, you will be able to get through anything. Anything\n\nI truly wish you all the best \u2665\ufe0f",

If it breaks for any reason they replace it for free.\n\nWhen I moved into my house the old owners left the recycling bin. Both handles were broken which made it near impossible to carry so I took it to the dump to exchange it. When I got there I was told it was still usable so they won't replace it, but I could buy a new one for $10. After a bit of polite arguing I asked if there were any restrictions on how the bin breaks to have it replaced. They said no, if it breaks for any reason at all and is unusable they would replace it. So I placed it on the floor and stomped on it a few times, until it was in pieces. I then picked them up and put them on the counter and said \"Excuse me, my recycling bin broke and I'd like a replacement please.\"\n\nThey had no issues giving me a replacement.",

But upon getting home and inspecting them closely, he realized he had not gotten the American-made ones, and he really preferred to have the American-made wrenches.  So, he went back to the store to exchange the wrenches for a different set.\n\nThe clerk said \"I'm sorry sir, but I can only exchange the wrenches if they're broken.\"\n\nThe man argued for a while, basically pointing out that he was returning them in brand-new condition, the store could take them, put them back on the shelf and sell them to some other guy who didn't care whether he bought American-made tools or not.  But of course, the clerk didn't make the rules, couldn't bend the rules, and refused to even consider taking the wrenches back unless they were broken.\n\nSo, the man took his Asian-made wrenches and left the store.  He went and bought a quantity of liquid nitrogen.  And then he poured liquid nitrogen over the wrenches until they were good and cold.  He got a hammer and smashed each wrench into several pieces.  Then, he took the pieces of wrenches back to the store, and exchanged them for a new wrench set!",
