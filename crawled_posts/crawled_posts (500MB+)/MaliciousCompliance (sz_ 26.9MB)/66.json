This morning Kid 2 decided she wanted her breakfast, while Kid 1 was still watching his show.  So I got Kid 2's breakfast and she sat down at the kitchen table to eat it.  Technically the TV is still visible from the kitchen table, so this is a bit of a gray area, but I was going to let it go (hadn't had my coffee yet and didn't really want to pick that battle).

He was in the process of being disciplined my my father, receiving a very stern talking to that I anticipated would result in a spanking. I believe I was 6-7 years old, making him 10-11 years old.\n\nIn my infinite wisdom and foresight, I went and got a paddle-ball paddle that we had either pulled the ball and rubber band off of, or it had broken off from regular use. Knowing our uncoordination and general ineptitude, we probably pulled the rubber band and rubber ball off of it.\n\nI presented it to my dad, saying 'If you want to spank him, you can use this'. At that age, my brother and I were mortal enemies, and we took every opportunity to cause pain and bodily harm to each other.\n\nMy dad responded 'I will use it to spank him if you want me to, but I have to spank you with it first to make sure it works.'\n\n\n\n\n\nI left the room and put it back in the pile-of-stuff we played with.",

            "Tbh, my parents still talk about me being a shithead like this. Let me tell a story through anecdotes.\n\nMy parents never told me that turning the lights on while the car was moving was illegal. If your family is like mine, that may be confusing, but fyi--many parents said it was illegal so their idiot kids would turn off the lights and they could see the road in the dark. It was a \"simple\" solution to a practical problem. But that wasn't me at that age.\n\nInstead, at the age of 5-ish, my parents said \"Brian, you can't turn the lights on because it makes it hard to see out of the windows. That's a new rule. No lights on in the car unless you ask us first.\"\n\nI was happy to oblige because their reasoning made sense, and it included me in the process of driving by helping me understand what THEY were experiencing. This is also why \"no screaming, jumping, or being rowdy in the car\" was effective for me--I understood that the consequences might mean they couldn't properly drive, and I might get hurt in an accident as a result. However, I was a stickler for rules, and this came to bite them in the ass, as I'll get to later.\n\nMy older sister, on the other hand, was a primal beast with no care for others. She would hurt people because she thought it was funny. She gave zero shits about other people being uncomfortable. But the thing is, she saw that me being a rule-abiding citizen garnered me favors and admiration from my parents, and she wanted the same. Rather than realize I was responding to GOOD rules with actual substance, my parents started to realize that by calling something a \"rule,\" they could enforce behaviors and the kids would be compliant.\n\nThe problem? I started to see all rules as having some inherently important background, even if none was supplied--after all, my parents didn't lie to me before, so why would they lie now?\n\nSo my parents developed weird rules to keep my sister complacent.\n\n\"You can't eat ice cream past 7 PM on a school night.\"\n\n\"No speaking at louder than whisper at grocery stores.\"\n\n\"No one is allowed to open the attic.\"\n\nFor me, I invented explanations for why these made sense. For my sister, she just hoped she could get the praise I did.\n\nThe problem was, I was a child of justice. If someone is breaking a rule, it needs to be called out, for EVERYONE'S safety. Dad's driving and mom turns on the light in the car to look for her wallet? \"MOM, THATS AGAINST THE RULES!\"\n\nMom has an ice cream Sunday at 7:30 on a Wednesday? \"YOURE BREAKING THE RULES!!!\"\n\nDad tells my sister to come back to the cart at a decent volume in the store? \"DAD YOURE BREAKING FAMILY RULES!!\"\n\nMom and dad need to go to the attic to stop a leaking pipe? \"NO ONE IS ALLOWED UP THERE!!! YOU CANT GO!!!\"\n\nAt some points, parents have to realize that kids may require different rules. Otherwise, you may realize that you have to engage your kids on their level. If you're not ready to do that, you're a bad parent.\n\nNo, I'm just kidding. You're not a bad parent. Kids are hard, and develop in weeeeeeird ways. What works for one kid may not work for the others. But the one thing that I have seen almost universally produce better kids is treating them like intelligent human beings. \"You'll understand when you're older\" is not an explanation, but \"it's hard to explain until you're older, but here is why it's hard right now\" goes a long way. Not all kids are willing to admit fallibility, but as long as they don't feel belittled for their lack of experience, they're usually willing to accept guidance.\n\nAnyway, just my 2 cents.\n\n",
            "I recently read that kids don't generally tell on other kids for breaking the rules to get them in trouble. Rather, they tell on them because rules are their law and order. Sense of security. So instead of the knee jerk reaction of punishing the child for tattling, look deeper and see if there's an insecurity reason.\n\n*I was one of those children who would be punished for telling on others. I was also neglected as a child and a product of a divorce at the age of 2. When I was at the more stable parent's home rules and order were cherished. It all makes sense today why it was so important for me to have law and order in the few times I had it.",

So I got up and grabbed my towel in a very aggressive manner causing a wall of sand to fly up and slam into my uncles face. \n\nI'm pretty sure he wanted to kill me that day, what with all the screaming about how I did it on purpose and got sand in his eyes and mouth.

I say I'm going to have to check with the kitchen, and I ask a line cook if he could put wings in a calzone, his response was \"I mean.....I guess....\" and he translates to the pizza guy what we need, pizza guy shrugs and nods at me.\n\nI go back to the table, and say \"the kitchen says they can do it, but I want to make sure you want chicken wings in your calzone\" the dad, exasperated, says \"buddy, why is this so hard?\"\n\n\"Not hard at all, sir, coming right up\".\n\nThe kitchen guys are actually chuckling while they put this thing together, I walk it to the table, happily drop it off, and get called back 3 minutes later to explain why there's bones in a calzone.\n\nI (very comfortable with confrontation) say this is what you asked for, I confirmed twice, and the dad snaps his finger to the manager and calls her over.\n\nHe complains there's bones in his daughters calzone, manager looks at me and I say \"I confirmed twice she wanted chicken wings\", and the dad says \"you know what she meant, like chicken meat\".\n\nI explain \"there's chicken meat on those bones\"\n\nManager tells me to wait elsewhere, manager takes the tongue lashing from customer, and personally makes a new calzone. Mind you, the family eats their food while new calzone is being made, forcing teenager to eat alone while Dad keeps looking at his watch.\n\nI was fired (with no protest from me) about ten minutes later, in fact I got to leave before Calzone Girl finished her meal, and take great satisfaction knowing the manager had to bus the table afterwards.",

He told me he wanted it medium rare so I told him we can't do that and the cooks wouldn't allow it. He says \"Well, I've come here plenty of times and they've always cooked it for me like that\" (never seen this man here before). Even his friends in his table looked confused with what he was saying. I tell him to let me confirm with the kitchen. The cooks were like \"No, we've never done this before and we won't do it.\" \n\nAfter another back and forth of me going to the kitchen and customer. The cooks said \"if he wants a raw chicken. Then lets have it in writing.\" Btw I was like 18 at the time, i didnt want to be in this position at all. I was scared to get confrontational and tell this to the customer. So i go back and I tell the customer the cooks cant do this. The customer says \"wow, can't believe yall are doing this to me.\" After this, I finally take and put in their order for the cooks.\n\nThe weird thing is is that the table enjoyed their food and had no complaints about their food. I even went to my manager who ran the register and asked her if that table (specifically that guy) complained. She said no and they left me a decent tip too. I told her how i expected the guy to complain and explained to her what happened. She totally had my back and agreed on what we did. Even told me to come get her if anything similar like that happens again. Kinda sucks your manager didn't do the same",

            "Not quite the same situation but I was a waiter at kind of a mod level restaurant, not quite high end fine dining but not Olive Garden either. Nice enough for about half the clientele considering it a fancy night out basically.\n\nSo we're open Thanksgiving Eve basically but were closing early at 7. It was 6:30 and it had been relatively slow and my section was up on rotation for the next table as a small group of 3 people came in, seemed like 3 friends but late 30s maybe early 40s. I greeted the table went through the whole speal, and let them know that we closed early and that the kitchen would be closing soon so they would need to order soon and that everything would need to come out together since when the kitchen closes the stations they don't open it back up.\n\nThey said ok and that they already knew what they wanted. Got appetizers, main course, desserts and alcohol.\n\nI made sure to ask if they were sure about dessert because there was ice cream involved with the kitchen closing and they snapped back \"Yes we heard you the first time, hopefully you heard our order\". I said ok and that I'd put the food order in and come back for the drink order. So I walked away put the food order in and came back with waters to get their drinks. They asked what the bar had, even though it was on the menu, so I ran through the regular alcohol and wine staples and they asked if we had Hennessy. I said no but we had Remy and that we had XO or VSOP.\n\nI started to explain the difference but the guy interrupted me saying that the XO is fine. I started to explain that it's 10 year vs 4 year aged so XO is a lot more expensive but the guy just incredulously looked at me and interrupted me again saying \"Do you always question your guests orders like this? No wonder this place is dead tonight. Oh and make it a double\".\n\nMy manager had to get involved twice. Once when all the food came out at the same time, apps, meals & desserts, and I got chewed out saying I never explained that everything would come out together and how I rushed them. They proceeded to stay an hour and a half after our closing time. At which point my manager had to get involved a second time when they finally got the check and realized how much a double of Remy XO cost. Once again almost raging about how I misled them and didn't explain anything and all the standard bullshit.\n\nMy manager didn't fire me over it but I definitely knew I was basically getting no tip on the highest spending table the whole night, which they of course did, tipped the change to round it up to the next dollar with a smiley face on it, and this was after my manager comped the desserts and 1/2 of the Remy.\n\nThankfully my manager knew the shitheads would do that, AND was making me drive out to my family super late so he fucked around with the ticket putting auto gratuity so the total came out to the same but so I at least got 20% on a lower check with the card charge looking the same.\n\nMy manager was a shithead too but that day he was a good dude....Then he got fired 4 months later for getting caught fucking one of the hostesses that was in high school, while his assistant manager got arrested in the restaurant after 5 different women complained to police that he pulled his dick out and flashed them in the elevator of the parking garage by the restaurant....good times.",

        "selftext": "**Update**: First of all, wow! Thank you all for so much for your support, understanding, and awards. I'm newish to Reddit and I was completely overwhelmed with the responses to this post, so I apologize if I didn't get to your comment. I've had a number of folks suggest I put up a photo gallery of barely-compliant outfits, and I would very much appreciate suggestions for how/where to do that (subreddits only, not an insta fan sorry). I'll be off of the grid all next week but I can start putting some together after that. And to those of you who disagree with how I handled this situation, know that I don't hate you. I just think you're wrong.\n\nThe shelter I've (30M) been working at for a couple of years now is over 30 years old, and is quite notorious for keeping things that way. The daily notes are physically kept in binders, 80's-style punitive measures are imposed on clients in conflict, and the electrical panels are labeled with cards that went through a typewriter. You get the idea.\n\nThe floor supervisor (over 20 years in that position) emphasized that even though jeans were allowed, we needed to strictly adhere to the dress code. That meant button-up or collared shirts, no logos, only long pants/dresses, no hats unless you're outside, no visible tattoos, etc. In other words, dress nothing like the vast majority of the people we serve. \"We're meant to dress they way they should aspire to dress,\" said the supervisor. I was told other staff -including staff above my paygrade- have long hated the dress code and unsuccessfully tried to change it for years. None of them were bold little shits like me, though.\n\nGiven my previous experience with underserved populations, I also knew this was a terrible idea. Generally speaking what people in these communities lack in financial resources, they make up for in their abilities to read people and navigate emotions. If they think you're an authority figure or acting inauthentic, many will outright write you off. And for the most part they have a great social/emotional radar.\n\nThe dress code said men's shirts must, \"... have visible buttons *or* a collar.\" I sewed two buttons near my hip on a plain t-shirt and wore it in. They said nothing the first time, but had a meeting where they \"weren't pointing out anyone in particular\" and updated that specific part of the policy to prevent me from doing it again. Next I wore capris. After all, nothing about pant length was mentioned either. That time the code was updated and we were informed via email. Still no one-on-one conversation about it.\n\nA few months and minor malicious compliances later, our workplace gave us logoed t-shirts with the institution's name and website on them. Hooray, we thought! We will at least be able to wear t-shirts now. Nope. After a week of several coworkers wearing the shirts *they gave us*, we got an org wide email that the shirts did not comply with the dress code and should not be worn during work hours. Knowing me as the office rabble-rouser, several pissed off coworkers came to me independently to ask how they too could rebel. Enter this story's biggest malicious compliance.\n\nAs a minimalist, I had no desire to hold onto a shirt that I would not wear. We had no input on the design/color of the shirts, and I simply did not need it taking up space in my closet. The most reasonable alternative would be to turn the shirt back in and explain that, so I did. Coworker #1 was moving soon and didn't need an extra thing to pack, so she also turned hers in. #2's partner hated dark green (the shirt's color), so he turned his in. This happened all they way to 25 total employees, with some borrowing other's excuses.\n\nAfter 5 days, the supervisor had a box with two-dozen shirts sitting in his tiny office. He actually has to keep them on his desk, and I can hear him bumping his hand against them when he uses the mouse.  3 months later they are still there. He's not dumb; he knows those shirts are an \"F you\" that lives in his office.\n\nHe cannot donate them to the shelter due to some other ridiculous handbook rule about organizational spending, and he bikes 6 miles to work so driving them home isn't a reasonable option. He's tried putting them in general office storage, but his boss has said the shirts are the supervisor's problem since he ordered them. Currently he's just stuck. We know it bothers him, but he knows he can't bring it up since it's his own rules that prevent us from wearing them.\n\nNo dress code changes so far, but the top-of-the-year meeting regarding our handbook has dress code on the table. 3 of the people who returned shirts are a part of that advisory board of 5. I'm cautiously optimistic that we'll finally be rid of of some of the dumb, short-sighted elements of our dress code come February.\n\nTL:DR The homeless shelter I work at has a dress code that drastically sets staff apart from the community we serve. I convinced several coworkers to turn in their non-compliant clothing. My boss has since had to deal with a pile of clothes on his desk.",

            "I made this its own post a while ago, but it's my favorite MC I've done.  I worked in an office in a large shipping company.  We were in a nondescript office park.  We had no logo on our door.  We had a code for the door.  Customers didn't even know where we were, but they were not allowed in the building.  In the six years I was there, 0 unauthorized people tried to gain entry to the building to ship something.  So, nobody in the office had any customer-facing positions at all--all of our customer communication was by phone or email.\n\nSo I'd been off for a bit and came back to work in early summer.  I wore the same shoes I'd worn last summer, which was a pair of dressy sandals.  I was taken aside and informed that I could not show more than three toes, so I would have to get new shoes.\n\nFine.  I spent all weekend shopping for shoes.  Finally found a pair that I liked that only showed three toes.\n\nWell, they were wedges.  Apparently wedges were unprofessional and not allowed.  Now, this was a wedge that matched the shoe--no cork or espadrille or whatever.  I challenged it saying that high heels hurt my feet.  My wedges were okay...but they had a platform.  Boss says, no platforms over 1\".  I measured, mine were exactly 1\".  So then boss says that the shoe has an open back and the dress code says either open back or open front but not both.  I pointed out that in the pictures on the website, there was a peep-toe with an open back.\n\nFinally, my supervisor said that I should wear other shoes tomorrow, but bring my sandals so that the supervisors could have a meeting over their appropriateness.\n\nWTF.\n\nSo, I called my doctor.  I had just had knee surgery a few months before.  I described the shoes and the nurse said it was fine and that my dress code was ridiculous.  She wrote and the doctor signed that I was permitted to wear whatever shoes I wanted.  They faxed me the note and I emailed it to both supervisors.\n\nThey were PISSED.  I wore those damn shoes every fucking day that summer, and then with tights in the winter.",

It\u2019s a v neck, that STILL shows my chest tattoo.

        "selftext": "I used to work at this one coffee shop, my first chain coffee shop after working only at local or family run ones. Simply put, it was hell. Owners would micromanage everything without knowing anything about how the business ran, never listened to their staff, and only cared about the money. Typical out of touch owners of a business.\n\nI was hired to replace a manager that had walked out of one of their locations, leaving it with only part time staff. I was told I was being hired on as the \"acting manager\" until they either hired someone else or they felt I would be a good fit for the position after my 6 month probation.\n\nI won't go into everything that went wrong because there's a lot but to summarize, it was literal hell. I was expected to cover all no shows (which had me working 90-100 hours a week), I wasn't allowed to fire anyone no matter how many things they did wrong (someone actually showed up to work drunk and I *still* wasn't allowed to fire them), and any changes I wanted to implement were shot down (like replacing old parts in the espresso machine, shortening our hours to save money on labor, bringing in items that customers would always ask for).\n\nI was stressed, over worked, and irritated as hell when the owner comes in to talk to me about sales for the store. We weren't making enough to warrant the hours I had scheduled and he wasn't going to pay me any more over time. I would only work the hours I'm scheduled and if someone no showed, I had to have someone else cover those shifts. I tried to explain to him that I only came in when no one else would cover, it just so happened that the people he allowed to continue to work here had terrible availability. Making the schedule was already hard enough, getting someone other than myself to come in on their day off was next to impossible. On top of all that, I had to learn the ropes myself. There was no one to train me so all the managerial knowledge, ordering, scheduling, I learned myself. No one other than me knew how to order coffee, had the numbers for the repair guys, anything other than making coffee and using the til, I was the only one that knew.\n\nHe wasn't hearing any of it.\n\n**Owner:** \"All I'm hearing is excuses. This is your store. If you can't handle running it. I'll start looking for someone who will.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Wasn't that the plan though? It's been 3 months since my probation period ended and you never gave me the manager position so I assumed you were looking for someone to take over.\"\n\n**Owner:** \"I think it's in your best interest to take some time off. Start thinking about your position here and whether you actually want to start moving up (I had mentioned in the interview I was looking forward to working my way up in the business).\"\n\n**Me:** \"I can't. There's no one to cover me.\"\n\n**Owner:** \"You're taking this time off.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Is this a paid break?\"\n\n**Owner:** \"No, consider this a time out for you to get yourself sorted. Take the two weeks to rest and we'll see what your position will be like when you get back.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Owner, I can't really afford to take that amount of time off. I can't even take 2 days without having to come in and cover.\"\n\n**Owner:** \"Don't worry about the business right now. It'll run without you.\"\n\nNow, to put into perspective, I was basically the manager at that point. I made the schedules, I did the orders, I knew the codes to the safe and the alarm. I wasn't allowed to hire someone to assist me and no one worked enough time to be able to cover even half my shifts. I knew this, the staff knew this, customers knew it.\n\nI made sure to block all work numbers and spent those 2 weeks looking for another job. I managed to find one after a few days that paid significantly more. I sent my resignation email to payroll and the owner (knowing he never checks it), deleted my account off the POS system (being a manager means I have access to it from home) and spent the rest of the leave catching up on well deserved sleep, having blocked all work numbers. I'm not getting paid so I'm not working.\n\nAccording to my coworkers, shit started going wrong the next day. One of the openers didn't show and the next staff member didn't have keys. Owner wasn't answering his phone so they left a message. Owner didn't show up until one of the regulars called asking if the place was closed down. He showed up 4 hours after they were supposed to open.\n\nOrders weren't done, inventory was missed, 4 no shows, you name it, it went wrong.\n\nOwner tried every way he could to get a hold of me, even using a customers phone to call me (too bad I didn't answer any calls that weren't in my contacts already).\n\nAfter 2 weeks, I turn my phone back on and get a call the same day from Owner. We agree to meet the next day.\n\n**Owner:** \"So, you've had some time to think.\"\n\n**Me:** \"I have. It's really given me perspective on my position here.\"\n\n**Owner:** \"We can start you back on your normal hours for now and we're looking for a manager to take on more of your responsibilities.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Oh, that's good. I'm actually quitting.\"\n\nHe was silent for a few minutes. I think he was waiting to tell him I was kidding. Sucks for you buddy, I'm serious.\n\n**Me:** \"I've already e-mailed payroll and removed my log in from the computer. Here are my keys. Good luck.\"\n\nAnd I left. Owner tried calling me a few times but stopped once I told him to check his e-mail.\n\nI was on okay terms with some of the staff that worked there and apparently majority of them had quit after I had left. Owner did find a replacement pretty quickly but without anyone to train them (owner didn't know anything about running the business), they were fucked from the get go and left pretty soon after they were hired.\n\nMy petty ass is always checking reviews from customers and employees and they have consistently sucked for the past year and seem to be on a downward trend over the past year.\n\n**TL;DR:** Owner forces me to take 2 weeks unpaid leave, place goes to shit and I take that time to find a better job, land said job, give my 2 weeks via email knowing he won't check it, and quit the second my vacation is over.\n\n**EDIT:** Holy shit thank you everyone for the awards! I finally got to premium! Now my avatar gets a sweater <3  \nThis particular job I had was soul crushing and I'm lucky to have a story like this to share with others that have gone through similar shit. If someone is dealing with an owner similar to this, I highly recommend brushing up on your knowledge of your local labor laws. There are sadly way too many owners that try to get away with shit like this.\n\nTo clarify a few things, I'm from Canada. Forcing me to take leave was not actually legal of him to do. I was tired and so worn down that I just didn't want to fight anymore. I took it as a gift of all the days off I missed from all the over time I worked and that was it.\n\nFor those wondering about whether or not I'm owed overtime, thankfully I'm not. Another manager task I had was organizing hours and submitting them to payroll. Owners didn't have control over that, the managers (along with me) were in charge of that. There was a rule in place where we had to get approval from the person who made the schedules for overtime and that was me. So I got paid my overtime. Thank fuck. Even if I did have some money owed, I personally just want to leave it be. It was hard enough getting my last paycheck from them, I didn't want to put any more energy into these guys than I had to.\n\nAgain, holy shit thank you all <3 I hope you are all doing alright with everything that's going on in the world right now and are TAKING NO SHIT LIKE THIS.",

I had five fax machines and two coworkers.  We logged every fax.  There was an incoming log and an outgoing log.  And there was the ever important confirmation sheet. \n\nOpposing counsel was the kind of lawyer that gives lawyers a bad name.  Stereotypical jackass who played stupid lawyer games.  Dropping documents at 5pm on the Friday before a three day weekend.  That kind of petty shit that adds unnecessary misery to the profession.\n\nMy guy comes to the mailroom and says opposing counsel claims he didn\u2019t receive a fax we said we sent.  I call bullshit.  I sent it myself.  The confirmation sheet exists. Opposing counsel probably lost it.  Or his secretary didn\u2019t give it to him.  Whatever.  My guy knows I sent the fax.  Opposing counsel wants to be called every time we send him a fax.  He\u2019s accused me of not doing my job and lying and now he\u2019s creating extra work for me.  Ok, let\u2019s play.\n\nWhat he wanted and expected was for me to call his secretary and let her know a fax was on the way.  Nope.  Fuck that.  I called his secretary and told her I was calling for my guy.  She assumed he needed to talk to her boss so she connected me.  Opposing counsel answers expecting some kind of substantive discussion.  Instead he gets the mailroom guy.  I said \u201cI\u2019ve been told to let you know every time I send you a fax.  I\u2019m sending you a fax.\u201d  We hang up.\n\nAn hour later I call him again.  New fax.\n\nHalf an hour after that I call again.  New fax.\n\nAnother hour another call another another fax.\n\nMy guy comes to the mailroom with a big smile on his face.  He\u2019s giddy, almost giggling.  He says opposing counsel asked that the calls stop.  He no longer needs to know when faxes are coming.  He\u2019s tired of being interrupted.

I was a teenager and needed money, so I did this for a while. The restaurant would pay this agency and they would tell us what restaurant to go to and when. Key to this story is that we were not paid. On an average night I'd make around $50 in tips over 3 hours, on special nights it could be as high as $200, but if there were no customers I'd make nothing.\n\nAfter working for several months I must have fallen out of someone's favor, and I got assigned to a restaurant in the business district. I have no idea why they wanted someone making balloon animals there. The key audience was kids and I never saw anyone there under 30. The first night there I made $5, which wasn't even enough to cover mass transit to and from the location. After being assigned there twice in a row I complained, but was told that if I didn't go I'd be banned from any more assignments.\n\nCue the malicious compliance.\n\nThe next week when I was assigned there (which was the third time in a row) I waited until there were a couple guys at the bar that were tipsy. I go up and ask if they want balloon hats, no charge. They were hesitant, but I promised they'd be good. They agreed, and I got to work.\n\nI broke out all of my skills to make these hats that were clearly people in a cage. The people were all pink and had prominent bubbles on the chest and derriere. An inflated balloon tied around the waist made for a bikini bottom, and a carefully tied balloon in their hand made for a bikini top. They asked what it was and I told them a stripper in a cage.\n\nThey.  Loved.  It.\n\nI got a $20 tip, but more importantly they went to every person in the restaurant to show off their strippers-in-cages hats.

My partner took a job at a local fine dining place back in September and upon receiving his first paycheck I noticed he was only being paid 2.63hr. He let it go at the time because he didn\u2019t want to make waves at his new job. He was promoted to bar manager after the New Year and at some point him and the owner got into an argument about money. Basically the owner told him that now that he got his promotion and a small raise he felt entitled to more money. My partner told him that no, he just wants the minimum wage he is supposed to be paid. Owner didn\u2019t believe it had gone up to 5.15 and said if that was true then his payroll person would have said something. Brought up the NJ DOL website and pointed out. Owner apologized but then said he couldn\u2019t afford to pay his servers and bartenders that rate. This is a place where a 2 person cheque is well over $200. I think what he meant to say was that he couldn\u2019t afford to pay the employees that and continue to pay himself what he had been. More than just corporate greed. It\u2019s greed in general.",

        "selftext": "I am an RN. A few years ago, I was working at a walk in clinic in the middle of downtown in a large Canadian city. \n\nNow, as a walk in clinic nurse, I am used to a lot of entitlement from patients - those who believe that they can jump the line of other people who have been waiting 5+ hours to see the doctor simply because *their* symptoms are more important, those that don't understand that when we say that we have closed registration early in order to be able to close at our official time of 9:30 pm it means that they can't be seen even if it is only 8 pm when they come in, those that have become verbally, physically, and sexually abusive towards me if they don't get their way.\n\nA lot of the doctors that worked with me seemed to have a lot when faced with patients' ire. So if I told the patients that they couldn't be seen due to the clinic policy of wanting its employees to actually get sleep before having to come back in the next morning, they would attempt to go around me and appeal to the doctor who would inevitably cave.\n\nThis angered me on a lot of levels. Firstly, these doctors were simply rewarding this disgustingly selfish behaviour by capitulating. Secondly, they were lending credence to the belief that a lot of patients had - I was a mere subordinate to the doctor and not my own autonomous practitioner. Thirdly, I was nurse manager of this clinic. The doctors were on call at the behest of the clinic and as such, did not technically have authority upon our hours as nursing staff and receptionists. Fourthly, we are supposed to act as a united team.\n\nSo one particularly trying night, a lady came in with her toddler child. She came in at around 8:45, and we still had another two hours of people waiting to be seen. We had closed registration at 6 pm and we're not accepting any new patients. I am in the back of the clinic performing a wound cleaning when the receptionist calls me and asks me to come up front as there is an agressive patient demanding their child to be seen.\n\nSo I head out to the front. The lady is standing at the desk, arms folded, snapping at her child to sit still. I glance at the child, who is sitting on a chair, swinging their legs and babbling away happily to anyone who will listen. Eyes bright, smiling, laughing. *Doesn't look unwell*, I think to myself as a cursory assessment.\n\nAs soon as the lady sees me with my stethoscope, she launches her tirade.\n\n\"Doctor, my child is extremely unwell. She has asthma and can barely breathe. She needs to be seen immediately.\"\n\nI glance deadpan back at the child who is singing loudly to herself. I look back to the lady.\n\n\"She doesn't seem to be in distress, ma'am.\"\n\nThe lady tenses up and stares at me as though I am a complete fucking moron.\n\n\"Well where the hell did you go to medical school?\" She inquires with the auditory level of banshee. \"Kids present very differently than adults when they can't breathe. What are you, 12?\"\n\nI walk over to the child and place my hand gently on her back. I count her respirations as she falls quiet under my touch and I observe her scapulae as they expand and contract, indicating full chest expansion. I listen to the smooth sounds of her inspiration and expiration audible even without a stethoscope. I observe the moistness of her conjunctivae as she rubs her eyes, and I see the glistening wetness of her tongue as she licks her lips. She's well hydrated.\n\n\"I'm not a doctor, I am a nurse,\" I say, as I plug my stethoscope into my ears and begin to listen to the child's lung fields.\n\n\"Of course you don't know what you're doing!!\" She yells. \"I didn't bring my ill child to see some stupid nurse, I DEMAND TO SEE A DOCTOR! NOW!!! SHE NEEDS TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL AND IF SHE GETS WORSE, I'LL HAVE YOUR LICENCE.\"\n\nChild's lung sounds are perfect. I lean down and smile at the child. \"How are you feeling?\" I ask her. She wants my stethoscope. I hand it to her. \"I'm bored,\" she says, understandably.\n\nI look to the lady. \"Registration closed some time ago because as you can see, we have many patients to see and will end up being here past closing. I am afraid that we cannot see your child today. Based on my physical assessment, I cannot triage her up the line as she does not seem to be in respiratory distress. There are several hospitals close by that I can direct you to, if you wish.\"\n\nA slow purple flush begins to crawl over her features. I smile blandly at her as I await the inevitable shit storm about to erupt. She walks up to me and leans into my face. I stand my ground, staring noncommitally back. The rest of the waiting room is staring intently.\n\n\"GET. THE. FUCKING. DOCTOR.\"\n\n\"The doctor is seeing patients, ma'am. I cannot interrupt him.\"\n\n\"MY CHILD IS GOING TO DIE BECAUSE OF YOU, YOU DISGUSTING, LOW EDUCATED, PEICE OF FILTH. GETTHEFUCKINGDOCTOR!!!\"\n\nI am about to repeat my previous statement when I suddenly hear a slight cough behind me. It's the doctor. Internally, I sag. Great. He's going to usher them in, and I get to look like an idiot in front of everyone again.\n\n\"What seems to be the problem?\" He asks, staring quizzically at the lady.\n\nShe rushes over to him and clings to his arm. \"Oh, thank God, doctor. My child. She has asthma. She has run out of her puffers and is in an attack. This.... nurse...refused to let her see you.\"\n\nThe doctor stands there, resolute, and disentangles his arm from her vice grip. He takes a cursory glance at the child who has begun delightedly listening to her own stomach with my stethoscope. He then walks over to me. Now this is a doctor whom I have not met before tonight. I prepare for the worst.\n\n\"Nurse. I assumed you performed triage?\"\n\nI nod. \"Yes,\" I say. \"I do not see any evidence of respiratory distress.\"\n\n\"Lung sounds?\"\n\n\"Non-adventitious.\" I say. (Fancy way of saying clear as fuck)\n\n\"Mucous membranes?\" (Fancy way of asking about hydration status)\n\n\"Pink, moist.\"\n\n\"Capillary refill?\" (Fancy way of asking about blood flow)\n\n\"Immediate.\"\n\nThe doctor turns towards the lady. And this is when I realize that he has been watching this entire exchange from the beginning.\n\n\"I am calling you an ambulance.\"\n\nThe lady blinks. \"What? Why?\"\n\n\"You said that she needed to go to the hospital. If that is what you think, you know your child better than I do. I'd rather be safe than sorry.\"\n\nThe lady looks nonplussed. \"But...but...the nurse said that she isn't in distress....\"\n\nThe doctor smiles humourlessly. \"What, this nurse right here? The one you were accusing of negligence and lack of knowledge? I trust this nurse's assessments. She has been very perceptive and professional for the long night that I have had the fortune to work with her. However, she, like myself, cannot know the intricacies of your child's history. It would be negligence indeed if we were to dismiss your concerns as a parent. Nurse, please call the ambulance.\"\n\nUnable to keep the shit eating grin off of my face, I walk to the phone. The lady is trying to argue with the doctor who is walking away. \"Best of luck to you, ma'am. I am sorry that you have had to wait so long, but it's best that we leave this to the professionals, hmm? And a shame it is, too, as this is flu season and all of the emergency departments are full to bursting with people waiting to be seen. Prepare for a very long wait.\"\n\nAnd with that, he returned to the examination rooms. I hung up after exiting the call with EMS. The lady was visibly shaking. A few smiles littered the faces of those watching.\n\n\"EMS should be here shortly. If your child's status worsens, please have my receptionist call me back out. Have a good night, ma'am.\"\n\nVindication has never felt so sweet.",

Nurses aren't less than doctors, but just part of the overall gears that function hospitals, clinics, etc. The idea that nurses are somehow less than doctors in the hierarchy just bother me. Nurses are medical professionals, not personal assistants. They deserve some goddamn respect for putting themselves in situations to save lives. \n\nEdit: For some odd reason, some people have taken my comment to mean that nurses are somehow better than doctors and need to remind me that doctors work harder to get where they are. My point was that nurses are such an important part yet are the most likely to get treated like shit. Just cause the doctor spent more time in school, doesn't mean the nurse is doing nothing. The nurses are practically running the damn place with how much they do. Treat them like how you would treat doctors cause nurses let doctors do what they can do.

So they have access to a higher concentration of medical care, a chance of seeing allergy specialists (depending on what the hospital specializes in) and have a larger window of opportunity to speak to a doctor/nurse than just the somewhere-around-9 PM window that's available for patients at the clinic that day?

        "selftext": "This is a cool story about the acts of malicious compliance of my grandfather, who died a couple of weeks ago.\n\nSetting the scene: a week after graduating college (first in his family), Grandpa, a very gentle, non-confrontational kind of guy with a mischievous streak, gets drafted into the US military for the Korean war.\n\nAct I: During basic training, he \"forgets\" to wear his glasses to target practice. His sergeant refuses to let him leave until he's hit the target at least once. Grandpa is a decent hunter, but now he can't even see the target. They're out there for hours. Finally, the sergeant comes up and tells him he hit the target. Grandpa checks the target. The hole was made from the other side, obviously by the sergeant himself.\n\nAct II: Grandpa and his friend are told to go to San Francisco and to take a boat to Tokyo from there. When they get to SF, they see a long, long line to get on the boat. Grandpa's never been to SF before. He convinces his friend to visit the city with him instead of standing in line all day. They have a great day, and come back to the port in the evening. The boat has already left. They get yelled at. A lot.\n\nAct III: The US military finds out Grandpa learned how to use a typewriter in college. Instead of sending him to fight, they let him stay in Tokyo as a secretary to a general. The general keeps sending him out to get things signed. It's hard to get people to listen to a non-officer, though. That's what Granfpa tells his boss when he complains about how nothing seems to get done. Next thing he knows, Grandpa's been promoted. Now he can order people to sign his forms.\n\nAct IV: Grandpa finds out that 1) US soldiers in uniform ride Japanese public transport for free and 2) if he donates blood, he gets the week-end off that week. He starts donating blood. Every. Single. Week. And travels all over Japan on the week-ends.\n\nAnd that's how he met Grandma.\n\nEdit: Thank you so much for the love and well-wishes, everyone! Grandpa had a great life and died peacefully with lots of kids, grandkids and great-grandkids near. We miss him, but he lives on in his stories. \nAbout the blood, as several of you have pointed out, every week is a lot. It might have been plasma, or the army might not have known/cared, or I could be remembering wrong. I'll ask some family if they remember and keep you updated.",

            "This reminds me of a story I read about a lazy soldier. It was about a man who did things like your Grandpa, getting promoted to make someone else's life easier, and donating blood to facilitate traveling an entire country on the weekends. Things that aren't \"lazy\" at all, but are creative ways to work hard for personal benefit (and ultimately avoid things like, you know, active combat).\n\nThe only example I remember from the story was when the character was at a military academy, and he joined an athletic team, joined the fencing team, but then chose the training foil as his weapon category of choice. So he had virtually no opponents, and training/combat were easier due to the less-dangerous weapon (which in turn required less heavy protective gear). But then he got full benefits from being a championship athlete at the academy, which had benefits there, and let him skip some early gruntwork when actually joining the military.\n\nHe was your Grandpa, so you already know this, but people with that kind of creative outlook towards living life are a lot of fun.
