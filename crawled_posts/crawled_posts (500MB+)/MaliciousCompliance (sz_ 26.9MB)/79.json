        "selftext": "This isn't my story, but it happened to some high school classmates of mine in the late 1990s. Unfortunately, I wasn't smart enough to be part of it. \n\nThe AP Calculus class teacher had a tradition that held up for at least a decade, where, if you brought your college acceptance letter, you'd be invited to his Breakfast Club: essentially, instead of taking the math final exam for the year, he'd provide transportation to the local IHOP, buy everyone breakfast, and shoot the breeze together. \n\nThe gesture was a popular and welcome one-- after all, these were the brightest kids in the school, the top 10%, including the valedictorian and the salutatorian, the captain of the debate team, and others. Taking a final exam when they were already assured their places in Ivy-league schools was a pointless formality, after all.\n\nThe year this story happened, however, there was a new teacher who made a big deal about how unfair the Breakfast Club was (funnily enough, her name was Karen). The school's vice principal came in and told the class that they would stay in the school with everyone else, and take the final exam, or else they'd face in-school suspension.\n\nThe AP Calculus teacher had his hands tied. So, on the day of the test, a Friday, the whole class came in and took their test, which consisted of a single question: What's your name? The students looked up to see a shit-eating grin on the teacher's face, and they quickly caught on: everyone filled in their papers, submitted them, and then they went off to IHOP. Perfect test scores for everyone!\n\nBy the time the weekend was over, the whole school knew the story, and Karen must've complained to the vice-principal once more, because he came and gave in-school suspension tickets for the entire class. \n\nIt was truly an odd sight to see the school's geniuses file into the ISS room-- only to find their AP Calc teacher, who had volunteered for monitor duties, or swapped with the normal monitor, or something. And he had brought bags of bagels, cream cheese, whitefish spread, and butter for everyone serving suspension that day.\n\nMr Buckley, you're a legend!\n\nEDIT : Forgot a detail.\n\nEDIT2: Thanks for the awards, everyone! Hope you all have a great day!",

I was told by the chair to call everyone by their first name rather than the formal Dr. SoandSo.  I complied  and life went on with me using informal names and them doing the same for me.  However, about a year later, I called to Dr. Soandso in the next room to ask a question.  It was benign enough and still respectful using his first name.  Not long after, I received an email.  He addressed it to Rissilly and stated that I needed to call him Dr. Soandso and not to use his first name.  I knew this was a way to establish his superiority over me but I would not have it.  I may have been the secretary but I was still a human being who deserved respect too.\n\nHere is where the malicious compliance came into play.  I wrote him an email back addressing him as Dr. Soandso.  I agreed to call him by his formal name but I insisted that he do the same to me.  I am no longer Rissilly but Mrs. Doe.  I copied the department chair and executive aide so all were in the loop.  He went to the chair to complain but she sided with me.  And so it began.  From then on out, it was Dr. Soandso on every correspondence and when I spoke to him.  If he addressed me as Rissilly, I would remind him that I wanted to be addressed as Mrs. Doe and would not answer until he addressed me as such.  This really got on his nerve.  He did not want to be the only one to call me by the formal as it messed with his need for superiority over a peon.  \n\nIt only took less than a week before he wrote me again.

I worked in that department for 8 years and we never had another problem like this.\n\n**On a side note, I always called him Dr. Soandso in front of and to the students, as most wanted to be addressed as such in their classes.\n\n**Edit:  Several are stating that I am being petty and should have addressed him as Dr since he earned that title.  While I totally agree that he earned that title, he did not earn the right to treat me differently than others in the office staff just because I was low man on the office totem pole.

I wouldn\u2019t be as eager and happy to use formal titles if faculty and administration looked down on me, but it\u2019s quite the opposite.

Please no more awards, give the money to a good charity instead.\n\nI'm a big wargames player, and a local store used to buy tickets and rent a bus to bring people to a Games Workshop convention in Baltimore (Games Day).\n\nThe cost they charge covers the bus, and a one day ticket.  The only caveat is that kids under 18 (16 with a note and an older buddy) had to have at least one adult with them, who was also paying full entry, on the idea that the parent would stay with their child.  This was made explicit in following years.\n\nNow the convention was located in the prime shopping area of the Baltimore waterfront, so every year there are a few parents who come to go shopping.  Usually though they have a few other parents who agree to watch the younger ones though.\n\nThe year this took place, my friend Hal and I ended up going.  Keep in mind that we're both in our mid 20's.\n\nSo as we go through our morning at the convention, we noticed that a familiar group of boys were following us.  When asked we were told:\n\n\"We should stay with you two because you're responsible\"\n\nNone of their parents were in sight.  Or on the site as it turns out.  Most of them were cool, at least as cool as a 10 year old can be to someone in their mid twenties.  (Ages were from 8-16).  We ended up grouping them up with an older kid as an 'assistant buddy', and took them with us.  It's not like their parents were around for us to give them back after all, and we knew most of them from the shop.  Made sure they got turns at the different events (nothing at the convention could be called inappropriate), and generally made the best of it.  But hey, we were still a bit angry at having them foisted on us without being asked.\n\nWell, it turns out none of them were given enough money for lunch.  They had their own money, which they spent on swag, but the cash their parents gave them wasn't enough to cover an actual lunch at the convention all.  It averaged about $3 per kid, when that was the price of a soda.\n\nSo, Hal and I took all of their lunch cash...and took them to Hooters.\n\nUsed that money, and some of our own to make sure the waitresses were extra attentive, and had them at their own table.  (We sat nearby to keep an eye on them)  Had them order whatever they wanted (that a kid could legally get, no booze of course), and between the restaurant being mostly dead, and the fact that Hal and I were tipping well, meant there were buxom scantly clad women around constantly, Almost a 2/1 ratio (kid to waitress).  They must have eaten five platters of wings before they were through, not including the ones they ordered but didn't like (usually because it was too spicy), those got bagged up into a cooler bag.  Told them it wasn't an issue, just order something they did like.\n\nAt the end we picked up the tab, but not before calling the trip organizer, Jim, to let him know what happened.  Was told it wouldn't be an issue, get him a receipt.  So we get the group scrubbed up, helped by the 'assistant buddies', and back to the convention, and finished the afternoon.\n\nSo we got back to the bus, and gave Jim the receipt for lunch, as well as any other necessary items, mostly beverages (gotta keep hydrated) that we bought them afterwards.   Just for them, not our bills.  (We paid for our lunch separately for example.)\n\nThe bus was set to leave at 6PM, and we were told be back for 5PM just in case, because the trip would leave, full or not.  So around 5:30 the parents start coming back in, only to meet Jim at the front.  He refused to let them on until they paid us back for watching their kids.  Told them that if they didn't pay by six, the bus would be leaving *and that they would still owe the tab*.\n\nOne parent asked for a delay to hit an ATM, and was granted permission to go.  Jim told the rest that the bus would leave when that dad got back.  A few other parents asked to see the bill, which is where they discovered that we took their 'precious angels' to Hooters...never mind the fact that we were at a convention about a game where people kill aliens with chainswords.  Jim informed them that if they had spoken to Hal and I before the convention started, then maybe they would have learned about our lunch plans, and could have watched their kids themselves.  Didn't shut up the few Karens in the group, but it reduced most of it to grumbling.\n\nAbout this point the 1st dad came back, and asked his share, was told, and left most of the parents in shock.  They apparently didn't have that much cash still on them, and Jim wasn't going to give them any more time.  Pay up and board, or stay behind and pay later.  The 1st dad offered to lend money to the rest, (not a guy you want to owe money to from what I gather) with some accepting, the rest 'finding' the cash in purses and wallets.\n\nJim ended up handing us five hundred dollars.  Almost $200 for the chicken, the rest he charged them as a 'kid-taiment' fee.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: thanks for the great conversations, and the piece of silver (four more and I'll have a whole electrum!).  Hitting bed now, but I'll try to answer any replies when I get up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2:  Wow, this exploded!  Please no more awards, give the money to a good charity instead.",

            "During college I was, let\u2019s call it a \u201ccamp counselor,,\u201d for a summer program at Johns Hopkins. It was a three-week residential program for smart kids; they qualified by taking the SAT as sixth or seventh graders, and they came from all over the country to study. Mostly STEM classes were offered, but also philosophy, creative writing, and some fine arts IIRC. (Which i probably don\u2019t, because it\u2019s been awhile).  Very bright, although usually not quite as clever as they thought they were. \n\nAnyway, the kids got a day trip to the Inner Harbor as part of the program. I went along to supervise my kids\u2014about a dozen boys, ages 12-14\u2013and so I let them pick where they wanted to eat. They picked Hooters, so that\u2019s where we went.  They ordered wings, drank soda, and some good clean fun. \n\nI wasn\u2019t invited back to work the next year.",

            "The kids sound WAY more responsible than their respective grown ups. Like, I'm sure it was annoying, but good on them for being like\"okay, we're on our own, we don't know where we are, that's a familiar adult we can kind of trust, let's just stick with them.\"\n\nI guess if your parents are that entitled and irresponsible, you start to figure out how to compensate for them by yourself--and unfortunately for you on that day, that included knowing their own limitations as children, and recognizing that they needed an adult.",
            "Man you did well, and sound like great dudes. \n\nReally glad you got some profit out of the situation, I have been a Scout leader for the younger end you got there and honestly impromptu being made responsible would be terrible, especially at something like a con where I usually have a rather full checklist of stuff I want to do myself.\n\nAlso you probably cemented their future plastic crack addiction for years to come, that would probably do it for me if I had any interest at the time.  \nThankfully I only play MtG, which isn't expensive at all. /s",
            "So, I'm a little confused. Did you know the parents of these kids? It seems super irresponsible for parents to thrust their kids on a stranger at a convention.

            "My immediate thought was find whoever is in charge and give them the \"abandoned minors\". That shit would get serious real fast for the parents.

One manager had a bellyfull of the parents using his store as a day care facility and threatened to call the police more than a few times for child abandonment. Naturally the parents (mostly were mothers) would go ballistic or Karen on the manager, but they would acquiesce, taking their kids elsewhere, most likely to the local TILT arcade and give them a 20 to burn on games.\n\nI tell ya, the days of malls and retail. I'm sad the former is dying, but the latter has not let up on the pace or the pressure.",

She was quite the annoyance but we largely ignored her. One day it got too much and I poured my water bottle over her. Unfortunately there was a teacher course and she saw what happened. Cue me being sent to the principals office.\n\nPrincipal was naturally rather unimpressed by my behaviour and told me to write an essay on what I'd done and why it was inappropriate indicating that I'd receive detention at the end of it. \n\nNow the MC instead of writing the one page essay requested, I wrote 3 pages, detailing the months of annoyance and abuse and how we were constantly trying to avoid her, even moving locations where we hung out. I detailed how she would jump on our backs trying to knock us off balance (causing us to fall several times), pull our hair and the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance of the essay the dozens of times she tried to grab and kick our nuts. (I got really good at catching approaching feet with my thighs) \n\nI handed in my essay and waited for them to tell me how much detention I'd get. The principal came out of his office, said I was free to go and told the teacher to bring the girl in. She ended up getting detention, a call to her parents and she didn't bother us again.\n\nBonus story.\n\nSimilar vein. Another girl I poured drink on, this time red fizzy on white school uniform.\n\nShe was constantly stealing our hacky sack, so one day I saw her run for it as it fell. Stepped on it so she couldn't get it. She was trying to wrench it out from under my foot so I poured most of my can of red mirinda *slowly* on her back. Poured half my drink out before she ran away. Nothing came of that one. (although I figured out years later she actually liked me so screwed that one up)",

One day after I had enough, I yelled at her to stop touching my ass, she replied with the oh so mature \"What are you? Gay?\" so I snapped back with \"No, I just don't fancy farm animals\". She got ultra red pissed off and began to yell shit at me but I just ignored it and started singing Old McDonalds Farm. Eventually half the lunch line joined in. She stormed off and had to deal with people asking her how old McDonald was doing for a couple months.\n\nShe thankfully didn't harass me again.

Our principal was a bit shocked to see that I was the perpetrator because I was a twig of a girl and this guy was fairly tall. The principal was cross with me at first until I explained that the kid had been bullying me for months, the teachers were informed and they did nothing to stop this guy from hurting me, and that I had punched him in the face right after he took my (very expensive) flute and dumped it out of its case and onto the concrete outside. \nI still got suspended because of a zero tolerance policy at my school, but the principal picked a day where we only had to attend for half of a day (to make up for snow days) so I got to sleep in and play video games all day.

I got a call from the principal where he was apologetically letting me know that they searched him and his locker publicly based on this unfounded claim. \n\nBefore that she told multiple of the other boys on my son\u2019s football team that he is gay and he likes them. She did this while leading them on promising \u201cthings\u201d trying to get them to turn on him. Real weird \n\nI have screen shots where she admits to making up a story about a group of boys online bullying her over the summer. They were super close to being in huge trouble based on her word. \n\nShe changed schools at the beginning of last year saying that all the kids at her previous school bullied and harassed her. I\u2019ve been trying to figure out what she did there and have uncovered one story where she accused a boy of throwing a rock at her head giving her a concussion. Editing to add that the parents requested very specific information about the location and time knowing that they could get video. It never happened.\n\nThe school won\u2019t confront her, won\u2019t punish her. At this point there are several kids who will be attending a different high school because the parents don\u2019t want their children in her path for the next 4 years.",

We\u2019d have preferences and argue which finger used to flick the coin was the best. From the index, middle, ring and pinky fingers. We nicknamed the pinky finger flick the Lauren flick accordingly. Over time, it just turned into just the Lauren. As such, we\u2019d argue whether the Lauren, although had little power, boosted greater accuracy and feel over the other fingers. A teacher overheard us talking intently about Lauren and strange upsides and downsides to using it. Obviously they misunderstand and got mad, took us a while to explain our way out of that one.",

        "selftext": "This is a story that was recently brought up again by my mom when she was recounting some really shitty racism she encountered when she first came to the United States.  I've heard this story a few times before but didn't think to share it anywhere else.  That is until I was made aware of this subreddit.  Enjoy.\n\nIt was the late 1980s in Los Angeles, California.  By this time my mom, a Japanese immigrant, had been living in the United States for ten years.  Although she could speak English well, she wasn\u2019t fluent and preferred to speak Japanese with others from the local Japanese-American community.\n\nOne day, she and a friend were waiting to be seated at a restaurant on Beverly Boulevard.  As they chattered away in Japanese, a large shadow cast down upon them.  Looking up, they found Karen\u2019s 1989 counterpart leering down at them.  \n\nMom couldn\u2019t remember how the woman looked except for the look of pure contempt trying to work its way across facial muscles frozen by Botox.  \n\n\u201cYou two,\u201d Karen barked, \u201cthis is America!  Speak English.\u201d\n\nStartled, my mom and her friend made eye contact, unsure of what to do.  Encounters like this were, sadly, ones they had run into many times since they came to live in the USA.  They were not ones for confrontation.  Before, they couldn\u2019t do anything while their bullies marched off, unpunished.  But then, as they made eye contact, a brilliant thing happened.\n\nMom likened the moment to their thought processes coming in sync together.  They had a shared idea that didn\u2019t need any further elaboration or explanation.\n\n\u201cMasami, my dear, I do think the waiter ought to have shown up to escort us to our table by now,\u201d Mom chimed in the poshest British accent she could muster.  \u201cIt\u2019s frightfully rude to keep us waiting like this!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, darling,\u201d her friend replied, invoking her best impersonation of the Princess of Wales, \u201cit is frightfully rude indeed!\u201d  \n\nAs they continued to twitter away in their fake English accents, Karen began to slowly back away.  Her Botox face reddened and twisted itself in a visage as hideous as the Furies.  Realizing that she had just been outsmarted by two young women obsessed with British culture and celebrity, all she could do was storm off down Beverly Boulevard a defeated bully.\n\nWhile there was no direct punishment, it was a story that my mom would continue to retell thirty years later.  It has always made me chuckle to myself, and I hope you enjoyed it too.\n\nEdit: So there was a massive error on my part.  What I thought was Botox paralyzing Karen 1989's facial muscles would have most likely been a botched face lift.  For some reason, when I first heard my mom's story, I just immediately thought her face was that way due to a bad Botox injection.  \n\nAnd holy shit this post blew up. I thought this was going to get buried.  Thank you everyone for your comments and awards.  But seriously, if you have money to burn please use your funds for a worthy cause.  This edit is coming in too late, but in the future even a small donation to organisations working to stop Asian hate crimes goes a long way.  Thank you.",

This one woman was saying that she thought and spoke in both languages equally each day.  But this one question stuck with me \u201cWhat language do you and your husband argue in?  THAT\u2019S your love language.\u201d  \n\nUnless I am attempting language immersion, if I am visiting Africa, France, Taiwan, Sweden, etc., with someone or a group who speaks the same language ... naturally we are going to speak it.  \n\nSo why some Americans are so freaking high and mighty to say this when someone is not speaking English is BEYOND OBNOXIOUS.  \n\nI live on the Canadian border, about 90 minutes from Quebec.  So we have (had, I should say prior to COVID) a lot of French Canadians shopping state-side.  Years back, I heard this uttered a few times to someone speaking in French.  If I heard it nowadays said to ANYONE, I would not be silent. \n\nWe also have a growing Hispanic population (mainly undocumented) due to so many large farms roundabout.  I have acquaintances in the loop who used to give them rides and do their shopping when our border patrol presence was very strong with checkpoints set up randomly.  But now, things have eased, and many have started to do their own shopping.  \n\nMost of the guys are identifiable by their dress and farm odor, and I feel oddly protective.  Somehow I end up shopping when they do.  I am legit waiting for some jerk in the store to step out of line and say something just so I can tell them off.",

            "That reminds me of the beginning of 'Crazy Rich Asians' where the young Chinese mother arrived in London with her children ahead of her husband in a pouring rainstorm, after a lengthy, exhausting trip. They finally arrive at their hotel only for their registration to mysteriously disappear when the manager sees that they are Asian. He wouldn't even let the children wait in the lobby while she went out in the rain to make a call (of course she wasn't allowed to use the house phone). Five minutes later they're back at the hotel and the manager starts to throw them out when the owner comes downstairs and welcomes them with open arms. The manager tries to subtly inquire as to how much ass kissing will be required to fix his racist error, and is informed that as of a few minutes ago the hotel has a new owner: the Chinese woman he's been treating so terribly. The manager looks at her, and she smiles. \n\nYour mom's story is better, because it's real, but the story from the CRA book/movie is one of my all-time favorite 'racist bastard gets what's coming to him' stories. She bought a hotel on impulse, like it was a candy bar, because the manager was a racist dick, and now she's his boss. It's beautiful.",

        "selftext": "Many years ago I had succumbed to a patriotic fever and enlisted in the Air National Guard. As such I went to basic training. Yes, it's the same basic training the \"Real Air Force\" goes to. Anyway... \n\nOne of the first bits of training they try to hammer into your skull is the importance of the Dorm Guard (DG). DG is responsible for controlling who has access to the dormitories, reporting headcount to nightwatch, and making sure nobody is slitting their wrists in the shitter or starting fires. It is a very easy job but trainees regularly fuck it up because they can't think straight in a military training environment. \nIf someone knocks on the door the DG has to verify their ID against a list on the back of the door. No ID? No entry. If ID is presented but there is no matching name on the list? No entry. There are only two exceptions. If the person requesting entry has a key and uses the key in the lock (because holding it up to the window to show you are a key holder isn't good enough. Yes, one trainee learned this the hard way.) Or the person requesting entry can use a known code word, but this will only happen in an actual emergency and isn't part of the training experience. To quote my MTL (Military Training Leader) \"If Osama bin Laden shows up to the door armed with an RPG and wrapped head to toe in dynamite and he gives you the code word, let the fucker in and stay out of his way.\" \n\nEveryone will do DG duty and you should expect to be tested. They will yell and threaten, try to trick you, intimate you and beat on the door mercilessly, but the protocol is gospel. Break from the rules and you'll find yourself writing letters to the families of your fellow trainees, explaining that they were killed because you couldn't remember how to guard a fucking door. (Looking at you, Trainee \"Oh I see you have a key, let me open the door for you\"). \nBasic is a headgame. They aren't allowed to physically touch you so you are never in any actual danger. All danger is simulated by big bald Sargents yelling. I had the advantage of being almost 10 years older than the average trainee (I celebrated my 28th birthday during BMT.) I've been yelled at before. It doesn't bother me.\n\nIt's the middle of the night and I'm on duty. I do a head count. 51 people present, 50 people assigned. This means either I miscounted, or someone is here that isn't assigned to be here, not to mention whoever did the count before me has been fucking it up. I recount, 51/50, and call it in to the MTL on duty (not our regular MTL) via the loud ass squawk box intercom on the wall which everyone in the dorm can hear. \n\nMe: Sir, trainee Youse reports as ordered. Blah blah blah other shit I had to report... Headcount, 50 assigned, 51 accounted for. \n\nMTL: \"WHAT WAS THAT HEADCOUNT AGAIN?\" \n\nME: Sir, 50 assigned, 51 accounted for. \n\nMTL: WRONG. COUNT THEM AGAIN. \n\nNow I've already checked and double checked and I have already assumed that this was a paperwork error and not my error but they want me to follow orders and procedures so that is what I will do. I recount and report.\n\n\"Sir, 50 assigned, 51 accounted for. \"\n\nSO HELP ME TRAINEE IF I HAVE TO COME UP THERE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T COUNT I WILL CHOKE YOU TO DEATH WITH YOUR REFLECTIVE BELT AND BURY YOU IN THE PARADE GROUND WITH THE FLAGPOLE UP YOUR ASS. NOW GET EVERYBODY UP. SOUND OFF ONE BY ONE SO I CAN FUCKING HEAR IT. \n\nBy now almost everyone is awake anyway so everyone begins to sound off. \n\n\"One sir, Two sir, Three sir..... Fourty nine sir, Fifty sir... Cut to the last guy, shaking his head because he's scared of what he knows is coming next... Fifty one sir. \"\n\nGODAMNIT! ONEOFYOUUSELESSFUCKSISGOINGTODIETONIGHT! I'M FUCKING COMING UP THERE! \n\nThe dorm is a 2 minute walk from CQ. He was there in about 9 seconds banging on the door. But, being as mad as he was, he stormed over without his key, his ID, and had apparently forgotten the fact that there was a single word that would open the door instantly. He was focused on fixing whatever was jacked up with my headcount. \n\nBanging on the door. OPEN UP! \n\n\"Sir, may I see your authority to enter? \"\n\nI JUST GOT OFF THE COM WITH YOU LET ME THE FUCK IN!\n\n\"Sir, without valid ID I am forced to refer you to CQ for authorization.\" \n\nARE YOU FUCKING SHITTING ME? I AM THE CQ! CUT YOUR SHIT AND OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR! \n\n\"Sir, without valid ID I cannot allow you access to the dorm. Please contact CQ for authorization. \"\n\nBy now the other trainees are nervous, and some are telling me to open the door while others are insisting I keep it shut, perhaps indefinitely because the Sgt. sounds like he may actually end someone's life tonight. I stick to the program and we go back and forth like this a few more times. I've honestly never had anyone this angry with me in my life, but all my replies are literally written on the back of the door so I keep reading them to him, which only makes him madder and madder each time. By now it's been 20 minutes since first count and he's used up every threat and insult at his disposal and is forced to stop and think. He remembers the code word. \n\nCODE WORD\n\nI opened the door immediately. He bolts passed me with only the slightest pause for some direct eye contact which sent the message that he would be back shortly to harvest my flesh for a new suit he was going to make, and he begins to count. \n\n51\n\nWHO OF YOU IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE? \n\nSilence. \n\nThen from the last bunk \"Umm, sir?\" \nIt's a guy we don't recognize. All our counting thus far took place in the dark. Until the Sgt was in the room and he turned the lights on we had no idea. It turns out this kid had graduated the day before but needed to be warehoused for a few weeks while he waited for his next training assignment to begin. He was supposed to be there, but since he wasn't on our roster, he was not included in the headcount. Promises of extreme punishment were issued and we were told that this wasn't over and that the morning would be terrible for all of us, especially me. \n\nAt 0530 I was called on the carpet to explain why I refused to allow the Sgt to perform his duties. I stated plainly and simply that there were protocols and procedures in place for me to follow. I had been told never to deviate and that I would be tested. I had performed my duties to the best of my abilities. They could find no fault with this and I was never punished. \nMy MTL (not the one from night watch) later quietly congratulated me for sticking to the protocol. Ultimately it reflected well on both of us. \n\nTl;Dr: Fix your attention span and learn to read a page or two of text. This post may or may not be worth it but someday one will be.",

            "Guy I was with pulled main gate guard duty. Come morning, at 05H50 the RSM drives up to the gate. He stops and this guy marches over with rifle, and calmly asks for ID. This was the morning the RSM had left his Military ID at home, and after 5 minutes of yelling , and having a rifle levelled at him, he reversed, and drove back ( at a speed that might or might not have been considered as inappropriate for formula 1 vehicles)to his house to collect it. \n\nHe arrived back at 07H10, with an entire platoon of the rest of us waiting in front of his locked office looking at him at parade rest. Sweet FA he could do, though the guy never again pulled gate duty, instead he was assigned the coldest furtherest posts instead for his next duty a month later.\n\nwhat probably Peed off the RSM was the stream of cars driving in through the other gate, with a guard letting them through without question, but that gate had no road to the RSM's preferred parking area without going all the way around the base, and through another 2 security points that only opened after 07H00 in any case.",
            "Haha I had two similar events in Army basic. Not quite as funny as yours though.\n\nOnce, while we were still in reception waiting to go to basic we had a guy fall into our formation by mistake. So obviously when we went to count off... We were +1.\n\nWe must have counted off a dozen times, the guy refusing to admit his mistake (we didn't really know each other at that time), the drill sergeant getting madder and madder... Many pushups were had before that goober admitted his fuckup.\n\nThe second time, while we were actually in basic, some guy went to sleep after his assigned fire guard shift (like your door guard) in the wrong bunk for whatever stupid reason. One or two fire guard shifts later, someone realized that his bunk was empty and reported a soldier missing. \n\nInitially the drill sergeants were in a rage at the fireguard because they thought fire guard had let a soldier go AWOL, and then they were in a rage at the guy who wasn't in his assigned bunk. It was not a good night for that kid... But he was the platoon fuckup anyways, he had lots of bad times in basic.\n\nMoral of the story... Drill sergeants HATE it when they think they've misplaced a soldier.",
            "I was on submarines during the 80s and each boat had an access control list while in port.  If youre on the list you get on , if not you are barred , if you challenge it hard enough - terminal force is authorized.  I was on Tridents the last half of my time in.   My boat was new and our Captain was original nuclear navy. He had been XO of the Nautilus SSN-571 when it was in service.  He had turned down Commodore to be in command of the submarine.  \n\nOne of his buddies was Admiral Hyman Rickover - the father of naval nuclear power.  This was about a year before he died.  85-ish(he was 85 too).  He was invited to come down for a test ride on what was at the time the most powerful weapon of destruction on the face of the planet.  1296 Megatons of nuclear destructive capability. \n\nThe list of things to do or not do was like a rock stars list.  Do not address the Admiral even if spoken to.  White grapes peeled in the wardroom and all times.  A one page list of protocol for the old man.  Food, temperature, music.  the whole thing. \n\nSo anyways he and his staff came down (even retired he had a staff) Along with people from squadron.  And he just walks down the plank on board and starts to go down the hatch before topside watch can get there.  The topside pulls his shotgun racks it and points it right at his head in the hatch.   His staff goes crazy.  The watch hits the alarm and orders him out of the hatch.   \n\nYou would think the Father of Naval Nuclear Power would be on every single access list for every nuclear powered vessel in the US Navy.  \n\nBut he wasnt.   \n\nThe watch was dressed down for pointing a shotgun at what was considered to most powerful and feared person in the pentagon.   \n\nBut the old man,  sincerely apologized for violating a protocol he developed and was escorted down.    It was kind sad as you watched this 85 year old man sitting there.  Enjoying what would be his last ride on something he was responsible for.  He died a few months later.  And there stories passed since almost anyone in naval nuclear power had at some point been the target of his wrath.   He wasnt a bad person but knew first hand the cost of failure having lost 2 submarines in the 60s.  And perfect was the only standard in his life. ",

            "Ha ha, nice one.\n\nMy Dad told me a similar story from Vietnam. Forgive me I don't know all the military terms, but I've been told the story a million times. He was a lowly technician, not a combat role, and one of his jobs when was within cooee of the front was guard duty.\n\nHe said one time he was one duty and a patrol came in, so he called out the code word, and because they were battle hardened tough and rough warriors they ignored the kid on guard duty calling out the code. So my Dad called it out again, and they ignored him again. These people were obviously Aussie soldiers, but rules are rules and at this point he's ordered to start shooting at these men.\n\nHe didn't shoot at them, but he did storm up to the patrol, go straight to the boss and start shouting at him \"What the bloody hell do you think you're doing?! I was about to SHOOT you! Why didn't you call the code word? You stupid bastard!\"\n\nAnd the officer he was yelling at started yelling back at him, and an argument was breaking out, when an even higher officer came up to find out what was going on. The other bloke started talking, but my Dad, probably only 21 at the time, cut him off and was all like \"I'll tell you what's up! I nearly shot this idiot right here because he didn't say the code word. It's YOUR job to train these people, if YOU can't do your job someone's going to DIE!\"\n\nAnd the senior officer turned to the patrolling officer and said \"He's right you know. You have to say the code words.\" And my Dad yelled \"Too bloody right I'm right. Next time, I'm just going to SHOOT you.\" and he stormed off.\n\nAnyway, he says it wasn't until about 5 minutes later, when he was walking away, that he realised he just totally yelled at two officers and threatened to shoot one of them. Nothing ever came of it, but he was shitting himself.",

            "I went through Air Force basic a while ago, we called it Entry Controller (EC) or Fire Guard. We had an MTI (Military Training Instructor, MTL's were in tech school when I went through) come up through the back door super quiet while one kid was on EC duty. The MTI snuck around the dorm making noise and then hiding so the EC couldn't find him. He brought a red pen and drew a line across certain trainees necks to show that they were dead.\n\nThere was another time when my EC battle buddy and I decided to take turns napping, because fuck sleeping for two hours waking up for an hour or 2 and sleeping for another hour or two. He took first nap shift, everything was uneventful. When I slept it was close to 3:30 am and I lay down on the bench in the shower. About 5 or 10 minutes later the latrine door was booted open, I have no idea how I moved so quickly but I was up, uniform perfect, flashlight on and fake weapon shouldered in less then a second. Our main MTI turns and sees me, looks for a second or two then asks me what the fuck I was doing in the latrine. I didn't know what to say because my brain was still asleep, but I managed to reply, \"The latrine is secure sir.\" He stared for another second then said, \"Carry on Trainee Slixem...\" and I sped out of the bathroom. I find my EC battle buddy and ask him why he didn't warn me that our MTI was here and his answer was, \"I was ruffling the papers really loud, you should have heard.\"",

            "I got my ass kicked once for doing this.  At the start of our FTX I was assigned to guard the gate (vehicle and pedestrian) that led to our \"FOB.\"  I stopped all of the drill sergeants and asked for ID.  All of them except one had their IDs out and were showing them before I even opened my mouth, but one of them copped an attitude.  I was asking myself whether this was the right thing to do -- we'd never been explicitly told that screening people for proper ID was part of the \"game\" -- when I heard the guy behind me rack his .50.  It's amazing how that one sound can say so much: I've got your back buddy, you're doing the right thing, and P.S. whoever is trying to get in, you'd better fucking do as he says.\n\nTo be clear, we were not issued any live ammunition and we didn't even have any blanks for the .50 cal.  I'm not even sure such things are made.  I knew this, the gunner knew this, and the DS knew it.  Everyone knew it, but somehow it was still enough to get him to fish out his ID.  We let him in and I thought that was the last of it.\n\nToward the end of the week, my platoon was OPFOR and another platoon was sent to search our \"village\" (MOUT training site) for an insurgent.  We'd done the searching before and knew how it was supposed to go: they would come in, form a security perimeter, move tactically, ask us predetermined questions, etc. etc.  We were all given roles and were supposed to ask for different things like MREs, money, and some other stuff I don't remember that they weren't allowed to give us because of Geneva Conventions or something.  Anyway, these guys roll in and just start beating the shit out of everyone.  They're in full battle rattle (bulletproof vests with plates, helmets, and a rifle) and we're just in the cloth BDUs with no weapons so there was no contest.  I personally got shoved facefirst in the dirt, had gravel shoved into my mouth, and got kicked in the gut.  They weren't fucking around.\n\nOur DS rolled up about two minutes into this ass kicking, waved his hands to turn us from hadji into CIA Special Agents, and instructed us to arrest everyone in the platoon for war crimes.  Afterward he pulled us aside and said he had no idea they were going to do that and they were going to get smoked for it, but also take this as a lesson on how not to treat people when we deploy.\n\nAnyway, I found out later that the other guys had been specifically instructed to \"rough us up a bit\" by their DS, who was the one who got mad when I asked for his ID.  I have no idea what happened to him or his platoon, but I didn't see him around from then until we graduated a week later.\n\nIt was worth it.",

He started screaming at me but I kept my gun on him. Eventually he stopped and took me aside and we had a casual conversation about where I was from. Never heard about what happend from anyone.  ",

That made him very angry because his name was supposed to be on the entry list, but someone had not updated the list since we moved. The list had a bunch of names of people I didn't recognize.

Enraged, he left.  45 minutes later, he let himself in, challenged me to my face to explain himself, looking violent. \nI did. \nThe cursing woke everyone, and he kicked the shit out of a metal trash can until it was a crumpled mess. \nHe woke everyone.

He had done extensive user research and designed attractive screens. In another example of \"don't ask if you aren't prepared for the answer' at the same meeting, a different exec piped up to vomit doubt all over him and demand \"what *exactly* does your 'user research' say our customers *want*?\" My colleague replied \"They want a big red button labeled 'give me large amounts of somebody else's money', but I assumed you don't actually want to provide that.\")",

That union was so powerful that it was damn near impossible to fire people once they passed probation.\n\nMy absolute favourite story is the guy who would drink while working on the line and somehow never got caught by management. Well, one day management hears he's drinking again, so he grabs some security and heads to the guys work station. This guy hears they are coming (workers would yell out and warn when bosses are coming around), and he just leaves his work station and takes off running. Manager sees him and the chase is on. This guy runs all through the plant with manager and security chasing after him.\n\nSomehow he managed to lose them, so the manager radios ahead to the security gate to tell them about this guy and make sure he doesn't get out. They really wanted to nail him with drunk on the job. SOMEHOW this guy gets out of the plant and went home to sleep it off. Nobody knows if he snuck through security, or jumped a fence somewhere. And the funniest part about it is that because they didn't *actually* catch him drinking, all they could write him up for was leaving his work station, which is clearly not nearly as bad.\n\nMy second favourite story was the guy who got divorced and kicked out of his house, so he started living in the plant.

        "selftext": "TLDR: lawyer tried to hardball my client, i proved his client committed a statutory offense and got what i wanted plus damages and dobbed his client in.\n\nSo i work as a specialist property valuer. A few years ago a real estate agent friend approached me on behalf of his client. His client was a book seller who operated a specialist book shop on the 7th floor of a City building. A one man band small business. Nice bloke.\n\nUnfortunately nice bloke had decided to renew his lease for 5 years and signed the new lease without getting advice. His new building owner enacted the market rent review clause and jacked up his rent by something like 50%. Tells nice bloke, your new rent for the next 5 years is x. \n\nNice bloke is distraught! He cant afford it. So he asks nicely to rescind the lease and he will move elsewhere. Estate agent friend has found a cheaper space for him. Denied by building owner. Building owner says he will also sue if he breaks the lease.\n\nSo the agents asks me to review the case. I look through the case. Nice bloke is stuffed. The lease is lock tight and they are justified in jacking up the rent. I think our only hope is to appeal to the mercy of the building owners lawyer. So i call him and ask for release, penalty free, for my client. Mr Lawyer says \"stiff cheddar, you need to comply with the law, try reading the lease\". A real arrogant a-hole. Cue malicious compliance \"ok, i will\".\n\nI read through the lease and note that all references to the Retail Leases Act have been crossed out. Fair enough. The act only applies to retail tenancies IF they are below the 3rd floor of a building. Nice bloke is on level 7. Act should not apply. But hold up imma gonna check that. \n\nI call the small business commission who administer the act, and they advise that, if you retail a good (like books) it doesn't matter what floor you are on the act applies. You could be on the friggen roof if you want. The level 3 provision only applies if you retail a service. This means the building owner has breached the act and failed to comply with the law (theres certain things they have to provide before signing a lease and timing they have to follow). A breach is no small thing. I get a ruling from the commission.\n\nI call for mediation with Mr Lawyer. Present are Mr Lawyer, building owner and their agent and nice bloke and me. I again plead for a penalty free release. No dice and they threaten to sue. I gently slide the ruling accross the table to Mr Lawyer. \n\nMe:\"Ok. Well as per your suggestion i read the lease. We have a ruling that proves the act applies to the lease. Your clients failed to comply with the act and committed a statutory offense \"\n\nLawyer: (reads ruling)....\"um ok. We will grant you a penalty free release\"\n\nMe: \"oh. We dont need that. We enact our right under the act to terminate the lease, penalty free, and to seek damages for the landlords breach of their statutory obligations and ill be reporting the breach to the commission \"\n\nLawyer: \"no need for all that, lets just tear up the lease\"\n\nMe: \"sorry, that wouldn't be complying with the law would it?\"\n\nUPDATE 1: I just spoke with the agent on our side, we are still good mates. He cant remember the outcome off the top of his head but he thinks he might have leveraged a waiver of nice blokes make good obligations (requirement to replace carpets, paint walls and remove fitout etc) and he did move nice bloke to a cheaper space. He thinks he might still have a file on it so he will ring me back when he gets into the office.\n\nUPDATE 2: so i spoke to the agent today and he doesn't have the file anympre but his recollection is that he negotiated a waiver on the make good obligations,  got 60 or 90 days rent free and relocation as a deal for nice bloke. We canremember if anything happened from the dob in.",

            "Years ago my wife had a one person landlord/tenant law practice here in the US. It was basically a one person show, so if my wife had to go to court, the office was empty. Not usually a big deal as this was the type of practice that was mostly cell phone and laptop. Technically it was a two person partnership law practice, but my participation was limited to reviewing contracts and going to court once in  a while if she two cases at the same time.\n\nSo, there was one tenant client who had a dispute with her deposit and damages. Long story short, not only would her landlord not give the deposit back but claimed there were extra damages. Our case was weak as our client didn't have proof that the damages in the apartment were preexisting or caused by external forces (a window was allegedly cracked by a tree branch from the outside).\n\nNow, in my state, if the landlord does not provide a detailed list of damages or the the deposit, automatically the landlord has statutorily failed his or her role and now owes double the deposit. Guess who didn't comply with the statute? The now double deposit amount exceeded what the landlord was demanding so were willing to settle for the difference. Nope. Mediation fails and we go to the judge.\n\nNow, before I continue, this landlord was an arrogant SOB who didn't know the law.  He was a computer engineer who thought his shiat didn't smell and the rental was just a second investment property. We (I got involved at one point) tried to explain the law when offering the deal, but no dice. He thought a law firm that didn't even have regular office hours during the business day (not really required in our line of work -- really only needed the office as a space nicer than Starbucks to meet with clients) was too far beneath him.\n\nNow the way LT court works is that you have two rounds of meditation before you see a judge. Most cases settle before you get to the judge so if it gets that far, the judge is looking to see who is being unreasonable.  The judge rules for the landlord, though he disagrees with some of the cost estimates and awards him a bit less money, but reminds the LL that he owes double the deposit so he needs to give T some money (more than what we would have had to pay if he just accepted our offer).\n\nLL doesn't agree with the judges findings and appeals (larger court fees). When my wife gets the paperwork she sees he screwed up the appeal. Since she wasn't his lawyer she didn't have to tell him he screwed up. She didn't even have to respond to the court. Instead she quietly put a lien on the property for the judgment, added a fee for the extra paper work involving the fee, and went on her merry way.\n\nYears go by. One day, we get an email from the email the LL asking us to remove the lien as he is selling the property. Gladly, just pay the judgement and fees. LL refuses and hires his own lawyer to fight us. This time we have the strong case. We simply show the attorney the paper work and how everything was proper on our end and it's not our fault LL tried to play lawyer without seeking legal advice.\n\nLong story short, our client gets her money, we get our legal fee, and LL gets a bill from the attorney that he hired that probably negated whatever the judge awarded LL.\n\ntl;tr - mess with the horns, get the bull even if it takes awhile",

But my favorite are people, doctors and lawyers who call and think that if they threaten to sue that surely will get them what they want right away! No.. Our trained response and means of handling that is \" if you feel you need to bring legal action you are welcome to do as you feel is right, and I cannot offer any legal advise in this situation.\" oh wow. The best is that I go out of my way to sounds gleefully chipper when I deliver that line.

Some were great, some were crappy. This happened at one of the crappy places where I worked as a lowly customer service rep. I was late 40s, very dependable, and my manager Ann called me her ideal employee. Never had any customer complaints, never tardy, sick once in 3 years, submitted many time and money saving ideas, always worked late when asked. I  worked 32 hours a week, Monday through Thursday, so I was typically the one she asked to work late since everyone else was full-time and no overtime was involved if I worked a few extra hours.\n\nI was having migraines and my doctor could see me the next afternoon. I asked Ann if I could leave two hours early the next day to go to the doctor. She said work was slow that week and no one else was off, so yes. But since I was giving less than 48 hours notice, it counted as unexcused and I would get a written warning. I said that I was giving 24 hours notice and we were slow and fully staffed, so I just didn\u2019t get why there would be a warning. (Four warnings in 6 months and you were  terminated. They didn\u2019t care if you had a doctor\u2019s excuse. Tardies were a warning, calling in sick, returning late from lunch. It was not difficult to get four in 6 months.)  Ann said that it was a matter of her having to shift the schedule around. It was inconsiderate to not plan ahead and she didn\u2019t want to set a precedent and be taken advantage of.\n\nI went to the appointment, got the warning, and was ticked off about it. But I decided I would be happy to comply with their petty policy in my own malicious way. I didn\u2019t have to wait very long.\n\nA couple weeks later, Ann came to me an hour before closing and said she had a stack of orders that had come in via Amazon and they needed to be put in that day. The phones had been busy, so the reps who normally entered orders didn\u2019t get to them. Could I stay and put them in? I said I really had no other plans, but I\u2019d been thinking about what she\u2019d said about giving 48 hours notice when asking someone to change their schedule, and she was right; it does lead to them taking advantage of you. So I would be willing to stay late two days from now, but I can no longer stay late on such short notice. \u201dBut, I didn\u2019t know that I\u2019d need you until just now!\u201d \u201cOh, I totally understand. It\u2019s like when I was having migraines and needed to get into the doctor as soon as possible. I think I deserve the same consideration that you deserve. If you give me 48 hours notice, I am happy to stay.\u201d She was speechless. She had to pay someone else overtime to stay.\n\nA couple days later she thought she\u2019d get back at me when she told me that I could not remain part time and would have to start working Fridays the following week. I calmly told her that the following Thursday would be my last day then. By that afternoon she changed her mind and I could stay on my current schedule.",

I was asking for an average of one weekend off a month. \n\nAnyway, submitted a time off request weeks in advance. Made the mistake of assuming it not being declined (normally they are quickly if there\u2019s an issue) meant it was approved. So I went and booked accomodation for the weekend. \n\nGetting closer to the date, I ask about it, passed around between managers a bit. Eventually one tells me that I\u2019ve had too much time off recently. A few weeks back I would\u2019ve accepted that and organised another time, but I had booked accommodation now. \n\nI promptly handed in my resignation and all of a sudden they were ok with me taking time off. \n\nToo often businesses/managers love playing the power game and treating staff as disposable, so it\u2019s always nice to have times in your life when you can give it right back to them.",
            "I have actually had this type of issue with a doctors office.  They had a policy that there was a $40 dollar charge if you canceled an appointment with less than 24 hours notice.  There was a big sign on the wall in their waiting area about it.  So one day their office called me about an hour before our appointment to reschedule because the doctor had to run to their child's school to deal with an issue.  \n\nI had already taken time off in order to be at the appointment, and I remembered their policy.  I wasn't actually mad at the doctor, I understand that these things happen.  But if that was their policy, it should go both ways.  So when I came in for the rescheduled appointment and asked them how were going to pay me the $40 fee.  They looked really confused and I had to point out their policy that was prominently posted on their wall and remind them that they had canceled my appointment with only 1 hour notice. The receptionist finally told me that they would have to ask the office manager about it and they would get back to me later.  \n\nStrangely enough, they never did get back to me.",

Think about David Brent in The Office.  \n\nA quick anecdote - A now-retired manager, who was universally despised and ridiculed, often told me how wonderful he was and how much his team respected him.  I knew that he was a tosser but it was easier just to nod and smile whenever he started speaking to me and to look for my escape.  Eventually, two members of his team made accusations of bullying against him. When he sat down with the investigating officer, he immediately started babbling on about how he would be happy to give evidence against some unrelated party who was misbehaving.  The investigating officer had to stop him in his tracks and explain that he was the one who was being accused by his team members.

And respect is so easy to give, if anything, he goes out of his way to disrespect everyone. So strange, I'll never understand.",

            "I used to work in the public service and we had a policy that declared all sick/medical leave as an unplanned absence. Even if you gave two month\u2019s notice for elective surgery, it was unplanned leave. Even the initial leave for a birth was \u201cunplanned\u201d.\n\nManagers were marked down if they had a lot of unplanned leave in their staff because it was lumped in with people taking sickies and this was seen as poor management.\n\nIt was eventually changed, but some policies are just dumb.",
            "First time I've ever seen a boss tell an employee that they had to become full time. Most places try to keep their workers from even thinking the phrase much less saying it. I know it was mostly to get a rise out if OP but still could you imagine how it could be played out: \"Hey OP I can't keep you as part time so I'm making you full time.\" \"So you're gonna pay me more in hours/pay raise that normally attributes a status change and pay me overtime when you come to me for the extra work that's great! And when will my full time benefits go in?\" \"....nevermind\"",

            "You should have said sure, but I am going to have to give the company a warning for not giving me 48 hours notice and that after 4 warnings in 6 months that you would quit.  See if they like their own policy in reverse.",

            "power struggle much?\n\nif this was a bloke, I'd say \"pissing match\".\n\nthing is, with her backing down so you can stay on your current schedule, she has implicitly admitted that *you* have the power in the situation. If there *really* was a (new?) policy that you could not remain part-time, then she would accepted your \"last day\", and that would have been the end of it.\n\nI will say though, while you now have the power, your manager is going to go to extreme lengths to get rid of you - either by several more write-ups to terminate, or making you so uncomfortable as to quit.\n\nAnd 'tardies'? what the hey? are you in school?",
            "You should be a socialist. Seriously.  What you describe is their beliefs. Please read their ideology.  It contains such appalling ideas as universal healthcare.  For free. Like every other western country except the US. Weird thing is our healthcare is cheaper than yours (don't yanks love cheap) but better and for everyone.  For  Free. We pay a bit of tax.  You don't but your healthcare, not that it covers the poor ( those poor folk who wash your car, tend your garden, look after your CHILDREN)  You know those people you think you own because Americans love slaves. Literally or economically.  \n\n\n\n\nIf you are a Republican then hahahahahahaha  ha ha ha ha. \nIf you can find Donald's dick,  here is a microscope, ha ha ha.",

            "I used to work at a 24/7 operation. You could do staff exchanges to get days off which is often the only way to get time off. I was scheduled for a double one Saturday. Friday night my toddler was up all night throwing up. I called in and said that I would miss the first half of my first shift so that I could get some sleep. The overnight supervisor even heard my little girl. When I get to work I was surprised that they would not sign my sick slip but that it would be considered an unpaid and unexcused tardy.\n\nSo much for being a team player. Never again.",
            "Scheduling is difficult. Don\u2019t get me wrong.  But sometimes you just have to work through it.  People need to handle their affairs  and it\u2019s not worth fighting people over it.  Migraines are one of those things that will sideline you from anywhere between an hour to a whole day, or longer.  Prodrome symptoms, in my experience have been mainly hindsight, and do not give warning \n\nI have only had to turn down time off when it was really, particularly unreasonable.  And even then I tried to be flexible and ask them which days they need off the most and which days they can do a half day, etc.  I know it may not be popular to say that around here but 99% of the time you can honor time off, but there will always be a 1% where you just can\u2019t",
            "What kind of stupidity is that? Telling someone who knows better that they can't remain at the position of their choice because YOU say otherwise? Like they get to dictate whether or not you stay in your position regardless of your opinions like you're some 16 year old that brainwashes themselves into thinking that they HAVE to do it."
