        "selftext": "A long time ago I worked at a company that gave me a retirement account through Fidelity. I eventually changed jobs to a different company that provided a retirement account through another provider. So I call up Fidelity to roll my old account funds into my new one.  Fidelity can do that for me, but there is a $50 account closing fee. Why do they have an account closing fee? Because fuck me. That's why. I tried to be clever and say leave $1 in the account, but they require a $50 minimum in case you do want to close at a later date. Cue malicious compliance. Ok, roll over all my funds except for $50. Keep the account open. Send me quarterly updates on my $50. Invest it. Make it grow.\n\nI now have a tradition, once a year I call Fidelity to transfer over all but $50 of my account balance, usually just a check for a few $. By this point, I've cost them way more than $50 of service, postage, and checks they mail to me, but I still have a few decades to retirement. Let's see how much I can cost them before they give me my $50. I'll go to my grave with that account still open if it means Fidelity never gets the account closing fee. Why? Because fuck them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I have a pretty embarrassing update. I called up Fidelity this morning after this post blew up to see if I could get them to waive the closing fee. Turns out they got rid of the closing fee years ago! I never bothered to ask about it after that initial call with them. THAT is how malicious I am with my compliance! I've been needlessly fucking with them for no reason. Anyway, the guy asked if I wanted to close my account. I told him nah. I'm in too deep. Let it ride!",

When I moved to Canada I told my bank I'd no longer need the account but there was going to be a $50 fee to permanently close it. I thought \"well what's stopping me from withdrawing all but a few pennies?\" And the answer? Absolutely nothing! I've had 13 cents in that account for almost 5 years now, they send me an email summary every single month with zero activity on it. I just delete it and move on lmaooo",

            "Reminds me of my first bank account. My mom opened it for me at Wells Fargo for my 12th or 13th birthday and put $100 in. I eventually spent $60-70 and for some reason my card was declined the next time I tried to purchase something. Went to the bank to find out why. Turns out my money was in a \"$35+ account\" and since I had a buck or two less than that they had to charge me $5 to move it to a smaller account. Unfortunately, that account was a $30+ account, and after the $5 moving charge I didn't have $30 in the account. So they helped me out and moved my money into a $25+ account. Whoops! I didn't have that after the $5 moving charge fee! Gotta go smaller! It only costs $5! They did that till I had only a couple dollars left. Fuck banks.",

After a few weeks here I was able to get settled in, get a permanent address in the area, and open a new account here.

It is a little old and the appliances are a bit dated, but it was much cheaper than a two bedroom apartment downtown and I move around every couple of years for work.\n\nMy landlord lives out of state and doesn't have anyone local, so for the past year and a half I haven't talked to anyone.  Just pay my rent on time and keep doing my thing.  About 4 months ago plumbing issues started popping up and two major appliances decided to give up the ghost.  I notified my landlord via email and written letter (I rent a lot and have learned to abide by the exact wording in a lease).  After several follow up emails and phone calls a local handy man showed up to look at everything and provide a quote.  \n\nAfter receiving the quote for parts plus labor the landlord told me flat out that they will not be paying for the repairs. They said that since I am an engineer, they would  *allow* me to purchase parts, install them and then deduct the cost of the repairs from my rent payment.  They said it was either this or \"learn to make do\".  I was not super thrilled at this response.\n\nI replied back to them saying if they were willing to deduct *__my time__ and cost of the parts* from my rent that I would get started immediately, thank you very much!   They were thrilled to hear it and asked me to send receipts for their records when everything is finished.  Great!  Now to put together all the pieces and get to work.\n\nThe first step was to file for an LLC with my current state.  Next, I set up some cameras and borrowed a GoPro from one of my hiking mates.  I was able to document all the repair process, from me watching YouTube videos of how to do things to me making multiple runs to the part store to get that piece I didn't know I needed.  Here is the kicker. At my day job I make over $50 dollars an hour, that is what my time is valued at.\n\nThe final bill for everything has worked out to be a about 12% higher than the quoted cost and the landlord is very upset, but my lawyer added to the email chain has kept them very civil.",

            "I was leasing a house through the HUD/Section 8 program. In the middle of January we had a heavy snow that completely covered the outside lot with ice. When it thawed a few days later, the runoff water worked its way through the outside wall and completely flooded the ground floor. We discovered this when we got up in the morning and had the carpet squish under our feet.\n\nThe landlord was slow to respond, and by the time he started doing anything about it, everything downstairs smelled moldy. An inspector arrived and declared the site unlivable -- and the Section 8 office sent a letter that said that they were no longer eligible to receive rent as of the day of the snowstorm, retroactively until it was fixed. Also that if it weren't fixed in a certain time (I think 90 days), that the lease was effectively terminated and we'd be fast-tracked to get a new place to live.\n\nThe landlord was not cooperative at all. First, he simply assumed I was available at all times to help him work on cleaning up all the moldy carpet and patch up the walls and such. Every day, he would tell me \"I'll be in tomorrow at 7 AM sharp, be ready\" but never actually arrive until at least 10 AM, some days as late as 4 PM.\n\nOn the 1st of February, he turned up at the door, ready to collect the rent. I was ready. I showed him my copy of the letter that explained he couldn't collect rent any more, then followed that with an itemized list of every single day's schedule -- starting from the time he said to be ready to work, ending at the time he finally left. Accounting for overtime after 8 hours each day, and after the 40-hour mark overall, and at minimum wage, he owed *me* money.\n\nHe threw the list back in my face and stormed off, screaming obscenities. The next day, he showed up with another document, turned to the last page and asking for a signature. I flipped right to the front page, and there was this long tirade about how everyone was unfair to him, everyone siding against him, how he even had to work on the place on his birthday (never mind that *mine* was in that time-frame too), and ended with an \"agreement\" to pay the rent and promise to do everything he said from then on.\n\nI told him, \"I can't sign this.\" He said I \"don't have to\" as if it were a subpoena. So I took a copy to the Section 8 office so they'd know what sort of attitude he was presenting, to find out they got a copy themselves that morning and had been passing it around to laugh at.",

            "The only time I've lived in a rented house I had a clueless landlord.  It was a house of uni students, with each outgoing tenant being removed from the lease when they left, and their replacement added.  Simple, no problem, this had been going on for more than a decade.  It was a bit run down, but the rent was cheap so nobody minded.\n\nA nominally identical property next door (also a rental) came up for sale, and our landlord decided to buy it.  Discovered that they were paying double the rent we were.  So up went our rent.\n\nDifference was that the other place was really nicely maintained, everything worked.  If you expect us to pay full market rate, we expect full market value.\n\nOur landlord had to replace:\n\n* the hot water service,\n* heater,\n* aircon,\n* dishwasher,\n* stove, and\n* ALL the piping in the house (that list may not be complete either -- it's been many years and I may have forgotten something).\n\nThe new aircon also required a significant rewire of the house.  Cost him an absolute fortune.  Then, for the first time ever ALL of the tenants moved out at the same time.  This wasn't petty malice or because of what the landlord had done.  We simply all moved for various reasons.  So we just let the lease expire.  And because the lease had been \"continuous\" (albeit with many people rotating on and off it over the years), it meant he couldn't bill us extra for wear and tear.  So he had to spend even more money replacing the carpet and painting the place (neither of which had been done during the \\~13 years of this lease) before he could get new tenants.\n\nIt would have been a long time before he reached \"Step 4: Profit!\" again.",

And anyone who's cooked a turkey knows that without brining or other treatment that sucker gets drier than the Sahara.\n\nSo I did my best using a low sodium broth and unseasoned butter instead of actual brine. It was...ok. But nowhere near as good as my previous turkeys. \n\nAs I'm preparing this and generally fighting the urge to give her a piece of my mind she goes on about how they eat a rotisserie chicken once a week or so. A rotisserie chicken prepared at the grocery store with more sodium in one wing than I use on the whole turkey. \n\nSo because I'm petty I mentioned surprise that she gave that to him to eat because of the high salt content.

            "when i was with my ex-fiancee we used to always have family dinner at our house on holidays . Her mother and father were often invited as well as both her grandmothers and sometime her sister in law . As her parents didn't live far from us they occasionally came by for non holidays dinners as well . \n\nHer mother is a stay at home wife . She has never had a job in her life . My fianc\u00e9e was an only child and she moved out when she was 18 ( when we were dating she was in her 30's) Her mother has no circle of friends . I give her credit for working out daily at home and staying in great shape . Neither her mother and father had cell phones and there home phone was only turned for 3 hours on Saturday . So aside from working out her mothers only daily activities are watching tv. \n\nWhen i first met them her mother made a few playful (?) jibes at me . As time went on it got worse and worse. Especially when it was just the 4 of us at dinner . From the onset i decided to always be respectful of her parents , at any cost . As the years went on my fianc\u00e9e began joining in with her on needling me and their visit's became a night mare for me of constant needling and minor jibes . I never returned the criticism . My fianc\u00e9e had told me that growing up her father had had a very bad temper . I never saw this in him . Although he was far from a gregarious person but talkative and polite . One thanksgiving dinner her grandmothers couldn't come and her children's were at their fathers . so i knew it would just be the 4 of us . I hope it wouldn't be like so many other dinners . It started as soon as her mother walked in the house with \" oh i see its casual dress\". i had just been working on my motorcycle out back and it was still a few hours before dinner . i hadn't changed yet .and it just kept going downhill from there . I don't remember the specifics of it but at one point were sitting in the living room watching tv and they were both digging on me incessantly . i was paying with My dog with its famoviriet squeaky toy . My gog loved the very soft rubber squeeky toys . she would squeek them for hours . The hard plastic ones she would chew up in a day , but the soft ones lasted till we replaced them because they got filthy or the squeeker fell out and she lost interest.  Her mother considered herself an expert on most things from watchign oprah and other talk shows all day for years . this was usually her fuel for most of her jibes and critismism . she was talkign abotu somethign Dr Phil said and i said that Dr phil often exagerated things for better tv viewing . my fiancee snapped back with \"oh what would would you know about psychology ?\" ( although i didnt finish college , psychology was my major). in frustrated i tossed the squeeky toy at her . If i had thrown it as hard as i could i couldnt possible have hur5t her , but i didnt , i tossed it . it boumced off her head with a barely audible squeek . Her Dad gave a slight chuckle , btu she got this look of horror on her face and screamed \" did you just throw that at me ?\" . Before i could even respond her father said in a very angry tone \" OH please ! your lucky thats all he did . youve been a complete Bitch all night  . \" \n\nside note . i have never hit a woman in my life . Im not capable of it . The few times i had ever been angryu enough to want to , my muscles lock up and i cant even move . My fianceeon the other hand had ATTEMPTED to attack me before and i just stood there . She was 5'3\" and weighed 110# i was 6' and weighted 250#. The only time i even made any attempted to defend myself was when she swung a baseball bat at me . I cought it ,yanked it out of her hands and tossed it on the couch .\n\nSo now her father is yellign at her because she is makign a huge deal out of me tossign a dog squeeky toy at her after putting up  with her and her mothers taunts all evening . Her mother looks at me and says . \"well ! those of low character always seem to resort to violence\". at this point her father turns beet red , stands up looiking at her mother and throws an arm out towards the front yard . \"THATS IT . GET THE FUCK IN THE CAR !\" she stands up and sheepishly begins to make some kind of defensse. He cuts her off \" BULLSHIT ! They open there house and hospitality to us and all you can do is sit there and pick on him . Well if you cant keep A civil tounge in your mouth we just wont go ANYWHERE . \" She begins walkimg out and at one point appears as though she wants to stop to say goodbye and he screams \"OUT!\" . as he walks out the front doro i say \" sorry for ruining dinner . \" he responds , calmly \" you did nothign wrong  , I AM sorry you have had to put up with this every time we coem over \"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nafter they left my faincee started to apolagise and i just raised my hand  and walked out . after i had a nice ride on my boke for an hour or so i came home . nothign was ever said about it and 2 years later when he next had her parents over her mother ,although not exactly friendly refrained from any negative comments to me .\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsorry so long i am overly verbose",

Wild horses will travel miles to find mineral deposits that include salt, because their diet doesn't contain any. (for domesticated horses it's added to feed and some hay these days, but some horses still need salt or mineral blocks they can lick at). \n\nIn colonial times the British government would ban some colonies (well, the foreign populations in those colonies) from making their own salt as owning salt production gave them immense power. India is perhaps the best known example as one of Ghandi's rebellions was to walk to the coast and make salt by evaporating the water off of seawater. \n\nIt's added to so much food these days we hardly need think about making sure we get our full intake (rather we worry about having too much). Then about 20 yrs ago I moved abroad to a country that didn't have much in the way of pre-prepared food, and was also a very hot, causing me to sweat more than usual, and sweat contains salt. After a week or two I became salt deficient and for the first time in my life, I began adding salt to my meals.

Surprisingly some fast food has relatively low sodium . Like a MCDonnalds filet-o-fish has less than 600 mg. So she could have one for a meal and cook a low sodium meal at home and be ok. Sodium makes your body retain water. If you work out and sweat then sodium should not be a problem. But if you don\u2019t work out the extra water retention with high sodium in diet can cause organs to labor too hard and over years takes a toll.

I got schnapps for Pop's, and Lou just did the Dew cuase it was the hardest stuff his religion allowed.\n\nThe point is I spent quite a bit of time collecting bottles. The guy scans them all in I have him take one out cause I went over and plop down the $280. He then told me they had a policy not to accept bills over $20. I left him to put all those bottles back, literally went across the street to a different liquor store without even moving my car so I could load it up with booze in front of this idiot's security camera who came up with that policy.",

        "selftext": "I was talking to some friends from undergrad and this story from my freshman year came up again. Having recently stumbled upon this subreddit (from r/StoriesAboutKevin, weirdly), I think this might belong?\n\nSecond semester of my freshman year, I was taking a music theory course. The professor was very serious about her job and this class was a bit of a weed-out class for students who wanted to pursue Music Education (I was taking it for fun). By the time the end of the semester rolled around, I got the feeling she didn't really like me much because I didn't pay attention in class but still got As on the homework/exams/playing tests (I'd played piano for a decade by this point), so she couldn't really punish me for anything since I wasn't disrupting the class, but was just a thorn in her side through lack of participation (thank god that wasn't part of our grade). Our final project was to find a poem we liked and craft a song using the poem as the lyrics. As she passes out the requirement sheet, she announced that she would be playing these for the class, so we need to put in effort so that we don't feel embarrassed by what she plays in front of everyone (about 30 people). She shoots a glance at me--the least involved student--as she says that, which I took as a challenge. I found a poem called [\"A Minor Bird\"](https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/a-minor-bird/) and decided to craft my masterpiece in the key of E-flat minor. The reasoning: 6 of the 7 notes are lowered a half-step. So it's not a matter of thinking \"everything I see is lowered,\" it's \"everything but one note is lowered,\" which is fairly hard to keep track of while sight-reading something that utilizes both hands on the piano (we were to hand them in at the beginning of class and she would go through the stack and play them, without practicing first. It's a freshman-level class. How hard could it be?)\n\nI spent weeks working on this because I wanted to make sure it was both well-written *and* an absolute bitch to play. I had upperclassmen take a look at it to make sure everything was labeled correctly, and they told me I was the most magnificent bastard ever because this prof had irked most of the students in the department who had taken her class.\n\nThen the day comes. We all turn our papers in, and I'm visibly excited by everything. The prof comes in, and goes full Dolores Umbridge--\"I certainly hope everyone met the requirements and put care into their work. If not, we'll soon find out!\"--goes to the piano and pulls the first paper off of the stack, and makes some comments about it that aren't negative but are a bit goading, regarding the amount of effort it seemed to take to write it. She (apparently) pulls mine up about 2/3 of the way, sits down to play it, and stops at the first chord. She looks around, makes eye contact with me and straight-up *glares* before regaining her composure and plunking through my piece. There's several chords that make a nice crunch before she corrects herself (that damn NOT-flat note tripped her up every time), and it sounds like whoever wrote this piece did a shit job because of how it sounded. At the end, the meek international student--who has Perfect Pitch--raises her hand, and goes \"Excuse me, Dr. <Music Instructor>? That piece just played... it has 6 flats in the key, yes?\" Prof: \"Yes, it did. I didn't quite expect that\" Student: \"You..didn't play all 6 flats, it didn't sound.\" Prof turns, glares at me, and goes \"no, no I did not\"\n\nGot a 97% because she marked a chord label incorrect. Went back in and showed her that she missed the not-flat note in the chord, and that it was actually labeled correctly; got it changed to a 100%.\n\ntl;dr Music professor 'threatened' to play our pieces in front of us so we would work harder on it. I wrote something she couldn't play.\n\n\nEdit: I have the music, played by Finale NotePad, and have made an account just to upload it here: [Enjoy!](https://clyp.it/ehzbip53) Unfortunately, I have no idea where the sheet music is at this point. That class was Spring '09, and I've had a lot of life happen since then.\n\nEdit 2: The sheet music is definitely not on my current computer. The mp3 source also says it was created via Melody Assistant, not Finale, in case anyone cares *that* much. The best I can provide for \"pics or it didn't happen\" is [this](https://imgur.com/X697fUt), which is just the text of the poem in a word document with the date. Nothing too exciting. I'm going to see if my parents can find my old laptop at their house, and I'll search for the sheet music on there, and I'll share it with everyone who has asked (both publicly and privately) for a copy of it!\n\nEdit 2.5: With my new job in \u201cthe real world,\u201d I haven\u2019t had vacation time to go back to visit my parents to find said sheet music. I\u2019ve had quite a few people message me/comment to ask for it, so I\u2019m sorry to disappoint still. There have been a few other people in the comments who posted a link to their reverse-sheet music creations, and they look to be pretty close (the beginning starts with a pickup note on Beat 4, so that throws a lot of the computer-created versions off). I\u2019ll post comments from the people who messaged me theirs, as well, because this post is about to be archived and I won\u2019t be back home before then ",

            "I also took a music theory class in high school as a kinda \"fuck-off\" class, as I had been told by people that it was an easy A and a fun class to take. Unfortunately, there was a new teacher that year that took it very seriously. He wasn't a terrible guy, he just didn't seem to realize that half the class was not trained to even so much as read sheet music and had taken the class for the same reasons I did. I was one of several class clowns that took it at the same time. There were some great moments in that class such as when I was asked a question I had no clue what the answer was to so I just said \"I don't know, but I'd like to point out that I've been here half a semester and haven't heard a single theory about music.\" Or when a friend was talking to somebody else while the teacher was speaking so he called on him to make him shut up. The kid looked up and without missing a beat said \"I'm sorry, I was lost in your eyes.\" The teacher couldn't help but laugh and say \"Ok, well pay attention.\" But the best time was when that same kid was called on for the 3rd time in a day and was fed up. He said something like \"I don't have a clue. Nobody in this class does but Nina. (Nina was the conductor in the school band.) I haven't gotten anything better than a D on any paper in this class all year. I have barely learned to read sheet music, let alone play off of it or write it. Nobody in the class seems to know either and we are all just accepting that we're going to have to deal with failing the course because you're light years ahead of us in what you're teaching at this point. I really wish a counselor or somebody would have told me that i had no business attempting to take this course, but nobody did, So stop calling on me or wondering why I'm not paying attention.\"\n\nThe teacher asked if everybody felt that way and we all said that about summed it up.\n\nLike I said though, the teacher was cool. He said \"well, i wish somebody would have said something sooner and without being so dramatic. Everybody hand your books up here. I don't have enough time left in the semester to really help you guys much. So whoever at least shows up can get a C. Anybody who wasn't lost at this point can come meet in the other room every day with me. The rest of you can do whatever you want as long as you keep it down.\"\n\nWe brought in movies and ordered pizza almost every day for the next month until the semester ended.",

They have the dumbest rules and don\u2019t give two shits about the people they are scheduling. They only care that they get scheduled. Everything else is on us. If they give us a hundred people all at different places at 9am, well, fuck us. We are penalized for sending trips back if we are too full, so there is a strong incentive to take people late than to send it back to someone else with more room. It\u2019s all a rates game.\n\nAlso mine is in the state of Illinois. They\u2019ll pay us 150+ dead miles to take someone from their house one mile down the road instead of sending them a normal taxi or Uber. Basically paying several hundred dollars on a trip where the budget should be less than $15. It\u2019s unbelieable the waste and attitude.\n\nMy boss is a douchecanoe too. She\u2019s basically the reason I\u2019m quitting. I\u2019ve asked and begged for help in that office but no fuck me. They\u2019re in for some shit when I leave because she still doesn\u2019t know how to do the schedule or some of the rest of my job and she hasn\u2019t started me training anyone else to do it either.

It was privately owned, and the VPs had all put in a portion of their own money to start the company.  By this time in the story, they were finally making a respectable 30-40 million a year in profits.  \n\nBut they still acted like a small company.  Penny pinching.\n\nOur engineering department was designing circuit boards with embedded computer systems.  And to program these, instead of soldering the microcomputer to the board, we would solder on a microcontroller socket, and then plug in an \"In Circuit Emulator\" that would *pretend* it was a microcontroller, and allow the programmer to create the required program.\n\nThis In Circuit Emulator, or ICE, was made by Hitachi.  It plugged into a free PCI slot on your PC, and had a ribbon cable that would attach to the specialized microcontroller die that plugged into the socket.\n\nIt was a mess.  It gave our tiny IT department headaches.  And it cost $15,000.  And it was an absolute necessity for most of our most popular product lines.  And there was only one of them.\n\nAnd we were renting it.  It cost $4,000 a month. \n\nThe first month we had it, our CTO and Marketing VP planned our whole new product line around this family of microcontrollers.\n\nSo, at the end of the month, us engineers ask management to buy this for us.  Since we would be using it for a while.\n\nThe Engineering VP saw the price tag, and told us to just rent it.  Surely we would be done with it soon.  Engineers, being practical, forgot about the objection and just put our noses to the wheel.\n\nThe CTO and Marketing made plans to keep us busy using this microcontroller line for a while.  They pre-ordered a few million chips.  \n\nAfter a year, the VP of Finance asked about this recurring contract line item.  They called the engineer who had originally started the contract.  The engineer helpfully forwarded the approval from the Engineering VP, and his later email asking to buy it, and the VP's reply where he demurred.\n\nBy the end of the week, this toy was ours.  Along with a second one, since finance determined that product rollout was being affected by not enough access to the equipment.  \n\nHitachi just gave us the first one.  Stopped charging us, and never asked for it back.  We paid $15,000 for a second one.\n\nNo one got fired or demoted.  But at the next department meeting, the Engineering VP tried to tell us that we didn't have enough money to upgrade our PCs.  That one engineer spoke up, \"Would $40 thousand cover it?\"\n\nThe company found the money.",

So you ended up with the same construct as before, but in a datacenter of someone else with five times the cost (or more; depending on who managed your own data center and what these people are doing now).",

The higher the Opex costs, the higher the budgets given as a baseline before hearing business cases for additional spend.

I didn\u2019t have a single issue with management until seven months into my employment when a male manager joined the team. He was a bit of a misogynist. He would make backhanded comments about women, and he only had issues with the female staff. He wrote me up for some ridiculous reasons, one being opening the dock door \u201ctoo hard\u201d, when it was a heavy steel door that you had to put some muscle into to open. He fired another lady who was pregnant for asking to be put in a section closest to the kitchen. She filed a lawsuit and won too. \n\nOne day, I walked into work. He pulled me into the office immediately and presented me with a write up slip. It was because I was not wearing a belt. The dress code stated \u201cIF pants have belt loops, a belt must be worn\u201d. Okay, my uniform that day didn\u2019t comply with the dress code. The issue was that I hadn\u2019t worn a belt in 7 months while he and the other managers never mentioned it. In my opinion, the appropriate thing to say would\u2019ve been \u201chey, I see you haven\u2019t been wearing a belt and we haven\u2019t been enforcing it. Dress code says you must wear a belt if you have belt loops. I\u2019ll give you (x amount of days) to purchase one before I start enforcing\u201d. I just got a straight write up. \n\nSo I went home and cut off all the belt loops off all of my work pants. \n\nThe next day, immediately upon walking in, he asked where my belt was. I pointed to my pants and said \u201cwhere are my belt loops?\u201d  The employee handbook stated \u201cIF there are belt loops\u201d but I no longer had belt loops. \n\nLet\u2019s just say it didn\u2019t make him like me any more, but I felt like a hero standing up to him in such a petty manner.",

            "Good job OP!  My all male high school had a business/professional dresscode and it was the early 90s so there were a LOT of options as far as color, style, fit, etc  I got a detention for not \"wearing a belt\" but my dress pants had a built in belt made of the same fabric as the pants.   The disciplinarian wouldnt budge because the dress code said  belt had to be leather.... so off to detention I went.  Que me thinking of how to maliciously comply...and my grandfather was a master tailor who would do anything for me.   I went to Big and Tall clearance section and bought the UGLIEST, loudest, and biggest rayon shirt and pants I could find.  My grandfather darted the shirt in as many places as he could. He took in the pants so much the pockets touched the center back seam, put 3\" cuffs on them, pleats on the back, and tapered the ankles to 8\" with a HUGE break.  When he was done, he had me try it on and gave me an ORANGE leather belt to go with them.  I cant even begin to tell you how many neon colors were on the shirt, pants were a muted olive green, orange belt, hideous multicolored argyle socks, white patent leather slip on dress shoes, and since it was winter, I paired it with a 70s chocolate brown pleather trenchcoat.   I went to school strutting like a peacock.  Disciplinarian takes one look at me and tells me to get in his office.  While in his office, he asks me if I think the dress code is a joke.  To which I tell him, absolutely not, i dont want to get in more trouble for violating it which is why I'm in dress code.   He looks like hes about to flip his shit when he realizes, because he knows the book like the back of his hand, that the dress code says \" all clothes must be properly fitting/tailored, dress pants or khaki style pants, shirts can be long sleeve or short with a collar, dress socks to be work at all times, dress shoes or boat shoes, and a leather belt must always be worn\" Theres more, but it applies to turtlenecks, jackets, blazers, and sweaters.   Hes looking at me with his eyes twitching  and asks me if I know how ridiculous I look.  I told him that I think I look awesome and I have a well tailored/fitting outfit, with a leather belt, dress socks and shoes.  He says, but you dont come close to matching.  I ask him where it says we have to match in the dresscode....he tells me to get the fuck out of his sight...lmao",

She tried to say that it was inappropriate. I told her to tell my manager that. When she did that in front of me, I asked if he was really complaining about a black belt with glitter or was he just checking out my ass. \n\nGuess who never had that boss mention my belt again, EVER. Bossman knew what was up as I'd mentioned the assault and he didn't like that she was trying to manage his people when hers were so faulty.

He pointed to my cartilage and said I wasn't allowed to wear it. I argued that it wasn't against policy and made him go get a copy of the handbook from the office. Policy was one earring per ear but it didn't say that it had to be in the ear lobe. He had to begrudgingly let me keep it in.",

Then suddenly we got a new manager and he started enforcing the dress code requiring a a shirt Tha buttoned up.\n\nI ignored it and I got written up and when I said \"I've been working here for months and nobody said anything\" he told me they were going to start enforcing the dress code. The next day I went to Hot Topic and bought a shirt that was buttoned up, had the playboy logo on the front and said \"talent photographer\" or something like that. He saw I was wearing a button up shirt and didn't say anything for a few shifts.\n\nThen he called me into his office and said my shirt wasn't appropriate, and I had to take it off. I told him it was a button up shirt and conformed to the rules. He said it was pornagraphic because it had the playboy bunny on the front. We argued back and forth a bit and finally he asked me if I had a shirt on underneath. I happened to be wearing a Korn t-shirt underneath with some creepy dolls on it. He sighed and said I could wear that the rest of the day, but had to buy an \"appropriate\" shirt or I'd be fired.\n\nLuckily it was close to Halloween, so I went back to Hot Topic and found a shirt, that buttoned up, which had \"patient# 13857\" on the front and said \"state mental institution\" on the back and bought it.\n\nThe next day my boss said had the day off, so I showed another supervisor that had been at the previous meeting my shirt and he said it was appropriate and laughed. I wore the shirt for a few days and then my boss called me into his office again.\n\nThis time head of HR was there. I knew it was the end, but I didn't care. I was tired of that job and my boss's micromanagement. They came up with some cock and bull story about me \"misleading a customer\" and fired me. I asked if they would let me listen to the recording of that call and they said \"maybe later, buy now we have to escort you out of the building\".

            "Similar experience.  Worked at a pizza place and the owners took a vacation to Greece.  My BFF at the time was left in charge while their youngest bone head sun would pop by as he ran a tanning salon next door.  It was the middle of the summer and again it was a pizza place so it got hot as balls in the back during the day.  I came in one day wearing a fitted t-shirt with the sleeves cut off, bought it that way & a 1 inch split in the middle of the front. It revealed absolutely nothing and the girls were no where in sight. Son walks in makes a face and then asks to talk to me in the back.  Proceeds to tell me my shirt is inappropriate, something to be worn to the club not work. I respond I don't go to the Hoeplex.  I'm more of a Strand girl. (Popular clubs in a nearby city) I then tell him I'll take his opinion into consideration.  \n\nI go home that night walk into my younger brother's room and ask to borrow his new green shirt.  At first he told me no but when I told him what happened at work and my plan he was all for it.  I show up the next day in jeans and my brother's shirt.  I hurry up to get inside and then stalk the front counter waiting for Sonny boy to walk in.  See he would alway come to the front counter first so he could flirt with one of my coworkers.  Soon as he comes in I make my way slowly to the front.  Morning Sonny! *extra obnoxiously* How are you?! He grumbles something and then I watch him look at my shirt.  He is reading it \"Make 7\"... ,Time to check the dough. I spin around to head to the back now. Slowly of course. Baby steps as I head in the back now. Wait for it... audible groan as he reads the back \"Up yours.\"   Mission accomplished!!!!\n\nLater on in the day he came up to me and said well played. Which was the cherry on top for me!",
            "I worked at a call center and we weren't allowed to wear t-shirts unless we wore a jacket or another shirt over them. I worked there for a little over 7 years and it was a constant battle with management because I prefer t-shirts and they didn't pay me enough money to invest in plain shirts just for work. At first it was no problem for me to walk out onto the call floor and put my stuff in my bay, and then go to the bathroom to put on a cover up shirt or a light jacket. Later I was told not to do that and to go to the bathroom and change first before coming onto the floor, and eventually told not to even enter the building unless my t-shirt was completely covered.\n\nOne day as I was preparing to log in and start working, the center director saw me and asked why I had a jacket on as if he hadn't been the one to tell me to wear one. I told him it was covering my t-shirt just as he'd told me to do and it was zipped up just like he'd said I had to do. He walked away looking pissed off. The next day we had basically the same conversation. He asked me why I insisted on wearing t-shirts and I told him I didn't make enough money to afford a separate wardrobe for work. He started to walk off and then halfway across the room turned and yelled at me. \"I want you to go out and buy a shirt with a collar and I better see you wearing it from now on!\" It was extremely embarrassing. \n\nI got even, tho. I went to a few thrift stores looking for the ugliest shirt  - with a collar - that I could find. For $2 I bought what had to be the brightest, ugliest Hawaiian style shirt ever made. Bright blue, pink, and purple, and there was a zebra on it. Possibly the most hideous shirt of all time. It was lightweight and covered my t-shirts perfectly. And I wore it EVERYDAY for nearly 2 years. I kept it in my car and washed it on weekends. He fumed and I'd see him looking at me like he wished I'd dissappear, but he couldn't say anything. He said buy a shirt with a collar and I did. \"A\" as in one.",
            "This reminds me of when I was in high school. We had a dress code and I started getting written up for dress code violation. It started with detentions, then 1 day suspensions, then 3 days, then 5 days. Each time I'd come back to school I'd be told not to come in the next day because I got written up again. \n\nI would repeatedly ask what the dress code violation was, and no one seemed to know. Finally they told me to go to my science teacher and ask her, because she was the only one writing me up. I asked, and she said, \"it's a dress code violation. Figure it out.\" \n\nFinally after coming back from another 5 day suspension and failing all my classes, I went to my science teacher and begged her, crying, to tell me what the violation was. I told her I was failing all my classes and no one could tell me the violation and I was gonna have to repeat the 10th grade. She finally told me, \"your pants have belt loops, you need to wear a belt.\"\n\nI grabbed masking tape, wrapped it around my waist through my belt loops, and said \"is a tape belt okay??\" She told me \"well it just has to be a belt, the rules don't say what the belt needs to be made of.\"\n\nNever got written up again.",

But he probably told her something along the lines that I wanted her to finish my sandwich.",

            "My response to that as a man to a couple of creepy regs- you know the type, you can smell the swinger oozing out of their pores-  was to paraphrase and act out the movie Cabin Boy at them.  \"I know I'm not as pretty as her, but this is how a Harem Girl dances... UH! HUH! HMMMPH! UH! Ok. Now that the sexy is out of the way, what are you drinking?\" Really shut them up and made my attractive coworker's night.\n\nHere's the scene for anybody wondering what my seductive dance looked like.[https://youtu.be/hGltKJdG1s0](https://youtu.be/hGltKJdG1s0)",
            "I wanna hear how he reacted to being refused all night. Did he get angry? Did you point out his request? I want more info!",
            "He deserved no service at all.",
            "Oh man working in the service industry you always find old creeps like that.\nNo self awareness either, they don't seem to realize how pathetic they sound or that these girls don't actually want to talk to them. Maybe that's the point though,  to force an attractive woman to give them attention. Guys like this are just an embarrassment",
            "He wouldn't have been nice to your colleague anyways, so a big win for everyone.",
            "As a bartender, I dealt with shit like all the time. Pro tip: if you\u2019re at a busy bar/club and can see that the bar is full of other people trying to get drinks and bartenders running around trying to make them, don\u2019t wave your god damn hands at the bartender. They see you. You aren\u2019t invisible. But it\u2019s the most surefire way to make us act like you ARE invisible. Wave your hands at me and I\u2019m deliberately picking the person behind you first.",
            "I wanna know how mad he got",
            "It'd of been hilarious if it was last call and he missed his chance to get a drink..",
            "Back in my barman days for a few glorious months one summer (I was 18 at the time) we had Wet T-Shirt competitions on a Tuesday night as well as two guest bar staff.... who would work topless (they were female)\n\nSo there\u2019s me, 18 years old, working behind the bar with two topless women, needless to say not many people wanted me to serve them.",
            "Play stupid games win stupid prizes the bar game",
            "I was expecting a different ending, but that works just as well.",
            "I\u2019m the complete opposite. If there\u2019s a pretty girl, I try not to talk to her cause I get all tongue tied. Then I come off as rude because I\u2019m avoiding eye contact",
            "He should have gone to the other side of the bar where she's serving.",
            "I love this. Truly justice was served",
            "Boooom!",
            "I want to be friends",
            "Definitely thought this was gonna be a dnd story when I opened the thread.",

            "\u201cBe careful of what you wish for\u201d seems like a proper quote here.",
            "Nice!",

            "Hopefully he\u2019s no bricks here, only soup.\u201d",
