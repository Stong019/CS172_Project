        "selftext": "The \"5 minute early\" post reminded me of a story that happened to a friend of mine, let's call him \"Bobby\".  \n\nBobby was a CNC machinist, a good one, and the only one. The company he worked for made an intricate product, and his CNC part was crucial. The rest of the product bolted on to it. The finished product sold for tens of thousand of dollars.  \n\nIt took 3 hours to make this piece. Bobby would make 3 a day, he'd make one in the morning, take his coffee break, then make another, and take his lunch break. That ate up about 6.75 hours. He'd stay late to make the third part, and make 2 hours OT.  \n\nHis new foreman turned out to be more than a bit of a jerk. He'd try to get Bobby to do other tasks, and Bobby said no, as he needed to monitor the CNC machine during all stages of the cycle. Foreman bitched to the Plant Manager, who told him to back off and leave Bobby alone.  \n\nOne day there was a bad snowstorm, and Bobby was 10 minutes late. The Foreman was there to greet him at the time clock, with a shit-eating grin on his face, holding a Demerit Slip. Bobby had clocked in a minute late the previous week, and the Union rules said that if you were late twice within 14 days you got 20 demerit points.  \n\nBobby and Foreman got into a bit of an animated conversation, and the Union Steward came over and said that Bobby had no choice but to take the demerit hit.  \n\nSo Bobby went to work. His shift was 8am to 4:30pm, but he usually stayed until 6:30 to finish the last part. Not today. At 4:30 he shut the machine down and headed for the door.  \n\nThe next morning, Foreman comes over and says that the assembly team is short a part.  \n\n\"Yeah, I know. I'm working on it right now. It'll be done in 2 hours.\"  \n\n\"But they need 3 a day. Why didn't you make 3 of them yesterday?\"  \n\n\"Because my shift is over at 4:30, and I went home.\"  \n\n\"What? You stay every night until the third part is finished.\"  \n\nBobby pulled the Demerit Slip out of his shirt pocket, looked Foreman in the eye, and said, \"Not any more.\" Bobby had done the math. Every week, instead of getting 15 parts, they were getting 10 or 11.\n\nForeman tried to sweep it under the rug, but within a few days chaos ensued. The assemblers had no core part, and their team went to the Plant Manager to let him know that production was falling. They assemblers liked it....they got to hang around yakking while they waited for the next CNC part to arrive.  \n\nEventually, there was a meeting with Plant Manager, Foreman, Union Steward, and Bobby. Foreman tried to throw Bobby under the bus saying that he refused overtime. Union Steward pointed out that, as per the contract, mandatory overtime was only in case of emergencies, and this wasn't an emergency. Bobby had every right to decline the OT.  \n\nForeman lost his temper, started yelling at Bobby and Union Steward, and was asked to leave the meeting. Plant Manager knew he was screwed, and looked at Bobby and asked, \"What's it going to take to get you to work the overtime?\"  \n\nBobby smiled, and replied, \"As long as Foreman is my supervisor, I won't be working a minute of OT.\"  \n\nAnd that was the last anyone saw Foreman.  \n\nBy sticking to the contract, Bobby cost the company a handful of parts worth many thousands of dollars, and put the company into a position where their lowered production would cost them even more...in perpetuity. Bobby worked a couple of Saturdays to catch up, and made double-time for those shifts.  \n\nThey hired a new Foreman, who was explicitly instructed, \"Do not, under any circumstances, fuck with Bobby.\"",

        "selftext": "I moved to a new state to take a high school teaching job in a rural town. I liked my fellow teachers and almost all my students, but this was a small town with the usual assortment of outsized attitudes. One student was particularly lazy. Her parents both worked in the small school district (admin at the HS, teacher at the MS). She rarely turned anything in on time, and what was turned in was generally rushed or incomplete as if she'd gotten the instructions secondhand. Somehow, though, she had straight As in all of her classes.\n\nI quickly figured out why. When she turned in another late, incomplete assignment, and I very generously gave it a D, her overall grade in class dropped to a B. I was called in the next day to a meeting with the principal and both of her parents who immediately complained I was being unfair and capricious with my grades. They accused me of not giving students the instructions, so I showed them the instruction paper which I passed out and went over in class. They accused me of not giving her specifically a copy, but I remember handing it to her and I told them why: she was making out with her boyfriend when I was trying to go over the instructions. (They didn't like hearing that part lol) They accused me of not being clear with the deadline, but it was the second line of the directions. They accused me of not fairly grading her work, but when I showed them her work, they clearly hadn't seen it before and wondered whether I'd gotten assignments mixed up before I showed them her name on it.\n\nThe principal asked me to change the grade in the gradebook. I asked about whether she'd have to redo the assignment first, but that was declined by her parents. I understand why my principal caved - it wasn't worth trying to fight two employees in a small, rural district already struggling to recruit people.\n\nSo I went back to my classroom and changed every students' grade to a 100 in the gradebook. No special treatment. Even the ones who hadn't turned in a single thing got a perfect score.\n\nThe Fallout:\n\nMany students asked me why their grade changed, but I never addressed it. I would just brush them off by saying not to worry about it, though clearly rumors were spreading like wildfire in the small school, because even the secretary and the principal asked me about it later on. I only said that yes, I changed her grade. The principal looked like he wanted to ask me about why I changed all the grades, but he just shrugged and walked away. He never interfered in my grade book after that. The student's parents transferred her out of my class and her boyfriend also transfered a day later (no more PDAs in my class, finally, so no complaints).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I'm trying not to let internet strangers hurt my feelings, but a lot of comments are hung up on the idea of \"Why are you letting them make out in class, you're a bad teacher!\" lol\n\nTo be clear (to be cleeeeeeeeeear\\~\\~\\~), I tried all the usual stuff before they transfered out (it was an elective class, so it was possible): asked them nicely to stop, kept them after class and explained why it was inappropriate to make out in class, wrote them up with official reprimands in the school discipline system, made jokes in class to embarrass them into stopping, and eventually sent them to the principal's office - but guess who worked in the principal's office and would run interference?",

            "I adjuncted at a college for a while and was teaching a research method classs (major required, nearly universally despised). Grading was \n\n30% exams \n\n40% for the various homework\n\n20% final paper (most of the homework was sections of the paper that I gave comments on to make the final better)\n\n 10% attendance.\n\nHad a student who mostly attended class and did amazingly well on the tests.  But that's it.  None of the paper sections or other homework. Gave the whole class an extension on the final paper to the last day of finals.  She turned the final paper in the day after I'd submitted grades to the university (which was after they sent the threatening email about late submission).\n\nMonths later I'm getting calls from her parents and my former department chair.  They beg me to grade her paper since it was \"turned in.\" So I did. It was terrible.  So she failed it too.\n\nMore calls and the chair asks me if another colleague in the department could grade her paper and they'd average them as a \"fair\" method since I must be biased. There was a pretty detailed rubric and it was hard to mess up things like \"no spelling errors\" but fine,  I don't care. \n\nThat person gave her a 98.5, which was the exact number the student needed to earn to not fail. At this point I didn't care,  but when they called me asking to teach it again I told them off for having no integrity at all.",

            "I was teaching English at a two-year Catholic college, one of my students was a girl who never turned in anything and when finals rolled around, complained to her dad that I was somehow unfairly imposing these Draconian requirements on his little princess. Dad went absolutely batshit, left this long message for the English Department where he tore into me, up and down and sideways. I explained to the Department Head and the Dean of Students that she had not handed in a single assignment, that she hadn't taken a single test and that requiring all students to take the final was obviously not my personal vendetta against her. I failed her, but I also never worked there again. It's a hard call sometimes, I wonder if I should have been less idealistic and lived to teach another day.",

But they ask me to take over a Spanish class (don\u2019t speak the language) but tell me not to worry because I just have to proctor a test.  First clue that this whole class is sketchy (Spanish teacher had a rep as being a very easy class)- as soon as I tell them they are taking a test they all start moving their desks close to their neighbor.  Like full on scraping/scooting the chair two feet to the left or right, whichever way their cheat buddy lives. Everything was so sketchy, all of the movement and fidgeting throughout the test. Not anything like the same grade French class tests.  Then I catch a boy who is supposed to be a good student looking down at the floor where his book has been placed as instructed, but the book is open.   I\u2019m like, what are you doing!?  He says he has dropped his pencil accidentally into the open spine of his book and is just fishing it out.  I tell him, go see the headmaster.  Later the headmaster talks to me and tells me that this boy comes from a good family and is an A student so no way he can be cheating.

I finished the semester gave everyone As and tendered my resignation. The pay was crap and I didn\u2019t need the job but I enjoyed the students. I was pretty much doing the university a favor because they needed someone to teach that class (statistics for business) and they didn\u2019t have anyone so I said sure why not.

            "I was teaching a 9th grade class in a very small town (pop. 900) in the heart of the Rocky Mountains and gave an assignment to write a paper describing a thermos bottle and use the words conduction, convection, and radiation to show me how it works.\n\nI had one Special Needs student in the class who turned in her paper on time and all done. Upon reading it, I see her use the terms \"black body radiation\" and \"thermal emissivity rate\". I was pretty sure she had no idea what those terms meant so I asked her to redo the paper - not all of it, just the part with the terms - and demonstrate what they meant OR leave out that paragraph all together.\n\nGot a phone call the next morning from her mom, shrieking at me.

            "How times have changed. I was not a very diligent student but went to a good private school in a wealthy area. After I had f'ed around on a big assignment and was in danger of getting a failing grade the teacher called my parents to let them know and enlist them in \"fixing\" the situation (i.e. getting me to finish the work and the teacher would pretend it was on time). After the teacher explained the problem, she said something along the lines of \"So, what should we do about this...\" and my Mom replied, \"Fail her.\" The teacher was gobsmacked, mentioned what it would do to my grade and GPA etc. My mom was all \"So what.\" As far as she was concerned, if I did the crime, I did the time. She wasn't about to rescue me. Pretty sure that was the only time the teacher ever heard that.\n\nedit to ad a missing word because I still don't pay attention.",
            "I've done this! I had a student go to the department head, claiming I had favorites and graded everyone else too harshly. It was a whole ordeal. All for what would have been, at best, 1 pt to her overall grade. \n\nThe department head sided with me, however my supervisor decided to grade the largest assignment herself and said she would have had it +7pts instead of what I assigned it. She even admitted she was biased due to the students complaint. Ended up telling me to add 7pts to that assignment for the student. I said I'll be adding it to all 60 of my students. Because if I was truly a tough grader, all students must have been suffered. And if my boss pushed for me to only add it to that one student, she was forcing me to concede that I grade unfairly. \n\nI had a good chuckle that when it kind of got out, the self proclaimed favorite student said he would have gone to the head and showed her his grades (solid C+ student) in order to defend my honor.",

            "I had a professor once who told this story at the start of every year in his class (or atleast he said he did I only took the class once)\n\nNow he was a big professor. Been there decades, tenure, leader in his field, etc.. He was known to be a good teacher and if you put in effort it was easy to get good grades which is why I took this class. His syllabus had been refined over many years so there was really no way around any of his rules and everything was submitted online.\n\nSo one year at the end of the semester he gets a call from parents basically yelling at him because their kid was failing the class. The parents were freaking out blaming him and making every excuse for their child. He basically says I don\u2019t care and hangs up. They go above his head to the department chair and make some SERIOUS accusations with absolutly no foundation. I\u2019m talking favoritism, that he tried to sleep with the student and she said no, that he faked his credentials, just about everything you can think of. The chair obviously knows him and doesn\u2019t believe the parents but talks to him about it anyways and now the professor is pissed off. \n\nThe only reason the student even had a chance at passing the class was because they had done really well on the papers. So now he regrades everything. Not much changed with all of the work not turned in and bad attendance grades, but he looked closely at the papers and did those online checks for plagiarism. Turns out she used one of those online things like fiver to PAY someone to do her paper for her and the person she paid had used the same paper for a different student at a different university a year or two ago. Put in the other paper and this one has three matches ranging from almost exactly the same to paragraphs copied and pasted but some changed. \n\nAs I said he was very talented and basically wrote a scientific god damn paper that coulda been peer reviewed. He showed us pictures of it and there were footnotes, diagrams, statistics on the likelihood of this happening, way too much effort. Apparently the student had also signed something at the start of the year to allow her parents to see her grades and such (every student has the option for this I personally didn\u2019t do it but this student did)\n\nHe sent the dean, the department chair, the student, the parents, and the office of academic integrity all a lengthy email with attendance records, images and accounts showing not turned in work, work she did turn in that was horrible with an explanation for each section of the rubric she missed points on, and to finish it all off his research paper on how she definently chested on the papers. He went on to explain how this meant that she would now be charged with plagiarism and have to defend herself against the \u201chonor court\u201d at the school. If she was found guilty she would be kicked out of school and likely never be able to get another scholarship again. Yah she was very quickly found guilty lol\n\nThis is second hand from a couple years ago but I remember it pretty well and I\u2019m pretty sure all of these details are correct but god damn was it hilarious and he said he hasn\u2019t been contacted by a parent since then",

I am protected because I am the DH, and the conversation is hearsay.\n\nI changed the grades.

        "selftext": "I used to work as an administrator in a secondary school in the US (Grades 9-12) around 10 years ago. We were a school that didn\u2019t have a specific \u201czone\u201d or neighborhood, so to speak. Some of our students lived 30 or 45 minutes from the school, which made it necessary for us to sometimes conduct business with parents or guardians over the phone as opposed to in person.\n\nOne day I met with a Senior (Grade 12) who was in a class that he and his father had deemed too hard for him, and since they didn\u2019t want it impacting his ability to attend college, asked for him to be changed out of the class. It was early in the semester, and there was plenty of space available in other courses, so I had no problem doing it after a conversation over the phone with his father. The student was a good guy, and he was totally grateful to me for helping him out. He would now get to enjoy his last year a little more, with one less difficult class to worry about. \n\nThe next day, I get a phone call in my office from mom, who is irate. She spends approximately five minutes berating me about changing his schedule. I indicated to her that dad was on the contact list for her son, and he was allowed to make these decisions if he chose to do so. She is the person who put dad on there several years before.\n\nEvidently, mom put dad on the list before their divorce. She had raised the child over the last several years by herself (according to her), and she should make all of the decisions. I didn\u2019t know this, and the records didn\u2019t reflect it. Since she knew this argument wasn\u2019t going to work, the next objection was against our policy of making decisions over the phone. The conversation went something like this:\n\nMom: \u201cHow do you know for sure it was his dad on the phone? There\u2019s no way you can be sure. I can\u2019t believe you would ever make a decision like this without a parent present. By doing business over the phone, you could be speaking to anyone.\u201d\n\nShe continued on and I tried to explain that it is necessary at times to use the phone, since parents work in another town and may have to travel an hour or more to get to the school. Well, she wasn\u2019t buying it.\n\nSo finally, I relented. \u201cMa\u2019am, you are right. I will no longer make decisions like this over the phone. I am going to insist parents come in and meet with me in person.\u201d\n\nMom: \u201cGood. Now I need my son to be put back into the class he was in originally.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cMa\u2019am, I\u2019m sorry. You are going to have to come in and meet with me. I\u2019m no longer changing schedules over the phone. How do I know you are this student\u2019s mother?\u201d\n\nMom: \u201cI can\u2019t do that. I live 45 minutes from the school, and I work every day.\u201d\n\nIt was at this point she dropped all of her objections.\n",

Essentially, all phone contact from the school went to him. I still got all the folder contact, but anything serious enough for a phone call... straight to him. I didn't find out until my daughter's speech therapist noticed it on her file when trying to schedule her therapy for the year.

It\u2019s all about identification and it\u2019s the biggest problem we have. People will walk in expecting to check out a child, eat lunch with them, change their transportation, and they will have absolutely no ID on them. And they\u2019ll insist that they are a student\u2019s guardian as if that would prove anything. It may be true but we have no way to check and even if you are, how do we know you\u2019re allowed to pick them up if there\u2019s court docs on their profile? \n\nParents will get upset and start giving us sob stories about how they\u2019re in a financial bind, live on the other side of the city yada yada yada can\u2019t you just make an exception?

We tell them we can\u2019t accept that info over the phone since we can\u2019t confirm they\u2019re the guardian. We compromise by accepting a faxed note with a copy of their ID.

        "selftext": "Here's a simple and fun husband and wife MC from yesterday for you. On mobile, tldr etc.\n\nMy wonderful family of four are on a trip to visit family and friends. Four years ago, on a trip with the same itinerary as this one, I (husband) booked our hotel as I usually do. I am what you would describe as \"thrifty,\" and I don't like spending a ton on hotels when we are basically just sleeping there.\n\nThe hotel I booked for this leg of the journey was probably not the most high class and sure...it was not in the safest area of town. This was definitely a hotel where some acts of questionable legality and morality occur. In my defense, it was a VERY last minute booking as we were supposed to be staying with family and there were very few options available under $150 a night.\n\nThe stay there ended up being fine but it has been a long running joke between us for the past four years.\n\nWe are now visiting for the first time in four years. I went to book the hotel, and my wife said \"No way! It's my hometown, and I am doing it this time.\" So, she pulls up Ye Olde Priceline and starts looking at places...specifically looking for a place with a pool for the littles. She looks at one, reads the reviews and details, and says it looks good...especially for the lower price! She even calls to make sure the pool is open because of Covid. I look at the photos, and look back at her thinking she was making a joke. She was not. I just smiled and said \"whatever you think, babe!\"\n\nYep, you know what's coming. \n\nAs we approach the hotel, I see a look of confusion slowly wash over her face. She says \"Wait, is this...\" and trails off. I reply with a resounding \"Yep! It sure is!!!\"  She booked us in the exact same hotel that she has been griefing me about for four years. I laughed and laughed and laughed. She cannot believe she did it, and also thinks it is hilarious. I am vindicated!\n\nTLDR: wife gives me grief for four years for booking us at a shady hotel then proceeds to book us all herself at the same shady hotel.\n\nEDIT: thanks for all the comments and awards! Glad this could bring you so much joy. Just finally told her that I posted it and people are loving it, and she wanted to thank you all for helping me revel in my rare opportunity of getting one over on her...because that is a rare occurrence with us.

Not 50m away from the hotel a police stopped us and inquires what were we thinking of doing, we explained that we intended to eat somewhere close and if he could point us to any decent place. He shook his head and said \"Listen this is a rather dangerous zone so I suggest you go back to the hotel as every single place that you'd like to be in is most likely closed already.\"\n\nSo we sheepily got back to the hotel and ate whatever we had in had.\n\nA few nights after that I woke up in the middle of the night and while I was peeing from outside I could listen to something that went like this:  \n\n\n\"No Ramon, por favor\"  \n*Unilegible Ramon Response*  \n\"Basta Ramon no lo hago mas!\"  \n*Worrysome noises*\n\nWe had a lovely time there.",

Once every 4-6 months, they\u2019d have the big wigs come do a walk through. The big wigs usually tried to sort of \u2018catch\u2019 things by coming last minute, but we always knew at least a day or two ahead of time, and frequently we\u2019d get a week heads up. Whenever this happened, we\u2019d be told to wear slacks and button ups. I got to where I hated the place, so one time I just wore my usual cargo pants with a polo and sneakers, not in any way unsuited to the normal standard or job details. I had good hygiene and spent 8 hrs per day at a desk getting yelled at by customers that could only be described as scumbags, fuck being uncomfortable for 8 hrs just so that I could not even be looked at when 6 old white guys walked by me. \n\nWell, I got a very stern talking to as soon as I showed up to work, and they tried to send me home, but wouldn\u2019t you know it, the big wigs walked by right as this conversation was happening and my manager hushed. It was also insanely busy and I told her that if she wanted to send me home, it would take me close to 2 hours with traffic to make it back, and in reality I just wouldn\u2019t come back because what\u2019s the point in spending 3-4 hrs on the road to work 4-6 hours at a job that totally sucks.

            "This was one of the red flags that my Ex was a narcissist- we had spoken often about doing housework 'as equal partners' well before we were married.        I intended to keep my full-time job; in fact, I earned more than he, so chores were agreed upon to be split.\n\nSeven (7) months into the marriage and he decides he doesn't want to do his share anymore and gets violently angry that I expect him to take out the trash on his designated day.\n\nFollowing that, he argues that since he doesn't want to clean- 'I can't make him and if I want it clean, you'll have to do it yourself!'\n\nChallenge accepted - Malicious compliance activated.\n\n After announcing, \"Okay, I will!\"         Subsequently, I cleared the living room of his refuse; his jacket, his backpack and his shoes- SLAM I threw them into his den and onto his PC chair.        His dirty dishes and his dirty laundry?    BAM onto his PC chair.        He couldn't access his computer without picking up his shit on his chair.\n\nNaturally, he protested, and I replied, \"YOU wanted me to clean,  so this is how I'm going to do it!\"\n\nIt only took one more day of that type of 'housecleaning' and he started doing his chores.\n\nHowever, the marriage limped along a few years and he got his heart's desire when I was called up to military deployment and he had the house to himself- to clean or not to clean, as he saw fit.        Therefore, he did NONE of it.       I wasn't even there and the mess was all his, but he neglected ALL of it; then the Ex had the audacity to announce that, \"I've gotten used to you being gone, and I like it!\"        So, I came home to piles of trash; overflowing litter boxes and dead houseplants.        \n\nHis solution to the squalor was that ***I*** should do it all: the cooking, cleaning and working a full-time job, because I was 'a terrible person' and his sitting on the computer all day, was 'more important'.\n\nLong story short, which included DV; we divorced.

He went so far as to declare that I will be the one to clean out the bin, not him! I went off and stopped cleaning anything but the messes I make. I went so far as to get separate garbage bins just for me. \n\nDid he learn his lesson? Nope, he complained about how lazy I was and I don't pull my weight around the house.

            "I spent 4 years with my ex. Moved in with him at his mom's apartment about a year in (we were young) and they were messy, but I didn't mind. A year after that, we moved into his dad's house, as his health was declining and he needed help paying bills. I was taking care of the cleaning, as much as I could handle. His mom was by sometimes to help dad out (she was a caregiver and would help him for super cheap) and my friend lived with us for a few months. \n\nBut when it was just me and the ex, I was doing all the cooking, the cleaning, taking care of three animals (dog, cat & bearded dragon), and I was so drained. I dealt with it for months because his dad had passed, but it went from slightly messy, me spending all my money on bills/groceries for the FOUR of us, to the point that my depression was taking over my brain. I could barely handle any of it and I REPEATEDLY asked for help. The bare minimum of help, like dishes once or twice a week & taking the laundry baskets up/down the stairs (I did the actual laundry). \n\nHe stopped being home most of the time, instead stayed late at work (we work at same job, so he was definitely there) and hung out with his best friend for hours afterwards. I worked first shift, he worked second, and during the week the only time we saw each other awake was for 10 minutes after I clocked out and visited his dept. The weekends were spent with his other best friend (his wife and three kids). The guys would disappear in the car and I'd be stuck with the wife and kids. \n\nI hate to say it but I'd probably date him again despite it all. \ud83d\ude2d (He's currently engaged to the girl he started dating a few months after we broke up.)\n\n...

My highschool had a policy that anyone who has missed less than a certain number of school days could pick one class they had an A in to skip the final. You could get a couple extra days for college visits, but otherwise it was very straight forward. Awesome policy, and we all loved it.\nOne year, we had this kid who was in eighth grade and had been diagnosed with cancer. He spent allot of his year sick, getting treatment, going to the hospital, running to the bathroom to throw up, etc. Despite all this he finished the year with an A in his Spanish class. It was his only highschool class, so it was the only final he would have been able to skip.\nAdministration was not going to let him skip the final because he had missed too much school. He and his parents asked them to make an exception, given the situation, but administration wouldn't budge. His teacher stood up for him, but was told this kid had to take the final no matter what. He had missed too many days and there would be no exception.\nThe teacher said ok, but told her class not to study for, worry about, or exempt her final. Then, the first day all her students showed up for the final she told them to take out a piece of paper and number it 1-3 leaving one line in between each number. \nShe then asked three questions along the lines of, \"What is your name?\" \"How do you say yes in Spanish?\", and \"How do you say hello in Spanish?\" Then she collected the final. Everyone got an 100 that year, and she became a legend.\nThe kid has been cancer free for over five years now.",

            "I was taking culinary classes, and the administration at the community college said that every class needed a final.  This made sense for the lecture classes, but how are you going to give finals for a lab class?  One of my instructors took it literally (he was the head of the program, and his lab class was the first lab class you took), and we had both an oral and written final in his class.  God, that oral final...I could not remember the name for a slotted spoon.  Oh well.  One instructor took it to mean \"show me what you learned\" but that was baking class, so it was easy to show what we'd learned by baking a cake.\n\nThe other lab classes I took?  One of the tests was 10 questions, and our instructor had submitted our grades before we even took the final.  It had questions like \"What size is a quarter inch dice?\" and \"when are high heels appropriate kitchen shoes?\" and \"how many refrigerators are in our kitchen?\"   And it was multiple choice.  Another of the tests was 15 questions, and had questions like \"What color is the sky?\" and \"In which direction is the Pacific ocean?\"  Things that had absolutely nothing to do with cooking.  Not only that, but he wrote the points each item was worth on the test.  Up where it said \"Name\" it said (15 points).  All the other questions were 1 point each.

I was told that I had to give everyone a final exam, so I gave everyone a test a few weeks before school ended, and called it the 12 graders' final exam. I then told the rest of the class that if they showed up for my final, they *would not fail*. Don't show up, and the make-up exam will be much harder. \n\nDay of the final, I hit them with 9 questions like \"What color is George Washington's white horse?\" and \"Who's buried in Grant's Tomb?\"; that sort of thing. Question 10 was to give me a 100-word paragraph on something they learned that semester. (I did that partly because I wanted SOME part of the test to relate to the course, and partly because I ran out of too-obvious-answer questions.) The few students who took the make-up test got a genuine Technology final.",

On top of this already stupid idea, our school decided we also had to have finals. So after we finished our college level AP exam and our easy state standardized EOC exam, we walked into the room to take our final. Each person grabs a packet of papers for our exam and the instructions read: \"Please explain why 10 or the 23 AP United States History memes are funny.\" I asked our teacher afterwards if she was even planning on looking at them and she said \"Well I gave everyone a 100 when they walked in the door so no.\"",

He then said that the university doesn't specify what percentage of our final grade it would be.\n\nHe said that it was worth one-tenth of one percent of our grade.

I also made sure to inform as many employees to do the same.\n\nDidn't check your email while you were on shift because you were too busy trying to figure out what made grandma's ambulance ride to the doctor medically necessary? That's ok. Just check it when you get home. Make sure you put it on your timesheet, though!\n\nIt took a couple pay cycles, but eventually I get a call (on my day off), asking why I'm logging 1.75 hours on weeks that I didn't even work. I explained that I was just following their corporate directive. I was told at that point that I no longer was able to log those hours. I told them to give me that in writing as that goes against labor laws. Needless to say, the directive to check email every day got revoked.\n\nOh, but I did put down 30 minutes on my timesheet for the call as it took 22 minutes.\n\nEdit to say: Thank you everyone that's up voted and given awards. You guys are the true heroes!",

The grove has well spaced trees all in neat rows, the grass is mowed super short, the ground is really flat.  It looks like an ideal place to pull your rig if you don't know better.\n\nThe ground is so flat because they use mechanical harvesting.  Bumps and grooves can cause the machines to leave pecans laying on the ground.  A 2 inch deep groove from a big truck like that can hold thousands of dollars of pecans and will until it is fixed. Oh, and you have to get them up by hand.  It's a big deal when someone screws with your livelihood like that.  \n\nSo the guy parks there one time.  They get it, he probably doesn't understand he is causing so much trouble.  Dad goes down, explains the damage he has done, tells him the grove is private property and not to do it again.  Dude, we'll call him Dude, agrees, apologizes.  Dad goes home, fixes damage midweek.\n\nNext Friday there is the truck again, same spot.  Dad, not about to put up with this, calls the sherrif dept.  Cop comes, truck moves.  Dad fixes damage midweek.  Next week, no truck.  One week later, truck is back.  Repeat complaint for trespassing to sheriff.  Dude claims he forgot.  He drives over the road and his home depot where his car is parked is 30 miles away.  It is convenient for Dude to forget because he saves his gas and time by driving his employers rig and parking it on my parents land.  (Also, he doesn't get nailed if his cab isn't clean, no other driver gets assigned 'his' truck.  There are plain motivations.)  Dude clearly does not forget every time he is home but this is what he claims to the deputies sent out on the complaints.  After 7 times the sherrif department is called, he FINALLY gets a trespassing citation.  No fine is levied.  Drives his car two weeks in a row.  Following week, truck is back.  At this point my dad has fixed this damage so often he is keeping a tractor and blade on the property so it gets done faster and easier.  \n\nCalls the sherrif yet again.  The sheriff himself comes out this time.  Truck leaves, sheriff comes to see my dad.  Says the enforcement problem is that it is hard to explain to a court the harm when pictures hardly show any damage and Dude always apologizes and moves the truck when deputies come.  Says getting Dude for trespassing under those circumstances is going to be tough but he is on this and will see it through for my parents but his office us 30 miles away, not that many deputies to be out patrolling, etc.\n\nAnd then the sheriff, bless his little elected heart, says, \"But if there were something different like a theft of services going on...\"\n\nCue Malicious Compliance.  \n\nThe next day, signs go up on 80 trees in a row (8000 feet, they are 100 feet apart).  \"Semi parking.  $500/hour.  Prepay.  Violators will be towed.\"\n\nDude doesn't pay the signs any mind.  Dude does, however, pay the tow truck and deputy quite a bit of mind.  Comes running and screaming, waving his arms as they are hooking up.  \n\nWell, before my dad called to have him towed, everything was documented, including having the sheriff himself drive by and take several pictures of the truck parked with the clearly visible signs.\n\nEverything is put on hold while Dude's employer, who owns the truck drives out.  \n\nAfter 3 hours, Dude's boss gives up and writes a check for $7800 to cover parking and tow truck fees.   That actually covered the tow truck, all the repairs, printing the signs, and beer for about a year for my dad's Tuesday poker gathering.  Salut.\n\nDude, who still lives there, does not park in the pecan grove.  His boss payroll deducted his checks for 2 years.\n\nTLDR; trying to stop trespass parking is useless.  Charge for parking instead.\n\nEdited for typos and clarity.  Thanks for the upvotes.  \n\nYes, my dad IS awesome.",

            "As a truck driver, I get why we was wanting to do that. But also as a truck driver, I never park my truck anywhere without asking first. I've been turned down before without reason and that's fine. You just accept it and go somewhere else, even if it's a PITA, as it often is. It's part of the job.",

Kudos to the nice sheriff. \n\nI can\u2019t believe the driver, after ignoring your repeated warnings, didn\u2019t think anything of the sign. How could he be so dense as to not notice it\u2019s clearly for him? \n\nHe\u2019s either dense or incredibly entitled to assume he\u2019d keep getting away with it. So deserved it.",

            "For those who are curious, the reason the nuts are so impacted by the grooves is because, as OP said they mechanically harvest, they more than likely are using tree shakers and ground collectors in their orchard. \n\nBig machines clamp onto the trunk of the tree and shake until all nuts fall. Then a sort of spinning brushes which can then sweep into an above tank. So these spinning parts only affect a level ground and any outlying nuts are left behind",
            "That\u2019s awesome! \n\nThe only parking story I have is that my grandfather had throat cancer, causing him to have to use his finger on his throat to talk. So he rented a handicapped spot for many years before his death. I knew he parked there but never knew it was his- until I was willed his apartment and moved in. \n\nNow, my MIL is handicapped and cannot walk long distance or sit down for long periods of time due to a rod in her back. So, when my in-laws visited, they legally parked in the spot. The old man at the other end of the row claimed it was his spot. Except the city owns these lots. \n\nAfter some back and forth, the neighbor next door informed me that this guy literally removed my grandfather\u2019s sign and put it in his preferred spot. I never had a chance to do anything about it but waiting came with sweet revenge. He complained to the city whose response was to remove it since my grandfather was no longer paying. Lmao I still laugh every time I think about it! \n\nThe funniest part is the space we told him to use was further away from my apartment but actually closer to his! He complained about being out of breath yet every time my MIL left, he\u2019d come move his car...",
            "When I was about 18 living in rural Arkansas and no jobs around for miles. I and a few friends had the idea to go out to my family's land and hand pick pecans for the entire winter. \n\nThe land had about 13 large pecan trees that have been in our family since my grandparents planted them. And the pecans started dropping about November. Pecans were going about a $1.21 per pound. \n\nI and three of my guy friends started picking 100 to 200 lb a day, and each made between $50 and $70 a day picking pecans. We would pick for two to three hours then go sell the pecans and smoke the rest of the day away.\n\n Picking pecans was some of the best money that I've ever made in my life. And some good ass memories came out of that time, but picking pecans at that rate off of 13 trees is not really sustainable and it only lasted until January. But it was fun while it lasted.",
            "This is similar to what we (my family) had to do at the hunting camp we own in MI UP. My grandfather bought the property (120 acres) before the State turned the area into a State Forest Area and it\u2019s been in the family ever since.    \nAnyways, there is an area for 4 wheelers nearby, plus the roads and of course the private trails on our land.  We started having problems with people leaving their 4 wheelers out behind the camp building because they were too lazy to take them home and back.  Plus they were breaking into & using the camp building itself to cook, shower, toilet.  This all despite the \u201cNo Trespassing \u201c & \u201dPrivate Property\u201d signs around the whole place.    \nAt first we just attached notices to the vehicles (used those plastic paper holders meant for putting in 3 ring binders, note inside, sealed top with duct tape, zip tied to handle bar) telling the owners that it was private property and to remove vehicles from it.    \nThat didn\u2019t work, but we still have a lot of distant family in the area soooo\n\nNew notice informed that if we (or one of our agents) found their vehicle on our property we would assume it was abandoned and promptly remove it.  Then gave our distant family permission to check on the camp regularly and any 4 wheelers they might find were theirs to keep.  After about 6 weeks, there was no more problem.",

I know people aren't themselves when they're tired, but it's still kind of shocking he wouldn't be at least a little curious why the county is calling at that hour. ",
            "He probably thought it was a telemarketer. That's what he gets for being rude I guess..",
            "The sad part is that he might already have a bad day to begin with and had his sleep disturbed.\n\nAnd the next morning to find out HE WAS ROBBED BITCH!",
            "What was the malicious compliance?",
            "the amount of spam calls i get a week, at all hours, has gotten out of hand. I would have called him 1 more time. I could see the issue. It has become an obscene problem. You woke him up from sleep, if anything he is disoriented as well...",

            "Some people aren't really awake when they do this stuff. I've had small conversations with people who were just asleep that won't remember it at all in the morning. I would've probably called him back.",

            "Although the OP\u2019s story is extremely satisfying, I would get in trouble for doing my job this way. Every agency works differently though. And if the officers seemed okay with how things ended up, then that\u2019s a wrap. 10-8 CLR",

            "I work as an alarm agent that are the middle men for residents, companies and store owners with security systems that are monitored 24 hours for police/fire dispatch. \n\nI know to well this type of scenario and do not understand the attitude that comes from MOST of these people with alarm systems.\n\nWhen an alarm such as Burglary and Fire are activated, regardless of an actual or (most likely) false, as an alarm agent we have very specific procedures to follow with calling customers about active alarms, no matter what time in the morning or evening.\n\nThis mean the typical phone call for an alarm agent is meant with anger and disdain. \n\n\u201cWho are you and why are you calling!?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you understand what time it is?\u201d\n\nThe worst is when a subscriber of an alarm system calls me for information about their own security account and doesn\u2019t recall the password (that they set up) and gets furious when I can not give them the info due to their inability to remember their own password/code.\n\n\u201cI have never had a password for this account!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the owner, and I demand the information, NOW!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou called me and you\u2019re telling I need a password to get information from my own account!\u201d\n\n...and so on\n\nThen there are accounts when the first contact to call is police dispatch, which is fine since there is the symbiotic relationship between alarm agents and dispatchers. However, when a faulty alarm doesn\u2019t get rectified we have to keep calling dispatch as long as we\u2019re getting alarms and that can be VERY annoying on both parties. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling to dispatch on this burg alarm \u201c\n\n\u201cWe already canceled the dispatch and got a false alarm call for you guys\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s going off again  and the owner does not have proper code to the account to mark it false.\u201d\n\nWhat I have come to learn is that unless you\u2019re a business or own a business (small or big), and even then, security that is monitored 24 hours is more of a hassle for what it is worth.  Piece of mind is about calling 24 hours to make sure everything is okay. Crime is not adherent to the subscribers schedule, which mean calling about a faulty alarm at for in the morning and getting screamed at during the process.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "I worked for an alarm central station. The amount of times people got pissy when we called them bc their business was being robbed and the police required a key holder to respond was insane. So glad I'm not working there anymore.",
            "Fuckin right o fuck that dick ",
            "Lol, glad to hear about your excellent note taking skills! I too, am aiming for this position. I took the class and I am in the hiring process now....takes a long time! ",
            "Come on dude. You don't call someone at that time of the damn morning.",
            "He was too TIRED......\n\nCome on people, I didn't see this pun anywhere.   Get your damn act together."
