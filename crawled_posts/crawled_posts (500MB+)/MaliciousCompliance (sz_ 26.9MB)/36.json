        "selftext": "\nJust saw a similar story that reminded me of how I quit one of my first jobs .\n\n\n\nSo back when I was a teenager around 14 years old I worked for the shop down the road as their weekend \u201cbaker \u201c which was mainly just defrosting pre cooked items or browning pre cooked bread in the ovens . \n\n\n\nMy bosses daughter also worked there as a checkout staff , however she would just call in sick / hungover every weekend so of course her dad would let her off the hook and make me cover her shift , so I would work 5am to 7pm most weekends .\n\n\n\nAfter a couple years I decided I was quitting and gave them my 2 weeks notice. My boss asked me to stay an extra week to train the new weekend baker which I agreed to . At the end of the 3rd week I went into my bosses office and did the usual \u201c Well it\u2019s been great working with you \u201c to which he replies \u201c So OP the extra week you worked to train the new baker means you have been here two years , which means according to policy you need to work 4 weeks notice instead so I\u2019ll see you next week . Also you need to give us back your uniform on your last shift , and it needs to be freshly cleaned. \u201c \n\n\n\nBeing a petulant teenager who was tired of waking up at 4am I stared at him in disbelief for a couple of seconds waiting for the shit eating grin on his face to laugh and say \u201c just kidding have a good one \u201c . That moment didn\u2019t come . \n\n\n\nSo I walked out the office ,stripped down to my boxers , folded up my bakers whites , my trousers and even the little mesh fedora on top , walked into his office again and dropped the uniform on his desk and walked home. He followed me down stairs and through the shop shouting about how I would never work anywhere again . Thinking back that must have been a strange thing for customers to see .\n (it was a 10 minute home walk in the summer sun nothing arduous )\nApparently according who his daughter who got back in touch with me a couple years later I\u2019m now one of the stories my old boss tells people when he\u2019s had a few drinks (Not in a nice funny story way).\n\n\n\n* EDIT. - I live in England and yea it\u2019s illegal to make kids work 14 hour days but then it\u2019s also probably why retail shops love employing teenagers because they\u2019re just grateful for the money and don\u2019t really know their rights .\n\n\n\nAlso for those asking yes we did but not when I worked there so I don\u2019t know if that counts . I think I just have a bad habit of sleeping with people I have worked with or work with .Thankfully not anymore .\n\n*FINAL EDIT \n\nThanks everyone for the awards and stuff but also Thankyou more for all the amazing replies . Instead of replaying embarrassing things I\u2019ve said at work through out the day tonight in bed , I\u2019ll be thinking this memory through over and over with all your hilarious come backs, comments and revenge plans edited in .  \n\nThis was 15 years ago now and I live across the country with my amazing Wife living a humble but good life which I feel in itself is the ultimate moral victory .\n\nAlso the comment I made about showing dominance sounds very douchey now I read it back so getting rid of that .",

            "My first job was working at an A&W burger place. My manager was a total loser. He was hard on the guys and easy on the women, I think he thought they would be into him or something. He gave us lots of terrible jobs and would laugh at us while we did them. He would make a massive deal if you walked through the kitchen in your street clothes to get to the office/washroom to change into your uniform so you had to change before showing up. But then he\u2019d show up in his spandex after a long bike ride and go cook his own lunch and not pay. This was pre cell phones and I was up for my three month review. I had written down my schedule and was prepared to show up on Sunday for the meeting. I worked two jobs and while at my other job on Saturday I get a call from my dad saying my boss called and was angry that I missed my review and was going to write me up. I called my manager while on my break and he said he bumped my review up a day to see if I kept tabs on my schedule. This was the last straw and I was pissed so the next day during the lunch rush I walked in with my uniform rolled into a ball, asked for the manager and in front of all the customers threw it in his face and told him I can\u2019t work for a place that has the manager making food in his sweaty bike gear while sweating on the grill and walked out.

That weekend myself and some friend went to a strip club and had a dancer dress up in the company gear. Pictures were taken of her strutting on stage with a logoed shirt and hat and sent to the old boss. I never heard back. He might well be in the 'there is no bad advertising' camp.

I had a dispute with my manager about having December 31st off since it was one of two days a year I see my entire family. There was a non verbal agreement that if you worked Christmas you had 31st off and other way around. \nI was on the roster to work Christmas and was fine with that, I applied for the day of months in advance. New week rolls in and the new schedule got put up the week before Christmas and I see that I\u2019m working both Christmas and 31st, and another girl got the 31st off (changes were marked in red) this girl happened to be the girlfriend to one of the staff leads (like the one 26 year old that worked there for 11 years and didn\u2019t quit) and he got the day off too\nSo I walked up to the manager and told him about this and that I applied to have that day off months in advance, also reasoning why I had asked this(which he already knew) and I just got back a \u201cwe don\u2019t allow for days off on holidays, roster says you\u2019re working so you are coming in\u201d so I relied that I couldn\u2019t work and things had been arranged weeks before. \nHe wouldn\u2019t budge and even got a bit more sassy with me for not obeying his commands or whatever he got his panties up in a bunch over.. \nSo I quit on the spot, took my shirt off, handed him that and my company box cutter. Walked through the store to the lunch room, grabbed my other shirt from my locker, put on my own shirt, walked back to the manager and chucked him the other shirt and left. \n\nThis way I had both Christmas and 31st off and I felt a lot better about myself that day",

She finds all sorts of wild stuff, including drugs, drug paraphernalia, and occasionally hypodermic needles. There used to be a city task force that would come collect them, but it was discontinued. My friend would pick them up and dispose of them as safely as possible to reduce risk for park users. Eventually, she decided to ask the building manager (not her supervisor, but the person in charge of the facilities for the building she works out of) to install a sharps container in the bathroom (which park users have access to). He refused on the grounds that it would \"encourage drug use.\" Counter arguments to the point were unsuccessful, as was pointing out that NOT having a sharps container endangered her and the custodians who took out the trash.    \nSo, she started bringing the needles to him whenever she found one, and asking him to dispose of them.

Treat it as the disease it is; you have an outbreak - get health care workers there to help treat the disease.\n\nIf you don't have that level of control and can't get the government to act, you mitigate the harm to everyone else as best you can.\n\nThank you, OP, for dealing with this sensibly and directly.

            "Hi there! I\u2019m a Community Health worker and I primarily work with IV drug users and have lots of experience with harm reduction and needle disposal! **Here are some really important tips if you ever come across a needle:**\n\n- Never try to recap a needle that is not your own\n- If you see a syringe, assume that it still contains a needle\n- Assume that all needles are contaminated \n- If you get stuck (pricked) by a needle, call your doctor or go to urgent care ASAP. You will want to start preventive medication as soon as possible, because the sooner you start it the more effective it will be!\n- Never put a needle in the recycling or loose in a trash can, because someone else could get stuck by it\n\nAnd on that note, here is how to safely dispose of a needle:\n\n- Never pick up a needle with your bare hands, EVER! Also assume that any needle you see is contaminated.\n- Instead, pick up needles with a pair of tongs, you can get tongs that are specifically made for trash/litter pick up, but you can also use a normal pair of kitchen tongs just as well!\n- Before you pick up a needle, identify a container that you will put it into. A sharps container is best, but if you don\u2019t have one you can use another thick, heavy duty plastic container that can be capped. Something like an old laundry detergent bottle, NOT thin plastic like a milk jug. Never use a can, thin plastic that can be punctured, or a glass container (it could shatter)\n- Open up the container before you pick up the needle, and also it\u2019s best to label your DIY sharps container with something like \u201cneedles\u201d or \u201csharps do not recycle\u201d\n- Gently use the tongs to place the needle into the container. Place the needle with the sharp end facing down into the container first. Do NOT fill the container all the way, you don\u2019t want their to be any needles close to your hand when you screw the cap on\n- Tightly cap your container\n- Dispose of your container. In some states you can dispose of it in the trash (NOT recycling), but it\u2019s best to look this up first! If you can\u2019t dispose of it in the trash, you can see where your local sharps disposal program is",

The rental is in the back of a gated community on a mostly undeveloped street.  \n\nYesterday, I received a letter from the home owner's association informing me that I'm not in compliance of the \"strictly enforced by towing\" restriction stating that vehicles may not be parked on the street overnight.  In the letter was a picture of my project car (old BMW) parked beside our house on the street.  I decided to look up the HOA's restrictions (which I haven't seen before since I'm a renter) and discovered I'm living in HOA hell.  The street parking rule is just the beginning of a long list of restrictions including one warranting a hefty fine for \"leaving the garage door open when not in use\".  \n\nThis came as a huge surprise since several of my neighbors have parked their cars on the street without problem since I've lived here, so I assumed it was okay.  I can only imagine that they've singled me out because my car is 30 years old, however, in my defense, it's very presentable and by no means junky.  \n\nBeing singled out made me incredibly frustrated to the point where I started doing legal research.  It turns out my HOA has every right to tow my project car since it's parked on a private street in the neighborhood.  The good news for me is that the street just outside of the neighborhood is public, and it's 100% legal to park on it for any amount of time.  \n\nUnfortunately for the HOA, the closest section of public street to my rental house is right in front of their nice gated entrance.  Ironically, my old BMW has now become part of their image, and there's nothing they can do about it until I move out in a few months.  \n\n\nTL:DR: my new HOA threatened to tow my project car.

Technically, under the HOA agreement and county laws, our private road was supposed to become public and we weren't to pay for maintenance. I filled complaint after complaint - nothing was done. When I got a copy of the HOA's financials, I questioned them as to why the phone line (note: *ONE* phone line, for the gate's phone box that would call residents so you could press 9 and open the gate from your phone) cost *$4000* **PER MONTH**. I work IT in networking and was responsible for ordering telecom services for offices. Some offices, we had T1 lines which are 24 phone lines. A T1 line from the local telecom was $500 per month. The HOA said that's what it was and refused to provide me copies of the actual bill. So I filed a complaint with the state's AG office. The response I got? \"Fuck off\" (only in political language). We had a problem with non-residents using our pool from neighboring communities (because of the broken gates). A lot of us complained we couldn't use our pool that we were paying for. Instead of installing a lock on the pool gate we could open with our gate cards (RFID cards), they installed a $70 sign. Guess what? It didn't work because nothing was stopping non-residents from opening the fucking gate!\n\n**FUCK. HOAS.**\n\nEdit: Aww, did I hurt an HOA president's feelings?",

We did individual counseling, parent trainings, data analysis, etc. Think highly specialized mental care and support in home and community settings.  Anyway after two years of working there and getting another certification, I asked my boss for a raise. I was newly divorced and raising 3 kids, so I really needed the money. I had been working 10+ hours a week of overtime to stay afloat. My boss also knew about my situation. My evaluations were great and I had been told I would be moved up to supervisor soon, so my boss had to have known this conversation was coming. This man looked me dead in my eyes and said that he knew I wanted to make more money and my reviews were great, but he wanted to make sure I was \u201cloyal to the company mission\u201d.  He told me he can tell when people are \u201cjust looking to make more money. And we tell those people to go work somewhere else.\u201d  He wanted to make sure that the new supervisor would \u201cput the company mission and families they support first.\u201d He told me that he couldn\u2019t offer me a raise at that time but he would get back to me. No date was set for a follow up meeting or anything. \n\nI started applying for new jobs that day. Within two weeks I had found a new position making double the salary for only 40 hours of work a week. As it turns out, I was being severely underpaid (shocker I know).  The day I handed in my notice, my boss and the owner were in a meeting about my new position within the organization. Of course no one said anything to me about it beforehand. They sent me an offer, which I politely declined because it sucked. Then they tried to hire me on as a contractor at a rate that was at least 25% lower than every other contractor rate in the city for my position, so I turned that down too. My boss and the owner were both shocked that I rejected their offers, especially since they were willing to offer me \u201cso many perks,\u201d they were giving me the opportunity to \u201cbecome a leader in a great company\u201d and believed I was \u201ca great clinician\u201d who would do \u201cso many great things within their organization,\u201d etc. I reminded my boss that he is the one who told me to go work somewhere else and then I stopped responding to their messages.",

            "I worked for a company for three years. I got a decent raise each year and was generally happy. The owner sold out to a larger company and I did not get a raise for two years then they gave me a measly 25 cents and hour. I told them a dollar and hour would be a raise, the 25 cents didn't even keep up with the cost of living. They came back with that I was getting paid what the position was worth and I was \"topped out\". I started looking for a different job and found a job with a competitor for almost double the pay doing similar work. When I turned in my notice they were shocked I was leaving after everything they had done for me. I asked them to clarify that point and they told me they had given me a job and paid me! I reminded them that I did a job for them that created profits for the company so it seems to me it was mutually beneficial, but the pay sucked. Then they went on and told be I would lose my profit sharing, something like $3500. I let them know with the increase in pay I would have that covered in a couple months. The best part is they struggled to replace me. I had a couple friends that worked there and they told me all the time how much they missed me and the guys they hired  as replacements were worthless.",
            "I love how companies try to act like everyone\u2019s disposable until you hand in your notice then they scramble to give the measly raises and praise. The previous restaurant I used to break my back managing at refused to get me any type of raise until I threatened to quit (and a small one at that). The whole spiel of putting the company first is total BS.",
            "Good for you!\n\nUnderpaying staff is selfish, greedy, disrespectful and very telling of how much you value your people",
            "I got stuck in this situation once. Was told the same thing. It was at the start of the \"company year\" So I still had all of my annual leave. Within a week, I applied for a got accepted into an apprenticeship with a big company, who paid me more to train, than my current company paid me in a fairly high position after 5 years. I took my annual leave as my 4 weeks notice and left a few days later. They had to hire 2 new employees to do my job when I left and my manager had to step down to (attempt to) do my job, while they found someone/some people to do it.\n\nMy boss undervalued me because they didn't understand my role very well as it was \"out of their realm\". So when the new guys weren't instructed properly on how to do the job, the job didn't get done. People who depended on my role in that department got stressed and angry and others started to leave. The department/managers lost a load of respect for being mismanaged and it was slowly dissolved/merged into another department later down the line.",
            ">he wanted to make sure I was \u201cloyal to the company mission\u201d.\n\nLoyalty to a company is a joke, as you probably know. The minute you are no longer useful to them, they'll kick you to the curb. \n\n>My boss and the owner were both shocked that I rejected their offers, especially since they were willing to offer me \u201cso many perks,\u201d they were giving me the opportunity to \u201cbecome a leader in a great company\u201d and believed I was \u201ca great clinician\u201d who would do \u201cso many great things within their organization,\u201d\n\nI was told something similar when I handed in my resignation at my previous job. They weren't able to offer me any more money (I wouldn't have taken it anyway) but they said I had the opportunity to become a leader in that company. By that point I had worked for them for nearly 3 years, they were over an hour away from where I lived (although COVID meant we had been working from home for several months at that point),  in the last 6 months, my job role had completely changed (without a raise) and I was on my 3rd manager in as many months. In the year since I've left, nothing I've heard from my former colleagues has given me cause to regret my leaving.",
            "Very similar to what happened to me! I don\u2019t know why managers get so shocked when they don\u2019t feel the need to pay someone fairly. I was with the same team for over 10 years and kept bringing up the need for a raise as whenever someone let the team I would absorb their work but yet get paid at the very low end of the pay bracket. Also did manager level work with zero oversight yet still never get a raise besides the normal 2-3% yearly increase. They\u2019d always say \u201chonestly people only make more when they switch jobs\u201d \u201cif you want more you need to leave and go somewhere else\u201d \u201cit\u2019s just how it is, even I am not getting paid much for what I do\u201d. Still loved what I did so never left until I found out that someone who came in at my rank was earning the same amount as me. Yet I was handling 5x the work and I had over 10 years specialized job experience for this role. \n\nI applied elsewhere, got the job as well as a huge bump, along the lines of what I should have been paid. They were so angry telling me I should have told them I was applying elsewhere, I had broken their trust and they never ever told me to go elsewhere. That they were stunned and couldn\u2019t believe what I did to them.\n\nThey refused to let me go within the two weeks I wanted saying it would take at least two months to train multiple people to take over my responsibilities since my work would be broken up to 4 different team members. I fought back and it ended up agreeing to one month instead but it was a very tense and aggravating month where they refused to acknowledge my existence or talk to me out of anger.\n\n\nEDIT: adding a reply I wrote to clear up the confusion. \nTLDR (Is that the right acronym?) interviewed for diff position in the same company in the US so it\u2019s legal.\n\n\n\u201cSorry, I replied to OP then fell asleep. It\u2019s within the US but legal because I left a part out that it was within the same company but completely different department / location. They have no contact etc. We don\u2019t have transfers or anything. We have do interviews, negotiate salary etc, so everything like an outside hire if we move. I left it out because thought there\u2019d be a small chance someone would recognize the story but in hindsight I\u2019m being too paranoid.\n\nSo they made a big stink and went to HR when they were given my official two weeks notice saying it was impossible. Then it got heated between the VPs where the new VP said it\u2019s their fault they had zero backup for all my knowledge. I\u2019m usually anxious about big life changes so I\u2019m sure they thought I\u2019d never leave. Heard the CEO had to get involved and that\u2019s how the middle was agreed upon. It became a \u201cfamous\u201d work story that went through the gossip vine. \n\nAlso, we used to be a work family since we got along well and spent so much time together.  Over the decade they all left one by one for better opportunities until it was just me. I never would have wanted them to deal with taking up my work on their work. But the people who replaced them have no dedication or love for the job. They do the bare minimum and slack off most of the day. Figure it was time to take the leap and trained everyone as much as I could. I heard the managers had to do 85% of my work for a while because no one else could do it. I got emails well after a year into the new job on how to do the work from the employees and I took the time to answer them even though I was under no obligation to because I still felt bad (even though I shouldn\u2019t have). One good thing that came from it is I heard they\u2019re treating people better now!\u201d",
            "This just happened to me lol.\n\nHave been leading my team unofficially for about 6 months, so I asked for a raise to accomodate that, laid out everything I have been doing that is out of scope for my PD, and was promptly told that \"we don't need someone in that position\".\n\nSo I stopped doing all of it, and had another meeting with my bosses where I said I have found a new job, they've offered me equal salary to what I have here, but I need a change. If you can offer me that new position, I'll stay, if not, I'm going to have to leave. They said \"if you need to leave, then leave.\"\n\nSo, I handed in my notice the next day, and asked for 2 weeks off because I am dangerously close to burning out/have already burnt out. Said I would be willing to extend my notice period to account for this. Emailed to boss, boss's boss, and HR. Boss calls me next day and says \"HR have told me to tell you to take stress leave starting immediately\" and for me to \"get a doctor to sign off on if I'm okay to come back to work.\"\n\nWent to the doctor, was told I am not okay to go back to work, and handed boss my certificate from said doctor. I am now using up my sick leave (I have roughly 200 hours) that I would have had to otherwise forfeit (sick leave doesn't get paid out at the end of your employment here), and I get my annual leave paid out to me (currently at around 100 hours).\n\nIt's looking like I'm not going to be able to go back at all, meaning boss has lost his best employee, they're paying me for not being there, I'm getting paid my annual leave, and I get to start a new job.",
            "A few years ago I had a co-worker who quitted for a better paying job. Our boss called all of us individually and asked us if we would leave for a better paying job, I replied \"yes\" without hesitation so I was fired later that week for not being \"part of the family\" (so much for treating your family like that). By Friday I actually found a better paying job (working fewer hours as well).\n\nThe kicker is that a lawyer friend told me I had a very strong case to sue due to wrongful termination. We ended up settling out of court for about $12k",
            "Always always always check comparative salaries and have that on hand when negotiating your pay.\n\n\nMy boss at a previous employer confided in me that he made roughly the same pay because he did not negotiate because it sounded like a lot of money in Brazilian dollars and I asked for the median salary of a tech at my level of experience.   He had 10 years of experience on me.  Also I was hourly and he was salaried so I made more than him if I had to pick up extra time.   \n\nAfter learning what not to do I'veuse that to negotiate. The last 2 temp jobs I've had I got at least 7/hr more than the temp agency opened with.     \n\n\nAlways always always",
            "Wow this actually sounds like the ABA clinic I currently work for. There\u2019s a constant flow of new grads who are hired because the company can\u2019t keep people. After I obtained a certification to promote to a higher position I asked around with my coworkers to see how much they were making. It turned out some of them were making less than I started at with the company while holding a higher position. Afterwards I went to HR to discuss the pay raise that came with the higher position and I was told there was none.\n\nEvery Monday morning the company has a meeting to discuss the going\u2019s on with the company and to go over new protocols with clients. The Monday meeting we had after my talk with HR was instead used for the head of HR (which happens to be our only HR employee) to tell us how there\u2019s no pay raise. She proceeded to tell the employees that if we wanted more money to come to work as if we weren\u2019t already. Also there were a few employees that called out for family emergencies and everyone was told how family emergency\u2019s were not company emergencies and if someone wasn\u2019t in the hospital or dying to come to work. So I guess if an employee had a sick child to take care of then they\u2019re sol. After this meeting almost half the staff quit within a month causing us to become greatly understaffed.",

            "It still baffles me.

Now, I am the only person left in my timezone (where most of our customers are) doing this role. I approached HR for the third time about the long hours and lack of overtime or compensation. It is the third iteration of the HR office so each time, I have to explain everything from scratch and each time I get the whole 'thanks for your sacrifices','we are family', 'you are such a great contributor' schtick.\n\nNo shit, three or four times in the last meeting (I record every HR meeting) the guy mentioned how positions like mine, skills like mine are in high demand...

            "Something like this happened to me as well. We were told that there was no room in the budget for our salary and that it would affect our company's bottom line too much if we received raises. \n\nNo promotions, barely cost of living raises at 2%. I was a senior member on the team but was treated as lower while expecting to do more. A bunch of us were getting tired of it.\n\nSo I got another job and the pay increase was insane. The perks were WAY better and the company felt more like family than the previous one which was trying HARD to sell as family. \n\nSo 3 weeks later, I brought someone else from my previous company to my new company. She got a lofty pay raise as well. My old company started panicking because losing 2 vital people in a month was staggering. We were honest upon our exit interviews as to why we left.\n\nThen a third person came shortly after and the old management started panicking. They gave raises to everyone left and gave some promotions to some of the remaining members on the team. All in all, 5 of us ended up in my company and it's been 5 years. We're much happier and well, my old company apparently sort of learned the lesson of valuing their employees.",

I had to take a few hours here and there the first couple months to get my new license, set up car insurance, and get my marriage license. I also had to take time off twice because I got sick, after others went to the office sick (but didn't take time off because sick time came out of the 2 weeks PTO). I didn't feel bad about taking time off to do all that stuff because they said they were extremely understanding of that stuff. \n\nThey also told me that if I ever had any concerns about office culture to let my project manager know. Well the office culture was horribly toxic, which made it difficult for me to work there after hearing racist and political crap every day. \n\nSo I expressed some concerns and was told they were heard. A few days later I got pulled into a \"meeting\" to let me know it was my last day with the company because of \"breach of trust\" and I took too much time off.

            "I was taking a stupid online elective class the summer I got married.  When I signed up for the class, there was apparently a miscommunication between the instructor and the registrar about the date the class was to end, and the syllabus showed that the final exam would be a week later than originally listed - three days after my wedding, in the middle of my honeymoon.\n\nDrop/add for summer courses was something like three days, so by the time I knew this, it was too late to drop.  Still, it was just a Music Appreciation elective.  Surely the prof would understand and let me take the exam early.\n\nThat's a big nope.  I emailed him and asked, as courteously as possible, if I could take the exam four days early.  After the last class, but before my wedding.  To which he replied, \"No, sorry. Figure it out on your end.\"\n\nWhat \"my end?\"  My end is Jamaica.  Plane tickets are purchased and the wedding venue is booked.

        "selftext": "So, I work for a construction company as an inventory admin. My job is to basically schedule counts of our warehouse and input the numbers they give me for inventory. Then try to see what the problem is when the numbers on the last count and current count don\u2019t add up. There is a little bit more to it but I will not bore you with the specifics.\n\nThe problem with this job is that when you have been doing it long enough and are good at it, there is less work to do. In the beginning when counting one rack out of 60 racks of material would take a few days, it was fine because I was always busy. But now that everything is in order, the entire warehouse can be counted in 3 days. This leaves me bored for most of the time. So, to fix this I studied up on our cloud-based ERP service that we use for all internal and external transactions and have become sort of an expert on it. Every single aspect of this company uses this ERP service to do their job. Timesheets, HR, Payroll, Accounting, Scheduling, Management, Manufacturing, ordering from vendors, Delivering, Inventory, etc. all runs through this ERP service. So it is very important that this service is up and running perfectly 24/7.\n\nI became so proficient in this service, that our VP decided to cut ties with our consultants of the ERP because I could do what they did but better, quicker, and MUCH cheaper. For reference, we were paying these consultants $5,000 a month just to be on standby if we needed them for some sort of problem that could arise from using this ERP and had to dish out more money to fix those problems depending on how many hours of their time was spent to fix said problems. Not sure on their exact rate but it was something like $200 an hour and they took weeks to fix anything, while I could fix the problem in time for my daily afternoon shit break.\n\nI never got an official job title or raise of any kind for being an expert on this service. The company just saw me being able to do it and let me fix things that happened so they no longer needed the outside help. I wasn\u2019t to upset because it gave me something do so I was glad to help the company save money, even if none of that money fell my way.\n\nSkip ahead a few months. We now have a new warehouse manager and someone in the warehouse fucks something up in inventory by sending a bunch of materials to the wrong job with no records of it being shipped. We are talking half a million dollar fuck up here. In the same day, our ERP had an update that caused a bunch of bugs with our accounting department. So, I decide to work on the ERP problem first because the warehouse fuckup is more of a delay fuck up and not actually stopping anybody from doing their job at the moment, while this accounting problem means our bills are not able to be paid. You can guess what kind of issues we will have if bills are not paid. The ERP bugs turn out to be quite big and numerous so it ends up taking me a couple days to figure out, but I fix it before any bills are actually due and decided to take lunch a little early to celebrate a victory. Crisis averted.\n\nNew warehouse manager storms into my office after I get back from lunch and is LIVID. Apparently, the bosses were pinning the blame on him for the warehouse fuckup. And considering he is the one who oversees shipments and personnel in the warehouse, the blame is rightfully placed. He starts laying into me asking why I have not fixed the problem yet. Yelling and screaming like a child. I tried explaining that I was fixing an ERP issue and have not had time to look at the warehouse problem yet. He gets even more angry and notes that it is funny how I have time to take early lunches but not do my job. That started to piss me off but I held my tongue and kept calm about the situation. He then ordered me to ONLY do what is in my job title and to leave the \u201cERP bullshit to the people competent enough to handle it\u201d as he put it. Since this guy was technically my supervisor, I had no choice but to obey. I asked him to send me that in writing and he snarks and storms back into his office. 5 minutes later I get an email stating that under NO CIRCUMSTANCES am I to work on anything related to ERP unless it involves inventory.\n\nCue MC.\n\nI do nothing but inventory from that point forward, knowing damn well that we would be essentially coasting until we hit a problem that I would refuse to fix. Sure enough, not even a week later I get an email from HR that some sort of bug in the ERP system was preventing them from accessing payroll to pay employees this week. I reply an apology that I am no longer able to work on ERP bugs due to supervisor and to refer to the ERP system help guide for further assistance. I knew the help guide was not going to help her in the slightest, but it was no longer my problem so I was not going to deal with it. Skip a few days later to Friday. I checked my bank account in the morning before getting to work and laughed because there was no money deposited. That problem never got fixed. I hurry up and get to work, excited to see the chaos unfold. And what I was expecting was an understatement.\n\nWhen I show up to work, I see the ENTIRE warehouse staff of 50 people walking out of the front door. I stopped one and asked why they are leaving and they replied with \u201cI didn\u2019t get paid today, so I am not coming back until I do.\u201d I go into the office and see the warehouse manager in a panic. He has jobs that need material and nobody to load it onto trucks or deliver. I ask him if he needs help with anything and he just screams at me to leave his office because he is getting phone calls out the ass from superintendents of jobs asking why our material has not arrived yet. I pass by HR on the way to my office and see a bunch of the bosses huddled up over her computer with her with angry and confused expressions on their face, I guess trying to figure out the problem. I felt bad for her because it really was something out of her control, but I knew she would ultimately be okay because she had been there for so long that they would never fire her.\n\nWhen I get to my office, I see the VP waiting for me there. He has a very pissed off expression on his face. When we get inside, he demands to know why I did not fix the problem in HR when she emailed me about it. I replied that I am no longer allowed to work on ERP problems as it is not in my job title. He has the most shocked look on his face and asked why all of a sudden I had a change of heart. I show him the email from warehouse manager and I could see the dots connect in his head. He immediately storms out and I see him heading straight to the warehouse managers office.\n\nThey were in there for a few hours but eventually he comes back to my office. He seems calmer now and asks me politely if I can fix the problem in HR and if I can resume fixing the ERP if needed. At this point I liked the relief of responsibility and told him I would only do it if he put it officially in my job title along with a raise. His calmness turned to anger again and he says \u201cI cannot believe you!\u201d as he storms out and returns to his office.\n\nA few hours later, he sends out a mass email that he has hired the old ERP consultants to fix the problem and that next week, everyone would be paid for the money they are owed, along with the money they earned if they return to work. This one surprised me as he would rather pay over $60,000 a year to consultants than give me a few extra bucks an hour for better work. I think he expected me to change my mind and just do it for my own paycheck but I decided to wait because I knew how these consultants were and if they managed to fix this problem in a week, I would streak naked through the office. Most of the warehouse staff agreed to return but were still upset about not getting paid.\n\nSure enough, next Friday comes around. Nobody gets paid again. At this point it is becoming a real problem and the entire staff is becoming agitated. They have bills to pay. I even heard a bunch of the warehouse talking about some competitors nearby they could go work for. At this point, I even considered just fixing the problem because the warehouse didn\u2019t deserve to be treated like that due to poor management. Maybe I am the asshole here for this but I am severely underpaid and can barely afford my apartment, there is no reason I should do extra work for free.\n\nThat same day, the VP returns to my office and hands me papers. These papers said that I would be promoted to a newly created position that dealt with inventory/ERP upkeep. It would be its own department and he would be my direct supervisor, also came with a hefty raise. All I had to do was sign and agree. I looked up at him after reading the paper and he had the saddest look on his face. \u201cPlease just sign it, the consultants said it would take them weeks to get around to fixing it due to the high volume of clients they have taken on and we cannot keep skipping paychecks.\u201d\n\nI happily signed it and immediately got to work on the HR issue. Managed to even fix it that same day. It was just a simple problem with the permissions of HR and payroll in the ERP due to the update.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I was doing work outside my job title. Supervisor gets mad and tells me no. I stop and company is unable to pay employees for two weeks. Vice president finally caves in and gives me promotion to do said work outside my job title along with a raise.",

            "Similar scenario. The city I worked for (I\u2019m retired now) had a small fleet of helicopters, mainly used for the police. They hired a basic level mechanic for them. The Federal Aviation Administration has very stringent regulations on who is allowed to perform maintenance on aircraft and a person needs to get separate certifications for almost every aspect of the repairs. \n\nAnyway the lady they hired was fresh out of technical school with the correct certifications to do basic maintenance. She loved working on helicopters but was limited in what she could do. The city would contract out any advanced repair or maintenance work at very expensive rates. The mechanic continued to go to school to get more and more advanced certifications. As she got the certifications, she would perform that repair work so it wouldn\u2019t have to be contracted. She was paying for the advanced training out of her own pocket. \n\nAfter a couple of years, she was certified to just about repair anything on the helicopters. She discovered that the city was saving about a million a year in contracts because she was able to perform the advanced maintenance and inspections required. She went to the city manager and requested a 50k a year raise.  City manager refused any raise and she promptly quit and went to work elsewhere with well more than a 50K raise. \n\nThey soon discovered they couldn\u2019t find a basic level mechanic for the fleet at what they had been paying her. They also were not getting the advanced work she had been doing done by city maintenance because they didn\u2019t have anyone certified.  The cost of having to contract out all of the helicopter maintenance almost caused the elimination of the helicopter unit. The city manager\u2019s refusal to consider a pay raise for her costs them several million dollars a year.",

            "I thought for a second Joe was going to just show up, be the only one at the office while everyone else was at home, and just chill because there's no one there since everyone wanted to stay at and work from home.",
            "I think HR knew Samantha was full of it, and needed her to say it herself.",
            "That's a really good one. I got put on notice during covid because there was a down turn in work and to complete my hours (we are on a direct billing system to our customers. Down to the 15min, expected 40h a week) i supplemented my hours by working on internal business development projects rather than direct bill. This means documentation of our processes and training material. We have a lot of document debit because no one likes to make it.\n\n So, boss puts me on notice and I'm sitting there with HR and they said I'm not doing my job. I ask them for a itemized list of my duties that I agreed to in my contract. There is no such thing. I asked for a list of responsibilities as layed out by my boss, he's never given me one. So i said \"you want to fire me but can't prove to me I'm not doing my job. All you have is my billable hours not meeting a target that was set on my last review that isn't even signed by either party. Ok give me a list of duties and responsibilities so that i can prove that I'm a good employee by your standards.\" so they provide this list, which notablely far exceeds the efforts of my co-workers, and I blow every metric out of the water. The follow up HR conversation was \"look at how much you improved\" \"no, this was purely not having correct management guidance on what my job is and it never being communicated to me. I want a transfer out of the department.\" \" Well we can't do that because you were on report\" \"interesting, well let me say this a different way: my boss has been harrassing me, never defined my role then attempted to get me fired when I didn't do things his way.\" \"Is this a formal complaint?\" \"No, this is me asking for a transfer and you not grasping the gravity of the situation. I expect this to be done in 6 months\" \n\n6 months later, My transfer is Nov 1st. Still their best employee in that department now that I've been given the means to measure my normal duties. 3 other staff are now leaving too and Sr management is looking REALLY hard at the inner workings of the department. Some times when you play stupid games, and your employee knows their rights, you win stupid prises. \n\nI can't stress this enough: get everything in writing. Record all conversations either by hand or audio. Journal your week and what you were doing. Date it all, sign it all. Employers are out to make money off you and they will get rid of you when it suits them. They are not your friends and they do not have your best interest at heart. Protect yourself and don't be afraid to push back. Be civil and ensure you are being the reasonable one. \n\nKnow your rights.",

There\u2019s no set timeline for the coaching, but there are goals you need to hit. One of those goals my manager set was something to do SPECIFICALLY with in-person communication. Well, two months later and I\u2019m sure I knocked out all the goals and asked to be taken off coaching, but was told they can\u2019t take me off because of that goal hadn\u2019t been accomplished. I was LIVID that they wouldn\u2019t remove that as a goal in the face of a global pandemic that didn\u2019t allow me actual in-person interactions with people. It took another 3 months before I was able to be removed from coaching after fighting with HR. I was tempted to just quit, but if you quit or get fired on coaching you can\u2019t be rehired in the future and I really liked working there and had great experiences my entire tenure except for my time with this manager.\n\nI switched teams as soon as I was able to get off coaching, and was promoted within 3 quarters and top performer on my new team every quarter.

        "selftext": "I was reminded of this story from my work by one of my coworkers. It's been maybe 5-7 years since this happened.\n\nWhere I work there is a semi-strict dress code that needs to be adhered to so we look presentable when going to customers houses. The minor details are more or less negotiable depending on who's our manager that day. We have a normal manager we see almost daily, but if he's off or it's a weekend someone else subs in.\n\nThe day this happened was a Saturday and our regular manager was off so the duty manager for the day happened to be \"Mr. Hardass\" whom no one liked and he made it his life goal to make all the techs miserable. When we walked in the door we had to pass through the managers office to get to our meeting area. \n\nMy coworker Tim (name changed) walked in the door that was to the managers office with everything looking right on his uniform but his shirt untucked. The following conversation took place:\n\nMr. Hardass: your shirt should be tucked in.\n\nTim: absolutely, and I will do that when I set my gear down and go to the bathroom\n\nMr. Hardass: No, you need to show up for work ready to work. Not show up and get ready on \"my time\"\n\nTim: ok, let me set my stuff down and I'll go right to the bathroom and tuck it in for you.\n\nMr. Hardass: NO. You're going to tuck it in RIGHT NOW before you walk another step into MY building. \n\nTim: Right now?\n\nMr. Hardass: RIGHT NOW!\n\nSo, my coworker did as instructed, un-buttoned his pants and pulled them all the way down to his ankles and proceeded to smooth out his shirt and then reach all the way down and pull his pants all the way back up and re-buttoned them. \n\nFrom there he immediately walked outside and called the HR hotline and told them his manager on duty just forced him to undo his pants and semi-strip in front of him in his personal office and wouldn't allow him to go to the bathroom to tuck his shirt in. That he felt weird and uncomfortable to be around Mr. Hardass and didn't know if he had any ulterior motives.\n\nNone of us are privy to what exactly happened from that phone call on, but we do know that he got \"laterally moved\" from being a tech manager to the safety team where he was no longer in charge of any subordinates.\n\n\n\n\n\n***I'll make an edit to iron out some details or important things I forgot:\n\nOur job is very much union based and as such the union book is the law of the land so language and actions have to be very specific as to not draw ire from the union nor the business. \"Tim\" was raised in a union household by someone who was VERY involved in their union so he has a very keen knowledge on how to manipulate things well within the trappings of the union handbook. \n\nHe did this whole thing not next to the bosses desk but within line of sight of the door coming in and the door to the meeting room so there were visual witnesses from the meeting room and people who trickled into work behind him who literally walked through the entire ordeal. So, there were plenty of witnesses to corroborate.",

I clarified that he wanted me to go in the bathroom, that had no hot water (at all), with no shaving cream, and shave with a disposable razor.  \n\nHe confirmed that this was what he wanted, and I told him that wasn't going to happen, I wasn't going to slice my face up because he was having a bad day.  He backed down, he was normally pretty chill so I chalked it up to him being on the warpath for something unrelated to my  face.",

            "So in school we had to wear a uniform. Part of that uniform was to keep the shirt tucked in. I lost a lot of weight and went from a UK size 14/16 to a 10, but my mum refused to buy me new trousers and there were no belt loops. My PE skirt literally slipped off if I didn't wedge the band into my shorts. \n\nOne day a teacher was on the warpath and forced me to tuck my shirt in properly. I would tuck it in, but leave a good chunk of material hanging out so people couldn't see down my pants. It looked messy but it was still tucked. Well he made me do it properly. When I was done you could see down the front of my pants easily. I was 13. He very quickly looked away told me to untuck my shirt and to buy new pants. I told him to go tell my mum that because she was refusing. I kept those trousers through most of school, I was a very skinny kid, like my abs were showing skinny, wearing massively oversized clothes. I looked ridiculous and was called fat a lot, nope, not fat, just have big clothes. Teachers did stop asking me to tuck my shirt in properly though.

            "I have a similar story.  When I was a teenager I worked for a local grocery store that required you to wear black pants under your smock.  Being a teenager with little money, the only pair of black pants I owned was a pair my grandmother bought me when I first got the job, and I had not yet gotten around to buying a second pair.  At some point during one of my shifts, the front end manager made me get off my register and clean something up, either it was a spill of bleach or she made me use bleach as the cleaner, I cant remember which it was at this point.  Well, during the cleaning process, I got bleach on my pants.  I think it spilled on the floor and I knelt on it to clean it up and didn't realize it was bleach until after it began to stain my black pants.  I figured, oh well, I'll finish out my shift and ask my mom to take me pants shopping that night and borrow some money for it from her, since I didnt have enough in my account for it.  Well, I get back to my register, and the same manager who asked me to clean the spill walked past, and said that my pants were \"unacceptable\" and I needed to \"go home and not come back unless I have a professional looking pair of pants.\"  So go home I did.  And I did not come to my next shift, as instead of opting to borrow money from my mom, I decided to wait until I got paid again to get a new pair of pants.  The store manager called me when I missed my shift and asked me why I hadn't come in.  I told him \"front end manager asked me not to come back until I have a pair of black pants.\"  He asked me to wait a moment and I guess went to ask her what happened, and when he came back to the phone he asked me if I could just come in for my shift in a pair of jeans.  I told him I'd come in if front end manager apologized, since she was the reason I got bleached in the first place.  He sighed and said okay, and I got a very reluctant apology out of her, and got to wear regular jeans for a few shifts until pay day.",

If you are used to ordering at the fancy green place, or the running donut place, the number of sugar and creams you order may need to change depending on how much you actually want.\n\nOne night, we had these 3 bikers drive in, and you could tell they had been on the road for a while. \nTheir ringleader was your stereotypical biker; tall, wide shoulders, big beard, covered in leather. \nHis friends were were shorter but otherwise still had the whole tough but tired look going on.\n\nMy coworker was in the back working soup and sandwich, but Its only three people and it's been a slow night. No worries. Just need to get these tired boys some caffiene and wish them a good night. \n\n\nRingleader: I want an extra large 12 and 12. \n\nMe: Are you sur...\n\nRingleader: Did I stutter?\n\nMe: Okay but that's only...\n\nFriend 1: Did he stutter!?\n\nNo. No he did not... So off I went to make him exactly what he asked for. Grabbed a cup and put it under the sugar dispenser while I pressed the times3 button 4 times. 12  XL shots of sugar.\nThen I went over to the cream dispenser and did the same thing.\nNow, fun fact. The cream and sugars are measured to dispense 1/12 of the cup size you are selecting.\nSo by the time all 12 shots of creamer were dispensed, the cup was basically full.\n\nI stirred the creamy sugar mixture around before I poured an itty bitty splash of coffee in his cup, just enough to bring it up to the saftey line on the cup.\nI tried asking him if he wanted me to heat it up or anything, but I basically got the same exact run around from him and his friend.\n\nObviously the guy knew what he wanted and he didnt need me to tell him what he was ordering.\nThey grabbed the rest of their order and drove out into the night.\n\nNow, you would think that was the end of the story. The big angry biker man got his nasty sugar cream drink and left me sitting there wondering if the rest of the world had been drinking their coffee wrong this entire time.\nBut no, I was lucky to be working the next afternoon when he came back in! Mr. Ringleader came back in all by himself the next day and shuffled up to the counter.\nI could tell he must have been embarrassed because his voice was a lot softer this time, he knew he fucked up.\n\nThe glorious aftermath is that he apologized and confirmed that the drink had been utterly disgusting.\nTurns out he was used to ordering from the fancy green  coffee place and they use way smaller measurements for their creame and sugur.\nOnce I knew where he was used to ordering from I made him the approximately same drink using our measurements (roughly a triple triple) and sent him on his way.\n\nI only wish I could have seen his face when he took that first sip.\n\n\nTLDR: Mean man offers a cup full of creame and sugur, tastes disgusting.",

Almost all the people expect a Starbucks drink and will order something like an \u201ciced coconut soy macchiato\u201d which leads to me confirming with them multiple times that they understand what the drink is.

            "Good to see he had the integrity to apologise. It's been my observation that the vast majority of bikers are honest people at heart. They speak their mind, and unless you've crossed them somehow, you usually won't have any trouble.\n\nYears ago, I worked at a roadhouse on a busy highway. The sight of some 20 Harleys pulling up at once might have made some nervous, but not me. Once a year said bikers made the ride from Perth, capital of Western Australia to Carnarvon, about 1000 km away (about 600 miles) to a biker's event known as the Sandhurst Run.I never had any trouble with them. They paid for their fuel, got something to eat, and I'd say, \"the pub's next door, the general store is that way. Watch out for the cops in Geraldton and Dongara, and Gingin on the way home.\"",

He particularly enjoyed the ones with jelly and some weird tan colored stuff that my dad was too embarrassed to ask about. My dad could only surmise that they must be mustard and jelly sandwiches, so he asked my mom to pack one in his lunch. She tried to tell him that was a terrible combo, but he didn\u2019t listen. Lunch wasn\u2019t too great the next day. He grew up on a ranch in 1960s rural Mexico. Peanut butter wasn\u2019t a thing for him until much later in life.",

            "I learned to listen in many places including fast food but have something that this reminds me of. The person who won't listen to anyone. Dad was pastor of a church we were building on a new sanctuary and there were several people standing around the plans including the architect and the contractor. They are on the phone with the Sauder company. Some of you may have built do it yourself kits for furniture from them but they started as a church pew manufacturing.\n\nThis sanctuary was 4 sides of an octagon at the back so instead of just an isle up the middle and sides there were two more isles. Now there was as lot of commotion going on but the constitution head gave final measurements to the Sauder person who then said. Are you positive ..... And tried to say more when the head barked out I know what I'm doing. Well about that point my father walked up. No something else you need to know my father's undergrad was in mechanical engineering from Rutgers.\n\nThe Janitor had been standing there and he looked that construction head in the eye then looked at my dad and said Pastor they have just given the back of the sanctuary measurement to the pew guys as the front measurement. And won't listen to the pew guys tell em their wrong. (Now in this shape if you start with that long measurement 1st , at the front there will be no isles. As the whole building narrows from back to front)\n\nThe head turns red and say who the f... Black are you janitor .... Oh sorry Pastor. Dad says to Sauder person what measurement do you just get. The fellow tries to be polite but the architect writes it down and hands it to my dad.   It of course was wrong. We did end up hiring another contractor. And had the janitor over to dinner.

            "I went to Canada a couple years ago, i never understood what a triple double or any of that stuff meant. Here in the UK they leave all the sugar out for you to deal with yourself, so I just drank my coffee black the whole time I was there. But those Timbits helped balance it out",
            "I was once in a line at what I assume to be the same Canadian Coffee shop and was behind a young guy in his early to mid twenties. He got up to the counter and ordered, and I'll never forget this, \"an Extra Large French Vanilla with 7 sugars\".\n\nThe French Vanilla is a premix of sugar and flavoring that hot water is added to. The reaction by the guy behind the counter was similar to the OP's. \"Seven sugars? French Vanilla...okay then.\"",
            "Reminds me of two things.\n\n\nJiffy Lube has weird coffee that everyone either loves or hates, no inbetween.  My coworkers hated it, but needed the caffeine, so they'd make what we called \"The Diabeetus Blend\" of waaaay too much sugar and French Vanilla. \n\n\nAlso, I used to drink half and half cups in diners when I was like ten.",
            "When he came back I expected hem to ask: \"You know what might look better on your nose?\"\n\n\"The bar!\"",
            "I'm into it, sometimes you want some ice cream, hold the ice",
            "I used to work at the running donut place. We had a regular come in every morning and order 2 large and 2 extra large 15x15. I have a feeling our machines dispensed the same amount because I would have room for MAYBE 2 oz. of coffee in the large cups. I think about this guy often.",
            "I loved working at the big Canadian coffee shop here in michigan. It's been my favorite food service job.",
            "Every biker I've met is like this.",
            "Have you ever had some one order a Wayne Gretzkey?",
            "Ok I think you just settled a years-long argument between my wife and I.\n\nThe question - if I order, say, a medium double-double or a large double-double...is the same amount of cream and sugar dispensed? Or is each shot a proportion of the cup size?",
            "Ah yes, I do love tim horton\u2019s \ud83d\ude02",
            "Michael Scott?",
            "Mmmm Timmy\u2019s compliance!",
            "I love the aftermath....\n>Once I knew where he was used to ordering from I made him the approximately same drink using our measurements (roughly a triple triple) and sent him on his way.",
            "I mean where I go I got 12 and 12 before just because the flavory part of it tasted good, and like diabetes in a cup too but worth it",
            "I worked there as my first job and we also had a psycho who ordered 12 and 12s except she was a regular. Very weird",
            "Time to start over then",
            "I mean I like coffee as much as the next guy and often drink it black, but somehow I think I would also just enjoy the hell out of a cup sweet half-and-half.",
            "My sister worked at this same coffee establishment and once had someone order something similar and without missing a beat asked them if they wanted coffee with that.",
            "TWELVE TWELVE?! Bro a triple triple of any size is already too sweet for me",
            "Thanks for the warnings, I skipped the story because of them.",
            "Yeah, so I worked at the same chain for all of my high school imprisonment. I had a different guy, looked like he would have been terrified of a spider spider kind. The guy asks me what is the most cream and sugar he can get, and I just said that I could fill the cup, and add no coffee, but he still wanted a coffee, so I told him about the Wayne Gretzky (9C9S). Wayne Gretzky, the most famous hockey player ever wore jersey number 99. The guy said he would have an XL Wayne Gretzky. I gagged, but made the drink for him, the next day he returned, and asked for the same thing, and I gagged again - I have drank my coffee black since grade 9.",
            "I used to work at the same chain in the US and had a similar incident with an older Karen. She sat in our lobby to drink her coffee, and after taking the first sip, she came up mad as sin, claiming that her drink had almost no coffee in it. I told her that she got exactly what she had ordered. When she asked for a manager, I was happy to inform her that I was the manager. I had tried to warn her multiple times that our measurements were not the same as other coffee shops, but she insisted on a 10x10. So, I told her she wouldn't be getting a refund from us."
