This means that I am often on meetings or depositions that start at around 7:00 am or earlier. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, I attended several days of a deposition, starting at 5:30 (for me) each day. Those days, I left the office at around 3:00. My manager then called me into her office, and demanded to know why I was \u201cleaving early\u201d every day. I told her about the situation, but she did not care. She said, \u201cThis is a 9-5 job. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re in earlier, you leave at 5:00. Otherwise people will think it\u2019s okay to come in and leave whenever they want.\u201d\n\nWell, 9-5 it is! I started arriving in the office promptly at 9. This unfortunately led to me skipping several meetings, but alas, it cannot be helped. One meeting I skipped, scheduled for 6:00 am, is an important biweekly one that my manager is also supposed to attend. She has never attended and always relies on me preparing her a report on the meeting, so she can present it to her boss. When she asked for the report, I informed her that I was unable to attend the meeting, since I work a 9-5 job and I don\u2019t want to give anyone the wrong impression. No report, sorry!\n\nAs I left promptly at 5, I peeked through the window to her office and got a great view of her trying to explain herself to her boss. \n\nToday, she called me and dejectedly informed me that I can leave the office whenever I want from now on.",

Because of this, he would typically leave 15-20 minutes early to get a slight edge leaving the parking lot. His boss talked with him about \u201cthe perception\u201d of leaving early. \u201cNo problem\u201d, he said. He stopped working at the 8 hour mark, no matter when it was, and started playing music in his office or loudly watching videos from his phone.

They smiled and said - come in early tomorrow and we\u2019ll show you how it works.\n\nGot in early the next day.  Logged into the computer and said good morning to my coworker.

He would also dismiss the crew at 4:15 so they could clock out by 5:00 while he closed down the work location and loaded equipment for the evening, not leaving the field location until 5:00. \n\nOne day something went wrong and he arrived at the office at 8:10.

Unfortunately she never trusted me again and I can understand that. But she also cut off the company that I worked for and that put them in a huge financial bind.

I was checking out a place for 40% of monthly minimum wage and having arrived at the agreed upon time found an obese middle aged lady telling an agitated nephew that he can't freeload in his room anymore. So I talk to her and always the marketer offer to do some free digital marketing tips (basic stuff that people just ignore) before checking out the rooms, it never hurts to offer something valuable and low-cost for free before negotiations.\n\nI found an amazing room that made me feel like a vampire count with thick ornate columns, high ceilings, velvet drapes, with the only light coming from the glass wall on one side that casted my silhouette towards the entrance and kept my face obscure sitting behind the desk. But I should scope out the place right? So the landlord tells me she was bad knees and asks the nephew she just kicked out to show me around and upstairs, specifically to the room that just freed up (his).\n\n*Um what? That's not wise*...\n\nNot surprisingly he showed me the place flippantly, occasionally bad mouthing it, and let me know that there's rats.\n\n*Okay nope!* I said my thanks, left the lying landlord. That should've been the end of it.\n\nTwo days later, the landlord calls me in the middle of work and asks if I made a decision on the room and if I could show her the digital marketing tricks to which I gave her the benefit of the doubt and refused sternly. That should've been the end of it.\n\nYet she kept on calling, even when I blocked her she found other numbers to call from over the next two weeks. One day I was in a foul mood so I finally agreed if only to get her out of my life, except she then directs me to the nephew she's kicking out (as soon as his room is rented) because she's not good with tech. *Um what? That's not wise, but meh its what she wanted.* \n\nIt turns out the freeloading nephew was a natural and he managed to rank landlord's apartment on the top 10 search results complete with dead rats, dangerous fire escapes, fire hazards and all. The landlord was found in violation of numerous codes and I now had a capable and admiring digital marketer who eventually helped me get employed after CoVid layoffs.",

There were definitely some problems with the place and it was two single moms being awesome and supporting one another and sharing rent, etc. You would think that the landlord would do everything to keep such good tenants. But they had complained to landlord about a number of legitimate things over time and instead of fixing them they sold the place. New landlord canceled their lease and then had a realty company make them leave from time to time so an agent could show it to prospective new renters before they moved out. They did this but also put up helpful poster boards and signs identifying things such as broken screens, faulty wiring, etc. I don't think they got back their deposit on the place but I do think they got tremendous satisfaction from being able to share their truth. Both of them are in much better places now and are doing well so losing that lease was a good thing for them in the end.",

        "selftext": "Back in high school, I was all about my car. Don't get me wrong it was a rolling POS, but it was *my* car. It had a trade-in value of maybe $5, but it was ***my*** car. I was learning how to take care of it, by which I mean I found where the dip stick was and how to pull it. (I hadn't yet moved on to tire inflation. One step at a time!)\n\nOne day after school I drove over to my friend's place. We jump out, pop the hood, pull the dip stick, check the oil and it was fine so put the hood back down. I had no idea what an HOA was nor what it meant, I was just a happy ignorant teenager eager to demonstrate how responsible I was with my wheels.\n\nA few days go by and we're hanging out at my friend's place when his mom comes home. She starts giving us the business in that \"I'm annoyed but trying not to be\" voice about a warning she received from the HOA regarding repairing cars in your driveway, complete with a photo of my POS with the hood up. Really she was being pretty good, though clearly annoyed. We explain that we weren't repairing anything, that I was just checking the oil level, and didn't even need any tools. (Picture just had the hood up.) She softened quite a bit, and the focus of her annoyance shifted from us to the HOA since it's entirely reasonable for *anyone* to check the level of oil in a car. She finds her copy of the HOA rules and we all read them together. Sure enough there's a bylaw that says you can't repair a car in the driveway. I protest that I wasn't *repairing* anything, I was just checking the oil!\n\nReading the exact rules on exactly what was forbidden sparked an idea. I look at my friend, raise an eyebrow, and say \"Fight the power?\" \"*FIGHT THE POWER!*\" I propose my plan to his mom and ask for permission since she's going to have to deal with the fallout. She's on board since she thinks this is supremely stupid, and we set in motion. Cue the MC!\n\nEvery day after school my friend and I drove our POS machines to his place, parked in their driveway, raised the hoods, and just *looked* at the engines. No tools, we weren't even near them. We didn't check the oil, we didn't so much as touch them nor wipe them down with a rag. All we did was expose them to the birds, the sky, and God above to just let them breathe. After a while I got bored so I started setting up an easel and drawing my engine ten minutes at a time. My friend had to one-up me, so decided he needed some tasteful artistic photos with his engine. He judged the best photos would be him laying over the engine shirtless, stroking and fake kissing it. Just absurd over-the-top moronic high schooler stuff.\n\nPredictably the HOA was on us like stink on shit. The warnings quickly  turned into fines, complete with pictures of both vehicles with their hoods up. Then more pictures with mine with its hood up and an easel in front. Then even more pictures with my friend's with its hood up, him laying in the engine compartment and me taking pictures of him with a camera.\n\nSoon enough his mom let us know it was  time for the monthly HOA meeting. *Of course* all three of us had to go in person to protest the fines! So the motley pair of us show up along with his mom, and his mom's stack of fine notices. I bring along my engine drawing, and we printed some of my friend's ~~boudoir~~ engine photos larger than normal.\n\nAfter a while it was new business time, and my friend's mom steps up. I'm pretty sure they expected her to play the \"my son and his friend are morons, please make these fines go away since I didn't know what they were doing\" sympathy card. Nope, not a chance! She politely but firmly attested that she was being sent fines for something that wasn't in the bylaws, and asked the board to stop. One of the board members spoke up saying that working on cars was against the bylaws, and clearly that's what was going on since both hoods were up.\n\nOh you should have seen their faces when she corrected them that the bylaw said no repairs were allowed, that there were no *repairs* going on in any of the pictures since no tools were visible, and that we were just doing art projects for school. Even longer faces were seen when she showed my (truthfully completely terrible) drawing of my engine, along with the date-stamped-a-couple-weeks-ago pictures (this was back when film cameras stamped a date directly on the picture!) of my friend trying to seduce his engine. \n\nThe HOA president called for a five minute recess, during which the board huddled in a corner of the room. After the recess, the President succinctly said \"M'am, we are going to dismiss all your fines. Have a nice evening.\"\n\nWe damn near danced out of that meeting! Being the obnoxious shitheads that my friend and I were, we had to do the drawing/photo routine a few more times just to make sure they weren't going to start sending more fines. They wisely didn't, and being victorious we soon found other ways to annoy them.\n\ntl;dr: HOA forbids repairing your car in your driveway. Friend and I decided to draw my engine and take photos of my friend on top of his instead.",

However, on the other side of a wind break of trees from my property there's a small development of 20 homes all of which are in an HOA.  \n\nThat development threw a Halloween party, and invited all the surrounding families (about 6 in bordering non-HOA homes like mine).  Shortly after I got there, a man swaggered up to me, introduced himself, not with his name but with his HOA title and proudly proclaimed that he was the one I had to get permission from to do anything with my property.  I just smiled and said \"I don't have to worry with that crap.\"  He didn't take a hint, and somewhat aggressively suggested that I wanted to modify my tone if I wanted to stay on the good side of the HOA.

So I shot a video of the vehicle backing out of the driveway then driving down the street and driving back and then back into the driveway. And sent them that video with my response that the vehicle is not disabled it just isn't used very often.\n\nOf course being an HOA they still sent nasty responses back that just because you can move it doesn't mean it's not disabled. I said that's exactly what it means. And they responded well we're going to continue to fine if you keep parking the vehicle on the driveway. I responded with well let me know who you're legal representation is because we're going to have to go to court over this.\n\nI'm guessing their legal team took a look at it and all of a sudden everything went away.",

What startled me most is that many HOAs are contracting out management, so essentially privatizing infrastructure like roads. It\u2019s not just older retired people cruising around looking for violations anymore, but people specifically hired to do that.",

            "Even if you had tools out, conducting regular maintenance is not a repair. Technically you can replace your oil and filter and all the fluids in your vehicle whenever you want as that is considered maintenance and maintenance is not the same thing as repair.\n\nMaintenance is keeping something in good condition... Repair is fixing something that's broken. If nothing is broken then you are not conducting repairs. Same thing about upgrading your vehicle parts to better parts. If the part you were placing is still in working order then it is not a repair.\n\nEven jumpstarting your vehicles is a perfectly valid reason to have two cars in your driveway with the hoods up and it would be considered maintenance, not repair. Nothing is wrong with the vehicle, nothing is broken... You're just refilling the energy levels just like you would refill the washer fluid. That's a maintenance item, not repair.\n\nAs a side note me pulling semantics/pedantry like this is what pissed off the admins in high school my senior year. After winter break the entire school had to sign a new student code of conduct that was twice as thick as the old one. I was constantly pouring over the code of conduct before that and following the exact letter of the rules in ways that annoyed and pissed off the staff. They had to legalese the hell out of it and put in tons of definitions specifically defining words being used just like Congress has to do with actual laws. If they used a word that has multiple definitions or vague definitions then it's left entirely up to interpretation and that's the wave that I rode that year.",

        "selftext": "I work for a medium-size development company in a mid-size City. The company has about ten employees, and we collectively manage a little under 50 million dollars worth of residential and commercial real estate.  We are definitely understaffed. The person who owns the company has a temper and, as employees, a lot of what we do is to manage what information she knows about the company to keep her temper in check.\n\nOur longest term employee is our amazing head of facilities who has been with the company for about 8 years and he knows/does EVERYTHING and we are always SOL without him, because he is pretty amazing at his job. He can\u2019t even really take a day off without receiving at least a few phone calls from staff, even on his sick days, we just need him that badly. And, being a great human, he is always there for us.\n\nWell, he made a pretty big mistake on Friday, because he is human, and it really isn\u2019t that a huge deal in that it didn\u2019t cost our company any money, we apologized, and everything is basically fine, however, the woman who owns our company accidentally saw an email about it on someone else\u2019s computer and she lost her shit and he received a one-week suspension....as he has around weeks worth of built up PTO, and even the woman who does HR/payroll thinks the suspension is unjust, it will be paid.\n\nAnnnd we are completely falling apart without him. I finally broke down and texted him for help, and he said, \u201csorry! I\u2019m suspended! Can\u2019t help! Lol\u201d \n\nThe woman who owns our company was even asking where he was earlier when she couldn\u2019t find something. It\u2019s already epic, and we\u2019re only one day in. The employee in me is panicking, and the human in me is rubbing hands together in glee.\n\nTL;DR head of facilities is getting his first real vacation without getting bugged by us in 7 years, but only because he fucked up. We have really only punished ourselves. He\u2019s learning the wrong lesson, and I adore him even more!\n\nEDIT:::: Update - \nSo I caught a cold and I\u2019m pretty sick, but I know y\u2019all are asking for updates... please forgive all cold-related typos...\nHe definitely caved pretty hard, and tried to come back to work, however, caring coworkers wouldn\u2019t let him (the man really needed a vacation). I\u2019m sorry to disappoint you reddit. FWIW, I\u2019m also disappointed in him.\n\nTwo highlights of our struggles though\u2014\nThe weather turned super cold, and our offices got super freezing. Everyone complained a bunch. I was proactive, found the thermostat, realized the AC was still on, and switched it to heat triumphantly. Everyone congratulated me, and then we stayed cold. In fact, we got colder. Next day, I realized I had turned another part of our building to heat, and not our offices. It was 64* in our office. Well, fuck. I figured it out, and our offices got warm...and warmer....and then hot. By Friday morning, it was almost 80*. We just ended up propping the fire escape door open as the heat ran all day Friday, and it was in the 40*s outside.  He really enjoyed that story when I told him about it this morning. We both laughed pretty hard.\n\nThe other thing\u2014we needed a large heavy item removed from a parking garage, and the guy removing it asked if he could do it at 5:30pm on a weekday. I agreed bc why would I care when as long as it\u2019s gone? ....Suspended coworker saw my email about this (on a distribution email list) and immediately texted me about rush hour and traffic patterns... I just didn\u2019t think about how the road that this garage opens up on feeds an entire (primarily residential) neighborhood of our city...annnnd I told him I was going to ignore his same advice to bc he wasn\u2019t supposed to be working annnnd it ended up being a total shitshow, creating massive traffic  backups and couldn\u2019t be completed as scheduled. It was a triumphant failure.",

        "selftext": "So I am a fiend for excel spreadsheets. Absolutely love them and even bought an extra extra wide monitor for home so I can see them in all their glory. My Boss keeps telling me that she's an \"advanced excel user\", she can run macros, she can do pivot tables, she knows formulas. Not once have I seen her create or manipulate a spreadsheet in the 6 months I've worked for her. \n\nSo I had a Template on our Teams chat that we used every week, it was automated to within an inch of its life to tell us about the companies health. We've been using it for the last 4 months after I was given approval by the boss to make it live, gave her a tutorial and everything. This was for the admins to all see it and I'd only need to update the raw data once a week instead of send it manually to who ever wanted it on a given day (Up to 4 times a day usually). \n\nTook out about 6 hrs work a week having it set up like that. Well the boss told me to take it down because a different department who hadnt seen it, was worried about personal data when one of the admins told them about it. There isnt anything like that in there, and anything that isnt open access is password hidden anyway. Our IT team has to be formally requested to add a new member to our teams chat, the spreadsheet is password protected, the tabs are password protected and the whole company is locked down hard anyway.\n\nSo boss orders me to take it down and delete it \"Run a fresh one for anyone who wants it\".  \nSo I explained there wasn't anything in it that was \"personal or private data\", but got told nope delete it.  \nTried to explain we use it amongst the admins every day and it has all these built in features/tables etc.   \nNope delete it.\n\nSo I did. The fall out? Read on\n\nCue today Boss says to me her big boss meeting is presenting figures to the executives tomorrow. She starts quoting figures that are wildly out from the true numbers, I questioned where they came from and she shows me a Frankenstein report that is saying the exact opposite of what she thought. Run by someone not even in our department... I tell her the accurate grand total and show her how I got there with a simple table and some screenshots I had of the original shared spreadsheet. She asks for access and I tell her its been deleted.\n\nI explained why and even showed the meeting notes where she had approved its use after viewing it.  \nShe denies any knowledge of it, but wants it back. I said It would take me 2-3 days to make it again due to my workload increases. \n\nI saved a copy of the template, but no way am I telling her that. This will give me breathing room to get the backlog out of my queue while she thinks I'm working on it. Let her sweat through that Executive meeting knowing every figure is wrong, no ones saving her ass in this team anymore.",

No classes, no doing homework in suspension, no making up missed work from that day, even tests that counted for a large part of your grade. So the ONLY important thing that mattered to the school was the kids butt cheeks and what time they hit the seat. These are kids who can't drive, rural school with kids who live miles away, and who are still dependent on their parents for transportation. I told him that if I even thought we might run late on any given day I just called them in sick, cause all work could be made up with no penalty and my kids don't have to sit around bored, hurting their grades and realizing that there was NOTHING the school could teach them in 8 hours that mattered more than their butt.

Then about a year I to the position, the Ops Manager had a family issue and took 6 weeks leave, appointing me as the Acting Manager.\n\nMy first play was to institute the following:\n\n1. All attendance will be checked at the end of each payroll period (every 2 weeks) and instances of late over 15 minutes or absences will be checked against \"call out notes\". If notes indicate a call was received at least 10 minutes prior to shift for late or 1 hour prior for call out, any penalty points on performance will be reduced to 1 point for late and waived for call out assuming sick time is available for the employee. \n\n2. Should no call be received in the allotted time then it will be 1 point for late over 15 minutes or 5 points for a \"No Call/No Show\". More than 10 points in a rolling 6 point time frame could be grounds for termination. \n\n3. Should no other violations occur, late points will fall off after 90 days, No Call/No Show remain for 6 months.\n\n  The new policy took affect immediately and our call out rate dropped by nearly half. Within 4 weeks our attendance was the best of the bases in our region. Ops Manager comes back and sees the metrics and KPI's on employee performance and is impressed. I show him the new rules and he argues for a bit to which I reply solely by pointing to the metrics again. He acquiesced and the policy stayed. Of course he also took the credit and pay bonus for it.\n\nDon't miss that job.",

        "selftext": "This wasn't me doing the malicious compliance, nor the request, but the middle man who witnessed this gloriousness. I worked for a movie theatre company in a state that snows every winter. We had a contract with a snow shoveling company but my boss refused to use it because the costs of each removal had a possiblity of hurting his yearly bonus by a couple percent points (like $300 max out of $20,000). \"Only if it snows more than six inches\" he would say every time.\n\nUnfortunately this meant that one of the ushers would have to shovel snow on the sidewalk. Since it's a safety hazard to block the emergency exit doors of a theatre it meant you had to shovel a path around the entire building and for each exit door. Ultimately due to the size it's about a quarter mile around the building. No one likes doing it because it's cold and shoveling a simple one shovel-length path can take two hours.\n\nDuring a snowy Christmas week (the busiest week for movie theaters of the year, imagine Black Friday shopping for two weeks straight) it had snowed just under six inches. We were extremely busy and my boss demanded to take one of our much needed ushers to go shovel snow (I was an assistant manager). When we asked if the company could come out instead of us doing it we were told no, to which one of my co-workers (we'll call him Dan) said he would do it. An hour later after he had gone outside one by one my boss pulled each usher in and wrote them up for \"refusing to shovel snow\". When Dan came back in the other ushers complained to him about it. Dan asked our boss why and our boss said that it was because no one wanted to shovel all of the snow, and if Dan didn't shovel all of the snow he would get written up as well. This all happened at the beginning of my shift, around 5pm.\n\nCue the malicious compliance. What my boss didn't realize was that it was the last day of the payroll period. Being Christmas week Dan had already accumulated 40 hours of work earlier in the day. My boss left right after telling Dan to make sure ALL of the snow was removed. We worked the rest of the shift and everyone assumed Dan had finished and left.\n\nIt's 3am now and we go to punch out for the week but can't because there is a shift that hasn't been approved yet. Someone is still working and is at 12 hours of overtime. It's Dan. I go out to investigate since it should only be myself and my manager. As I walk outside I see Dan coming back in, smiling the biggest grin on his face, and the most dry, un-snowed path I've ever seen in my life. It looked like two pictures cut together; there was not a spec or snow on the entire front path of the theatre. Dan spent ten hours outside making. Sure that he removed ALL the snow from the walkway.

He had this smug look on his face like he had \"beaten\" us. He was not too pleased when he found out that all of our statements included him saying the phrase \"remove all the snow\" and that he refused to call the snow plow company.

At the location I worked the platter for screen two did not automatically start to spin like it was designed to. Ushers were required to go in every time a movie needed to start on that screen to give it a spin because once it started it was good to go. An assistant manager told me it was a bad chip that would've cost under $50 to replace but that would have come out of the managers bonus and he didn't want to pay for it.",
            "Reminds me of the time we had a massive blizzard and I was working as a cart pusher/bag boy at a grocery store. The blizzard lasted for 2 of my shifts (started Friday night and ended Sunday afternoon, working Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning). We ended up getting 26\" of snow in total that drifted 8ft deep in some places.\n\nMe and one other guy got tasked with keeping the sidewalks clear on Saturday. The temperature was also dropping quickly at the same time and the walkways were icing over. Management told us to grab a bag of water softener salt and use that. We burned through it in about an hour at the rate it was snowing. Went to grab another one and they stopped us and said no more.\n\nWe did what we could, but everything was coated in a layer of ice under the snow when it was all said and done. Stayed cold for the next couple days so it took over a week before you could actually see the sidewalks again.",

He knew nothing about projection other than where the start button is, which might be why he didn't put any film in the projector before starting it.

            "Only very slightly related story:\n\nBought tickets for my daughter and I to go see Star Wars The Force Awakens around Christmas of 2015. I bought the midnight tickets because that's how I saw every single one (except the originals). We also had just moved here from another state and in our old state any time you go see a movie and it's raining or cold, they let you inside to wait so that nobody dies of frostbite, hypothermia, or a bad cold from waiting in the rain. Here though, I wasn't prepared for Star Wars to be released at Christmas time, and it started snowing *hard.* \"No big deal\" I thought, soon we'll be inside. I also (very stupidly) was wearing a thin crochet-type sweater over my shirt and jeans because I'm not usually outside for that long. When we got there, the line was around the building, and *everyone* was waiting in the hard-falling snow! I knew that there would be a ton of people but I couldn't believe that they would make us wait in the damn snow! I went inside and asked the manager why we weren't waiting inside because of the weather (god I must have sounded like a Karen) and he said that he couldn't have all of us inside crowding the people who were there for other movies. Everyone was an hour or so early of course so we all literally stood in line in the pouring snow in 4\u00b0 weather for at least an hour. I made my daughter go sit in the car to keep warm while I held our place in line. I thought briefly about switching off with her but she was only 14 and I don't trust today's society and her standing alone in line behind a movie theater. I don't even mind the waiting. I minded the fact that very slowly I started to not be able to feel my face, my feet, and my hands. Plus I wasn't exactly wearing good clothes for snow because I thought we would be treated like humans and let inside to wait! There was another movie I had to wait for back home and it was absolutely pouring buckets and they let us all sit in an empty auditorium and sit on the floor of the lobby lining the walls. I seriously don't care about waiting - I care about living. I do remember while waiting in line for Star Wars TFA starting to fall asleep and sway on my feet. At that point I had snow up to the mid-calf of my jeans and I couldn't feel my feet. Somehow I stayed awake and just when I was thinking about my life and how I'd like to keep living and maybe just going home, they started slowly letting us back in. It took another 20 mns just to reach the door. By the time we finally sat down in the auditorium I felt weak and shaky. It took almost half the movie before I could feel my whole body again. It was *the* worst movie experience ever. I still to this day 5 years later cannot believe that they did that, making every human in line wait in a partial snow storm just to avoid crowding. I know there's a people capacity for public places, but people's lives can be at stake. Does anyone else have a bad movie story?",
            "I have a feeling that nowhere in the employee handbook does it say that ushers have to shovel snow.

The 'makeup rules' were as follows :\n\n1) no fake eyelashes\n2) no fake fingernails or fingernail extensions\n3) no makeup that is not a 'natural color'\n\nThe natural color one confused me. What is deemed natural? Who decides what is and isn't natural? I asked my manager for clarification but she couldn't give me any. \"just keep it natural. Use natural occurring colors and you'll be fine.\"\n\nThis did not sit well with me. Cue malicious compliance. My aunt has her masters in environmental science. I went to her house one evening and picked her brain about natural occurring colors. She informed me that, scientifically, natural occurring colors are colors that can be found directly in nature. She even showed me a textbook that directly spoke about natural occurring colors. I borrowed the textbook and highlighted the paragraphs that specified this. Keep in mind, this was well before you could just google something. The only way to back up the claim was to carry that 750 page textbook to work with me.\n\nMy next shift, I went all out. Green eyeliner, eggplant colored eye shadow, yellow nail polish on one hand and mango colored on the other hand.\n\nI hit the floor to work and within the first few minutes, I get hauled into my manager's office.\n\n\"OP, what do you think you're doing? You cannot wear those colors. You know our policy states natural occurring colors only when it comes to makeup. Head to the staff bathroom immediately and remove it\"\n\nWordlessly, I headed to the staff bathroom. But instead of taking the makeup off, I went to my locker, grabbed the textbook and marched back to my managers office.\n\n\"excuse me, manager? I am wearing natural occurring colors. Here, look at this textbook that specifically states what natural occurring are, by definition.\"\n\nI watched her face change as she read the book. First she looked pissed, then worried, and then finally resigned herself to what was happening.\"\n\n\"OP, do you really need to be that type of person??\"\n\nMe: \"the type that follows the rules? I thought that's what you wanted me to do?\"\n\nShe asked me to head back to the floor. For the remaining time I was employed there I wore whatever color makeup I wanted and so did almost all of my coworkers. They tried coming out with new rules but could never get the wording right.\n\nF*** stupid rules! Malicious compliance for the win!",

My work is fairly small and situated in a mall, we have a small locker room but it's unisex so no one gets fully dressed there, but many people will change their tops. \n\nMost days I work two shifts, an early morning maintenance shift with a midday lunch shift starting straight after I've finished the maintenance. \n\nMy managers are really stingy with breaks, absolute legal minimum, clocked to the second. They'll also try and schedule you for just under the hour requirement to avoid giving another break. IE, if you're due another break if you work 8 hours they'll schedule you for 7 hours and 45 minutes.\n\nAs a maintenance worker I have a maintenance shirt which I switch to a general uniform top whenever I come off maintenance. Since I'm female presenting I wear a light shirt underneath for decency. \n\nNormally it would only take me a few seconds to switch tops and jump back on floor for my second shift, but a few weeks ago my boss pulled me aside and told me that they didn't want me changing in the locker room anymore for 'hygiene reasons'. Notably they didn't tell any of my male coworkers who had been doing the same thing for years.\n\nNow I have to walk to the nearest bathroom (approx five minutes away) to get changed.\n\nHere's where the compliance comes in. There was an unspoken expectation that I would have to get changed during my break, but given how stringent my managers are, I really didn't want to gouge a large chunk out of my limited free time.\n\nInstead every day I deliberately leave a small amount of maintenance work left undone, maybe ten, fifteen minutes worth before my break so I'd have to keep my maintenance shirt on to complete that work. Once that's done I take a leisurely stroll to the nearest bathroom while on clock to get changed. \n\nThis is generally one of the busiest periods, early lunch rush, so my managers often have to stop sitting and chatting in the office and cover me until I get back.",
