        "selftext": "About 15 years ago I worked in a large hospital for kids in the maintenance department.   Our manager, let's call her Karen, was a major b*tch. No one on our team liked her and we outwardly showed no respect for her after her constant harassment towards us in the 2 years she worked there.  She would call us on the maintenence radios and be rude or tell the guys they were being incompetent. It was beyond micromanagement but also rude on top of it. She expected the maintenance guys to come do work at her house for free. Or would tell some of the hospital vendors she would guarantee the hospital contract if they did work at her house for cheap.  She used to brag about this to me. Karen and I were the only women in our department of about 25 people. \n\nI was a mouthy 20 something year old and didn't care for her attitude and regularly would say \"yeah, sure, whatever\" when she asked me to do things.  I would do what she asked because it was my job but I would have made a noncommittal remark like that. One time she asked me to come to her house and help her pull down dead trees in her backyard since she was having a pool installed. I said no, mainly cause I wouldnt do it for someone I liked let alone her and pretty soon after she started treating me even worse than she did before. She had been trying to get me in trouble since then. Such as CCing her buddy in HR on emails to me asking for status on projects that I was working on and wanted my replies in writing.\n\nFast forward 6 months later. Me and one of the maintenance guys were chatting in the office and I was 5 months pregnant with my first baby.  She asked me to do something, I don't remember what, and I said \"Yeah. Whatever, sure. I'll do that in a few mins.\" And I turn back around to talk to my coworker.  She is standing behind me and I hear her whisper \"I wish I could slap the shit out of you.\"  I can see my coworker saw her say it too and I made no comment but I was shocked. I acted like I didn't hear her though.  She left the office a min later to do something.   \n\nI get up and walk down the hall to employee health dept cause I am fuming and my heart was racing.  Pissed.  Also 5 months pregnant.   The EH nurse has me lay down for a bit, take my vitals, write up a formal report. And hour later send me back to my desk as ok to continue working.\n\nWhen I log back in I see an email from Karen, with HR cc'd asking where I had been for the last hour as she called the office phone a bunch of times and had abandoned my desk.  \n\nSo I emailed her back..\"I apologize for being away from my desk.  When you said you'd 'like to slap the shit out of me' I was so upset I had to be calmed down and have mine and my baby's  vitals checked at Employee healthand they were concerned about my hostile working environment and wanted me to stay there for the full hour.\"  I made sure I BCC'd her buddy in HR and ALL of HR, her boss and his boss to make sure everyone saw it. \n\nI was summoned to HR about 30 mins later.  I knew Karen hadn't seen my reply yet, this was early 2000s and her computer was down in the office near me. They had me go home for the day and put me on admin leave for 3 extra days.  I came back to the office to see her desk had been emptied out and we never saw her again.  \n\nThose guys in maintenance threw me the best baby shower ever 3 months later.",

        "selftext": "This is my husband\u2019s story from a few years ago. He was an equipment salesman and had a company pick up that he brought home at night and on weekends. His company did not allow personal use aside from driving it to and from work.\n\nSome salesmen took advantage of having a pick up and did use it for personal use and the company installed GPS systems on all company vehicles at the first of the year. My husband was pretty miffed as he really hadn\u2019t misused his truck, but he figured he had nothing to hide, so he shrugged it off.In February, he had to attend a trade show on a Saturday. This triggered the GPS and he would got a nasty call from his boss who was located in another state. My husband had to provide documentation that he was attending a company-sanctioned event; he felt like he was being babysat. This happened a couple other times as well.\n\nOne Saturday that spring, he backed the truck out of the garage and onto the driveway to get the lawnmower out. After he finished mowing, he pulled it back into the garage. Yup, you guessed it, this triggered the GPS twice and on Monday, his boss called him and chewed him out. My husband tried to explain, but \u201dLou\u201d was mad.\n\n\u201cYou know you are not to drive the company truck on the weekend!\u201d\n\n\u201cI was moving it out of the garage so I could get my mower out. Does your report show how far each trip was?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were .0025 miles each\u2026(he paused as he seemed to realize how short of a distance these trips were)\u2026but, well, that doesn\u2019t matter. No driving after hours or on the weekends. This is being noted in your file!\u201d\n\nSo on the weekends he either parked on the street or in the driveway.  A few weeks later, his compliance became malicious. We lived in the midwest where thunderstorms, tornados, and hailstorms are not uncommon. We were under a storm advisory with a strong probability of hail.\n\n\u201dShould you move your truck into the garage?\u201d I asked my husband.\n\n\u201dYou\u2019d think so, but today is a Sunday and I am forbidden from driving my truck even a few feet, so it\u2019s going to stay where it is,\u201d he said.\n\nAs the hail came down (about the size of a quarter), he stood looking out the window at the truck grinning. He loved explaining the damage to his boss and reminding him why the truck was no longer parked in a nice, safe garage.  Edited to add: When he reported the damage, he reminded his boss that it was a shame he wasn\u2019t allowed to move the truck into his garage when he became aware that a storm was coming. The boss knew damn well he had maliciously followed the policy. The policy was relaxed/reworded a few weeks later, not sure if it was a direct result of this.",

Once a week it seems I\u2019d have to explain to the regional manager that my guy was stopped at a red light for 5 minutes, he wasn\u2019t just idling the truck for no reason. \n\nI did use it once to prove my guy wasn\u2019t at the customer\u2019s house when it was broken into but that\u2019s the only time it ever came to good use.",
            "Years ago at a former employer we were told to bring our trucks to the shop. They'd decided to go big brother on and put gps on our trucks.  There were 6 of us altogether and most objected strenuously. (this is when we still at least had the illusion of privacy.)  The boss swore up and down he didn't have access to the data. It was supposedly just for insurance and theft recovery stuff.  Nobody really believed him and lots of snarky comments were made but things did settle down eventually. \n\nAbout 6  weeks in, he called up a coworker of mine to chew him out for still being at home several hours after he should have left home.   Rather than argue with the boss, he said there was someone there who would like to have a word with him.  Then he handed the phone to one of our bigger customers whose site was about 80 miles from the guy's house. After a bit of confusion the customer confirmed that our guy was there and had been there all morning.  \n\nBoss outed himself as a liar and still never apologized. If you think we rode him hard about it before...  \n\nCoworker never would admit it but I suspect he somehow engineered the situation.\n \nApparently the gps in mine never worked right at my house anyway.  That's not surprising the carrier the company used for everything had next to no coverage at my house.  I also parked it under a metal roof. At the time the gps receiver (an old Motorola phone with no service) that i used for my laptop wouldn't work under there.  No idea if that did anything or not but I like to think it did. \n\n\nThe gps thing lasted for only a few months before they told us to take part of it out and drop them off at the shop.  Not long after we were finally issued company cell phones, that they swore TOTALLY did not have gps on them.\nThey did... but that's a story for another day though.",
            "I was a mobile IT service engineer for a while, and although it was before gps, our mileage was monitored. Unfortunately one of the techs abused their car for personal use and from then on  we weren\u2019t allowed to use the car on our own time at all. \n\nAfter getting angrily interrogated about some excess mileage over a weekend (there were major roadworks and my trip to/from home increased by about 5 miles) I decided that the car could just stay at head office from then on. I\u2019d drive to the office, pick up the car and then start work, leaving it there at the end of the day. \nManagement were pissed as they could no longer get me to go straight to a job in the morning, but there was nothing in my contract stating I *had* to take the car home with me.",
            "Unfortunately you know a company doesn't trust you when they have intense GPS monitoring. Our GPS monitors would notify the boss when you were speeding. We had little hatchbacks, not really capable of doing more than about 160kmph at a push. I got a call one day. Boss: \"GPS says you're doing 190kmph\" Me: \"Well that's not even possible. Do you think this call is even necessary\" Boss: \"Yeah, true\"",

He drove all over the north island during work times heading up the coast to be with his GF on work time. I am not talking about cuttong off early on a firday, i am talking about leaving at midday and travelling 2h out of your working region (which was pretty broad anyway). \n\nHis wife with 3 kids under 5 at home had no idea.

            "I once found a GPS deal in my main company truck. There was no real reason for it, but it annoyed me, so I put it in my immediate supervisors truck, and forgot about it.\n\nAnyways, a few weeks go by, and that week in particular, I was sent on a lot of \"go take pictures of this\" jobs. I ended up getting a call from someone higher up in the company, asking what I'm doing, and do I even need my own company vehicle. He mentioned that the GPS shows my vehicle hasn't moved for 2 weeks. \n\nI told him I swapped it over to the other truck, which then confused him. Apparently my boss was told specifically to go to the places I was taking pictures.\n\nDidn't even get in trouble for moving the GPS, I did have to report my miles for those weeks though.",
            "In my first big job I worked as an electrician for big contract company working on new construction homes. They installed GPS on their trucks and that very first week I was called into the office because I had reported on my timesheet that I worked a certain number of hours at a single house but my GPS showed that I was parked in front of ten other homes for a couple minutes each and I should have reported work done on each of those homes. I had to explain to them that I never did any work on any of those homes... I was dumpster diving for wood for the crew so that we could use it for runners in the Attic.\n\nNope not a good enough excuse... I got written up and told that I have to report every house that I park in front of as having done work on that house even if I'm not actually doing work at the house. So from then on I walked to get wood. So I walked down the road to the first dumpster grab two or three pieces of wood and walk back to the house. Probably about 10 minutes.\n\nBut we need more than that so now I walk to the house further down the road grab two or three pieces of wood and walk back to the house... Probably about 15 minutes.\n\nAnd later the crew needs more wood so I walked to the third dumpster even further away... you get the idea I hope. Everyone in the company heard about this and was doing the same thing.  They all have the same excuse that they heard about me getting written up and didn't want to get in trouble themselves. It took the company months before they finally backtracked and said that we only had to report time worked on house if we actually work on the house and we didn't have to report little micro \nTrips to pick up or drop off stuff.\n\nTo give you an idea of the productivity lost I would typically be able to finish a home in the day and a half. From start to finish wiring it up with one or two helpers we couldn't get the wire roughed in on the first day and then make it look good and look it over for any mistakes halfway through the next day. After this it took us a solid two days to do a single home. And none of us sent the helpers to gather wood so the company was always paying the most experienced and productive people to waste all this time.",

He figured out that the particular model of system they installed would initiate an automated call if the ignition was rapidly turned on and off multiple times in rapid succession. It was intended as an anti-theft measure in the event someone breaks into the vehicle and attempts to start the vehicle with say a screwdriver. Well, you know what else could trigger it? A person with the key rapidly turning the key to on and off position. And the phone call, it went straight to his boss, his bosses boss, and the owner. So whenever they even remotely pissed him off. He waited until the next day, and as he is getting ready to start up his van at 2 o'clock in the morning, he jiggles his key in the ignition making sure to trigger the call, then starts it up and continues on his merry way to work. 20 minutes into his drive he gets a call from his boss worried that his van is being stolen. His response is technically the truth, he's driving in to the jobsite and nothing seems off. They never caught on to what was happening and he absolutely LOVED being able to wake them up at any odd hour he felt like. And yes, he would even do it on the weekend in the middle of the night.

            "I have a similar story.\n\nThis is my partner's story from a few years ago. she was an equipment salesman and had a company pick up that she brought home at night and on weekends. Her company did not allow personal use aside from driving it to and from work.\n\nSome salesmen took advantage of having a pick up and did use it for personal use and the company installed GPS systems on all company vehicles at the first of the year. My partner was pretty miffed as she really hadn\u2019t misused her truck, but she figured she had nothing to hide, so she shrugged it off.In February, she had to attend a trade show on a Saturday. This triggered the GPS and she would got a nasty call from her boss who was located in anotsher state. My partner had to provide documentation that she was attending a company-sanctioned event; she felt like she was being babysat. Ther happened a couple other times as well.\n\nOne Saturday that spring, she backed the truck out of the garage and onto the driveway to get the lawnmower out. After she finisshed mowing, she pulled it back into tshe garage. Yup, you guessed it, this triggered the GPS twice and on Monday, her boss called her and chewed him out. My partner tried to explain, but \u201dAnn\u201d was mad.\n\n\u201cYou know you are not to drive the company truck on the weekend!\u201d\n\n\u201cI was moving it out of the garage so I could get my mower out. Does your report show how far each trip was?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were .0025 miles each\u2026(she paused as she seemed to realize how short of a distance these trips were)\u2026but, well, that doesn\u2019t matter. No driving after hours or on the weekends. This is being noted in your file!\u201d\n\nSo on the weekends she eitsher parked on the street or in the driveway. A few weeks later, her compliance became malicious. We lived in the midwest where thunderstorms, tornados, and hailstorms are not uncommon. We were under a storm advisory with a strong probability of hail.\n\n\u201dShould you move your truck into the garage?\u201d I asked my partner.\n\n\u201dYou\u2019d think so, but today is a Sunday and I am forbidden from driving my truck even a few feet, so it\u2019s going to stay where it is,\u201d she said.\n\nAs the hail came down (about tshe size of a quarter), she stood looking out the window at the truck grinning. She loved explaining the damage to her boss and reminding him why the truck was no longer parked in a nice, safe garage. \n\nWhen she reported the damage, she reminded her boss that it was a shame she wasn\u2019t allowed to move the truck into her garage when she became aware that a storm was coming. The boss knew damn well she had maliciously followed tshe policy. The policy was relaxed/reworded a few weeks later, pretty sure this was a direct result of that."

        "selftext": "So this was back during the 2008 government mortgage crisis.  Had great credit, a great job, and multiple credit cards I used to manage the different properties I owned, a personal card, gas cards, etc.  So one day I get a letter from a credit card company that rhymes with Apital Pank saying that they unilaterally were raising my rates from 13.99% annually to 27% annually.  If I wanted to keep my card (something many people during the crisis needed to do to survive) I had to agree to the new rate, otherwise they would close my account, I would not be able to make any more charges on the card,  and I would have to continue making monthly payments at my current interest rate until the card was paid off.\n\nOf course I had done nothing wrong credit-wise to deserve this treatment from my credit card company (almost doubling of my interest rate) so I called their service line.  After being on hold for over 2 hours I finally got to speak to a CSR and after not getting anywhere with her, I had to hold for another 30 minutes to talk to her supervisor.  I was basically told (very rudely) that I could either accept the new rate or chose to close my account, those were my only two options.  Incensed, I said \"Fine, close it\" and they did.  \n\nWhat they didn't know was that a week prior I had transferred all the balances from my other cards (Over $22,000) to their card without paying a transfer fee and at a promotional rate of 1.9 percent for one year.  But because of the law at the time, they could only charge me at a rate of 1.9 percent until the loan was paid (Here's the malicious compliance part)   \n\nSo here I am 13 years later paying the absolute minimum payment I am required to make each month, never missing a payment and never paying late (otherwise their 'default' rate of 27% would kick in).  Since the inflation rate during these years has been well over the 1.9% interest I pay, it's like free money!  I paid off every other creditor I had with the money I saved and don't even use credit cards anymore as I've been able to save enough to live on a cash only basis.  They've tried multiple times to get me reactivate the card or to transfer the balance to another super-duper account with lots of benefits for me (like paying a much higher interest rate!) without success.\n\nThe only thing I lament is that all good things must come to an end as my balance is now down to $1000 or less, but at least it will last another couple of years.\n\np.s. young folks:  I lucked out, I would have been up a creek otherwise.  If you don't have credit card debt now avoid it like the plague.  It's ok to get a card, you need it for many things in today's world - just pay it off every month.\n\nUPDATE:  Had a lot of similar questions so I'm addressing them below\n\nHow is it free money?  A lot of comments about me still paying interest to Apital Pank - correct, I do, but this is how it plays out:  Instead of sending them a $1000 payment for example to avoid $19 dollars in interest in a year, what I do is invest those same $1000 dollars where I can get a much higher return - say 9.9 percent.  At the end of the year I have 99 dollars i've earned, I take 19 to pay the interest I owe Apital Pank and keep $80 for myself.  Now multiply that times 22K and 13 years.  Yes, I oversimplified for illustration purposes (I still have to pay some of the principal off, pay taxes, etc.)  Yes, I have consistently had a return above 10% of my investments so the model holds.\n\nInflation is not \"well above 1.9%\".  If you are a Keynesian, probably not, but inflation is not a rise in prices, it is a shift in the demand/supply of money which ultimately shows up in consumer goods.  This is where folks first see inflation and make the association that a rise in prices is inflation but it is not.  In addition, most media report on the CPI as if it were a measure of inflation, so folks accept those claims at face value and further believe a rise in prices is inflation.  The CPI calculation is secret, manipulated, and has changed over 20 times in the past - why?  Most entitlements are CPI based so a rise in CPI means higher costs for governments so they try to keep this measure low - ask anyone that depends on entitlements if their annual CPI adjustment keeps up with their expenses.\n\nI don't care if Apital Pank knows I exist or not, or cares or not.  I care and am having fun with this.\n\nI don't know what law made them keep the 1.9 percent - maybe some enlightened redditor has the answer.  I found out about them freezing the rate in the confirmation letter they sent me, the mentioned a \"law\" somewhere but don't remember what it was - consumer protection maybe?\n\nRIP Inbox",

Go to your Bank or Credit Union and ask for a \"Secured Credit Card\" for the amount you saved up. What they do, is take your money and hold it. And, that it the limit on the card. If anything happens. You lose your job, get in over your head, etc. and can't pay your bills, they will take the outstanding balance of the card out of the held funds. Close the card, and refund you the difference if any. Or, you can cancel at any time and the same applies. That secured money will collect interest over time. The Card is still fully treated as a full Credit Card, and will build and affect your credit score by using it.\n\nIt's a credit card with a safety net.

In 2007, the 'cash rate' in Australia was around 6.5% (4.6% difference). 2008, around 7%, 2009 down to 3% or so (getting tighter for OP), 2010 4.5%, 2011 4.75% (getting better), 2012 down to 3.5%, and on a slide down to three quarters of bugger all since then. It dropped below 2% mid-2016 - so the last 4 years have been \"a loss\" for OP. Still, a damn cheap loan. Unsecured loans from an Aussie bank is around 13% at the moment.\n\nBut - the sweetener in the deal is that the credit company has had to process all of the 'minimum' payments, at 1.9% interest on the balance over the 13 years, when they so desperately wanted 27%, but could have had 13.99% if they hadn't decided to be greedy pigs.\n\nIf they had said \"oops, our bad - we'll leave it at 13.99, sorry\", OP probably wouldn't have changed, it would have all stayed the same, and there'd be no story here :)",

            "We should be careful on this advice. It\u2019s good to not have credit card debt, but it\u2019s also good to have a credit card.\n\nIf you can pay off your credit card every month then you are in a good place with credit cards and it is beneficial to have one, especially one with a good rewards system. This is how you have a credit card without carrying credit card debt.\n\nWhy do I say that\u2019s a good thing? Because the prices everyone pays at the store already compensates for the fee the store has to pay to accept credit cards. Hence why you don\u2019t pay a different price when you use a credit card vs cash, but the store is paying a fee to accept a credit transaction.\n\nSo if you don\u2019t get the benefits of using a credit card you are subsidizing other credit card users ability to get those benefits. Things cost more for you so other people can benefit. You should be optimizing for your benefit, which means you should find the credit card with the best rewards to interest ratio for you.",

Same spiel: We're gonna jack your rate up to 28%, if you object close it.\n\nSo I did! And then they **still tried to jack the rate up.** So I did what I said I'd do and sued - it ended up going to arbitration and essentially they got told \"Sorry, you don't have anything in your contract clause that lets you pull this shit - his account stays at the advertised rate, period, unless he violates the credit agreement or other aspect of the account contract.\"\n\nSo that stayed dormant and slowly paid off for a few years. \n\nNow here's the fun part: later they offered me another card at 14%, which I had for a bit, but decided I wanted to cancel it to get a better rewards card. So they said \"Well we see you have an account with us already, how about instead of closing it wholesale we just roll it into your other credit card?\n\nQueue the malicious compliance. I said, \"of course, but I lost the card and would need it replaced.\" \"Oh, no problem, we'll send you a new card to activate! Thank you for staying our customer!\". I didn't change anything about the account, and it's locked in their system. They couldn't raise it if they wanted to thanks to that binding arbitration. \n\nAnd that's how I have a ~ 30k limit fixed rate credit card in a world where the lowest you generally see is 14% variable. \n\nStill use it whenever I have a big purchase to make, and recently got a huge $500 gift card from my rewards points for it.",

I couldn't afford a car, but fortunately lived in the city, so could get public transportation most places.

They both bought new cars, new stereo equipment, cameras, telescopes, and ate out most nights. Both went into severe credit card debt before the first year was out; took them years to dig themselves out of it.

In your card agreement, nearly all of them state that the credit card is an unsecured loan and that they will periodically review the risk of your accounts by gathering data on you, including credit reports (legal).

The original IG story post only reached 1,697 people. The \u201capology\u201d post reached 9,716 people & full of comments of people telling her she\u2019s an anti-vaxx Karen.

Idk why Reddit didn\u2019t aggregate this as a reply.\n\nThis would be valid concern apart from the fact that the information to all your concerns is out there and you just have to seek for it.\n\nRushed production: no, just fast tracked to ensure production was at full-speed . Doesn\u2019t mean that factories are skipping critical safety steps to make the vaccines. If there is evidence of that, that\u2019s another story\n\nNormal development process: mRNA vaccines have been in development for decades now. The virus spike protein is new, the actual technology is the same. There are peer review publications on these topics too, not specifically for covid 19 but mRNA vaccines for other diseases.\n\nLong term safety: this information can only be obtained, you guessed it, after long term. This is the same process that other pharmaceutical products go through. After approval, health professionals are supposed to report anything of concern to the FDA. They compile the info and review for new concerns.\n\nI think you are correct that it is possible that the vaccines won\u2019t receive formal approval, but at this point it is highly unlikely. The vaccines have been proven safe and effective for the time they\u2019ve been used and those are the 2 critical questions that the FDA has to answer to provide approval. \n\nThe fact that something takes 10-15 years to be approved is not necessarily because it takes that long to prove something is good or not good but because of bureaucratic processes that make it take a long time before the FDA can review stuff. The covid pandemic made it so important that they had to drop everything they were doing to focus on the data being provided by vaccine manufacturers instead, therefore jumping ahead of the line. \n\nAgain, counters to your hesitation points are out there, you just have to open your eyes and find them. Health officials have public safety above all else and there is some degree of trust that citizens have to put in them too",

            "I took my daughter into the city for some testing at the children's hospital. Because of the timing of the appointment and the travel involved, I opted to get a hotel the night before, and then use their shuttle to the hospital.\n\nAt check in, I was a nervous wreck. I had won a one night stay at this hotel chain and had a gift card for a specific amount. I was trying to explain that I couldn't afford to pay any overages. If the gift card didn't cover the night's stay, then I would need to cancel.\n\nThe staff were amazing and made sure I wouldn't have any extra charges.\n\nAfter check in, I also asked for directions to a restaurant that I had a gift card for. It was close, and again, we kept the bill under the amount of the gift card.\n\nLater we went swimming in the pool and then had a decent night's sleep  before waking up early to pack up, check out, and load up my car with the things we needed to take with us for her 8 hour hospital stay.\n\nFast forward to our return to the hotel. We have already checked out and don't need to return inside. So we go straight from the shuttle to our car to head home.\n\nGet kiddo buckled up and go around to my door when the wind whips the door out of my hand and slams the vehicle next to me. This was no tiny scratch that could be buffed out. This wasn't a small dent that wouldn't be noticable. This left a foot long vertical gash. This would need serious body work to prevent the door from rusting out.\n\nI dig around for some paper to leave my info, name and phone number. I go back inside and tell the hotel staff and let them know I left my info and asked if they had a police report policy. They laughed and said no and said that I shouldn't have left my info and just left.\n\nI made a comment about doing the right thing for my kiddo to see and they seemed to agree about that.\n\nHowever, I never got contacted about the damage I did to the other vehicle.\n\nI suspect that the staff either talked the other owner out of contacting me, or they may have even removed my note from the vehicle.\n\nOr it was so windy that day that it may have just naturally blown away.\n\nI think about that often.",
            "A while ago myself and 2 of my friends where sitting in another friend's car waiting for him to come out from the store. \n\nHe had a small coupe with tint so we're all kinda crammed in there. A truck pulls up and parks im the spot across from us and 2 guys get it, one in his 20's and the other was middle age.  There was a cart sitting next to where they parked and i guess they didn't want our next to their truck so they just gave it a push and it scraped all along the side of my buddy's coupe. \n\nThe guy in the passenger seat got out and was like \"wtf was that??\" And the 2 guys got smart and said something slick. By the time we managed to crawl out the back of the car and they realized there was 3 of us in the little car they did a half ass apology and tried to pretend that it was an accident. \n\nThey went inside the store real quick after. By the time our buddy came out the store we where loading cart #3 into the back of his truck.\n\nWish we would of stayed to watch the look on his face when he realized the bed of his truck had a pile of carts in it.",

There was a car coming, but all he had to do was let off the gas and stay on his lane and we would've made it across well before he would have needed to break to merge anyway.\n\nBut nop. He changed lanes to the far side, and kept his speed, trying to avoid stopping to merge and squeeze between my brother, me and the sidewalk ahead of us. My brother was talking to me, and I was watching the car the whole time. As we reached the lane lines, he was on top of us, so I stopped and as he drove past us, spartan kicked the side of his car. I kicked the rear driver's side door high enough to cause the window to explode.\n\nUnbeknownst to me at that moment, my brother had thrown his closed can of soda at the driver, through the window, and hit him square in the mouth. Driver swerves and hits the light pole at the corner of the street, and gets out of the car, drenched in blood and soda.\n\nMy brother and I rushed him, he fell backwards and climbed into his car. We kicked some more body panels as the dude tried to back off the light pole he had hit, and drive away.\n\nWe went back to the store to get more drinks, and on the way back my brother retold the story from his point of view. He said he was winding up the throw when he saw me raise my leg and hit the door as he threw the can. When the can hit  the guy, it exploded, at the same time the window exploded. When we got to the store, one of the clerks asked if we had beaten the shit out of the driver. We said we hadn't. He told us he was standing at the door, saw the throw, the kick, the crash, and the subsequent [street fighter bonus car stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xsqXo8pW2c).

        "selftext": "  \n\nI live in a subdivision connected to a major road. The road out of the subdivision has a traffic light. In the morning, nearly everybody needs to turn left for work. Even if you want to turn right, you are simply stuck because there isn\u2019t enough room for more than one car. To compound the problem, the traffic light is green for no more than 5 seconds. We MAY get 4-5 cars out legally, then you have to wait another 3-4 minutes before the light switches.\n\n As you can imagine, this causes people to run the light, swerve around somebody they thought should have gone, etc. It's a grab back of \"Idiots in Cars\", myself included. If you roll up to the light and see that you are 15 cars back, you know you've just added 10 minutes to your commute simply trying to get out of your subdivision. \n\n Well, because of all of our reckless driving behavior, the police communicated via our HOA that we needed to knock it off. They had a police car parked near our area every morning for a week to keep us on our best behavior. Our board tried to work with the city to lengthen the light, but to no avail. That's when a hero emerged.\n\n We get a random email to the HOA distribution list from an anonymous person. They laid out our plan for malicious compliance. There is a pedestrian crosswalk light at the before mentioned intersection that basically goes unused. In my 10 years living there, I\u2019ve never seen it used. There just simply isn\u2019t any pedestrian traffic. \n\nThe subdivision hero devised a plan on how to use this crosswalk to our advantage. Basically, one person in their car simply needs to walk over and hit the \u201cPush Button to Cross\u201d and run back to their car. When to light switches, we now get 30ish seconds to alleviate our traffic jam. Everybody is joining in, and it\u2019s hilarious. My oldest daughter got to do it the other day, and other cars in the line were rolling down their windows and cheering her on. It\u2019s possibly the best neighborhood bonding experience possible. I\u2019m sure our longer lights are screwing up something further down the line, but none of us really care. We\u2019re now on our \u201cbest\u201d behavior since we have about 5 times longer to get through the light.",

        "selftext": "My first job when I was a teen was as a dishwasher in a coffee shop that was just open a month in my seaside town.\n\nThe owners had just left other jobs with a bit of cash and set up the place thinking it'd be easy money ticking over in the background of their retirements. Problem of course was they didn't want to work in it, but also didn't want to hire an experienced manager to run it either. As you can assume, problems ensued from the get go.\n\nMy MC was late on in the summer. My job was to clear and clean all the tables, wash and dry all the dishes and make sure the floor was spotless. The problem of course was that that takes at least 2 people to do on a calm day, never mind busy weekends in the midst of summer holidays and as the boss didn't work there, he assumed I could do it all by myself. Now I didn't have any frame of reference for how hard a job actually should be so for the entire summer I had been busting my ass doing all this and barely making it work. I had adopted so many shortcuts that the dishwasher never actually got used as the baristas were telling me to hand wash stuff as they needed to serve it. We barely had enough cups to have the place full of coffee guzzlers and have some dirty to wash in the kitchen. So that meant I was in the kitchen most of the time scrubbing, and barely having enough time to run out and lift dirty trays, but I still managed to do both. (Looking back now I actually had to physically run around the cafe at times make it all work, wtf) Of course the boss would walk in randomly in the day and I'd get a telling off for the floor being dirty, or a tray on a table. Didn't matter if the tray had been there 10 seconds, it was my fault.\n\nNow I had dealt with this all so far, sucked it up and just pushed on thinking I must have just been slow.That was until the busiest day of the year, when we have a show in town. The place was full and with town so busy, people didn't even mind standing with no seats to have a drink. The boss gets called in as we are swamped and not coping (no cups, long queue of angry customers, people sitting at dirty tables). When he walks in he immediately points at every table with an empty cup on it and then says there is no cutlery, only to further add that the floor is a disgrace. I brick it and run out to the floor to clean and ask him to cover the dish washing for a minute (I had been stuck hand washing dishes just so that baristas had something to put coffee in). He's appalled, but complies. It's only when I get back I see he's obviously never worked back here before. He's actually spent the entire time I'm on the floor just packing a handful of dishes onto a dishwasher tray. The problem being that it takes ages to pack and wash and he hasn't cleared any space for my new dishes to be placed. I shit myself and ask him to help move stuff so I can set the new tray down. He flips it as if he's shocked I can't wash dishes in my own hands (bear in mind I've a tray of maybe 8 cups, teapots, icecream cones etc). He gets a space and the baristas start asking for cups. I start hand washing one to hand over and he scowls at me.\n\n\"Everything must go through the dishwasher.\", and then he walks off to mingle at front of house again.\n\nAlright mate. If you want it that way, then have it that way. I start packing up the dishwasher and try to organise the stacks of trays.\n\nNot 2 minutes go by before 4 baristas are screaming for cups and teapots. I just have to tell them bosses new rules.\n\nBoss now flies in and whips open the dishwasher before it's done telling me to start handwashing again. I start handwashing and he immediately follows with, \"There are tables out there with dishes.\"\n\nI had been pretty frightened of him to now, but having seen him start to lose his cool a little, it dawned on me that I was being overworked, and this guy didn't even know it yet. So instead of making any point or argument I realise the bast way to let him know is by showing him. I leave to get a full tray form out front. It takes a while to stack a few tables trays together, and while I was doing that he was sweating in the back following baristas cleaning orders, hand doing dishes as they were needed. Of course when I get back, there is again nowhere to put the trays and he's now scowling at everyone as if we had constructed the building ourselves.\n\nAgain when I say nowhere to put trays, I am including the floor, where trays were already stacked.\n\nHe then runs out when I get the trays unpacked into some stacks of dishes and he's back to the front of house.\n\nI have then to start cutlery, anyone that's worked in a restaurant or cafe knows the bane of cutlery.\n\nI'm nearly done scrubbing cutlery clean when Boss reappears and without looking pours coffee and tea onto my cleaned cutlery in the sink. At this point I can see he's defeated. He knows how precious my time is suddenly and he knows he's just fucked me over by doing that. His eyes are just wide with an aura of *fuck.*\n\nHe walks back out, still holding the now empty mugs and leaves me to start the cutlery anew.\n\nMaybe a minute goes by when he walks back in and just asks me to tell him how I do my job.\n\n**FUCKING FINALLY!!**\n\nI wash and talk, telling him all the little tricks and tips for making sure shit is still moving out the front. I can tell now from his face as I relay how this place actually works that he genuinely didn't know. I can see somewhere in his head he's just realised how he must have been treating myself and other younger staff all summer to this point. He's sort of looking a bit broken. 15 minutes into working at his own cafe and he's broken.\n\nThe rest of the shift he had his wife come down and the three of us worked the full shift to close. At the end of the day he actually apologised for making me work like that and he'd always have staff on the accommodate busy shifts. I actually went to work for him every summer after that until I left college. I actually really appreciated his reaction to that day and always did a little extra than I needed to and in return he always paid me a little better for the extra work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR :Boss overworks me to death only to have to do the job one day with me and realise what he's been doing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Apologies for the NSFW tag, it was an automated response for swearing I guess. If you want your r/MaliciousErotica you'll have to go elsewhere.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: Great to see so many people talking about their horrific service jobs in the comments. We all share each other's pain; let's heal together.   \nAlso I see some outrage about hand washing in the comments and I understand that, but 16 year old me in my first job did whatever 20 something year old employees asked. I still made sure I was using piping hot water and soap, and after this instance nothing was served without being machine washed as we had staff to make sure everything ran smoothly.   \nAlso a few people calling BS as no disposable cups in a cafe, but for a bit of context this cafe is a way out from town by a beach (cold climate, not tropical). People come to get out of the cold, not grab a coffee on their way to work, so Boss didn't think to spend money on stock that he didn't need all too often (First month, he soon learned to keep better stock).",

            "Dude, it is crazy how management overlooks the importance of dishwashers in any food/restaurant type setting. My first job was as a dishwasher in high school, and I was called in one day after the scheduled dishwasher and one of the cooks got into a fight in the kitchen and they were both terminated. \n\nI got there about an hour later, and both of the managers (they were a husband and wife, that's how the company did things) were besides themselves that one person could do the job that two people (them) were currently failing to do. Like, I walked in and it took me less than 30 minutes to clear everything they hadn't been able to wash and sort and pretty much set them straight. \n\nAlthough, the best manager I ever worked for there came up to me one night and asked me which job I felt was the most difficult in the place. They had maintenance workers, housekeepers, cleaning staff, managers, chefs, etc. I said chefs, since they had to make good food 3 times a day for 100+ people who were all old and cranky. \n\nHis response, \"Our dishwashers.

            "Last summer I was hired as the first employee of a couple who have started up 4 companies and sold three of them. I was working a pretty dangerous job, and severely overworked at times, and it got to the point where I was either going to technically commit a crime (I basically had to do what our customers do, which means I need to fill out a ton of forms, and the case was time sensitive), and receive nothing, or let this couple lose out on $10,000 from their pockets. I saw their home, family, etc, and I knew how much ten grand was to them. I decided to say fuck it and do something illegal to do my job. I thought I was about to be fired for sure. They decided to buy me dinner and a few beers, then tipped me a full weeks pay. They continued trying to hire people throughout the summer, but never found anyone. After that day we had, they told me that no other employee would have done what I did and so on. I've never really thought about myself being significant to anyone, but what I thought was one of the worst days of my life, turned out to be one of the best.",
            "Hahaha this was my first restaurant job to a tee, minus the remorse from the boss, who in my case had been running the place for twenty years and knew exactly what she was doing to people. ",

            "For any managers, superiors, bosses, or other higher-ups, they MUST see it to believe it. There's no way around it. They won't believe it isn't an employee's fault until they stand in your shoes. No matter what job, unless they've been doing said job for most of their life. \n\nUnfortunately, that is the reality of things. If you can't convince them to try and work in your shoes, and instead proceed to berate you for your \"lack of effort\", then they are not worth working for. Find a boss who is more like a coach or a mentor. Those are the best, and are worth working for. ",
            "At least the boss learned in the end.",
            "Wow, you're a damn good writer. I usually skim over this much, but you had me reading every word! Your story reminded me of my restaurant days as a teen. Glad it worked out!",
            "Damn.  My first job as a kid was also a dishwasher. Kinda had a similar experience to this. ",

            "I fucking love this. Because I can relate so much and pretty sure most people in this Industry can. Trying so hard to save money and overworking their staff. Putting on the youngest people they can find and not giving them any experience really. This made my day reading this. Because business owners tend to barely dabble in their own shops but have every idea of how it runs.. Yeah right.. Runs into the ground eventually. \nGood on you for staying strong especially being so young. Sounds like you are a great employee lots of people would have loved to have on their team! ",
            "Man, as someone who spend a week as a dishwasher, how did you deal with the damage to your hands? My hands got fucked from being in hot water almost 8 hours straight everyday. Little cuts wouldn't heal and scraping against anything caused my skin to tear. My fingernails got all soft and would break when hitting anything remotely hard.\n\nI was planning to endure till I settle my debts (40h regular job + 30h part time dishwasher), but then my car broke down and I was like fuck it. I'm not fixing a car worth $500 just to be able to go fuck myself at such a job. I called as soon as I was able to get my car home (took 4 hours) and quit while explaining the situation.\n\nFor the record, I was doing 3x as much work in that part time than I did at my full time job. I was earning about 3 dollars less per hour as a dishwasher as well. Fuck that. ",

You could wash like 20 in 2 minutes.. Or even push a tray of like 3 through in 2 minutes while you bus more tables. Still quicker than hand washing. Am I missing a detail that makes this story sound true? ",
            "Not to blow up your story, but the reason he said you \"need\" to run the dishes through the dishwasher is that this is the only way to guarantee sanitation.

And do all this other stuff and then after doing the deliveries I had to crush all the boxes and clean the shop. \n\nDuring the summer months it can get quiet busy and hot and only recently did the owner realise how over worked I was. I was dripping in sweat running back and fourth unpacking, getting on till, making sure ppl weren\u2019t shop lifting since the school kids loved to do that shit. And after the owner realised his blindness to this he now has 5 ppl do these jobs. 5. Wat. I was doing 5 ppls job and I didn\u2019t even know it.

            "Having a boss that doesn't know what they're doing sucks. At my last job, I had decided to get a part-time job to have some spending money in college, so applied at a burrito restaurant. The boss there told me the job wouldn't interfere with my schedule, but I have a class that was 5 days a week with nightly homework ranging from 1-5 hrs a night. So he puts me working 8 and 9 hour shifts, totalling 35 hrs a week, barely even part time, and keeps me there until midnight. Nobody else at the job ever really explained anything either, especially him, which was a bitch. All he did was complain when he didn't see me doing something that I wasnt taught. And bear in mind, whenever anyone showed me anything, I paid complete attention and learned after being showed it once. After a week though, he decided that I wasnt at the level they wanted me at, despite teaching me nothing, and fired me. On the plus though, I never have to go there again, and I have time for all my homework, so overall it's pretty good. ",
            "Saw that one popular post about the barista doing dishes whatever. So here\u2019s something that it reminded me of. \n\nI\u2019m currently 15 and during the summer, my cousin was working at a summer camp, and told me about how the camp needed kitchen staff because one had quit. No wonder they quit, the job sucked! I was told I would be able to start work some times at 8:00, and sometimes at 7:00. But for my first 2 weeks, there was only the head cook and another kitchen staff my age, so I would either start at 6:30 or 7:00. And pairing that with the fact that for some reason we had \u201cstaff snack\u201d till around 11:30, I would only get around 7 hours of sleep every night. We did have a schedule for the week\u2019s meals, but the head cook (a 60 year old lady) would never stick to it and constantly rearrange it without telling us, so we never really knew what we were cooking for the day. The 3 of us, sometimes 4, would cook the meals for 100+ campers and staff, and put out the food and cutlery on the front table for the kids to get. \n\nI was also usually on dishes duty, and if I wasn\u2019t doing dishes from the moment people started putting them on the racks, I would never be able to keep up on the rush. For some reason, when there were only 3 of us, the head cook would usually go sit down and eat while I did dishes, and the other cook would put leftovers away. So I would have to, fix loading mistakes campers and staff would make putting dishes on the racks, rinse off food and sauces from the dishes, load them all in the dishwasher, and put away dishes and cutlery. We could only have maybe 6 trays waiting to go in the dishwasher, so I had to be fast and not have any moments where the dishwasher was sitting idle, and it was only on for about a minute and a half. \n\nOne time, on one bad day where I was stressing real bad doing the dishes, I just didn\u2019t care anymore, looked for my staff friend, tried to get to them but got stuck and just cried to this other staff member I didn\u2019t know very well. The head cook had me go take a break, and I went back to my cabin and cried. I went back maybe 5-10 minutes later, and the head cook was mad at ME! For not going to her and making her \u201clook bad\u201d in front of everyone. Yes she actually said that to my face. I felt insulted and she made me go back on break. I looked around and saw a few of my friends sitting at the showers while their kids showered. I went over and sat with them and talked about what had happened. Then the camp director told me that he wanted to talk to me. I thought finally I might get some help with my job, and he\u2019s realize how hard my work is. But, instead he was on the head cooks side, of course the other adult, and also told me to not talk to the other staff while they\u2019re not on break. When they were just sitting alone outside the shower talking to each other. \n\nMany other awful things happened at this job, and I made a list on my iPod that had 6 things or so, but I deleted it when I sold my iPod, would have been good to have that. Another thing I remember was after this situation, I was doing dishes with the head cook and went out to put a tray away and said something to another staff as I was putting it away. The head cook who was obviously annoyed she was working instead of eating her food, said something like \u201cyou better not be talking while I\u2019m doing this work\u201d UMM NO SWEETIE. Not sure if this was my second or last week there, but I quit the job after 3 weeks working, and one week off on vacation. Since I was only paid 200 CAD a week, I didn\u2019t have much keeping me there, other than my first job reference. \n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of my pay, in CAD:\n$200 a week, with weekends off\n$40 a day for 5 days of meals each week (breakfast, lunch, dinner, camper snack, late staff snack)\n<$4 an hour for about >10 hours of work a day\n\nSo I got paid ~$4 an hour, and minimum wage for a high school student is $14 an hour. \n\nI hated that job. \n\nGeez that was a lot, here\u2019s a TLDR:\nHad awful job in a summer camp kitchen. Had to do dishes alone for 100+ people. Got overworked one day and cried. Quit after 3 weeks of work since I only made $4 an hour ($14 minimum wage). ",
            "good job keeping your cool, i wish i was that levelheaded ",

            "Really interesting to me how owners/managers sometimes can't do the work they employ people to do. I work at a bar/coffeeshop/restaurant and the owner has a hard time doing anything that doesn't involve making coffee. He's a really great guy but sometimes when we're unexpectedly busy he'll try to come and help us at the bar and can't even put in a food or drink order correctly on the POS, and it actually slows us down instead of helping speed things up.",
            "I don\u2019t really know what the problem with hand washing is anyways like it\u2019s honestly not unsanitary...",
            "I can only speak for my own dishwashing experience, but a combination of \u201cprewashing\u201d by hand and using the dish washing machine helped me clean the fastest. \n\nDefinitely requires technique that i had to learn. It sounds like this restaurant needed more dishes so the turn over didn\u2019t need to be so immediate!!\n\nUgh I used to have to prep food and do dishes. Downtime I\u2019d be scrubbing floors. People (my parents) look down on dishwashers like it\u2019s for losers or dummies. It\u2019s hard, honest work. Like this story shows, it takes dedication and know how.",

            "The idea of serving people with hand washed dishes is pretty gross. Why didn't someone get on this as soon as it started? A cafe would be shut down in an instant here if things weren't going through the washer. Most of them are designed to save time as well, though I guess if you don't have enough cups in rotation you'd be screwed. Ugh. I know your pain, it's such a bummer.",
            "So you NEVER had disposable cups for coffees to go? This sounds completely unrealistic. I don't doubt you may have busted your ass working this place, but to think it all hinged on DISHES for a COFFEE shop where the majority of customers will always want a to-go cup? This is just asinine. No coffee shop has a dedicated dishwasher that is THAT busy. Come on, FFS. 90% of customer will take their shit TO GO. I worked holiday season in the ONLY coffee shop in the biggest mall in a few counties in Syracuse, NY. Nancy's Coffee Cafe, Carousel Mall, 2006-2007, before Starbucks and Dunkin moved into the mall. We NEVER used washable dishes. I was making 3 drinks at a time during the busy hour, with two other people working with me. \nWe used paper cups for MOST drinks. Espresso went into the same containers for a few drinks at a time, cleaned as time permitted. Each milk steamer/thermometer was rinsed properly between each usage with hot water, properly cleaned, time permitting, all up to code. \n\nIf you worked a random 'coffee shop' there would be no cutlery, no trays. There would be PAPER CUPS. Maybe plastic utensils for scones and muffins if you offered it.\n\nIf this is somehow true, you worked for the biggest idiots to ever run a coffee shop, and you somehow pushed through minimum wage getting consistently overworked for no reason. But even then, even hand washing coffee mugs every 5 minutes, you would barely be busy if you could simply hold a sponge. ",

Not like the, \u201cI spend all of my money on DoorDash and weed so I don\u2019t have enough money to go out with friends,\u201d kind of broke, but rather the, \u201cI once ate a piece of cheesecake that I found on the side of the road because I was hungry,\u201d kind of broke. \n\nAnyhow, I have managed to find a way to swindle a certain convenience store to unwittingly give me coupons that I could use to get free food every now and then. I had worked there before, so I knew how to take advantage of their coupon system as much as they had taken advantage of me while I worked there. Well, one day I had gotten $11 in coupons which I was very excited to use to buy myself some groceries. \n\nNow, convenience stores are great, but when it comes to groceries, well, they aren\u2019t grocery stores, so options are a bit limited. Of course, for me it\u2019s free, so I\u2019m not complaining. \n\nSo I\u2019m walking up and down the aisles, looking for something slightly nutritious so that I can eat real food and not get that groggy \u201cI\u2019ve been eating nothing but peanut butter and bread for the last week\u201d type of feeling. You know the one.\n\nAfter grabbing some peanut butter and bread, a stack of pink catches my eye. My heart drops. Could it be? Do they have...meat? My legs pull me over to the meat stack faster than I can process this miracle, and I am suddenly face-to-face with a giant stack of packaged salami. Finally, some good fucking food. \n\nI grab myself a package of salami, and it becomes my new best friend. I imagine our life together. The sandwiches, the snacks, and best of all, the satisfaction of having a real meal. I put the peanut butter back and exchange it for some mayonnaise and mustard. Peanut butter had gotten me through some hard times, but sometimes you just gotta upgrade. I\u2019m sorry, old pal. Papa just needs some meat. I go to the checkout stand with my salami, beaming like a maniac. \n\nAfter getting home, I am ecstatic about this meat, and I immediately unwrap the Salami. As soon as I begin peeling it, I realize my mistake. \n\nInstantly, the wrath of Genghis Khan charges directly from the meat to my nostrils with a weaponized stench that pulls at my stomach. This is no salami. This is a foul, vile monster. I try to reseal the Salami to contain its stench, but it is too powerful. The Salami refuses to be contained. Panicked, I scour the house for anything I can find to vanquish this terrible monster that has let loose in my house. I happen across a freezer bag, into which I throw the Salami. \n\nThis displeases the Salami. Furious, the Salami begins planning its revenge. \n\nThe freezer bag contains the stench for now, so I place it into the fridge to return to the store the next day. My thinking is that the freezer bag will subdue the Salami until the next day. But I am a fool. A jester, and a clown. Overnight, the Salami rebuilds its arsenal.\n\nThe night passes, and I am ready to rid myself of this foul demon. I open the fridge. \n\nThe most putrid, insulting, horrific smell rips its way out of the fridge, grabbing me by the nose and tearing it clean off. The taste of salt fills my mouth, and I am unsure if it is from the Salami or the tears streaming down my face. I rush to grab another few freezer bags and contain the Salami as best as I can. The signature stench of the Salami has filled the room. It\u2019s not going away on its own, so I open a window and head back to the convenience store with Salami in one hand and a receipt in the other. \n\nI arrive, and make my way to the cashier. As usual, I look malnourished and have baggy clothing, marking me as a \u201csuspicious customer.\u201d I go to send the Salami back from whence it came, but the cashier has suspicions of my return. Of course. \n\n\u201cSo why exactly are you returning this, sir?\u201d \n\n\\*Please don\u2019t make me open the bag.\\* The displeased Salami becomes eager.\n\n\u201cIt smells really bad. I would open the bag, but I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d  \n \\*Please don\u2019t make me open the bag.\\* The Salami knows what is to happen.\n\n\u201cSir, I can\u2019t do the refund if it\u2019s in this bag. You need to take it out to return it.\u201d  \n \\*You are making a mistake.\\* The Salami is preparing to strike.\n\n\u201cI put it in a clear bag, so you can scan the barcode through the bag. Trust me, you really don\u2019t want me to open this.\u201d  \n \\*Please, for the love of all things holy, do not make me release this monster.\\* The Salami is foaming at the mouth.\n\n\u201cSir, I can\u2019t do this return without you opening the bag. Either open the bag or take it home. I can\u2019t refund your money if it\u2019s in a bag.\u201d\n\n\\*I worked at this chain for three years and that has never been a policy. I don\u2019t know why you would make that up other than to somehow catch me in some act, but please, just trust me\\* The Salami suddenly goes silent. It is ready.\n\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it is our policy.\u201d\n\nNo, it isn\u2019t, but if you insist, then very well. Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you. I barely crack open the freezer bags, and the Salami, furious, bursts out with a stench so sour that even the Karen in line behind me pulls her mask over her nose (actually). The cashier begins coughing as I pull the Salami out of the bag. She apologizes profusely about the foul-smelling meat and scans the beast before issuing me $5.99 in store coupons. I take the bag with me, leaving no line of defense between the cashier and the Salami. You said you can\u2019t accept bags, right? Well, I guess I\u2019ll just keep these bags then. She tries using a store bag to contain the Salami, but to no avail, as the store bags aren\u2019t airtight. You didn\u2019t want my bags, so have fun working next to the Salami until the line dies down.\n\nI grab two jars of peanut butter and buy them with the coupon, and head back home to have me some peanut butter and bread. Should have just stuck with ole reliable.",

So like any other group theres always a slacker who just piggybacks off of everyone elses work. This project spanned the entire length of the term and this slacker just did the absolute bare minimum or nothing at all for each of our deliverables. \n\nSo here comes the end of the term and we have to submit our final report which had to include a video demo of our app and this made up a significant portion of the marks. Of course the slacker puts it off till the last possible min to tell us he's not home and will be busy the day of submission. Our group was planning to record the last day cause the rest of the project had to be finished to demo it. So obviously im pissed cause this dude is just being a huge pain but I tell him \"its all good man, we'll just cover your part in the demo!\". He happily agrees as he wont have to do shit once again.\n\nHere's the kicker, in the requirements of the demo **every** member has to be in the recording or you wont get any marks for that portion. Clearly this guy didnt read the rubric and so he thinks hes getting a good deal. If you didn't participate in the demo you get a zero for that portion. Bet this guy is gonna be confused why his marks are so much lower than the rest of us.",

I was chosen as a leader, meaning I got double the work of everyone else.  My team won the contest by a huge margin, but only because I dropped a few team members for showing how unwilling they were to do any work.  The other team didn't think that was an option.  The three people I dropped, consulted with the instructor and chose to drop the class before receiving a failing grade.",

            "I've done something similar. Kept a guy from graduating on time. I've posted the story before. See below:\n\n\nI had something similar happen in a split level class when I was doing grad school. Being the grad student, I was in charge of managing the group project. One of the students never showed up despite me always messaging him to do so. In the end, I had to do his portion of the project. He emailed me a day or so before we submitted it and asked something about it being done. I submitted the final report without his name on the document, and gave him a 0 on a student evaluation we had to fill out. He was supposed to graduate that semester. I was only mildly surprised when I saw him the next semester still on campus.",
            "I had a class that was like this, except the group project was 100% of the grade. Groups were randomized, and the group I got was 4 slackers and me. Every week, I would try to organize a meeting so we could work on the project, and they would all be busy so it never happened. 3 weeks into the class, everyone but me dropped the class, and the instructor told me I couldn't do it myself because the class is explicitly a group project, and I couldn't join any other groups because we were already 3 weeks in, so that group would be giving me their grade up to that point.\n\n\nI petitioned each group, and one eventually did allow me to join, but most of that group also did bare minimum work for the entire class, so I ended up doing most of the group work myself and ended up getting an A.",
            "I was a hotel management major at UMass Amherst. I joined the management training program at Hyatt Hotels after graduation in 1987. This program was highly regarded as one of the best in the industry. I was one of three management trainees at the property.  After several months on the job, the three of us were assigned responsibility for managing the annual United Way fundraiser. This task was in addition to our regular 50 + hours a week working. I realized that to be successful we had to start immediately. I organized meetings and presentations to the departments. my two colleagues declined to get involved, citing their daily responsibilities as being their priority.  They failed to appreciate  the fact that our GM had made a commitment to the United Way to exceeding  previous years totals. Halfway through, they were removed by our supervisor from the project due to their lack of effort.  I was given sole responsibility and ended up exceeding the target.  I was recognized by the United Way and this proved to be a career making accomplishment.",
            "I was always the lazy one in my groups, but at the same time I\u2019d get high ratings from the other members. \n\nMy strat was never to ghost or ride the group, instead I\u2019d organize it. I\u2019d volunteer to be the person who kept in touch (before group chat apps), would chase down people to get their chunk done, would write the segues, introductions, conclusions, etc. \n\nNone of that was hard, and it meant i didn\u2019t do any actual research, but people appreciated it. I think it was because I basically turned the group project into individual projects for everyone.",
            "I had the opposite of this happen in college. An entrepreneurship class where the entire grade came down to a huge presentation at the end of the semester. I had done my share of the project and putting the presentation together, but due to a family emergency could not do the presentation. It had been made clear to us that missing a presentation meant a 0. I called the prof instead of emailing him and told him I would have to retake the course as I would be missing the presentation, no questions. He told me not to worry about it and to take care of my family. He asked the group if they would be ok with me receiving a mark even though I didn\u2019t present and they said yes. I finished the course with a mark slightly higher than my group mates, but kept that to myself. In private I asked the prof how that was possible and his answer was \u201cI know from pst courses that you are a very strong presenter, and they screwed it up in ways you wouldn\u2019t have\u201d",

            "This is where having a method to track who provided what deliverables as part of the project is helpful. Some data sharing programs can track who accessed the shared folder and what they changed.

The logs show who worked and who didnt.",

To this day he still messages me from time to time. Although we got an A, I still think I took away a helluva lot more just connecting with a foreign student. Man I appreciate that dude.",

            "Had a project like this in school where 4 of us had to draw up a networking diagram for this church the teacher went to.  We all met a few times (4) but she only attended once.  Emails to her were unanswered.  After class we'd give her what she was responsible for.  She never gave us anything back.  The 3 of us did her work and turned it all in.  The teacher required us that we put her name on it despite her doing none of the work.\n\nShe asked us to give her a copy 2 days before so she can learn her part.  I ghosted her and day of the class \"Oh, sorry, no copy\".  i covered my part, the next person did theirs, and she tried to read the slides word for word.  The teacher started asking questions and she had zero answers.  \"Did you not do this portion?  This was your part right?\"  \"Yes but they didn't give me a copy of the presentation\".  \"Right, but you did the research so you should know this\".  \n\nShe failed the class and I told the instructor \"She was clueless because she literally did nothing.  We did all of it\".  He tried to tell me \"You probably should have given her a copy though so she can read over it\".  I laughed and simply told him \"Nope, even if it affects my grade, I wanted her to look stupid and she did\".",
            "As a teacher, any group project I've ever assigned had distinct, individual parts. No partner would need to rely on someone else to get theirs done. No group grades would be given, only individual grades.\n\nThis way, students could still work together, socialize, feel safer while presenting to the class, but your grade was totally dependent on what effort you put forth.",
            "Collaborative assignments are the worst invention. Sure they can prove that a student can work in groups but they can also unfairly penalise hardworkers due to circumstances outside their control.\n\n Im not all sore about the few marks that were lost on a whole-class assignment in my final year that dropped my mark just below the threshold for  a first class honours degree.",
            "In highschool my friend got paired for a project with another student who basically straight up told him \"I'm busy, you'll have to do this on your own\" and my friend said \"sure, no problem\". So he did the project on his own, put his own name on it, and handed it it alone. The other student was obviously pissed and they had a meeting with the teacher where my friend explained that he did the entire project himself and so he's submitting it as a solo project. The teacher said unless the other student could prove that they had contributed to it in some way, they would get a zero for the project. He couldn't, and did receive a zero.",
            "Last term at university I carried my entire group project so hard and I ended up with the worst marks out of everyone in my group. \n\nThere was one other half decent guy in my group but the only other person was useless, and we were 1 person short to start with (3 instead of what was supposed to be a 4 man group).\n\nI was, by a significant margin, the most experienced programmer in my group, so I put hours upon hours into the project over 11 weeks absolutely non-stop with several all-nighters.  Then because of how much time I put into that, I didn\u2019t follow the course content too closely as I already knew how to do all the programming. This meant I didn\u2019t learn very much of the theory. \n\nSince the project was entirely coding based, I ended up carrying (alongside the other useful bloke) the project across 3 separate assessments on it to an average of over 90. The exam on the other hand was heavily theory based. \n\nNow, because I put so much work into the assignment, we all got a great mark and we all got the same mark, but the other 2 had plenty of time to focus on the theory content. So now they have all the theory knowledge and a good project mark, and I just have the mark. I ended up buggering up half the exam and ended nowhere near what I had hoped for / what I deserved in that course and the others did pretty well.\n\nI put in so much effort with very little reward. It makes university work quite discouraging and my marks sometimes suffer because of this.",
            "I think I once was seen as the lazy one in the group. Here's my story.\n\nI was doing a class unrelated to my major. Which meant I knew no one in the class. We had to create groups of 5 and I ended up in a ok group. Only two people knew each other prior to the project, but they all did a major related to the subject, except for me.\n\nWe planned meetings to go over the project and discuss the deliverables. All was going pretty well, I tried to contribute, but my contribution was (in their eyes) less valuable because it was outside my expertise. They didn't really listen to what I had to say, and as the quiet kid I stayed silent after a while (still did preparations and stuff tho).\n\nSo this one day we had to do a field excursion to a specific town with three of the members of the group. It happened to be were I lived and I always rode my bike to uni. The others agreed to go by bike as well as they lived nearby too. However, at some point they decided to not go by bike but take the bus. Which is fine, but I didn't know until I had already driven my bike to uni for my classes. I couldn't leave my bike there because I needed it later that day. I ended up not participating in the excursion because when I was almost there they had already finished up.\n\nI felt like they had shut me out on purpose, but again I didn't complain. At that point I think they'd just decided I was a waste of time, so when it was time to divide work for the final project, they divided it without me and just assigned me some part (the conclusion I think). I was a little pissed about that, but sure, whatever. I try to do my part as best I can, but they wouldn't really share their thought process with me so writing a conclusion, simply based on the text they wrote (without understanding some of the underlying things) was hard. I think they rewrote most of it in the end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey probably would have accomplished the same regardless of my contribution, but I felt really shut out, even though I really tried to contribute. Not all lazy ones are actually lazy, sometimes we just don't fit into the group socially and or practically and things just don't work out.",
            "I made a guy cry one time in class because he failed to deliver his part of the project for the third week in a row. I told him that it was unacceptable, and that if he was working for me he would be fired. He acted like nobody had ever called him out for being a lazy sack of crap before. Hopefully he learned from the experience.",

I ended up doing 98% of the project and when we presented it, it came out at as an A. Although I didn't know until later than my friend went to the professor beforehand and told her that I did all the work and he didn't do any of it, and that she should take that into account when grading me. My friend ended up retaking it at a later time slot (he's not a morning person) and actually passed the next year.",

He demanded we give him leniency and not turn him into the professor because we couldn\u2019t understand. Unfortunately for him, the rest of the group (other than me) were women returning to school who were also working and had families.

She and I kept him in the loop, made sure he knew all the dates, times and places, and it was back in 2001, so pre-group messaging, but we all had school email, so at least that was proof to our professor that we\u2019d let him know. And that was good because he did nothing. A week or so before the project was due, after we had already done everything, she and I went and talked to the professor.

Before the odd-sized groups convened, I always asked the teacher \"Instead of having an odd one out, or a weird sized group, can I just use the time to do the entire project on my own?\" and they looked at my grades, looked at me, looked at my grades again and usually just shrugged and said \"Sure, why the hell not.\"\n\nI didn't want people taking credit for my shit, and I didn't get along with anyone that well, but that was after a TEACHER plagiarized my work, and credited it to his kid or alter-ego, idgaf. >.< It was a comic, and I'm glad I signed the work no less than four times in the twelve panels I drew, because that ended up working against him.",

Not help with the report, not show up to team meetings, and not show up to class. We had to do a presentation on our design and every group member needed to be present, which he was. Thing is though, he never made any effort to work on the presentation.\n\nThe night before, we saw all his slides empty and so decided to put in like a couple text boxes that said things like: Shitbum (not his real name): talk about gear design, then to the left a blank space and it said, \"put a picture of one of the helical gears here\"\n\nHappened for both his slides. Professor hated it, gave us a C in the presentation but didn't matter cause we got an A+ on the report.

We were supposed to record changes in the animals behavior with the change in seasons, the do a presentation on those changes as well as research normal behaviors for the animals vs what you would see at the zoo.\n\nWe had 3 student groups, and one of the people in our group was insistent that we do it on penguins. I felt that picking an animal that lived in a climate controlled building wouldn't really work and the third person agreed with me that lions would be a good idea since they don't natively experience a Chicago winter. Penguin kid insisted, got angry, and stormed off.\n\nMonths later, we did our presentation. It was an entirely automated PowerPoint with voiceover recorded so I just started it up and sat down. Goes all the way to the end and the credits roll. Penguin kids name wasn't on it.\n\nThe teacher finally figured out that it was weird that one kid in the class never received a grade. He said he was part of our project, we explained that he refused to work with us so we just assumed (we didn't actually assume) that he cleared it with the teacher. \n\nThe frustrating part?

            "When I was in university I took a class called \u201cSoftware Engineering\u201d which was on the processes involved (ca. 1999).  We had to design a piece of software and write all of the documentation needed to produce it (it would be considered waterfall today.)  It was also worth a large chunk of our grade, and also required a presentation. (I\u2019m kind of wondering if this is the same class OP took, just 20 years later and modernized a bit.)\n\nWe divided the design document into chunks and each of us wrote a piece of it. Then we would put all the pieces together to form the design document.  One guy\u2019s part was really poorly written. It was so bad we had to rewrite it completely. Which we did. The guy freaked out and said he was going to go to the professor about it.  Because a teammate and I lived on campus we were able to get to the professor before this guy was. So together we went and explained what was happening:\n\nThat his work was sub-standard and we had to rewrite it, that we had to carry him through the project, and we wouldn\u2019t have had to come to the professor if the guy had just accepted our changes.\n\nAs we are sitting there talking to him the professor\u2019s office phone rings. The professor points at the phone receiver as he talks, it\u2019s our teammate. The professor says to both us and our teammate on the phone,  \u201cok, I know how to handle this.\u201d  He took the guy off our team and told him to write his own document from start to finish. \n\nWe did our presentation, handed in our document, everything went well. A couple weeks later the professor announces that not only did our group get the highest score in this class, we got the highest score of all his classes that year.  It was one my proudest moments as a Computer Science student. It was a huge project and one I was really proud of having completed. That I didn\u2019t have to share the glory with dead weight was some extra sparkles thrown on top. \n\nGuess who failed the assignment: Mr. \u201cI\u2019m going to the Professor because you won\u2019t accept my substandard half-assed group submission\u201d",

I get it\u2019s supposed to prepare you for working with people you hate at your actual job, but damn college work is a million times more stressful when you\u2019re doing it for more than one person. I had two different group projects in college that pissed me off. \n\nThe first one was to make a PowerPoint about a country in the Caribbean or something like that. Our group got Jamaica and groups were picked by the professor so I was with three other students I didn\u2019t know. One of them missed our first time working on the presentation together and then the second time we all met up she had completely changed the entire presentation without telling anyone. I was the one who had done all the work creating it at the first meeting and I was furious when I saw what she had done. I didn\u2019t participate at all during that meeting. Luckily that particular professor let us grade each of our other group members to get an idea of how much work each one put into the project. I gave the girl low marks and explained that she had changed all my stuff without asking and after skipping the first meeting. I\u2019m hindsight it wasn\u2019t worth that much of our grade in the class and I was already acing the class so I really shouldn\u2019t have worried about that one lol.\n\nThe second one was in a history class and we were supposed to be designing a museum exhibit and writing a little paper about it plus making a presentation. I had two decent group members and then the third one was a foreign guy who didn\u2019t even show up to class so we pretty much ignored him. He didn\u2019t communicate back to us much when we tried to set up meeting times to work on stuff anyway. But what pissed me off with this one was we were going to meet in the library to work on the project one night and I told the other two group members that I had a weekly meeting that is usually over by 8 and that I would be there after that. So I have the meeting, then go to the library and look everywhere for them but can\u2019t find them. I send texts asking where they are and one of them, who was a commuter from a town about 30 minutes away and happened to be the mother of a toddler, told me that they had stayed until 8 and then left when I didn\u2019t show up. That frustrated me so I replied that I told them the meeting usually goes until 8 and that I had no way of knowing exactly what time it would be over. I think I also asked why they came way before 8 when I told them I wouldn\u2019t be there until after 8. She responded that she has a child to take care of and also a drive back to her home so she can\u2019t hang around on campus all night. Dude, if you already know you\u2019re staying on campus to work on a project maybe you should make some childcare arrangements ahead of time. That\u2019s not my problem.

            "This reminds me of a time when I was in a group with my environmental science class at my local community College. One person was an aquantience of my best friends so I guess she decided since I'm super smart and knew my bestie I would just do everything. There were two others in our group. So in total one guy and three girls. The guy and I both ended up doing it all. It was a PowerPoint  presentation about ethics of using corn as possible fuel. Basically pro and con. The other two girls kept putting everything off (I wasn't as good about speaking up at the time) so I told the friend of the friend to do the references. I sent a  list over and all she had to do is alphabetized it and paste it....well she didn't even do that. I ended up doing it. During the presentation they didn't even know what we were talking about I ended up just handing her my notes cause I just wanted it over with. When we had to grade eachother for participation I gave her a zero. I told my bestie after that I didn't want to ever work with her again.",

I was willing to do most of the work but they wouldn't even answer basic questions on presenting, or couldn't. I skipped class the day of the presentation because I already had an A and could take the hit np. The only sad part was that I didn't get to watch them fail.",

The professor said the group exam questions were too long for two people to finish during exam time so we had to dissolve our group and each join a different one. The groups also did projects at the end of the class but I didn\u2019t have problems with that because I got grouped with people who were also majors in subject and needed the credits to graduate.",

We covered again, but made it clear this wasn't going to continue.\n\nWhen it happened the last time, we called him on it, talked to the teacher, and kicked him out of a group.\n\nIt was particularly difficult because we knew his problems, we were good friends, and we worked well together. But there was a limit to how much we were willing to do, and it was a very difficult conversation to explain to him that we were not going to earn his degree for him.\n\nUnfortunately he dropped out. He may have joined again to work with a different group of students, but he didn't graduate with us.",

You couldn't score yourself of course.\n\nThese worked as a direct modifier on your final grade. The project itself was assessed, given a mark, and then your individual mark was changed based on the average percentage the rest of your group did.\n\nTwice in group work I had the slacker. Both times I gave them 5%, and assumably the rest of my group were similar, because in both cases we would all get like 70-80 (considered a good grade in UK university; 70+ is the top band) while the slacker in both cases got a fail (under 40). First one was in first year and he dropped out, the other was in final year and I believe she failed the degree. (You are allowed one mark of 30-40, but as a slacker she had multiple anyway)"

No, at 5pm a series of alarms would go off and everyone would stand up in the middle of the meeting to leave.\n\nDoes operations need technical support at 4:55?
