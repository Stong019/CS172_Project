        "selftext": "A few years ago, I worked at a big retail company and had for many years. Eventually I went through enough gradschool education to get my license to work at a higher level. Much more pay, more job satisfaction, more responsibilities, fancy title, but the job market was rough. I stayed on with my company to work in a \u2018floater\u2019 position, where I would cover a large area and work at all the stores within that area on a rotating but irregular basis. Eventually I wanted to get a staff position, where I have a single store assigned. The area was huge, the furthest store being over a 100 miles from my home, and that is exactly where I was assigned to train for the new role.\n\nIt was a rough store, folks in my position were robbed and assaulted at gunpoint, neighborhood was very unfriendly, volume at the store was among the highest in the state. Staff turnover was, as you might expect, extreme.\n\nWell, after training I wasn\u2019t really being scheduled to float to other stores. Once a month, at most. I asked to be scheduled a little more diversely, since most of the stores in my area were much closer to my home and didn\u2019t require 4 hours of driving a day. Bossman told me that I was the only floater experienced enough to handle that store. I didn\u2019t buy it, but what can you do right? Well a colleague told me about the mileage reimbursement policy. Floaters working at a store more than 50 miles from home can file for reimbursement of mileage over that 50 miles each way, can even include meals. So I filled a few of these out and sent them to my boss to sign. He didn\u2019t quite refuse, but he never actually signed and filed them. I suspect as soon as I left his office at our district center he tossed them out. Bossman tells me later that they must be \u201clost in the system.\u201d Eventually the same colleague showed me how to fax those same forms to accounts payable, bypassing the district bossman. So I started doing just that.\n\nOne day Bossman calls me in a panic. He wants to stop my filing the forms. I ask to be floated closer to home, but he won\u2019t budge. He needs me at that miserable store. He promises me he\u2019ll make me a staff role at that store if I promise to stop faxing those forms. Staff roles are a promotion and usually come with better pay and a few other little conveniences, so I agree. Bossman says there won\u2019t be a paybump right away, but that it\u2019ll come down the road. That never happened.\n\n2 years later the situation at the store has become too toxic for even me. I ask to step down from the staff position to be a floater again and be allowed to float to other stores. Bossman says that I am already a floater, never was in a staff position, but that he can\u2019t let me work at other stores because it\u2019s better for me and the customers if I stay there for \u201cfamiliarity.\u201d \u2018Floaters\u2019 do not get scheduled to stores exclusively, so I am being singled out because they are still desperate to cover that dump of a store.\n\nI\u2019m livid, so I start looking. It took me months, but eventually I found an opportunity to make my dream career transition.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI put in my formal notice and that\u2019s when the fun started.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemember that whole mileage reimbursement policy? Well I kept meticulous track of all my shifts, and there is no statute of limitations baked into the policy, so I started filling out those reimbursement forms to retroactively cover every single shift from the past 2 odd years.\n\nI skipped the meal part since I didn\u2019t want to go through all that effort of finding receipts. I had a friendly store manager sign off on them, and I started sending them to Accounts Payable directly again.\n\nI didn\u2019t fax them all in at once, but for each shift in my final 2 weeks I faxed a few dozen in (we still have fax machines in that line of work, believe it or not) I figured, what do I have to lose? Worst case scenario, Accounts Payable declines the forms.\n\nOn my last few shifts I started getting the checks from accounts payable. Not added to my paycheck but sent to me directly. Mileage reimbursements are non-taxable income, so this was all tax-free money coming to me.\n\nIt must have taken a while for the charges to show up on a balance sheet, because a few weeks after my final paycheck I got a call from my now former Bossman. He wasn\u2019t happy. He got some big loss-prevention manager involved and together they started saying I was breaking some rule by requesting the payments. They specifically claimed I was ineligible because I agreed I wouldn\u2019t be eligible in a staff position. They then threatened legal action against me if I didn\u2019t remit the full amounts back that same week.\n\nBut I had the email chain from when Bossman said I was never staff, and always a floater. I politely referenced that email chain before letting them know firmly that because I was lied to, our prior agreement didn\u2019t apply and I was fully eligible all along. Corporate policy, as confirmed by HR, agreed with me, so I let them know I wasn\u2019t returning a single penny.\n\nIn the end the reimbursements amounted to well over $21,000 USD, and I transitioned into my dream job. I could say that I would trade that money back for the time I lost commuting to that miserable store (4 hours every shift), but all that pressure motivated me to making the best career move of my life.\n\nThe great satisfaction of not only professionally surpassing my old boss, but getting to tell him that his lies cost him way more on the way out is almost priceless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also shared my story and method with MANY colleagues who were being told wrongly by the Bossman that they didn't qualify for this policy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTl;dr: Boss lied to manipulate me into commuting 200 miles a day for 2 years without policy allowed reimbursements. I found out and quit for my dream job/career then filed reimbursement retroactively for a total of $21,000 USD\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 1: Thank you all for the support and comments. As many of you correctly guessed, I was working as a community pharmacist. I do want to clarify that most of my coworkers (Technicians, Pharmacists, Front-end staff) and customers/patients were amazing people. Between them and my subscription to Audible with a long list of books I always wanted to read, it made the situation such that I could tolerate that commute for all that time. The job market for retail pharmacy was/is also very rough and I can't overstate that enough. It has empowered big chains to abuse staff in this and other ways and that also endangers patient care not to mention staff mental health. I spent more than 10 months searching before I found an opportunity and that involved me leaving the profession entirely.\n\nThe District Manager \"Bossman\" and the store General Manager (who was fully complicit in the lie) are both still working for the company, last I saw.\n\nThe Moral of the story: Please understand your company policies and ignore any verbal agreements or HR-unsupported decrees otherwise. And be kind to your pharmacy staff, the job and companies are not always kind to them.",

So, I asked for the annual bonus instead. They said that Directors didn't get bonuses.\n\n8 weeks later, I was gone after working there for 5 years.

I fought it all the way to the top but he got his way and I found a job that gave me a 40% raise and then I got those banked hours paid out in full - which ended up being twice the amount of a raise I was originally requesting.  \n\n\nDont give me a raise? Sure. I get double the pay out requested anyways as well as a new job with a 40% wage increase.

            "Had a boss claim I couldn't log overtime hours. We didn't have a punch-clock but we got comp time if we worked on half days before a holiday (typically that Friday before the Monday holiday). I did the occasional field work with actual field staff and none of us could get comp time for 10 hour days (which was common). After conversing with HR, they pretty much confirmed the same thing: by not punching a timeclock, I can't technically work overtime.\n\nSo the first thing I did was cut back on my hours to MAYBE an hour or two over per week. That's because I got to work about half an hour before I was supposed to and I had nothing to do but to start work before the phone started ringing. I then (successfully) argued that since I do have a few extra hours of work that I didn't need to put in leave for doctor's appointments or I could start nickel and diming my time in the office. To say productivity in the office plummeted is an understatement: I did 3 people's work under the promise that it was temporary from the start. Boss can't force me to work longer, and he had been warned in meetings to hire the other two positions at least once each. His hands were tied.\n\nIt gets better. This is state employment.\n\nAs soon as I transferred to another agency, it became very clear that HR at the last place was just super lazy. I get to set my schedule (with manage approval) to come in and leave earlier or get every other Friday off or whatever in the first week. If I have to travel for work, food is reimbursed and I can receive comp time as long as I can prove it was over 8 hours (they only get concerned if you try to claim 4 or more hours of overtime a day), which I did simply by texting my supervisor when I got in a company car and when I parked at the end of the day. If I have a doctor's appointment, I didn't need to claim leave if it was roughly an hour and only once a week. Basically every policy the state was supposed to follow was pretty much followed (loosely, but at least followed).\n\nI never left the state. I worked at two different agencies in the same state and it might as well have been two different states in how policies were followed.\n\nI got a call about two years later. My former boss had vacated the position and I was being considered to replace him if I was interested (I had discovered that I was doing several fringe responsibilities of his job by the time I was leaving, so I had knowledge and experience). Since I had left, they had lost three more field staff and none had been hired. My replacement was hired *the month before* and had little training. And the cherry on top was the budget had been slashed about 10% since I had left. To sum it up: it was a sinking ship.\n\nNaturally, I told them no. Even more interestingly, I found out that no one in the agency punched a timeclock anymore but certain areas were allowed to claim comp time and others were not allowed to. IF I went back, I would've fought for all the field staff to get comp time from their days and collectively get roughly 60-70 comp hours **per day**. When I humored that scenario, interest in me faltered and they were clearly appreciative that I declined.",

Dan worked for Microsoft Security and was calling to let me know that my computer had been downloading malicious software, and because I was such a loyal customer he would be walking me through the steps to remove the software and fix my computer.\n\nIn case you didn't guess, Dan did not work for Microsoft, my computer was not infected, and he was not going to help me.\n\nOur conversation began:\n>Dan: Are you near your computer right now?\n\n> Me: Yes, why?\n\n> Dan: I'd like to help you check it for issues.\n\n> Me: Okay, give me a minute.\n\nAt this point, I spend a couple minutes \"finding\" my laptop and getting it booted up. Really, it only took about 20 seconds, but Dan didn't need to know this. Once I was at my laptop, Dan continued...\n\n> Dan: What do you see on your screen right now?\n\n> Me: What was that? (I wanted to make sure I heard his question correctly)\n\n> Dan: What do you see on your screen right now?\n\n>Me: Well, I see my desktop...\n\nAt this point, Dan tried to continue with his script, but I had not told Dan everything that was on my screen, so I continued.\n\n> Me: There's a clock in the bottom left corner, the time says 10:30AM, the date is December 3rd, 2017, there's a WiFi signal with full bars, there's a volume meter but I have it muted right now, there's a battery indicator showing my laptop is 27% charged.\n\nDan tried in vain to interrupt me, but there were still more things to tell him.\n\n>Me: There's an icon called My Computer, an icon called Recycle Bin, and icon called Google Chrome...\n\nYou can see where this is going - I proceeded to read off to Dan each and every icon, shortcut, folder, and file that was currently displayed on my screen. Dan never got a chance to get a word in edgewise.\n\nFinally after about 4 or 5 minutes of meticulously letting Dan know exactly what was on my screen, he asked me a question:\n\n>Dan: Can you right click on My Computer?\n\n>Me: Sure, no problem. Do you know where that would be located?\n\n>Dan: It should be on your Desktop.\n\n>Me: I know, but I can't find it. Do you remember what it was next to when I described everything to you.\n\n>Dan: It should be next to Recycle Bin.\n\n>Me: No, Google Chrome is next to the Recycle Bin.\n\nAfter a few more minutes, Dan successfully navigated me into the Start Menu to open up a Run box.\n\n>Dan: Okay, there should be a field in the Run box. Is it empty?\n\n>Me: No, it has something written already.\n\n>Dan: What does it say?\n\n>Me: The first one says msinfo32, the second one says cmd, the third one says regedit...\n\nAfter going through all the items in my Run box history (11-12), Dan let me know that he would need to call me back in a few minutes. Despite my pleas for help, Dan hung up. Apparently I wasn't supposed to follow his directions so well?\n\n\n ",

Things sound horribly out of order.  If I'm hearing this right, she's got a task bar on top of the machine, but the clock is in the lower left.  The icons for jobs are scattered everywhere intermixed with what's currently open.  I tell her I'll have to come see what's going on because I've never seen a computer screen like this in my life and have no idea how to help her blind.\n\nI drive to her location which is 45 minutes away and sit down in front of a relatively normal Windows XP machine.  Confused I ask her to tell me again, how she sees this screen.  She proceeds to start in the middle, and describe everything on it in an ever widening spiral.  Her description was accurate, but not something I could organize in my head.\n\nI had her working in 2 minutes after getting there.",

She told him I work in IT for a living and assured him I'd handle it. He pushed claiming only a Microsoft Technician could fix this problem.

And I kept asking \"well, what *should* I see??\" And he began to get very irritated and started swearing! No legitimate organization would swear first of all lol ...

When asked several times I always confirmed that and stated I was running MS-DOS 6.2 hoping he would be deterred but no. So I decided to let him run through his script all the way. \n\nNo I don't see a start button in the bottom left corner. Yes it is running and booted up, no my keyboard does not have a windows key on it. It is a standard 101 key keyboard. Yes it is definitely Microsoft. Sure I can reboot. It takes a bit for the mouse driver, cd-rom driver, himem and emm386 to run so hold on a bit, I really appreciate your patience. Close all windows and clear the screen? You mean like cls? OK, now all I see is a black screen with C:/ on it.  Do you want me to launch Microsoft Bob or something? This guy just kept running in circles, which was fine with me as I was just out on the porch drinking a beer or three anyway. \n\nThat guy actually passed me up to a tier 2, I let that guy run around a little bit and then flat out asked him if anyone fell for their BS. OHHHhhh boy did he have a mastery of the English insults. The layered and intertwined f#*&s and derogatories were amazing. It was like some sort of possessed spastic seizure.",

No my computers fine [we need to check] no, look, I work at microsoft, I know what I'm doing. [ more insistence ] okay but give me your name and badge number and let me call HQ and check who I'm talking to, you get me man? ...My man? Hello?\"\n\nThat's not verbatim but it's close. I did this two or three times, then my mom would say \"my [son] works for Microsoft, he doesn't need your help.\" And hang up. Idk if it was coincidence or if they listed our number but they stopped calling after that. I was sad, I wanted to fine tune my method and continue spewing utter bullshit their way.",

There's a significant amount of older Chinese folks in the US who were never tech savvy in the first place, and have no hope of becoming so due to language barriers in technology itself (it's better now that China has a massive smartphone market). Scammers know this and will call older folks. My dad strings them along and chats about everything, then strings them along with a Linux laptop I gave him a couple years back, and then if the scammer gets savvy, pulls out a really old windows XP laptop he has just to fuck with people.",

I strung him along for a bit, even typed loudly on a keyboard that was not even doing anything. Eventually we got to the Run part. He told me to enter some IP Address.

He proceeded to tear into me, telling me I thought I was so clever, that I wasn't anywhere near as smart as I thought, and that they **would** scam me eventually. There was a lot of swearing and threatening. \n\nThere's a really interesting [Reply All episode](https://gimletmedia.com/episode/long-distance/) about these scams, where the host digs really deep and even goes to India to meet with one of them. I highly recommend it and Reply All in general. ",
            "I got one of these. Strung the guy along for three hours across three calls; I told him I have a meeting and got him to call back an hour later. When he got to the end of his day, he said he'd call back the next day. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to kill the next day.\n\nI was on a Linux laptop and did a lot of Googling to figure out what things ought to look like to feed him info. We spent a lot of time \"downloading\" programs, including Chrome, waiting for the laptop to restart when I accidentally jostled the theoretical power cord and reading URLs very very carefully, character at a time. Once I supposedly had team view running I had fun with a supposed meeting number with a triple repeat number. I read it as a double number and it took a while to get the number to him correctly.",

            "Same \"company,\" same scrip here. I was on the phone with the guy for over two hours. I stole this from someone elses playbook, but I went the 28k broadband modem route. Even played the nostalgic tones for good effect.  90% into downloading his remote session software I told him that the connection was interrupted. I did this several times and he ate it all up. Very patient guy. After I told him I had no money and hung up, he called me back in a panic and asked me if I had friends or family that could pay him. \n\nI was happy to monopolize this guy's time. Knowing that he wasn't scamming someone while on the phone with me gave me great pleasure.",
            "Depending on how much time I have to waste I either 'read' them through something insanely long or ask to email them a file with my computer's statistics so they can diagnose it remotely. Of course, double click on THAT and you're in for several surprises! (heeheehee)",
            "I was sitting in my car after eating at a Chinese buffet when I got one of these. I've been waiting for my chance ever since I saw a YouTube video where a guy does this with a microwave.\n\nSo he asks if I'm sitting in front of my computer, I say yes, while looking at my radio.\n\n\"Is it on?\" I reply with \"yes\" and he trys to get me to hit the windows button on my keyboard. I tell him I don't see it, so he asks me to read off what I see.\n\n\"Well I have 1, 2, 3, 4, seek, scan, volume\" etc.\n\n\"Are you looking at your keyboard?\" To which I responded \"Yes, I have my radio right in front of me.\" He must have not heard the word \"radio\" because we went back and forth like this for about 3 minutes, and I kept saying radio.\n\nEventually he said he needed to speak with his supervisor and would call me back.

        "selftext": "I worked at a pretty popular department store for years, and I have to say that the customers this store breeds are the worst of the worst. This store is probably 90% of the reason that so many customers feel as entitled as they do. (\"The cashier had the hiccups, it was incredibly annoying, isn't there anything you can do for me?\" Was an actual honest to God complaint one lady had for me when I was a supervisor.)\n\nSo anyway, I was covering a break up at the registers. I was a supervisor at the time and I had also already given my two weeks notice. I was beyond fed up. It was like spring of my senior year all over again. I had no more fucks left. \n\nSo I'm up at the registers, and this lady who couldn't have been more than 40 comes up with a huge cart full. Anyone who has worked retail, you know this woman. She's got The Hair, she's smacking her gum at me while she talks on the phone, the entire transaction is delayed because I need her to pay and she starts to ignore me because apparently I'm the rude one for interrupting her phone call. \n\nShe proceeds to tell the person on the other end \"give me a second,\" and finally turns to me and says, as if I'm an impatient child testing her last bit of patience, \"yes?\" \n\n\"Here's your total, ma'am. Do you have any coupons or rewards to use today?\"\n\nShe nodded, and here is when she drops a few clippings on the counter in front of me, ignoring my outstretched hand, and turns her attention back to her phone. As soon as I look at the coupons, I see that none of them are usable. She has one that is $10 off your menswear purchase of $50 or more. She has all women's clothing. The next coupon expired two months ago. Another one doesn't start for another week, etc etc. \n\nSo I try again to get her attention. She's just as lovely and accommodating as the last time. She rolls her eyes, tells the person on the phone that she will have to call them back, and gives me another sharp \"Yes?\" \n\n\"Sorry ma'am, this coupon is expired, this one hasn't started, and this one is only for when you purchase $50 worth of menswear. Do you have any other coupons or rewards?\"\n\nShe stares at me like I had just called her mother some unsavory name. \"UH excuse me, WHAT?\" \n\nWhat could I do but shrug helplessly? \n\n\"You have GOT to be kidding me! That is the entire reason I came out here today, to use those coupons! I really can't use them?? Unbelievable. Some customer service here!\" All the while she's packing her useless coupons back into her purse and glaring scorch marks into my soul. \n\nRemember I said I was done? My patience before Shopzilla here was already at 0. She tipped the scales. I was officially in the negatives. I had negative fucks and negative patience left. \n\nSo when she said \"you should be ashamed of yourself, being so rude to a customer.\" Something in me snapped. \n\nI smiled sweetly at her, mustered up a bright and cheery expression that i usually reserve as my \"waitress\" face, and said \"I'm so sorry you feel that way, ma'am. But on the bright side, since it's Tuesday I can still apply your senior's discount! So at least you aren't losing that one, right?\" \n\nI can't quite describe her expression. I think she was angry, but I think she was more shocked. And in that state of shock, she sputtered out \"I'm not a senior!\" \n\nI mimicked her shock, trying to appear horrified by my \"accidental\" faux pas, and then immediately said \"let me take that off of there for you, then!\" And promptly took the senior discount off, bumping her total up another $20. \"I'm so sorry for the misunderstanding, ma'am.\" \n\nOh boy, she was pissed, but like I said, I think she was more shocked. She seemed a little dumbfounded, she paid, she took her stuff, she left. \n\nI will take that petty moment of satisfaction at her horrified expression to my grave. (It was even worth the write up that I did end up getting after she called the store and gave my manager a piece of her mind.)\n\nEdit: GOLD?! For my smart assery and pettiness? I told my mom it would pay off one day *wipes away a tear* Thank you, lovely anonymous redditor!\n\nEdit 2: Okay wow I didn't expect this to blow up. I've been at work and there's no way I can keep up with all these comments Haha. But thanks to everyone who gilded me, and had nice words! You guys are great. ",

This lady was being a monster bitch, going up to a register that had already been closed for the night as we were in our final hour, and impatiently scoffing since nobody was around to help her. She caused a fuss, the manager on duty had me (from the photo department) open a register just to get her out of there. She said \"what kind of shit show are you guys running here?\" And literally threw her ID on the counter while pointing at the cigarettes she wanted. We had big signs everywhere saying \"we card under 40\". In my anger, I simply handed back the ID and said, \"I don't need that, ma'am.\" She was *furious*, and the manager on duty thought it was hilarious.

Heaven forbid customers see a human drinking water!!!\n\nI also got in trouble once for turning my head away from a customer to sneeze. It was like, well what did you expect me to do? Sneeze in your face or all over your groceries? I would have thought turning my head away and into my shoulder and excusing myself was the polite approach, but apparently not.",

The line that makes any respect I have for you go out the window in a split second. \"Well, I've been a customer here for X years\" when explaining how her bill is \"astronomically\" high. She was paying like $112/m for three fucking lines. Already had a 20% discount and wanted more. She was one of those people who call customer service and bitch their way to discounts. My bill at Verizon is more than that for my phone and watch so I just looked at her with the waiter face and said \"unfortunately ma'am you already have as many discounts and I can give you in the store. Actually $112 a month for three lines is a pretty great deal considering some people pay that for one.\" She looked so offended and said \"I guess I'll be looking elsewhere for service then!\" And stormed out but not before I could give her a \"have a fantastic day ma'am!\" As she was leaving.",

One lady just asks me why im watching them, so I tried to explain that they will need my help when they go to pay. With a notorious snarky tone she said \"we don't need your help\". So I turned my back to them and watched the other registers. About 5 seconds later I hear the alert go off on their register.

If that makes you happy, do it. I've heard good things about [competitor] and that their customers really like [whatever]. \n\nAnd I don't get in trouble either because even if the cuntstomer was to leave (we know we've got them hook, line, and sinker), they wouldn't even be a drop in the bucket. \n\nInforming cuntstomers that I have a competitor's product and offering to transfer them to our competitor is apparently over the line, though.

No, I'm not really deaf at all, but my hearing is not superhuman and I don't deserve to be treated like crap for that.\n\nEventually I got fired from that job for addressing a customer's rudeness on a day when I'd had enough.It was a day with a huge sale and people were swarming in in droves and treating employees like absolute shit. I'd been working there for awhile and had developed pretty thick akin, but that day was so bad that by the last hour of my shift I was holding in tears. One lady came through my line and was exceptionally rude to me. Finally I said \"Please don't be rude to me.\" That was all I said. She blew her lid, started yelling at me, and threatened to tell my manager. I told her \"go right ahead\" and pointed out where my manager was standing. And that was the end of that job. ",

        "selftext": "Back in high school (around 2010) I used to work the closing shift at Dunkin Donuts on Sunday nights. Per company policy, I could box up two dozen donuts to bring home with me before throwing the rest out. One dozen went with my dad to work in the morning, one came with me to school - specifically my Spanish class, which was a pretty small and pretty tight knit group (tends to happen when a lot of course work is practicing conversations with each other).\n\nThis practice of bringing donuts every Monday sparked an idea in one of my classmates' heads (she's Anne in this story). Since it's so nice to have donuts once a week, we should do a weekly snack day where everyone can bring something in! They decided this would be on Thursday, and I said I'd just continue bringing in donuts every week on Monday as my contribution. Everyone was very OK with this, except for Anne.\n\nNo, no, no... this snack day was Thursday, and if you aren't going to bring in a snack on a Thursday then you aren't welcome to parcitipate. I was pretty pissed, but what can you do, it's only one snack one time.\n\nThen I got to thinking about it. I was only required to bring a snack, not something sweet or delicious or even palatable. As long as it was edible then it counted.\n\nMy next closing shift I grabbed an extra empty dozen box. I went to the store on Wednesday night and got a five pound bag of potatoes. I washed them and put them right in the box, and dropped off the box early in the morning to my Spanish classroom so nobody would get wise to the actual contents. Apparently the earlier classes had seen the box sitting on a shelf and had told our class that we had donuts. Everyone was excited. I brought them up and put them on top of the Elmo projector, trying my best not to betray the extra heft.\n\nThey all scurried up excitedly and Anne herself was the one to open the box. A blank expression turned to raw frustration.\n\n\"You were supposed to bring a snack today!\" she protested.\n\n\"I did!\" I said, walking up to the box and grabbing a potato, biting into it while making direct eye contact with her. \"You don't have to have any if you don't want.\"\n\nEveryone shuffled back to their desks, and Anne tried desperately to grasp a new argument out of thin air but it was not coming. I finished my potato triumphantly and brought the rest home for my mom after school. The box was checked, and she could not try to exclude me from the weekly snack day anymore. Everyone else in class who thought she was a bit over the top thought the antic was hilarious after they got over the initial disappointment.\n\nEdit: the story is real. If you can't fathom a teenager eating a potato raw out of spite then I don't know what to tell you except you should get out more.",

Do the chore.\n\nShe could see that I was angry and about to refuse outright, blowing the whole thing up, so she agreed that I could \"take a walk around the block\" to cool off first.\n\nWe lived in a somewhat rural part of the burbs, and the block we lived on was a square mile, give or take, which would have been about an hour or so: four miles around.  She was okay with that; the chore could wait an hour for me to get some exercise and cool off.\n\nThe block \"across the street\" was more like 12 miles around.  Guess which block I decided to walk?  Three hours later I walked into the house to find that my brother had done the chore, and none of us ever spoke of that again.",

The fact that I\u2019m bilingual has given me many opportunities, including one where a teacher in charge of an English Language Learner (ELL, important acronym for later) program gave me the opportunity to tutor students twice weekly, plus an additional fifteen minutes per every hour worked as prep time. \nOkay cool, so mondays and fridays I punch in fifteen minutes before 2:20, during my 7th hour prep, then punch out at 3:30 when the kids left. No problem, right? \n\nWrong.\n\nAt the end of the year I get an email saying I\u2019m being docked 11.5 hours that were punched in before the end of the day. I was livid. They claimed I\u2019m getting double paid, but I looked through everything I signed off on, and didn\u2019t remember seeing any restrictions on WHEN I was to punch in for those hours. \n\nWe met in the office and the district representative had me sign this document, and she showed me the contract I signed. Nowhere did it specify when I was to punch in those hours, and I brought this to both peoples attention who was present, but Federal Action Plan (fap?) Office Lady persisted, \u201cJust sign it! You can\u2019t get double paid!\u201d \n\nEnter Malicious Compliance\n\nI signed quickly, this time using my \u201c middle  name \u201c, which happens to be F$ck thi$ bull$hit. It read O f#ck this bullsh#t P.  I happen to know the person at district office , DO Savior, who will be reviewing this paperwork, and know that she\u2019ll either ask me what\u2019s up, or to have me resign an obvious Non signature. \n\nLike clockwork I got a phone call on my 7th hour prep from DOSavior. She asked why I signed like this, and why I\u2019m being docked. I explained my working with the two new students who don\u2019t speak any English all year, and even teaching them both English all year. I explained that no one said anything All Year, and that I\u2019d have made the adjustment to get paid those hours the entire school year. \n\nShe (dos) says \u201cwait a minute, you were on your prep time right? And you\u2019re bilingual? Do you have a cert?\u201d\n\nAll answers were yes. \n\nMy next paycheck was $3500 more than my standard paycheck, coming out of The FAP LAdys budget for Federal Action plans. I was very confused at first. \n\nIt appears that I CAN punch in during my contract hours if it is on my scheduled prep, and because I have an ELL endorsement (I got this endorsement working with monolingual students in the west valley ) and my direct supervisor on campus doesn\u2019t, I get paid as an ELL leader on campus, quite the stipend. So what was supposed to be a 345 dollar deduction in pay for me turned out to be ten times greater, as a deduction from THEIR department paid directly to me.\n\nSo looks like FAP lady\u2019s right\u2026\n\nI CANT get double paid. But looks like I can get DoubleQuintuple paid!\n\nTLDR- District office Paper Pusher tries to apply a nonexistent rule retroactively to save herself a Buck. She lost 11 of those \u201cbucks\u201d to me. Thanks!",

            "Way back in the dim days of prehistory I was attending college on a work scholarship when Congress decided to reeestablish the Selective Service system (post-Vietnam), and tied any/all federal education assistance to SS registration.  This meant when I went to register for classes at the start of my sophomore year, I found that I - and every other male receiving a scholarship or grant - had to divert to an extra stop in the registration queue and sign a new form asserting we had complied with the registration requirement before we could get our scholarship checks.  Only one table with a couple of attendants had been set up to handle the forms for every registering male of age, though, so that table was an understandably hectic environment.\n\n\n*I* thought the requirement was bullshit - so when they handed me the form, I scribbled \u201cDaffy Duck\u201d on the signature line and handed it right back.  I was somewhat surprised (and more than a little amused) to see them take the form and put it - with absolutely no review - on their Processed pile, where it was immediately buried under others.\n\n\nI fully expected -some- degree of blowback, but nobody ever said a word to me about it.

        "selftext": "A few years ago while I was in school and job hunting, I got an interview at a company for office work. Filing, answering phones, setting appointments, etc. I was looking forward to getting an office job instead of retail or fast food. \n\nThe building had big window walls that overlooked the parking lot so you could see cars pulling in and parking. I pull into the lot and park my car. I get out and walk into the office. Now as I\u2019m walking in, I note that there is a car parked in the handicap space in the front of the office. This car looks just like mine I should note. \n\nSo I walk in and I\u2019m greeted by the manager who kind of gives me a scowling look. It made me uneasy a little as we walked back to his office. We sit down and he is asking me questions in a bit of a clipped tone. He seems annoyed by my answers and I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on at this point. \n\nFinally he says \u201cDo you always park in handicapped spaces?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m confused so I ask him what he means. He goes on a rant about how entitled I am for parking in the handicap spot at a potential place of employment and I\u2019m just getting more lost. I asked him what is going on because I didn\u2019t park in the handicap spot, I\u2019m parked in the lot. \n\nHe argues with me and says he watched my car pull in and saw me park there. I again told him that I didn\u2019t park in a handicap spot but the car that I walked by in that spot looked similar to my car. \n\nHe says that he knows that he saw me park and get out of the car. At this point I\u2019m over the whole interview, I knew this would be a clusterfuck of a place to work for if this is the guy managing it. Then he goes a step further and says prove it. \n\nI grab my purse and get my keys out, I don\u2019t even bother waiting for him and just leave the office. He\u2019s jogging after me and hurried outside to stand and wait. His face went from smug arrogance to pikachu real quick as I walked past the car in the handicap spot.  He asked me where I was going as I walked over to my car, then I turned around and made eye contact as I hit the button on my keys to unlock it, and got in. \n\nHe was starting to walk over to me, calling out that he was sorry about the misunderstanding, but I just put the car in reverse and left. I didn\u2019t even make eye contact with him as I drove away.\n\n\nETA: this was my second interview so the manager knows what I and my car look like. I don\u2019t know why he said he saw me\u2026.I\u2019m assuming it was a lie to get me to admit I did it. I\u2019ve pondered this many a night trust me!",

            "I once was at a restaurant for a job interview(it was for a different business, not the restaurant) and was, rightfully, parked in the disabled spot. Our server came up to the table and said to me \"I know you aren't a cripple, I called a tow truck and you are going to be towed\" Of course, I showed the server my permit and let her know that I was indeed disabled. It was both hilarious(because my disability is obvious) and awkward. Anyway, I talked to management and contacted corporate about it. I never saw that server there again, and I didn't get the job.",
            "A similar thing happened to me. I was to do some consulting work and was recommended by the CEO who is a family friend. First, I had to meet the hiring manager and the person who would supervise me. The CEO texted me that I could park in his spot and just show the guards at the gate the text and they will show me where to go. \n\nWhen I walked into the building I was met by the supervisor who immediately layed into me about where I parked. He never let me get a word in and just said the interview was unnecessary. So I left. Later I got an email from the hiring manager saying that I was no longer under consideration and would not be considered for any future positions. \n\nThe CEO later called me and asked what happened. All he heard was that I was not a good fit. I told him about the parking and he thought I was joking. He told me he\u2019d call me back. Twenty minutes later, I got a call from the supervisor apologizing. At first, it was a non-apology apology. Then I heard in the background, \u201cApologize like your job depends on it.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t end up taking the job but I got a chuckle out of the whole situation.",

            "A friend of mine got hurt on her job about 15 years ago, and doesn't have use of her body from her belly button down. As a result, she uses a wheelchair to get around. She also has the handicap placard for the car as well, and we use it whenever we'd go out together (her car is so cool! Riding in the modified back of the car where it's like a bench? Not so much. You get the idea). So, from the waist up, she looks like a fit person (She always has been an active person, and she is active in the wheelchair racing community. I am so happy she finds comfort in that).\n\nFrom the few times I've gone to places with her, and the people who would try to give her all the grief (not common, but it does happen once or twice a year!). I LOVE when I watch their faces go from smugness from calling my friend out for parking in the handicap spot and how dare she and the nerve and blah blah blah blah blah, to seeing her come out of her car in a wheelchair. These people are lucky that she is a saint, and can let shit roll of her shoulders (She's of the mindset that you can't let people's smallness get to you, or else you wouldn't experience everything that the world has to offer. A great mindset, but I also don't feel that it's fair for her to shoulder all that). I've remembered a couple of instances like this, where she and I would come out of an establishment and find a very apologetic note scribbled on a napkin and left on the windshield wipers, after she was accused of abusing her privilege and parking in a handicap spot (????). So, like, how about stfu-ing in the first place, so we don't have to get here?

I spent more than an hour on that one, it hurt my final score at the end of the month.\n\nThe customer told a tall tale about how when she was trying to pay her debt to the company (she wracked hundreds of shekels worth of debt in unincluded uses), the sales representative was rude to her and refused to let her pay so she took a picture of him and left.\n\nThe reason the call took so long is because she kept telling the story out of order, adding and changing details and going on tangents and rants. It was very difficult to get the story straight. I felt like a detective trying to piece together the clues into what actually happened. Every time I read the story back to her chronologically she added or changed something in the middle or went on a tangent about how she's \"a polite British woman\" and we shouldn't hire people like that representative to represent our company. Eventually, I got her to settle down on a version of what happened.\n\nI looked through the records and saw that according to the representative (who was a lot more concise than her), she was the one being rude, yelling at him in English (a language he barely spoke) and taking his picture without his consent.\n\nI didn't tell her that, I just politely instructed her on how to pay her debt via the phone. She sounded nervous. I told her that until the debt is paid I cannot make the changes in the account including adding a report. So reluctantly she gave me her credit card details and the debt was paid in full. I reported on what she told me and moved it along to my superiors.\n\nA few days later my testing period was over and despite that tragedy of a call I aced it and got transferred to the illustrious email department, which is what I wanted. It's much more chill here and I can work at my own pace, not having to rely on the customer or the supervisor to work faster. Also, I could take my breaks whenever I felt like it.\n\nEverything is fine for a couple of weeks until I receive a new email telling a familiar tale. It was an enraged recounting of the same story I heard on the phone, except much more elaborate, with more details I never heard before, such as the involvement of another person, or that the representative assaulted the customer by trying to impede her exit from the store.\n\nThe customer complained that she's been cheated, and expected the representative to be fired, but she saw him again at the store and was outraged. She was under the impression that her paying her debt meant we will listen to her and fire the representative.\n\nThe email ends with the following demands:\n\n-Fire the representative\n\n-Reimburse her for the money we \"stole from her under false pretenses\"\n\n-Apologize to her in the form of extra compensation and a personal phone call from a high-ranking manager\n\nIf we did not comply, the police will get involved.\n\nSo I complied with the second part, and we got the police involved.\n\nYou see, while reading the email I noticed that the address she emailed us from had a different surname than her account or the credit card information she provided. And lo and behold, the email was actually her real name, while the other details were fake.\n\nTurns out she was indeed a \"polite\" British woman, a British woman overstaying her visa for over a year that was now using a fake identity in Israel.\n\nHow's that for false pretenses, bitch?\n\nAs we discovered later, she was also wanted for numerous accounts of fraud where she didn't pay for services or claimed compensation for stories that later turned out to be false. Just like she tried to do with us.\n\nWe called the police but they couldn't find her since the physical address she registered on our site was also fake.\n\nSo we called her back to the store to apologize personally. She gladly obliged. The police were waiting for her.\n\nNeither I nor the representative she implicated were there that day, unfortunately, so we didn't get to see the look on her face.\n\nShe was fined a hefty amount and then deported back to the UK.\n\nEDIT: Woah, that's a lot of positive feedback. Thank you very much, everyone. Especially to those who generously gave me medals. I used the coins to give medals to some of my favorite posts on this subreddit and others.\n\nAlso, please don't argue politics in the comments of this post.",

        "selftext": "Edit: Which\n\nTLDR at the end\n\nA few years ago I worked for a furniture stored in the back store. My job consisted of unloading and loading trucks, assembling furniture and placing it on the main floor of the store. After around 6 months there, my supervisor announced he resigned meaning his post was up for grabs. I had all the technical requirements so I applied, but they gave the job to another one of my colleague who had more experience, which was totally reasonable. \n\nAfter maybe 1 year my then supervisor just stopped coming into work for no reason he just decided he had enough and he just left, no 2 week notice or anything. So while the director tried to get to him I took over the role of supervisor. (I was the one with the most experience)  Which means that combined with my regular work, I  was now the one telling people what to do, when, doing the schedule, and all the paperwork for the shipment. 3 weeks later my colleague was officially \"fired\" by my director. In those 3 weeks I kept doing the job of supervisor, and doing it pretty well so I thought that the promotion would come to me, but my director did nothing. I went to see him, explained what I had been doing and asked if I got the promotion too which he answered that I was not qualified, nor smart enough to do this job. \n\n\nAfter some thinking I just decided, that if I was not Smart enough to do the Job, then I shouldn't do it, so I went back doing my regular job and I also started looking for something else. 4-5 days after I stopped filling in my director come see me in the back store Asking why the f*** the job isn't being done. After all without me to organize it, nothing was getting out of the store to be delivered to the client. I just reminded him of our previous meeting and he told me \" yeah I remembered that, what I meant is your not qualified to get the pay bonus for the job,you still have to do the job you idiot\" I have to admit I still wonder how he tough that would work... Still a bit dumbfounded I just told him that if I wasn't going to get paid for it I certainly won't do the job, and that considering we were already short staff with my old supervisor gone, he should be a bit more polite. Apparently this was an unreasonable request, a total lack of respect to him and worthy of firing me... Yep still don't get how that would fix anything, but hey he's the boss.\n\nI packed everything and left knowing that the back store which needed 5 people to operate was now down to 3 with the most experienced worker having a total of 4 months, it only took my boss 1 day to call me back and telling me, maybe he went overboard and that perhaps we could arrange something for the promotion, too which I replied that I would not be coming back since I had a few interviews lined up. I hung up while he was still cussing at me. After a few months at my new job I heard some surprising news, the store had closed down after 2 other back store employe resigned. Gotta admit that it felt good to see my old boss finally get what he deserved.\n\n\n\nTLDR; my old boss doesn't want to promote me but still want me to do the Job, fires me for not accepting too, and soon after I left for a better job, lost his shop.",

            "Years ago, I worked overnight maintenance at Walmart. My store manager got his hands on a new store in a bigger city, and he invited any of us that wanted to transfer to come with him. I jumped at the opportunity. \n\nI was the #2 maintenance guy at my home store, and I knew pretty much everything about the job. When I moved, the head of maintenance worked in the daytime, and knew nothing about the job, really. So, management relied on me for the night shift. Which I did. But the head started changing around things. He messed with our schedules a lot, made us come in later than the other night shift people, and we had to leave later. Our lunches were scheduled later, so a lot of times it was just me by myself. And then he started messing with our routines. So that at 7AM, when the morning rush was in full swing, I was trying to scrub the floors. No one would listen to me and kept insisting that I follow the head's orders. So, he wanted to be head of maintenance, he could be head of maintenance fully. I stopped ordering, I stopped guiding the others, I stopped doing anything that was even remotely the head of maintenance's job. \n\nWe started getting complaints from customers, and, of course they came to me about it, wondering why I was scrubbing so late in the morning, and all that. I just shrugged and said, \"Ask Oscar. You all told me to do things his way, that's what I'm doing.\" Then Oscar came to me to find out why some things weren't getting done anymore. I said, \"That's head of maintenance's job. Not mine.\" \"Bu bu but I don't know how to do any of that?\" I just shrugged and went about my job. They eventually offered me a raise and a made up title (Assistant *to* the Regional Manager...). I declined. Fuck them. \n\nGod, I do not miss Walmart.",

            "Yes! Good on you! \n\nI've worked i  hospitality for years a suffered under so many owners or \"boses\" doing very similar things.\n\nMy last role, i made very clear from the start that even with all my supervisor/ manager experience i did NOT want that role. I just wanted a simple come in, do my job, make people smile, just enjoy my work without all the BS. Owner was more than fine with this and even agreed that would be good for this particular business (basicly he had no idea how to manage a cafe, being a landscaper his  whole life and only hired people with alot of experience so he didn't have to train them etc.)\n\nSo everything's going well, im just doing what i said i wanted to do while working under the head barista/supervisor while i learned the ins and outs of this place. She decided to move on to bigger and brighter things. So i took up her hours and the owner also hired a new manager (after alot of gental words from all the staff basicly saying \"hey owner, you dont know what your doing please hire someone thar dose\")\nThis was great!! Untill this said manger stared giving themselves all the weekday day shifts and leaving the busy weekends and nights to... well me. Cause i have the experience and i wont leave my colleagues in a mess cause that just messes everyone up in the long run, i start doing manager/supervisor stuff as needed. \n\nI talk to owner about it and say \"you know what, ill do it if its needed but i wont do it for free!\" He says fair enough, show me what you can do and ill up your role in the next pay cycle.\n\nSo days turned to weeks, which turned to months. Im doing all the supervisor jobs. Till counts, rosters, stock ordering.\nEventually i say enough is enough, if you want me to be a supervisor, you need to make it official. Role, pay etc. He said well your your not a supervisor, no one asked you to you just do that stuff, its just expected now. I said \" no, ill just continue doing what my job description says from now on\" he said whatever that all you do anyways. \n\nSo for the following weekend, every customer (or karen) that complained asking for the supervisor (which can be alot!) I promptly said \"oh we have no supervisor on shift, here is the bosses number ( i gave the owners personal mobile number) contact him and he'll happily sort it out\"\n\nObviously didn't have my job long after that but  man it felt gooooooooood!",

After three years it was my turn for the role but upper management decided to give the job to a guy who had never worked our store or even in the department.

            "PRO TIP:\n\nIf you pick extra duties in an emergency, tell your boss RIGHT AWAY that you're covering the duties and WHY and that you need to get with him to discuss how the duties will be addressed going forward as soon as possible.\n\nIf he stalls, after a few days contact him again, and say, \"We have not figured out who is going to cover these duties in the future and unless we agree otherwise, I'm turning such over to YOU effective end of business today.\"\n\nIf he gets with you and tells you this is just a stop gap measure and to keep covering while he fills the position, tell him, \"I'm willing to go the extra mile here for you because I expect that my service as acting manager will qualify me to fill the position permanently and that I'll be given preferential consideration in filling the position.  If that is NOT the case, I need to know now.  Also, I'd like to know that youre making this issue a priority: can we plan to have this sorted out in two weeks?\"  If you boss balks at any of that, he is jerking you around.  You are making your very reasonable position explicit and telling him what you want, why, and how long you'll wait.\n\nAfter two weeks, if your boss tries to keep push the deadline out you can say, \"This is no longer an emergency.  You've known about this for weeks.  I have been the de facto manager that whole time and clearly this situation works for you or you would have changed it by now.  I've been patient but now you need start compensating me like a manager for being a manager.  I want your agreement that I will be filling this role permanently with the commensurate raise.  Starting tomorrow, I'll have your agreement or I'll turn the duties back over to you.\n\nEDIT:\n\nLet me add here that the power move is to point out to your boss that \"I have formulated reasonable, equitable, sustainable goals; communicated those goals to you explicitly and in a way we can track; been patient with you about meeting those goals; and now I am being firm with you about the follow up and results.

            "They used to do this at a supermarket I worked at. If someone left, the management came to us begging to cover the work and work harder etc and that they would be filling the vacancy ASAP. 3 months later we would find that vacancy has been permanently dropped because we managed to cover the gap in the rota with less numbers which meant we were fully capable of it. It was a shit show and only resulted in more people walking out. A team that needed 10 people to do the work had 4.

I wasn\u2019t too busy at night and the copier they had was horrible! It made one copy at a time. My husband was a service technician for an office supply company, so after talking with the administrator and owner, they bought a newer, much better copier. Throughout all this, I made copies of the paperwork we were low on and filed it just to help out. Once the concierge found out that I was doing that, she stopped and would leave a paper on the desk at the nurses station with my name and a make copies note attached. No please or thank you. This was her job, not mind I was merely trying to help. I set the keys to the copy room on top of the paper along with a list of instructions on how to make copies on the new copier and walked away.

When a GSA position opened up where I'd be able to get the pay *and* the position - and I'd have a more consistent schedule - I applied for it. I'd been there for about 2 years at that point, had called out 2 times, and was usually always the one to pick up shifts whenever someone needed it. \n\nI didn't get the position. Instead they gave it to a girl who had been a cashier for about 4 months. I was then told that I had to train her. To be the GSA. *I had to train her to do the job that I had already been doing but for minimum wage.* She left after a few months ago she could go back to school (she was in college). \n\nAll of the people I worked with saw the slap in the face and a few reassured me that it was only bc I was so qualified/versatile all over the store.

Minimum wage wasn't cutting it. \n\nI ended up NCNS about a year later on Black Friday (Thanksgiving night) after my GM made some inappropriate sexual comments to me.

In hindsight he was clearly taking advantage of me, but it was exciting to get to do these advanced tasks and I figured it might benefit me down the road.\n\nSo one day I was informed he had to have brain surgery for his issue and I would be working his 9 to 5 shift.  So I went from part time with random schedules to full time.  It was awesome. I did this for 6 months or so and never heard a single complaint about how I did.  In fact, I heard the opposite.  The front office told me it was great how I was able to get each days work done by 5pm every single day.  \n\nSo fast forward to the boss showing back up.  I figured I would be back to a random schedule getting my old 20 hours a week, but I figured he would be appreciative of what I had done for the company while he was gone and I would get to be his second in command.  I think he was very threatened by me, because he lumped me into the high school schedule which meant I was only getting 9 to 12 hours a week.  He had this complete idiot that had hired in years before me who he ended up giving extra hours and basically creating a special assistant role for him.  \n\nHe fucked up nearly every single day sometimes costing the company a little bit of money sometimes costing the company thousands of dollars.  Meanwhile I was working enough to cover the cost of my gas to get there, nothing more.  I started looking and was able to get into a factory with all of the summer help.  Was making $2 more per hour, plus it was a typical factory, 40 hours plus overtime every single week.  It was a much better fit for me.\n\nHowever, before I finally quit the idiot second in command dropped a product from the forks of the forklift and completely destroyed it.  Cost was around $5,000.

        "selftext": "This whole story happened in 2021 and ended in October (damn time flies),  and it is something, that puts a chesire smile on my face.\n\n**Warning!** This is a **very** extensive story, grab some popcorn ;P\n\n**Background (Ignore if you like):**\n\nIn  January 2021 I began working for a very big American company (In Europe), that was (and is) in the Energy Sector. At the Factory Plant I began working at, the Parts of Gas turbines get assessed for   restauration and reworked so they can get used again. Each single part would cost severeal thousand when produced new, and hold for like a  decade or so. Reworking cost like 1/4 of that and the part would be good for another 8-10 years, with more inspections of course for safety.  The  Customers would pay like Half or 3/4 of the cost of a new part, and   since we talk 2-8K per single part, and a Gas turbing containing **thousands**   of pieces we speak severeal Million for each gas turbine. Customer   would save a good chunk, and of course the company was sitting on a golden goose.\n\nOver the decades that meant, that the Facility where the stuff was reworked, had an absolute uncontested income, without much of competition (since the parts were their own design and production) and a \"win win\" for customer and company. Over time that lead to the problem, that competence, invention or even honesty, were not needed by the managment of the facility anymore. As long as the workers sticked to the already developed and tested processes and did their job, money would keep flowing in regardless what the office did or did not...you can see where this is going.\n\n**Setup (somewhat important) :**\n\nSo i was hired there as part of Quality Control, specifically, i was to   operate an 3D Computer Managed measuring Machine. Gas turbines get, as you can imagine, pretty hot and spin fast. And a decade of heat combined with dynamic stress has the nasty habit to deform stuff.  Can't have that for sure so, you have to measure the stuff really  precisely so  that the production knows what section of which piece needs reworking, or if a piece is too out of form to be used again at  all.\n\nThe Operation of such a  machine is not too complicated. Put the piece into  bracket, clamp it down, load the correct model and start the program. You get the measurement report then as an text file, an Excel as well as  a PDF. The Pieces (usually rotary blades) nearly always came in sets  (24-216,  depending on the size). When all are measured you compile all  the reports the machine made, into one Excel with a somewhat complicated method. Wasn't hard, i learned all that in a week.\n\nThat Machine was **immensily important** for the facility, running in 2-3 shifts per day, 6 days per week. Like  80% of all pieces that went through the reworking process had to be measured at least twice.\n\nAs nearly anyone with a technical background can guess, operating a machine and **understanding** what it is actually doing are two big different shoes.\n\nWhen i started there were only 3 guys that understood the machine properly, as well as a Technican, Vladimir who could actually fix codes, or reprogram a 3D model, if there was a problem. Vladimir however was the technican for the entire Facility (**very** busy guy) and when he had to come over, his time would need to be paid by the department, something the bosses didn't encourage so to say...\n\nOf  the 3 guys who knew the machine, Antonio is important. He had been working there for a few centuries at least, knew every nock and crany and, while being a simple worker, if shit went wrong, he  was the guy you turn to. He had a bit of a short temper and a very...blunt language, but he was honest, open and very fair.\n\nI ,myself am not the most social person: always held back, with a brutal honesty and i take my professional \"cold\" attitude a bit too serious i guess. In general, if people share my princeples of honesty, fairness and taking responsibilities serious, than we get along greatly, but with people that are less....trustworthy i basicly turn to an iceblock. Not perfect i know, but hey i don't work in retail for good reason...\n\nSo  thing is, despite some heated arguments, Antonio and me really got along swimmingly. What no one knew was, that Antonio had, over the decades, collected such a backlog of days off, overtime and what not, that he could retire two years early...and he was 63. He had decided to groom me as his successor, and began teaching me every little detail about the Measuring Machine, how to fix stuff, how to do proper maintance, why it did certain stuff and so on. He was a perfectionists, but so am i ,   so i really appreciated it.\n\nWhat  i  noticed in my first week in the company, was the biggest problem  there. The Facility had a massive problem with Cliques, clans and little circles. If you were part of the correct Clique, you could do  what you  want and remain untouchable. If You aren't, well your credit  goes to  anyone but you, and you are a fine scapegoat. I didn't cared much about it be honest. I am a bit of a rule-fanatic and stick to them even when everyone else ignores them. For me this was a well paying job, with a  horrible commute (1 3/4 hours in one direction), so i  wanted to stay  there for as long as i could, earn my money and then just take the next  job.\n\nThere was  a 4th gyus who was \"operating\" the machine, I don't remember his name, so let call him  Igor. Igor was part of the same clique as my Boss (Manuel), my Boss's boss (Freddy) , and of course his own Boss (Boris),  who was also his brother. He was  working the Measuring Machine, simple because it was the most comfortable job, he could perform. He was usually doing the Night shift, as those paid extra.  He occasionally took the Late shift,  while i always took the early one  (was the least popular, due to start at 6 am, but i liked going home at 3  pm).\n\nIgor was.... well as light  bulb, he was like a wet match in a dark basement  somewhere in a black hole. I might be a bit too harsh with him now,  but that was all i ever got to see from him. He was also pretty lazy,  rude and arrogant, after all he had an untouchable status due to his  brother's best friend being  boss of the enitre assessment department.\n\n**The Actual Story (long build up , i know):**\n\nA  good 6 month after i started there was the first incident with the Measuring Machine. We received the Material in Palettes and it was the firm rule,  that the Rotary Blades had to be sorted in   numerically order. Each had a serial number and a Set-Number. Stuff went a ton faster and easier if all was sorted clean 1-82 (or whatever the set went up to).  Ocassionaly an Order ( which were usually 2-4 Palettes) would arrive unsorted at the Measuring Machine, then we had to sort them. Since we had to   lift the blades out one by one anyway to measure them, it was not that big of a deal, just a tad bit annoying.\n\nIgor never finished a set if he could help it, leaving just one or two blades left for measuring, and even when he **had to** finish a set and start a new one, he would never compile the reports into one excel, i am pretty sure he didn't even knew how that worked.\n\nOne Morning i came to work, and like so often there was just 3 Blades left to measure, i shruged without care and wanted to just finish the order and start the next. Problem was, the Palettes were a complete mess, completly unsorted, despite them being measured. Igor had worked the late shift the day before, and would also work the late shift that day, so i would actually get to see him for a few minutes when i handed my shift over. This of course meant, that i would have to sort all of the   palettes, while also operating the machine with the next order as to avoid a delay (the machine was a bit of a bottleneck in the facility).\n\nUsually this is a chill post. The blades are never heavier than 22 Kilogramm (48 pound?), and you had like 6-14 minutes between the measurement cycles to  lift them out, and exchange them with the last measured blade. Sorting the last order took me took me 2 hours of quite sweaty work while also   operating the machine nearby, so i was somewhat annoyed.\n\nWhen Igor came in in the afternoon, i asked him in a politely manner, why he had not sorted that one order. He replied in quite a rude tone, that he wouldn't do that. I was a bit baffled and asked, if he didn't knew, that it was mandatory to do that. He simple replied, in a pretty rude tone again, that he wouldn't speak about that. Outright refusing to speak about a problem? what the hell? I told him, that if he didn't wan't to speak about it, i would have to speak about it with my boss. He just smiled in an smug fashion and told me to do that.\n\nWell, i did just that. Asked my boss about it, in the fashion of \"hey, i though we were suppose to sort that stuff, or did we change that?\". This lead to a four-way talk with my Boss, Igor, as well as Boris. Boris was  not happy at all, and my boss was  rather embaressed, because it was all clear, that i was correct, but neither of them wanted to admit that their friend had done anything  wrong. I did my usual Ice-block impression, showing a blank face, replying in very accurate and short words and staying all polite and professional. It came out rather inconclusive with a kind \"request\" that  we should please sort the  Palettes if they came in as a mess. Igor just  shrugged and it was clear that he didn't care. It happened  3 more  times that stuff came in  unsorted, but Igor managed to avoid doing it ever. okay...\n\n**Strike 1/3**\n\n6 weeks later there was the second Incident. Every morning before I started, I would maintain the Machine like Antonio had showed me to do, cleaning everything and rubbing special liquid into stone tread the Machine's arch ran back and forth on. One morning i came in,  and turned the Machine into manuel mode like every morning, so that i could run the arch to the end of the thread for maintance. A second thereafter i heard a grinding noise and instanty stopped the machine. The arch was a   aircushion based runner, kinda like a hovercraft as where the bottom of the arch would always remain a tiny bit above the surface to ensure minimum vibration. So a **grinding** sound is really really bad.\n\nI  quickly inspected the thread and found quite the deep crater in the  stone surface, maybe 2-3 cm deep (an inch) and wide, that was enough for the air cushion to loose pressure so the arch was sliding over the stone surface of the thread. This inspection also revealed scratches along nearly the entire lenght of the tread, so it was pretty clear, that the machine had been running with this crater for a good bit. Immediatly shut down the machine, informed Vladimir as well as my boss, that some big shit was going on here. I also took pictures of the  damage  with time stamps, just out of my usual paranoia...\n\nThe Machine was put out of comission, as the arch had taken damage, the entire stone tread had to be reworked and the machine needed recalibration. It was out for over a month due to that crater. That crater btw, looked exactly like the bottom corner of one of the blade... as if one had been dropped onto the stone tread...and the previous shift before me had **\\*drumrolls\\***   Igor! Of course he denied that he had done anything wrong, and he could also not recall seeing any scratches or hear any grinding noise during his shift... He tried to blame it on me, but i had reported the stuff like 5 minutes in my shift, with the last blade Igor had  measured still in the machine. Again it was clear to all who had fucked up, but again not even a harsh word to him.\n\nWhile the machine was getting fixed and reworked, we were put to different work, i got into the Pre-assessment team, where the pieces get their first evaluation. I made good friends there which would serve as my ears later on.\n\n**Strike 2/3**\n\nAfter the machine got fixed a good month later, we had collected a massive backlog, to the point that the other departments, who did the repair, were struggling to find something to do, that didn't needed measurements. The Machine was supposed to work in 3 shifts, but Antonio had left for his 2 year vacacion when the Machine had been put out for repairs, and the other two Collegues, who knew how to run (and maintain) the machine, had left for better jobs. So it was only me and Igor by then, with me working quite some overtime for good pay (all bullshit asside, hourly wage was really proper).\n\nOne morning i noticed something pretty weird, the order i had just started the previous afternoon was still not finished, again with just two blades remaining. Every measurement report has a timestamp, which i quickly had a look into. The Measurement cycle for these was like 3 minutes + 1 minute exchanging one blade for the next. For some reason the Measurement reports from Igor's shift had like 10-15 minutes gapes in between, some even half an hour. Igor was still around, as he had had the nightshift.  I knew he was a bit of a slacker, but these gapes where quite big, so i first though there had been trouble with the machine.\n\nI Asked him if he had had any trouble with the machine last night and he snapped at me, that all had been fine. I asked if he was sure and he in return inquired why i ask. I told him that there were quite some heavy gaps in between the measurement report, and that i couldn't find any error messages of   sudden stops or such. Igor looked at those timestamps for a moment, back at me and just shrugged before he went home.\n\nThat would had been the end of it, if it wouldn't had been even stranger the next shift (monday). I had, for once, not worked on saturday, so  Igor had 3 shifts in since i had last clocked out. I came in as usual, did the maintaince and cleaning and wanted to check how far he had  gotten. 4 Orders had went through since my last shift, so i assumed  that, as usual, i would have to compile the reports.\n\nBut there were **none**. I was pretty confused, searching the order's numbers, checking the machine protocol and all. The Measuring Machine had been running over the weekend with no shutdown or restart visible in the log, but also no measurement reports at all. I called in Vladimir, as well 4 orders worth of reports missing is a big deal. According to rules, i also informed my boss, that the machine was standstill due to technical issues. Both Vladimir and my Boss came in to the measuring room and we three  searched  for the problem. It took us a while to figure it out, simple to it being absolutly not exspected...**Someone** had turned off the output of the machine....maybe to avoid the timestamps.\n\nThis again caused quite some ruckus, as all 4 orders had to be measured again **with reports,** and production was really struggling now to have something to work on. Again, all clear who had fucked up...and finally Freddy had enough, but not of Igor....\n\n**The Malicious Complicance (finally XD)**\n\nThe Afternoon of the same day, Freddy, the Boss of the entire Assessment department came into my measuring room, nice exspensive suit, tie, polished shoes and went straight into my face. I was currently sitting in my chair, compiling the results of the remeasured first order, when he stood before me, giving me no room to get up. He look down on me and snapped at me, that he was sick and tired of me **bullying** my co-workers. He handed me a letter, which were the sign papers of my contracts termination, signed by him of course. He informed me, that i had exactly two options now.\n\nI could either promise to do better, apologize to my Co-worker Igor, and admit i was as fault. or i would be fired immediatly.\n\nWell...the good thing of being bullied and terrorized for most of your childhood is, you learn to keep a cool head under stress. So i reigned in my  first urge, to discuss with him or to tell him, that such was illegial.  Instead i took the letter and read through it before nodding a few times. Due to my cold, professional attitude, i was known for often remaining silent, so he took my nods as my complicance. He informed me, that he awaited my written apologize before 2 pm (all of  the bosses went home by 2 pm, and came in around 8 or 9 XD).\n\nWell, when he turned around and marched out with a smug grin, he left me  with the termination letter...with his signature on it. **Fun fact**, when both parties agree to it, a contract can be cancelled immediatly, without any further responsibilities, beside paying for already issued hours (Which go directly through Human Ressources, via the electronic timestamps of our clocking.\n\nI had two hours left until his deadline, and i spent it to carefully clean my workplace, make a back-up of my work-laptop (acc. to the rules) and then, also according to the rules, clean the harddrive completly. The Backup was put into the assigned server with all data correctly named and compiled.   But of course, the server for back-up data is marked as \"unsearchable\" as to avoid your search list getting cluttered, after all the same  parts  types came in again and again, with the same material numbers of course... If you know the rules, and knew were to search, you would find the stuff within 20 seconds, if not... well good luck mate, its only like 10 TB or so...\n\nI made a  copy  of the termination paper (signed by me now, too) and send them to my email (which was allowed), put the original back into the envelope and packed my things up. Then I went up to the office, envelope in hand. The Big Boss showed his smug smile again the moment he saw me, but was quickly confused when he saw me with my laptop, work phone and all that, too. I handed him the letter, offered a polite nod and turned  around again. He shouted, where the hell I was going, him still  holding the envelope in his hand.\n\n\"*You  terminated my contract, according to the rules, I am to hand over all personal equipment I had been handed by the company before leaving. Exception acc. to Paragraph B are safety shoes and safety glasses. I bid you a fine day Mister Freddy*\". I said that with a cold, calculated  voice, trying my best to sound like a lawyer, simple because I knew he hated my  professional attitude. Then i went to my own boss, and piled  my Stuff on his desk. My Boss was confused as hell, asking me what was  up. I  briefly informed him, that my contract was terminated and that once more quoted the rule.\n\nMy Boss was a smug ass, too but he wasn't all dumb. His eyes went big as he immediatly realized, that I was the only Person he had left, that actually knew how to maintain and **properly** operate the Measuring Machine. And that he had such a backlog already, that other departments, relying on the measurements, had started to enforce short-time work. He was first lost for words and then rushed into Freddy's office to see that termination letter.\n\nMeanwhile I changed my clothes in the locker room, went to the gate and asked the security guards to please have a full inspection of my person and my backpack. This was likewise regulation for personal that was  terminated on short notice, and while the security guards were pretty baffled, that I **asked**  to be  searched, they complied. They searched me fully and handed me a writted confirmation, that I had nothing on me, that belonged to the company.\n\nMy now Ex-Boss tried to call me all the time on my way home, but I dislike  having phonecalls in public transport, so I simply muted them and continoued reading my book until I got home. There, 4 pm by now, so well  past his own time to  go home XD, I finally answered his call.\n\nHe tried to convince me, that I needed this job and that all this could be sorted. My Reply: \"*I will have a new job within a week, you will need to take at least a month to train someone new on the machine....if you had anyone that* ***could*** *train a new person. I tell you what. Give me a solid contract with triple the pay and I come back, oh and* ***I*** *want a written apologize from Freddy, too as well as my peace when working*\"\n\nHe told me that i was completly unreasonable with such demands, again me:   \"*So to get this clear.. Three times I discover massive bullshit happening, three times you guys try to heap the blame on me and then you guys literally try to humilate me and Freddy does* ***actually***  *fire me... and you want me to be reasonable? Well, guess it would be* ***reasonable*** *then to just ignore you then. Please be well!*\"\n\nI hung up then and blocked his number, as well as any other number with which he would try to call me later on.\n\n**The Aftermath:**\n\nAs I had mentioned before, I still had ears in the company, so I have a good idea what followed. The Facility suddendly had its most sensetive bottleneck tightened even further, and then clogged full of concrete soon after. No one maintained or cleaned the Measuring Machine anymore, and being a precision machine, it didn't took that lightly. Vladmir was soon called in mutiple times a day to fix a problem, which in return build up a backlog for him in other places. Things I (or previously Antonio)   had fixed within a minute now took hours, just for Vladimir to find time to come over and fix it (in a minute XD). He tried explaining stuff to Igor but yeah...didn't worked well...\n\nOther departments ran completly dry of work, and of course they didn't  wanted to bear the blame for missed deadlines, so the whole Issue was pretty quickly reported up the Ladder...and with no one wanting to take the hit, it climbed higher and higher, before it was eventually got onto the Desk of the National CEO of the Company, the highest Entity of the Company this side of the great pond. (found that out via a friend  in HR).\n\nWas followed was the arrival of the proverbial \"Kill-Squad\", you know the modern equivalent to an Executer: a bunch of Guys in very tight suits, no sense of humor, cold eyes and the strict command to find someone's head to put on a silver plate. As far as i heard even a prosecutor from the  USA was among  them.\n\nI was called by the company a month later, asking if I could come in for an interview, not a job  interview mind you, but they asked me to give my statement on the whole affair. This wasn't a legal thing, and they had no way to force me to make a statement, as it was an internal investigation, but I still happily complied and even gave my signature that I told the truth. Gave them the entire story, as accurate as i could and openly admited what I didn't knew or where i was only guessing.\n\nThey thanked me, and apologized (honesty i felt), that they could not pay me for the time they took from me due to legal reasons. I was all fine with that and went home.\n\nIgor got fired for \"careless neglecance\", His Brother Boris likewise got the immediate boot in the ass. My boss went down under as well, he and Boris were fired for missmanagment. Their Boss however, Freddy, he got not only fired, but dragged in front of court, no idea how that went on, as he was dragged to the US. But given how ridicilous **that** justice system is, and that he had been designated as a scapegoat by one of the biggest Company's worldwide... wouldn't be surprised if he had to hold very   tightly on the soap for a good while. The Entire facillity went firmly in the reds for that year, due to nearly all contracted reworks missing deadlines, which means a **daily** fees of ten of thousands per contract.\n\nMy ears in the company soon sought themselves new jobs, despite in one case being there for 20 years. Last I heard, is that the Company had to contract the producer of the Measurement Machine to train new employee how to operate it properly. I had asked for triple my pay, well those guys were   more like \"Triple the Zeros at the end\" XD\n\nOh! and I did find a new job within 1 Day. I was \"fired\" on Monday, Had the Interview on Tuesday, a test work day the Thursday. I was  asked  at the end of that day when i could start. which was the next  Monday. I do manual measurements now, in a Incoming Quality control  department. The Boss is a blast, the team is all friendly and my commute is 18  minutes with an eletric scooter. I work there for 9  months now, and I already am the de-facto team leader for first sample  stuff, and best of all, I am appreciated for the work I do, too :)\n\nHope you liked this **looooong** story!",

We generally got along but he was a bit stingy and would get really anal about certain things that affected me unfairly as a paying roommate. The biggest point of contention was the thermostat. I like to be comfortable and would keep it at 70, he preferred 65 to save money even though he was well off. I tried to compromise, but it descended into us each moving the thermostat when the other left. Finally he put his foot down and said it has to stay at 65.  \nUnfortunately for my roommate, I had learned about bimetalic strips that old thermostats used to gauge temperature. Two different metals are back to back in a coil. As one expands more than the other, the coil unwinds and turns the furnace on or off.  \nKnowing this, I agreed to keep it at \"65\". But I didn't agree not to put a teensy, tiny kink in the strip behind the dial to change what \"65\" meant to the furnace. Several times he thought it's not stupidly cold in here, and started obsessively checking the dial to catch me red handed. He was so confused when it was exactly at 65 every time.  \nEventually he started setting it even cooler to compensate. But with a subtle kink here or there I managed to stay comfortable while keeping the peace.  \n  \nEdit: Since this post blew up, I have made a donation to UNICEF to help keep needy kids warm this winter.

            "I dealt with a similar experience in the army.\n\nWhile in South Korea the army installed electronic thermostats and locked their minimum at 78.  Way too hot for someone from MT.  But similar to an analog thermostat a digital thermostat uses a metal that changes resistance with temperature which changes voltage.  This change is then converted to temperature.  The medical repair guys simply inserted a tiny wire between the temperature point and the 24 volt power supply thus leading the thermostat to believe the room was over 200 degrees and keeping the AC on constantly.  With the cheap AC units installed it still only kept the room around 70, but it was a lot better than the alternative.",

While the land lady was out of the house we cranked the heat. Of course it was 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) in the middle of winter so we were getting thirsty. And we decided to go to the pub. With the furnace running non stop. After a lot of beer and a few hours, we came home and Tara was phoning us like mad (this was before cell phones). Bear immediately removed the device and we pretended to be innocent. Tara hired a furnace guy the next day and of course he found nothing wrong.

Two guys got sick of it and figured out how to open the lock without breaking the box, would increase the temp, then lock it back up as if they were never there.

            "I honestly think everyone who has these discussions should take into account their own height/body weight.  Growing up my mom kept the house around 68 F.  I was always freezing.  Summer or winter, I was wearing long pants and a sweater or housecoat, all the time. For reference my mom and I are both around 5'3\", but I'm 100-110 lbs and she's spent most of her life between 150-165.  She would sometimes complain that 68 was too hot and turn it down even lower.\n\nFast forward to a couple years ago. I've been out of my mom's house for years. But she dropped a lot of weight, and now she's about the same weight I am.  Suddenly, she's complaining to me.  \"I'm freezing.  Why am I so cold all the time?  I think something's wrong with me.\"  And nothing's wrong, she just doesn't have the same insulation she always did.\n\nI am baffled by these comments saying at 70 they'd be in shorts, because at 70 I would probably still need a light sweater. or at least pajama pants. But I'd be miserable if I had to live in a house that was 65 all the time. Granted, I'd probably get a space heater or move.  But everyone deserves to be comfortable in their own home.",

If the temperature had been changed,  he would change it back to 16 degrees. \n\nWhat I eventually figured out was I could either\nA) set the temperature up to 22 degrees while pointing the remote at the ac unit,  then set it back to 16 degrees while pointing the remote at my body, thus changing what the remote said back to 16 degrees while the ac was at a much more comfortable 22 degrees\nOr\nB) if he had moved the remote to his desk drawer,  use one of the other remote controls for the other identical ac units in the building to change the temperature to 22.\n\nI did this for years and he never caught on. \n\nHe did however decide that his weight was ultimately the problem and stated to diet.\n\nIncredibly, once he was down to a healthy weight, he was much happier setting the ac to 22 degrees. \n\nSo I think we both won. \n\nHe never did find out.",
