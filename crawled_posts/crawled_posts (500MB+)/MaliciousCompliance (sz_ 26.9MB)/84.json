Waitress brings the bill, he puts his credit card in the receipt thing, hands it to her. She comes back a few minutes later, tells him she can't charge the meal to that card because he doesn't look like the picture on the credit card. Well, that's true, he had lost 150 pounds in the preceding 2 years.\n\n\"Oh, that's me, I used to be fat...\"\n\n\"I'm sorry sir, you don't look like the picture, my manager won't let me run the card.\"\n\n\"Well I don't  carry that much cash, and that's my only credit card, so what do you wanna do?\"\n\n\"I don't know sir, but I can't charge this card if you dont match the picture. \"\n\n\"Well kids, you heard the lady... FREE MEAL!\"\n\n*Manager comes out*\n\n\"Sir, you're going to have to find another way to pay for the check.\"\n\n\"There isn't another way. I gave you my card, you refused to charge it, so it's your problem now.\"\n\n\"Well if you leave, I'll have to call the police.\"\n\ntEn MiNuTeS lAtEr\n\nCop: \"Oh hey Josh, what's up?\" (Remember that Josh works public safety, he personally knows all the local cops.)\n\nJosh: \"They won't take my card because it has my fat picture on it.\"\n\nCop, trying VERY HARD not to laugh: \"Uh, yes ma'am, I can vouch for him, he is the same person as that extremely fat picture on the card.\"\n\nManager: \"I can't charge the card if the picture doesn't match.\"\n\nCop: \"So he's tried to pay, and I've confirmed he is who he says he is, and that picture on the card is him, and you won't run the card?\"\n\nManager: \"I'm not allowed to, no.\"\n\nCop: \"Well Josh, you heard the lady, FREE MEAL!\"\n\nJosh and the cop then proceeded to stand in the parking lot for another 20 minutes laughing and talking, while the manager glared out the door from behind the hostess stand. (Josh's wife and kids (teenagers btw) had long since walked to Target across the parking lot.)\n\nI often would ask him if he had been back to that restaurant, he said he got a new card recently (with no picture at all) and he did go back, just he and his wife. Different waitress, never saw the manager, ate, paid, left.\n\nIt was a Longhorn Steakhouse, if you were wondering.",

I called customer support each time, getting routed to India and being told the usual \"I'm very sorry sir, it looks like there is maintenance on the servers. Your website will be up soon.\" this was very frustrating to me because this is an online business and it doesn't do any good to have a website that nobody can reach and continually goes down. Looks like a suspicious business from the customer perspective. Also, that's fine if they're doing maintenance but why couldn't they switch me to a backup server or something so my website would not have to go down (I'm not in the industry so I don't know SOP for server maintenance). Maintenance was also midday and for hours or even two days on end. So I had been working on transferring my website to another hosting company, and once that was done I called 1and1 to cancel my hosting. The guy canceled my hosting AND domain, which locked my domain where it couldn't be uncanceled for at least a month. So now the domain name that people know and I had made a lot of effort advertising is now useless. I ended up getting a new domain and advertising that as the new one, but that almost ruined my business. The situation in OP's story seems small and easily correctible (just set up a new subscription), but in my situation it was pretty damaging. ",

I was traveling on my own dime, and Austin routinely jacks up the rates for rental cars at the airport, so I rented an off-premises car from Enterprise.\n\nI caught a bus from the airport (long delays, lots of stops) and finally arrived at the Enterprise.

Back when 99% of people going online used their telephone line, with the whole screeching warbling bit to connect, and being unable to make calls while online. (Cell phones weren't exactly common back then, nor was 'going online'.)\n\nI did tech support for AOL back then, fixing problems. The usual. Well, at one point management decided that the Retention team had too much work on their hands -- too many people calling to cancel their service -- so changed the rules for techs. Originally, if someone said they wanted to cancel, we'd just foist them over to Retention immediately; with the new rule, we had to ask if it was something that we could fix, and if not to go ahead and cancel right there. No further attempts to convince them to stay, other than asking, \"Are you sure?\"\n\nSo I get this guy who, without preamble, tells me he wants to cancel his service. Okay, I give the usual -- and no, there isn't anything wrong with it, he just wants to shut it off. Fine by me. I pull up the account page, verify everything, then ask the \"Are you sure\" question.\n\nHe says yes, I click the big red button, and immediately hear from his end:\n\n>     \"GOOD-BYE.\"\n\nSee, he was one of those rare users who had a second phone line, and was connected and actively using the software at the time. So when I canceled his service, it instantly disconnected him.\n\nHe shrieked. \"Hey, what happened? It kicked me off!\"\n\n\"Well, yeah, you no longer have an account.\"\n\n\"But I wasn't done with it! Turn it back on!\"\n\n\"I can't, but I can get you to someone who can.\" I then transferred him to Retention.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve named this tale The Long Game, since it actually spans over the course of several years leading to the satisfying conclusion. Also, because its a long story. I\u2019ll understand if you skip this one for a shorter one. \n\nSeveral years ago I was in desperate need of a job. I was recently released from active duty in the US Army under a medical discharge, met my girlfriend (who is currently my wife) who moved in with me with her two small children from a previous marriage, and I was bouncing around from dead end job to dead end job. I had very little real world skills to offer to employers so my options were limited. I took a chance and interviewed with a small security company and was immediately hired. They liked that I was prior service, grilled me with questions only a veteran would know, and sent me to work on their biggest contract. \n\nI was on a site of a massive multi-million dollar construction location. A large named oil company was building a new headquarters and well... massive construction project just doesn\u2019t seem like a big enough description. As security, a bulk of our responsibility was checking and vetting all construction workers and contractors through the gate, inspect vehicles for possible stolen property, and generally serve as a deterring force. To put it simply, everyday my gate alone would process about 1-2 thousand cars during my 8 hour shift. The site was running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to meet the very tight construction schedule. I was only on one of 3 gates so thats about 3-6 thousand cars that came on site every day in an 8 hour period. Massive construction site. \n\n(As a side note that will become very important later in the story, each car that came through had to undergo a strict inspection when the driver is FIRST assigned to work on the site. Then the vehicle gets a sticker and is allowed to drive onto the construction site. We would ensure the car has the sticker, and then just process everyones badge through a verification machine. If all badges passed, and the car had a sticker, then we would let the contractors on site so they can get to work.)\n\nWorking there was great. All the security were ex-military so, beyond a little teasing about who they served with, everyone bonded really well. We didn\u2019t have sick days or vacations days, so when people would call off for personal reasons or illness, everyone happily chipped in to make up the lost hours. And, because of this teamwork, our big boss overlooked the call offs and let us make overtime money. No write ups, no punishments.\n\nSometimes we were working 16 hour shifts back to back. I spent many nights sleeping in the parking garage in between shifts because it was easier than driving home, to sleep a few hours, only to come back to work for another 16 hour day. We were in outdoor conditions in all weather, and were on our feet on concrete the entire time. Sitting down was a luxury that we rarely saw. We couldn\u2019t leave the gate for any reason unless we were relieved by a supervisor who would try to come by twice during an 8 hour shift to let you go to the port-o-potty or quickly eat your lunch. Rain, harsh summer heat, bug storms (yes thats a thing), hail... you were out by your gate with no protection other than a construction hard hat. I know these sound like horrendous conditions but really, it was the best job I ever had. \n\nBecause of the conditions it was no wonder that 95% of the employees were male. We tried hiring females but most would last a few days before quitting. Those people who did not quit in a few days were lifers and loved the job. \n\nThe problems began about 3 months into the job. One of the supervisors was quitting to go back to school so a position opened up. Everyone was given an opportunity to apply for the supervisor position. I was encouraged by the night shift supervisor (who was the one quitting) to go for the promotion because he thought I would be a good replacement for him, even though I was the newest officer on the site and had the least amount of experience. So, I threw in my hat just for laughs. \n\nTwo other people applied. One was a guy who had obvious seniority. The other was a girl (one of three on the site) who had been there for about a year. We were given a face to face interview with the boss. We\u2019ll call him Jim. My interview went well and Jim liked that I was ambitious. Jim was also the guy who accepted me onto the site in the first place. \n\nThe next phase of testing was a practice run as a temporary supervisor. We were each given a day to be the supervisor in charge. Jim was there, along with a junior Supervisor named... Ray, yeah, thats a good name for him. (For clarification, Ray did not want the promotion and was happy performing his regular duties) both were present just incase situations occurred that was beyond our ability to handle they were standing by to assist. My test day went well. I finished all tasks assigned to me and I even managed to handle a minor emergency on my own. The other two applicants apparently didn\u2019t do to well...\n\nThe senior guy kept forgetting his list of tasks he was given to accomplish and kept going back to the office to ask Jim what he should do next. The Girl did ok, but every time she would check up on the guards she would flaunt around her temporary rank, make employees call her \u201cma\u2019am\u201d, and bragging about how she was definitely going to be getting the promotion.  Imagine her shock when I was given the position as the new night shift supervisor. To say she was angry was an understatement. \n\nApparently she was so upset that she didn\u2019t get the promotion that she called me on my personal cell phone. She stole my number from the supervisor emergency phone. To add to the situation, I had not yet been informed I got the promotion. Nothing official had been put out just yet. Not a direct quote but paraphrasing as best as I can:\n\nMe: hello?\n\nGirl: How does it feel?\n\nMe: um... who\u2019s this?\n\nGirl: what? You don\u2019t know? I thought supervisors are supposed to know EVERYTHING!\n\nMe: (very confused) You called OP, I think you may have the wrong number.\n\nGirl: I know who I called! Don\u2019t pretend like you don\u2019t know. You got the promotion because you\u2019re all sexists pigs!\n\nMe: I got the promotion? Cool!\n\nGirl: That promotion was supposed to be mine but I guess since Im not in the bro-club they just gave it to you. If you don\u2019t resign the position to me I\u2019m going to tell HR about all this sexism and you\u2019ll all be fired!\n\nMe: What sexism? I got the position by passing the tests. Isn\u2019t it sexist to assume you should get the promotion only because you happen to be born a female? Isn\u2019t that act alone sexist? \n\nGirl: But only men get promoted to leadership positions!!!\n\nMe: 95% of the site is male! Odds are males are going to get promoted. Sorry you didn\u2019t make the cut but none of this is my problem. \n\nSo I hung up the phone and called both Jim and Ray to inform them about the call. I was assured that I was promoted, they didn\u2019t know how she found out, and they were going to file harassment on my behalf to HR for her stealing my phone number from the work phone and contacting me with threats.\n\nAnd thats where the story SHOULD end. But oh no fellow readers... it has only just begun. Now would be a good time to get some popcorn and a drink. \n\nSo about two to three months roll by and I\u2019m getting into the role of Supervisor. Girl, has since been removed from the site, and the employees are really happy that Im the new supervisor and that Girl is gone. Things continue as normal and I begin bonding with my staff. I especially bond with a guard that no one liked. His name for this story is Victor. Victor is a marine veteran, he was in the initial invasion of Iraq and developed severe PTSD. It makes him very confrontational, argumentative, and a super big A-hole to anyone who talks to him. I liked the guy from the get go and we quickly became close friends. \n\nEvery night I would hang out with him between my duties and we would talk. I eventually convinced him to seek help from the Veterans Association, and go to PTSD counseling. He was also going to school to get his Masters degree (Thanks to Ray who convinced him to not give up on his education) and would just need to vent sometimes. I was that vent. He would blow up at me, yell and scream, and when he was done we would hug it out. It was therapy for him and I didn\u2019t mind. \n\nAll seemed to be going well until one day I came to visit with Victor. What I didn\u2019t know was that Victor was pulling a 16 hour shift and actually worked the afternoon and the night shift. So when I showed up to work he had already been there a majority of the day. He asked me if I spoke with Jim recently. I hadn\u2019t. Apparently Jim didn\u2019t show up to work today. A few days go by and well... Jim mysteriously disappeared. \n\nAfter 3 or 4 days of his disappearance, Ray called an emergency meeting with the supervisors. In attendance was myself, Ray, and another supervisor from the second shift who is not important and does not require a fictional name. The meeting was to try and figure out what happened to Jim. We pooled our knowledge together and decided the best course of action was to contact the main headquarters branch to see if they knew something. He wasn\u2019t answering the phone when we called him so we feared he was in the hospital and no one bothered to tell us. \n\nWhen we called we were given the run around, but eventually an HR rep who was friends with Ray spilled the beans. Jim had quit the job. Girl (from earlier) apparently made good on her threats. After she was kicked out of the site, she got ahold of a lawyer and began the process of suing the company. Not only for sexism and favoritism, but also sexual harassment. \n\nAs it turned out, Jim was a lonely man. Girl and Jim began flirting and eventually sexting... and the idiot used the company supervisor cell phone to do it. She not only had copies of the messages, but when the company dug into the phone records they had all the evidence needed to see she was not lying. There were pictures... lots of pictures. \n\nGirl was brilliant. Evil, but brilliant. She knew that the old supervisor was going to go back to school eventually so she began flirting with Jim. She pursued him. Each conversation in person she would be flirtatious, rubbing him and even having sex with him. On the phone, however, she played coy and made him take charge. In the end, the evidence looked like he pressured her to have sex with him... and promised a promotion (in a bout of pillow talk and before anyone knew that the position was going to be open) to her in exchange for sex acts. At the time it was role play, but now it appears like this was all part of her insurance plan to get promoted for real. \n\nThat was more than enough for the company to do something. When Jim caught wind what was happening he took off. \n\nThis left us without a boss, and worse, in order to avoid a lawsuit, the company rehired Girl to her old position, replanted her on our site, paid her enough money to cover her missed salary plus a bonus and a raise, and promised to get more females on the site and on supervisor positions. This was enough to satisfy Girl so she dropped the lawsuit. \n\nAs the only form of authority on the site, we three supervisors took it upon ourselves to run the site as best as we could until a new boss was assigned to help us or one of us was promoted to the position. \n\nAlmost two months went by and Girl was a huge nuisance. She was constantly calling off her shift at the last minute and since everyone didn\u2019t like her, no one was willing to cover her shift. We attempted to write her up for the situation but she quickly threw it back in our face and threaten to call her lawyer for harassment. After all, \u201cnone of the male employees get written up when they call off... obviously this is sexism and boys club all over again.\u201d\n\nShe pushed her luck too far one day, however, and severely disrespected one of the oil company representatives during his visit. He had her permanently removed from the site. When the security company tried to take her side (for fear of another lawsuit) he said either Girl is gone or he\u2019ll get another security company to take over the contract. The company gave in and moved her to another site. \n\nBut even though Girl was now out of our lives forever, the absolute nightmare she started was still forming overhead. The company finally found a suitable replacement for Jim, that was also female to satiate the terms set forth by Girls lawyer. \n\nOur new boss was named... well, i have lots of names for that sea hag but for now I\u2019ll refer to her as Tasha. \n\nTasha was a handful from the get go. As the new boss she was working on the site for nearly two weeks before she ever introduced herself to either the second shift supervisor or myself (i still worked nights). What boss does that? Two weeks before you introduce yourself to the supervisors? It took her another month to eventually meet all the guards. The site was busy but it wasn\u2019t that big. \n\nAlready she was off to a bad start. She was also non-military and didn\u2019t seem respect the fact that every guard and supervisor was a military vet. Most of us served in war zones, lived in the dirt, and were very self sufficient. She saw everyone as a brainless meat head who needed CONSTANT supervision. The term micro-manager isn\u2019t strong enough of a description to understand the level of hands on she needed to have. And it probably would have been much different if she was improving things, or making things more efficient... but she was barely able to perform the simplest tasks, made constant poor decisions, and just kinda ticked everyone off whenever she was around. \n\nWe three supervisors tried to train her and bring her up to speed with the site but she wouldn\u2019t hear any of our advice. After about another week or so from her introduction to everyone she began to get worse. \n\nWe started seeing a ton of write ups flooding across our desks. Like, dozens and dozens for a single employee. And the write ups, while technically correct, were of the most petty things imaginable. Her favorite was writing up employees for breaking uniform regulations. You have a stray string on your uniform? Write up. Shoes dirty? Write up. A haircut she didn\u2019t like? Write up. Glasses smudged? Write up. The best was her writing up a guard because his uniform was wet... because it was raining outside, and we were not allowed to seek shelter because of our duties. \n\nEvery gate had a \u201cguard shack\u201d available. It was a small space with just enough room for a chair and a table to write on. It had a small A/C and a mini-fridge to keep water, Gatorades, and our lunch cold. But no one could use the guard shacks because they were so far away from the gates. Still within eyesight, but we had to physically badge in vehicles and employees and the verification machine was set up next to the gate. When you swipe a badge, a green or red light flashes and it makes a little beep sound to say wether or not someone is allowed on property. But if you\u2019re in the guard shack you can\u2019t physically hear the beep (reminder, this is a construction site) nor can you see the lights because the lights face the vehicle. So you have to stand there and swipe the badge and physically look at the lights to know wether or not to let anyone in. Also, remember the car stickers? They were positioned on the windshield so you can\u2019t see them from a shack 30 feet away from the gate. And because of the massive volume of cars coming and going, there just wasn\u2019t any time to walk to the guard shack, much less sit down. \n\nWe tried to explain that to Tasha who just didn\u2019t seem to care. \n\nIt also became very clear that she was focusing on one guard at a time. Every write up and disciplinary meeting was laser focused on one individual. Eventually that person would get so sick of the harassment that they would quit. As soon as they were gone she would focus on another guard. \n\nThe entire site went from a dream job to the most hostile work environment i\u2019ve ever bore witness too. I served 10 years in the Army and served three tours to Afghanistan. I served under some of the most idiotic leadership imaginable, people who only got promoted because they were in the army soooo long that eventually they would get promotions. Ask a Veteran, they\u2019ll understand what I mean. And all that time, all those dead end jobs with king of the tiny pond managers i used to work for, were NOTHING in comparison to Tasha. \n\nAfter two months under her reign 12 employees quit... including Ray. Yes, apparently supervisors were also under fire. I feel that I\u2019m obligated at this point to mention that Ray is the best damn leader I\u2019ve ever had the luxury of working with. Even though he was technically under me, he was and is the most professional man I have ever known. Period. Everyone on site respected him, everyone would have followed him to Hell and back, everyone loved Ray. Even when I was promoted above him, instead of being petty he encouraged me to do better. He trained me and became a role model to myself and many others on the site. Including Victor. Remember him from earlier? The PTSD guy that no one liked. Apparently he had two friends in this world. Me and Ray. And now Ray was bullied out of his job. \n\nProtip: Never fuck with a Marine. Especially one who has nothing left to lose. \n\nTo put into context how bad this really is, no one quit the company before Tasha took over. Some people left to better opportunities, or were new hires who couldn\u2019t hack it, but overall people had worked on that site since construction began 5 years prior. Some people had been with the company going on 10 years. These were the people she was going after and who she forced to quit. I had quit smoking for three years and things got so bad everyone started smoking again, even myself. \n\nYou would think with as many people quitting that we would have a worker shortage but then you would be mistaken. As soon as someone quit, the next day the position was filled again. But 2nd shift supervisor and myself quickly learned that these people were not ex-military. These people were moody, had very bad attitudes with other guards and the many contractors we were dealing with on a daily basis. They were lazy, would often hide in the guard shacks and would not verify wether or not cars could enter the site. They were messy (both in personality and their surroundings) and generally what one would consider horrible employees. \n\nWe called Ray to see if he could contact his HR buddy to find out where these people were coming from. And here is where the story gets even worse...\n\nRemember when old boss Jim took off? Well, someone had to take the fall for the sexism lawsuit that was forming. So the company terminated another employee. That employee was responsible for staffing the oil company contract. He was also responsible for hiring veterans and verifying them. Remember the questions I was asked at the beginning of this story that only a veteran would know the answers to. Yep, that guy. He was gone. So unfortunately no more veterans were selected from the hiring pool and sent our way. He was terminated because he originally hired Jim.\n\nAs it turned out, Tasha (the new terror boss) was actually in charge of an office building contract in another part of the city. She lost the contract to that building and herself and all her guards were now in limbo and out of a job. Some of the guards were issued to new contracts but pay in security is usually pretty lousy. Normally about minimum wage. But our job paid very well. $15 an hour to start off because the company was supposed to offer it only to ex-military guards due to the site contract. \n\nI discovered years later that Tasha actually lost the building contract not because the contract ended naturally, but because she and her guards were useless that the building hired other people to do their jobs. The person in charge of contracts... was sleeping with Tasha. They covered up the contract loss so she can still have a job. Oh, and since military guy got fired during the lawsuit... Tasha\u2019s fuck buddy took over his responsibilities.\n\nHence, Tasha got another site contract, a pay raise, and was selected only because she was female and sleeping with the contract guy. Hows that for ironic sexism? \n\nAnd... it gets better... and the write ups and harassment on our site were a ruse to get the Veterans to quit their jobs, forcing the company to fill the spot with whoever was available due to a loophole clause in the oil company contract. It basically allowed the security company to staff open positions with non-military employees in an emergency employee shortage incident. \n\nAnd guess who the new lazy employees were? Yep, the old guards that served under Tasha, who were so bad at their job that they lost their own contract. But why them? Because they were requested, by name, by the largest contract supervisor Tasha. \n\nOne by one I watched my fellow veterans and employees fall under attack and quit, only to be replaced by useless people and backstabbing thugs. \n\nI really could go on, there is a TON that happened during that time period, but its well past the time for some Malicious Compliance. \n\nI was the next to be targeted... and I was the next to quit. \n\nThe malicious compliance, unfortunately was not caused by myself initially. But, by Victor who now watched his second and only friend quit from the job site. Victor is my god damn hero. \n\nAfter I left I started working for another security company. Ironically, the guy who hired me was Jim. My direct supervisor? Ray!!! We three were back together again and worked for another oil/gas company. The pay was awesome and info was shared about Jim getting set up for the fall and what not. We tried to get Victor to quit his job and join us at the new company... but the old marine was on one last mission. \n\nRemember those car stickers? Well, as it turned out, Victor had a super power. For whatever reason, he was able to spot forged stickers from across the gate.\n\nOk, so forged stickers? Yep, they were a problem. The construction site had very limited parking and safety regulations were put in place that only licensed drivers could come onsite. The cars also had to pass crazy tests in order to meet the safety regulation compliance. The problem is that construction companies and sub-contractors often hire illegal workers, or people with criminal history, or people who just have crapy cars that probably aren\u2019t registered or even inspected by the state. No one really cared, but without licensing they could not drive onsite. So, someone began forging car stickers and selling them to all the people who would not legally be able to get them. \n\nAt first they were crude, obviously crayon on tape. If you glanced at it, it was passable but any close inspection would reveal that the sticker was fake. If a fake sticker was found, regulation stated that the car must be pulled over, and a security supervisor would need to be contacted. The security supervisor would have to get ahold of the site foreman, a supervisor from the fake sticker driver, and a police officer who would remove the sticker and permanently remove the employee from the site forever. \n\nNow, because all the replacement guards were really bad at their jobs, the fake sticker business was in full swing. They were getting better, laser printed on vinyl, and nearly indistinguishable from the real stickers. \n\nBut Victor was now on a mission. He took a position at the main entry gate and began pulling over as many cars as he could with the fake stickers. He pulled over sooo many that a security supervisor (Tasha) was assigned to be nearby at all times. The site had to hire an additional police officer and the Site Forman had a permanent representative at the gate... \n\nEveryday Victor was pulling over car after car. He started training some of the least useless guards how to do it and what to look for. It became a HUGE nuisance for Tasha but she technically couldn\u2019t do anything about it because he was following the site rules to the letter. \n\nAfter a month of aggressive crackdown on the fake sticker problem, the Oil company representatives held a special meeting with Tasha and Victor to plead with him to stop. He had singlehandedly removed so many construction workers and contractors that many companies were pulling their long term contracts with the oil company. Construction came to a sudden halt, and the oil company was hemorrhaging tons of money to either keep on contractors or find new ones willing to pick up the job where others left off. \n\nBest of all, the construction should have been WAY ahead of schedule so the Oil Company sold their old headquarters to someone else in the expectation to move into the newly constructed headquarters. However, incompetent security replacements were not checking vehicles exiting the properly and thousands upon thousands of dollars worth of tools and construction supplies were stolen, causing massive set backs. \n\nThen, the sticker fiasco cause any progress that was still going on to come to a sudden halt. \n\nThe Oil Company now had to pay and greatly inflated rent at their old headquarters because the building was sold but they had nowhere to send the employees!!! So the new owners let them stay and jacked up the rent so high that it was causing the oil company to lose massive revenue and stocks were beginning to drop. \n\nDuring the meeting Victor only asked one question, \u201cSo, are you changing the regulation to state that illegal drivers are now allowed onsite?\u201d\n\nOf course they didn\u2019t change it. They couldn\u2019t and Victor knew it. The meeting came to a close. Victor returned to his gate and continued his mission. After a few days, an accident occurred onsite. The blame was the drivers, but the buck was passed to Victor who became the fall guy and he was terminated from the security company. Everyone knew it was Bullshit and that he was obviously the scapegoat... but Victor didn\u2019t care. He waged his war, and in my eyes, he won. \n\nSo thats the end of the Malicious Compliance and if you made it this far then good on you. I hope you enjoyed this slice of my life and I leave you with a wish: I hope the best of your past is worst of your future. \n\nIf you\u2019re still here then you\u2019ll be pleased to know there is a little justice in the world. \n\nVictor left security permanently. He finished school with honors and got his Masters degree. He also took my advice and sought help for his PTSD. He ended up getting 90% disability from the VA and gets a fat check every month.  He technically does not have to work anymore but took a job as a maintenance supervisor at the local city college. He is doing much better mentally and is looking forward to buying his second home. We still talk regularly and is considered a very close friend of mine. \n\nJim, Ray and I worked together for years at another security company. \n\nJim left that company for better pay at a different security company and has only spoken to me once since his departure. From what I hear, he got married and is doing well. \n\nRay took over as a contract manager for an even different security company much closer to his residence. He is still happily married and adopted his two nephews to raise along side of his son. We still talk semi regularly and go drinking at least once a year with Victor.\n\nI became a big time security supervisor at the company and have only recently left due to political conflict. I now am an HVAC technician and me and the wife are doing well. \n\nAnd what of Tasha? Well... she was eventually fired for the hell she caused. It took years to unravel the drama but eventually karma caught up to her. Jim called me once (after he left to work somewhere else) and warned me that Tasha was looking for a job in a new security company. He just denied her application when he realized who she was based on the stories Ray and I told him. \n\nShe then interviewed for the position at my company. Guess who did all employee hiring? This guy! I had another officer send her into my office. She walked in all dressed up, smiling and ready to do her interview... then she saw me. Her smile faded and she walked out without ever saying anything. I then made a call to Ray and gave him a heads up that she was out there. Several weeks go by and she walked in to interview with Ray. \n\nHe told me that when she saw him she broke down crying. She confessed that since she was terminated she has been unable to find a job. Everyone who interviews her just so happens to be an ex-military veteran who used to work on an oil company construction site. She was losing her home, her husband left her and took her kids (he found out about the contract guy she was sleeping with), she was living out of her car... she pleaded him for a job. And Ray, the most professional man I had ever met, was an ex-marine. He knew what happened to Victor, about how she threw him under a bus. He told her to beat sand, and to tell Satan \u201chi\u201d for him when she goes to hell. \n\nProtip: Never mess with a Marine.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEdit for added info and concerns:\n\nFirstly, thank you all for the overwhelming response. I figured my story would be overlooked and possibly read by a handful of people. I never would have imagined I would get this kind of response. Thank you all for the awards, the updoots, and the kind words. It really means a lot to me and yes, I read them all. Wish I could respond to everyone but I can only say \u201cthank you\u201d so many times before it loses its sincerity. But thank you to everyone. Also, I will pass on your good wishes to Ray and Victor the next time I talk to them. \n\nSecondly, few commentators correctly noted that this story is very one sided and sexist against the female employees. I\u2019m just popping this here to address their concern on a few points:\n\n1) The female character named Girl should have a real name and not just labeled as a gender. You\u2019re right. Didn\u2019t even think about it while I was writing this and frankly I don\u2019t care enough about her to justify giving her an identification. If this upsets you then I understand and accept your criticism without any negativity on my end. \n\n2) This is a boys club, all females in the story are depicted as evil or were oppressed, ect... the story most certainly had that vibe and really that wasn\u2019t my intention. Consider it a big oversight on my part. The whole story is incredibly long and there were so many people involved that if I got detailed it would be like a marvel movie. In fact the persons Girl and Tasha were the only females on the site that were a problem and were not liked. We had other female officers on site that were well respected and were treated just as equally as everyone else. One female in particular tried to be a huge help to us and she was one of the replacements. She was an ex-police officer from Chicago who helped us legally build a case of workplace harassment and even coached us on how to lead the investigation. The case was ignored and nothing productive came of it. Its a story all on its own so I excluded it due to length. \n\n3) Jim was not a victim. You are correct. What he did is idiotic and an abuse of power. I will not argue with you there. However, note that I don\u2019t talk to Jim anymore. There are reasons for that and the fact that his loins caused numerous people grief and sorrow is a big factor. What he did was reprehensible. However, Girl using the sexual relationship to push her own agenda also negates her being able to claim victimhood. If she was a victim, she should have sued instead of going right back to a company that allowed this to happen. At least, thats my opinion which really means nothing.  \n\n4) If this story offends you then too bad. Hate to be the jerk but I can\u2019t change events that happened in real life to suite your political correctness. Things happened, and as the world crumbles around you sometimes the moral compass get spun. It\u2019s not an excuse, just a very sad fact of life that is highlighted when you are trying to claw your way out of a shitty situation. \n\nEither way, thank you for everything and I\u2019m greatly humbled by you all.",

However, crying \"sexism\" when that's clearly not the case is really harmful and needs to be dealt with accordingly.\n\nMy boss once asked me to take minutes during a meeting with the rest of the attendants being all male. It wasn't a sexism thing where they ask the woman to take minutes. My boss knows that my minutes are the damn best, so he asked me to take care of it.  \nIt's really easy to cry sexism when you're a woman in a male dominated field, but you need to be damn sure before you do. The time I had a  temp job where everyone earned the same, and I later found out my male colleagues were actually making more... that was sexism (I got the raise and missed wages paid).

Maybe don\u2019t read into things using your experience as the lens and if you don\u2019t like it just leave it? All this negativity on a story about negative people feels gross. It\u2019s honestly astounding to read a story about someone entirely different but the main point I keep seeing people make is \u201cshe can\u2019t be sexist she\u2019s a woman\u201d like????

            "**My \"I've got a similar story\"**: I had a project manager who was a real witch. Everyone hated her but me, I merely found her to be \"something to ignore\". One day she got very nasty to me, nasty to the point that the entire staff threatened to quit. I called the boss and told him all about it, he had to cut short his vacation (on which he was introducing his parents to their new grandchild) to come home to fire her. She stole the company laptop, and the company eventually decided it was worth it to not have to talk to her again. She moved on to another company, which soon hired me and someone else from the staff who hated her. We warned management about her, by virtue of telling them that under no circumstances were either of us willing to ever be alone in a room with her, because who knew what lies she would tell if there were no witnesses? Not long thereafter she had a bad meltdown in the office and ran out the door, leaving all of her things. She was never seen again. The moral of this story is, never hire a large woman wearing a tweed Chanel jacket and too much perfume.\n\n**My \"Yeah, never mess with a Marine\"**: When I was a kid (about 9) the (new) principal somehow got it into his head that I was the root of all evil, and punished me pretty severely. The two worst punishments the school offered (in a state where expelling someone was illegal) were, silent lunch (you were seated at a special table for kids that had \"silent lunch\", kids at surrounding tables would taunt and/or hurt you, and if you so much as yelped someone would be there in an instant to scream at you and send you to the office to be yelled at further) and indoor recess (everyone else got to go outside and play or be in the cool shade while you had to sit in a very hot classroom and do work). The principal gave me both, *every* day - pretty much exclusively because I had the audacity to complain about the people that were bulling me, and this would create work for him if I didn't shut up. I tried to explain to my parents what was happening to me at school and ask for help but they wouldn't even let me talk, they just assumed that whatever the school did was okay and they didn't need to get involved and if I wanted to talk to them about it I was just wasting their time. (Yeah, my parents were real winners. I would conclude I was an unwanted \"oops\" baby if I hadn't encountered the Planned Parenthood literature in which my mother recorded her very deliberate effort to have me. So I *know* I was wanted, they just *treated* me like I wasn't.) \n\nSo one day he pulled me out of class to bully me personally in the hallway outside the classroom. He pushed me a \\*bit\\* too far and in a panic I escaped and ran out the nearest door out of the school - I intended to walk home (a few miles). However, by chance my mother had just showed up to take me out of school to take me to the dentist, so her car was right outside the door. She, being crazy, didn't question why I came running out the building as soon as she pulled up and got in her car. Kids in the classrooms with windows facing her car only saw me run out the door and get into a strange car. The school asked what had happened - the car she was driving wasn't the one they had a description of on file (she had two and they knew about the other one) and she'd never actually gone inside to talk to them, so as far as they knew I was kidnapped, and the school went into full freakout mode. Meanwhile my mother pacifically took me to the dentist and then home, where she didn't find out about anything for a couple hours until the police called again to see if she'd gotten home. \n\nMy befuddled (and, I'm not kidding, severely mentally ill) mother did nothing about it (she outright refused to speak to them) until my father got home, and told him. (Her refusing to speak to them *did not* help them calm down, but it took 3 hours for the nearest police to get to us, so nothing happened before my father got home.) \n\nMy father was a marine. (A sniper, a very good one, and a Vietnam vet. I saw him shoot a squirrel in the head with a BB at about a quarter mile at age 71.) He talked to me and finally listened to what I had to say, motivated by the police being involved, and was infuriated when he learned what the principal was doing to me - he said he knew of the \"silent lunch\" punishment being used when he was in the service, and it was very inappropriate for a kid. *Any* kid. Especially *his* kid. He called the school, which had kept the main office staff - including the principal - there until they heard what happened to me. (I suspect the principal was *not* happy about the chaos he had caused, it was about 7:30pm and he had been at work for over 12 hours solid, but he had no way to get the school to call off the frantic search for me and any attempt would involve admitting that he had been bullying a child.) My father got in his car and went to the school and \"talked with\" the principal.\n\nI don't actually know for sure what was said, I can only guess, but my father told me that night that I wold be off of both daily punishments immediately and the principal wouldn't be bothering me any more and please let him know if the school failed to fulfill this in any way. In fact the (very macho, scary to most kids) principal would go sheet white, turn on his heel, and walk very quickly in the other direction when he saw me coming - a fact that did not go unnoticed by my peers, to their astonishment. (I had the good manners to refuse utterly to explain.) \n\nNever mess with a marine.",

And it does seem that your workplace may truly be not a very welcoming environment for females, esp with the employer gender ratio. But this is real life, not a story, so people can be morally grey and that\u2019s that. And the side you, OP, take in life may not always be the one right moral side, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact you took it. I like how this story represents the greatness of the world.\n\nI\u2019m glad Victor eventually got better, and Tasha got retribution in an ironic way.

We had a rather irate RE (Religious Education) teacher.  One Friday, we were set homework to write 2-3 pages, describing world religions as if we had just discovered the planet as an alien.\n\nI set to work and wrote it out on the Friday evening...  then had a thought...  If I were writing this from the perspective of aliens, then it wouldn't be in English (foolish me).  I came up with a symbol for each letter of the alphabet, and re-wrote the entire thing with these symbols.\n\nMonday morning rolls around, and I handed it in (with a decoder, of course).\n\nI ended up in detention for 2 days.  I also understand I probably wasted that teacher's time when they just wanted to read and grade - but part of me wanted to get some kind of credit for the extra effort.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh well, sometimes compliance isn't all roses :)",

History teacher broke the class into two teams of \"archeologists,\" and had us create artifacts for the other team to figure out.\n\nI wrote a page long letter and then assumed that the letter C had been replaced as redundant. (\"this letter is a k in front of some vowels, and an s in front of others.\"  \"Why not just use k and s then?\") There were a few other similar changes.\n\nThen I created a paired letter Cypher, each pair of letters matched to a different pair of letters.  The other side said it was unfair since I explained what I had done and how deciphering it was literally impossible. The teacher said it was a good example of how hard translating old languages can be, and how important the Rosetta stone was.",

It could definitely come across like am attempt to \"trick\" teachers so that you can get an extension. People are constantly spreading tips of how to corrupt docs so that they can't be opened, \"accidentally\" submitting the wrong doc, etc. I imagine it'd get pretty frustrating. \n\nIf it wasnt a huge deal, I would have just asked that they give me the English version the next day. If it was a big deal assignment or if I was just real sick of this kids shit, I'd probably ask for the alphabet code and then have them decode like 2 or 3 words - if it's coming out as legible English then clearly they actually did write it, so again just print off the English copy and turn it in tomorrow.\n\nThe most interesting part of this story to me is that a roman Catholic religious studies teacher was encouraging kids to use defamiliarization  to analyze religions. You would think that a religion as with as much archaic rituals and mystical spiritualism would want to avoid kids thinking about their practices too objectively.",

            "Freshman year of English in college I was asked to write a paper describing what a future archeologist with no knowledge of modern civilization would be able to learn about the 18th century if they discovered a copy of an 18th century novel. I wrote a paper on how they would be able to determine that a civilization with a written language existed, had some form of standardized paper making, and printing press. Did an entire analysis of what you could learn by finding a printed book, but no analysis of the contents because the prompt explicitly said no knowledge, which I took to include knowledge of the language. Got a zero on the paper and challenged it with the Dean, pointing out that there was no way a future civilisation could have zero knowledge if they were still able to read English because of the volume of writings in that language. I was told that I shouldn't be in college if I couldn't respect academic authority. Quit that school, went elsewhere, and now I've got a post doc. That was twenty years ago and I still use that teacher as an example of an incompetent educator and that Dean as an example of a useless bureaucrat.",

            "Reminds me of something a friend pulled in religious education. Also Roman Catholic school. Teacher was talking about cultural diversity in Christianity and how it often diverged in different places due to poor communication in ancient times and the very different pagan cultures that existed in places when they were being converted. Celtic Christianity was given as an example of a large divergence that could have caused one of the many failed Protestant Reformation attempts over the years, but didn't (some high church Anglicans hold that Celtic Christianity was the true light, Rome were the heretics, and the English Reformation was Cranmer pacifying Henry into splitting with the heretics to preserve the uniquely Celtic traditions of the Isles, but this is just bad history and bad theology in more ways than I can explain in a malicious compliance story). This was linked to the Irish pagans, and we were asked to write a two to four page essay describing Christianity from the perspective of the pagan Celts. \n\nThis girl wrote three pages in ogham script. Teacher accepted it and figured it would just be a matter of transliteration. Turned out it was written in Irish as well. The kid said something about period accuracy. The next year, according to a friend's younger sister, both that religious education class and the history class that teacher taught had a rule that said \"Assignments may not be turned in written in foreign script or a non English language, unless assignment specifically requests period accurate language and script.\"",

            "When I was in second grade I got sick during a spelling test and threw up on the test. My teacher gave me a 100 on it ",
            "Teacher wouldn\u2019t let me leave and I barfed hot vegetable soup all over the student back in front of me. It was lunch time and we got free milk and canned soup to eat with our sandwiches from home. Popular for day!",
            "This. \nThis is just one of many reasons I don't restrict visits to the bathroom in my classroom. I genuinely can't understand the teachers who think this is a good idea. ",
            "My daughter had a similar experience. She wasn\u2019t feeling well and asked her teacher to go to the bathroom. Teacher said no and my daughter sat down. Daughter got up and asked the teacher agin to go to the bathroom and was told no again. This time she vomited on the teacher\u2019s shoes. The bonus is that the teacher got the flu too and was out for a long time because of it. The teacher wasn\u2019t a very nice person. ",
            "When I was in 4th grade I felt nauseous\n I raised my hand, to ask to go to the bathroom, but was ignored for a while. I then got up and walked toward the teacher to tell her I felt ill and needed to go to the restroom immediately. Then I threw up on the teacher and fainted in front of all of my peers. \n\nAnother time, in kindergarten or 1st grade, I told the teacher I felt sick. She wouldn't let me go to the bathroom. I threw up some mucous and I got yelled at for \"spitting on my desk\" and made to clean it up. I told my mom about it and she ripped that teacher a new asshole. She had my back when it counted, especially when I was really young. ",
            "One time in class years ago. I want to say 4th grade it was 20 minutes before school was out and I had to pee so bad! I told my teacher. And she insisted that I could wait the 20 minutes. Well turns out I had made the 20 minutes but not the extra minutes to get to the bathroom.. I completely peed all over my chair and myself with like 3 girls around who all ended up going too highschool with me.. and still know me..",
            "When I was in 2nd grade I went to school feeling normal. Ended up feeling queasy about halfway through the day. The substitute teacher knew my family from church and told me to just use the bathroom instead of going to the nurse. \n\nNothing happened. Still felt terrible. \n\nI sat back down at my desk which was set up in a block with 3 other students and immediately vomited across the desk into the lap of the poor boy sitting across from me. (Into high school I still hadn\u2019t lived this down). \n\nAfter a few days of sickness and an ER trip we found out my appendix had burst and I had emergency surgery. ",
            "Similar experience in 3rd grade. My mom wouldn't let me stay home, wouldn't believe I was sick and went to lengths to tell my teacher not to believe me either. I almost threw up as the class was walking into art and the substitute let me go to the nurse. I told the nurse my teacher would be mad if I wasn't back soon but let me fall asleep for over an hour. When I woke up I was so panicked and quickly got back to class. At this point the class was at library. I decided to walk right into class and explain to my teacher. She yelled at me so much that she had me in tears. Of course I turn around to go to my desk and the whole class is watching, waiting to come back into the classroom from library. Humiliated, I sat down. Later, while making crafts, we stood in line at the teachers desk to have her hot glue something together (since we couldn't use a hot glue gun). I'm finally at the front and all of a sudden, can't hold it in. I can't get to the trash can fast enough and threw up on my teacher's shoes.\nAs she walked me to the nurse she mumbles, \"well I guess you weren't lying.\"\n\nKarma Ms. Scales, and yes I still hate you.!",
            "I got accused for pissing on the water bubblers. It wasn't me. So I was upset at being blamed for it. I was told to sit in the corner. The lunch bell rang and everyone went off to have lunch. Including the teacher.\n\n  \n\n\nDuring the break I just sat there. Until I actually had to pee. I was busting and decided I would pee all over the toys near the corner. I didn't play with them anyway. In hindsight, I should have peed all over the teachers desk.\n\n  \n\n\nHowever, when she returned to class, unlocking the door. She asked me how I got in? I told her I was never let out. You told me to stay in the corner until you let me go.\n\n  \n\n\nShe didn't believe me. I then got sent to the principal's office and suspended from school.\n\n  \n\n\nI was asked to be picked up by my mother, who was mad at me after they told her all the things I did wrong (allegedly). I got a beating when I got home.\n\n  \n\n\nI spent the rest of my life pretty much never trusting anyone and mostly flying under the radar purely to avoid any liars and conflicts.\n\n  \n\n\nIt served me well. But, fuck that teacher. She was an arsehole.",
            "I was a shy girl and in 2nd grade.  After already leaving class to pee  2 or 3 times, I had to go again.  Raised my hand, teacher said no.  I held it as long as I could, then peed my pants I just put my head down on my desk and cried.  I waited until everyone left so I was the last kid to leave.  When I got home and my mom found out, she took me to a doctor and I had some kind of infection or something and I ended up having to have surgery because of it.  I know my mom called the school or the teacher, but of course once I came back to school I was cured so no revenge.",
            "In 1st grade we were watching some movie about dinosaurs, (we weren\u2019t even learning about them) and I kept saying to my teacher \u201cI need to throw up, let me get up I have to throw up!\u201d And she wouldn\u2019t let me get up. So when the movie was over I ran to the trash can and a girl from my class walked in front of me, and I threw up all sliver her. Still friends to this day btw.",

In third grade her PE teacher decided he knew more than everybody and she needed to participate, regardless of the note from the doctor, my parents, and the school nurse.

            "My 4th grade teacher was an asshole. She would throw chalk around, pull out her hair, yell at us, etc. One day we were lined up to go to the gym. Like most days we weren't doing something perfectly, which caused a delay. While we were waiting for what seemed like an eternity, one kid goes up to her (to the front of the line at the door) and tells her he doesn't feel well. Now, this kid had trouble hearing and speaking, but he tried his best. All the kids had grown up around him and could understand him. She couldn't understand him at first, and he kept holding his stomach and telling her he didn't feel well. Finally, she yells at him \"Go to the bathroom!\" and, well, either he couldn't make it or he took her words literally. Liquid poo shot out of his shorts, then he proceeded to run down the hall in a panic to the bathroom. That's when she decided it was a good idea to let us leave the classroom for the gym as the overwhelming smell of shit filled the air. He shit in the middle of the doorway, so we had to tip toe around the puddle and walk carefully down the hall to avoid the poo drops. I still feel bad for that kid because he had enough troubles without being known as the kid who shit everywhere. She was a terrible teacher who didn't give shit... ",
            "I remember one time I was waiting for class to start in the 6th grade and I started feeling nauseous, so I told my teacher. That year I was getting all c's and b's so I didn't have any kind of extra trust that usually came from extraordinary grades at my school, so she didn't believe me and just said I should've gone before class. So I threw up in my mouth and swallowed it because I was disgusting lil sack of poop at the time. I got nauseous again later on in class so I went up to tell my teacher again while she was lecturing. She didn't like this and told me to sit down.  Then, as I was explaining that I really wasn't feeling good I projectile vomited onto my teacher. I dont really like confrontation so I never told the whole story to anyone, and my teacher didn't get fired or suffer any consequences outside of other students making fun of her. She sent me to the nurses office and I went home after throwing up again, this time in the office sink.",
            "Similar story, in 6th grade my best friend and I had a terrible teacher. We had those school breakfast French toast sticks that morning and 30 minutes into class my best friend gets real pale. She asked the teacher if she could go to the bathroom, he said no. And then no again, until finally she was grabbing her stomach and puking all over the table we were sitting at. Thank you Mr. L, I will never enjoy french toast sticks ever again. ",

I finally convinced my dad to take me home as i was a teen but not quite old enough to drive. Riiiight as i walked through the front door BLEGHFHGH all over the floor.

            "I was a sick kid growing up but I didnt like telling people when I was sick unless I knew it was gonna be an extra bad day. In 5th grade i had started getting very bad reactions from my ADHD(ADD) medication to the point my body literally forced it out of me. Most of the time it was a dry heave but one time as soon as i got to school and we lined up for morning extracurricular class i tried to tell her i was gonna be sick, she just told me i was fine and to get back in line. I walk about two steps and threw up a good bit but swallowed it so i wouldn't get yelled at. Another two steps and I couldnt hold it all so I ran to the trash can and spat it all out. It was mostly water and the medication so the teacher thought I just faked it with spit. She didnt think in was faking after she got her nice leather shoes covered in a wonderful layer of bile and Vivance.",

            "Two stories related:\n\nWhen I had turned 9 I just started the 4th grade. Precious I had a fantastic teacher who had the respect of his students so he didn\u2019t need to worry about trivial things like approving bathroom breaks. So long as you didn\u2019t interrupt his class or take to frequent he didn\u2019t care. Well this new teacher was terrible and also afraid of losing power so she understood a bathroom break to be ditching class and avoiding her. One day I got the shits from breakfast. I had gone to the bathroom 3 times by 10 am. Well she felt it was too much so said i was not allowed to go again until after lunch. 20 minutes later I feel my tummy rumbling so I just go to quietly excuse myself during independent reading, avoiding asking permission because of what i was just told, and on the way it she screams, runs across the bathroom, grabs my arm and literally throws me back into the classroom; landing into a chair. She screams that I was told no more breaks an hour ago and i was to sit and wait. Well i friend waiting more but 5 minutes later I knew it was a losing battle I walk over to the can, from trow and coat the inside of her desk can. She took me to the principal for disciplinary actions immediately and when my mother heard what happened she blew more shit than I did. Oddly enough that teacher did not return from term break.\n\nOther story was much further along. 16 years old and just starting junior year in secondary school. Had a bitch of an algebra prof who allowed no leaving the classroom during her hour and a half. She actually had the knob flipped so that the key was on the inside and she would lock us in during class. Well I had bad fish at lunch that day so my stomach was, again, turning in place. I knew i was about to erupt just not good timing as to when. I asked to go to the bathroom as not to cause an incident. No go. Then I asked to go see the nurse. This is to be allowed at any time, for any reason, without question. Again, nada. Lastly i say simply I want to take the trash can back next to my desk. She said she would not allow any sort of interruption to upset her class. Now for reference, I sit just next to her desk so I could reach out and touch her if she was seated at it. She finished up lecture and we start reading when I feel Ole Faithful start a knocking. I choke it down long enough for her to get back to her desk and sit down. Now this lady is the epitome of fat. She was wider than she was deep or tall. I\u2019m talking easily 70% body fat. She more or less pivoted foot to foot because she could no longer move her legs so this was holding it down for a while. But as soon as her ass hit that seat I turn and spray her up and down. I\u2019m talking firehose all over her face and front. When I finish, I ask if I am now allowed to leave the classroom for the nurse. I never returned. Next day i was told I was transferred to a different prof. ",

            "Back in grade 3 or 4, during a math class, I could feel a big fart coming on. So I asked my teacher if I could go to the bathroom, because I could feel I wouldnt be able to let it out silently. She denied my request, so I did my best to hold it in. \n\nBut then I had to get up and point to something and the little amount of strain was enough to push out a little toot. My teacher then got very angry and said how disguisting it was to just fart on purpose in the middle of class and ejected me from the rest of the class. \n\n Bitch, it was not fucking on purpose and I tried to find a solution we could both be happy about.",
            "I did a similar thing. Some kids were playing in the bathroom and when they came back the teacher yelled at all of us and said no one could go to the bathroom. Only....I had to pee. Bad. I pissed myself in my chair and that bitch wouldn't let me call my mom",

After fighting it for about 30 minutes, I can't hold it back any longer and walk towards the trash can to puke. This was one of those vomits that was like a fire hose at full blast. Almost like it is lifting you off the ground. Just as the liquid exits my mouth, my manager walks into the back room to see me puking. \n\nHe just turned around and left and came back a few minutes later. I was sitting on the floor with a smaller trash can sweating and drooling cause I still felt like puking. He said as soon as I felt up to it, I could leave for the day. \n\nI didn't puke after that point but I took that trash can with me when I left just in case cause I didn't want to puke in my car. I cleaned it out and brought it back. Said manager took my word seriously after that when I told him I didn't feel well.",

So one of the teachers decided everyone would wait in lines and had to stay quiet for a full minute before we could have recess. I told another teacher I had to pee and they told me to just wait.

We were in history class and were planning on heading over to the 8th grade wing to look at the projects they had been working on for a while (groups acted out and explained scenes from different time periods). I told my teacher before we left that my stomach hurt, and she brushed it off as me just trying to get out of class (granted I had missed a lot of school that year, but that was mostly due to an issue that made me go in and out of hospital often, and she knew that I was in hospital when I was gone). Well she didn't let me go to the nurse, and so I went along with the rest of the class to watch the 8th graders' history projects. I was able to watch a couple before I started feeling kind of dizzy and somehow made it to the middle of the big room that they were in. Before I knew it I was on the floor puking onto the carpet. My teacher saw after a moment and brought a trash can over, while another teacher who's class was in the room at the same time ran to go get the nurse.

        "selftext": "Added TLDR in the end.\n\nAbout a couple of decades ago, I used to work at a concrete production plant for a reputable construction company. Our company, like several other construction companies, were awarded a portion of a larger project.\n\nA large portion of land was earmarked for setting up temporary office buildings and concrete plants for the different construction companies. The \u201csites\u201d were separated by temporary barriers and had separate entrances. \n\nAs many of you may (or not) know, concrete is produced my mixing cement, water, sand and stone grits (size 20mm + 10mm) along with special admixtures in a specific ratio. Our recipe also contained a special ingredient - stone dust. Turns out, only our company used stone dust in our concrete and the neighbors did not. So a special truckload full of stone dust was specially shipped for us. This is important later. \n\nMy job entailed orchestrating concrete delivery to our project sites apart from regular quality control tasks like checking incoming materials for quality etc. Only after I had signed the delivery receipts, our stores personnel would unload the trucks at designated areas. A log of all trucks entering and leaving the concrete batching plant would be kept by security at gate (Relevant later.)\n\nSince my job entailed checking incoming material before accepting, the suppliers would usually try to offer some petty bribes, from cash to booze to flesh - if you know what I mean \ud83d\ude09 \nI always declined such offers as once accepted, you became their dog and lose all respect in their eyes. Moreover, bad material also impacted the quality of concrete produced: strength, consistency and setting time, to name a few. Since concrete delivery was also part of my job, it was in my best interest to only accept good material, otherwise the client would chew me up during casting. \n\nOne night, a supplier truck entered the premises with 20mm stone chips. Upon testing, I found them to be undersized for 20mm and oversized for 10mm. I went ahead and rejected the load. The driver and supplier started pestering me, offering bribes and what not. When I didn\u2019t budge, they called my boss who asked me what was going on. I explained that the quality of material was unacceptable and I have rejected this. When I mentioned it is too small for 20mm, he ordered me to dump it in 10mm bin anyway. I knew what that meant. My boss was on the supplier\u2019s payroll. \n\nA couple of weeks pass by and my boss asked me to reject \u201ca truckload\u201d of material from a very reliable supplier. He knew that the supplier was only delivering stone dust that day and should we reject material, the entire load would be a waste and a loss to the supplier. Once the stone chips or stone dust has left the quarry, they, for some reason, can\u2019t bring it back. Hence my boss wanted to hit the supplier where it hurt most. Especially stone dust as there was no other company that would take it. \n\nCue - malicious compliance. I called the supplier, who had become a friend by now and told him that I was under orders to reject \u201ca truck\u201d. He panicked and told me that my boss was putting pressure on him for bribes. This particular supplier believed in providing quality material and always visited my lab to understand how I tested the material and what my requirements were. He would then go back to his quarry and adjust the equipment to deliver the best quality materials. Because he put so much effort in improving the quality of his product, he did not budge and bow down to my boss\u2019s demands. \n\nI asked the supplier friend to route a truckload of 20mm stone chips meant of some other company to my plant first. I would let the gate security log the trucks\u2019 entry and then promptly reject the material. He was then supposed to send the stone dust which I would accept and be done with my \u201ctask.\u201d\n\nEverything happened as planned, I completed my remaining activities for the night and went home. When I came back to work in the evening, my boss was waiting for me at the door. As expected, he had checked the entry/exit log as well as material receipt history. He had noticed that I had accepted the stone dust and was chewing his anger, waiting for me to explain. \n\nHe very casually asked me if I had rejected a truckload. I acted dumb and answered in affirmation. I told him that the very first truck, a 20mm was rejected. Now usually 20mm is never rejected, especially from this supplier, so he asked me what reason did I give while rejecting the truckload. I said flakiness index - a test we never do as a field test, but is mandated by the client to be done once a quarter. \n\nHe knew that I was playing him but he couldn\u2019t do anything. I had done exactly what he had asked meto do, reject \u201ca truckload.\u201d I had covered my bases with the security log as well as material receipt so he just muttered something under his breath and never mentioned this to me again or asked me to do anything similar. 2 months later he was transferred to a different site and I became the overall incharge - same designation and pay, just more responsibilities.\n\nEdit: Wow. So many upvotes and a Gold. I am deeply humbled \ud83d\ude4f\n\nEdit 2: wow another gold and then a platinum. I feel blessed.\n\nEdit 3: TL;DR - manager asks me to reject \u201ca truckload\u201d of material, assuming I would reject the special kind. I reject the generic material which was meant for someone else anyway, thereby saving a supplier a bunch of money and inconvenience.",

            "I used to be an inspector for TxDOT back in the day. We had a contractor that had their own plant, but wasn't very good. One night, we were slipform paving, and somewhere in the middle of it they sent a truck of soup (slipform paving you need thicker concrete). I knew it wouldn't pass, so I started doing the slump test on it. Specs also said I could hold it for 45 minutes.\n\nSo, I started doing that on every truck. At one point, I had every one of the plant's trucks waiting. By the end of the night, I sent back 19 trucks that didn't pass inspection. That means the company had to eat the cost. While I was holding the trucks on site, the plant manager came out with a stack of 100's, and asked me what it would take for the concrete to pass. My answer was the concrete needed to pass the slump test...\n\nI had to explain to the big boss why I rejected so many trucks.

            "I've only known of two separate instances where we had run-ins with contractors and regional inspectors. The first was a good on the contractor's behalf. \n\nThey misjudged (or flat out didn't and tried to bull their way through with a wild number) the moisture content on a load of aggregate for concrete. \n\nThey based their batches for a bridge project on that number, which pretty much made batches as dry as popcorn; the rocks were literally heard rattling around in the drum!  We limited out on the water allotted by the book to add to dry batches to get them to spec, and it was still dry. \n\nThe pump truck was choking on the dry crap, so we took a load, and ran a slump cone. Now in doing so, we were measuring the moisture content by making a controlled cone of concrete slump and after a predetermined measure of time, measured how far the concrete slumped down. \n\nNormal slumps usually run around 4-7\" depending on the materials used. This one, ran one quarter of an inch.  (.25\") It was that bad.  Dad rejected that truck. \n\nBut the sawed off young buck mouthed off at dad, which the foreman and the crane operator heard. Dad, John, Frank, and me, would have easily totaled over 1 ton of deadweight, and this little shit of a trucker barely tipped the scales at 100. He realized he had no authority there or the muscle, scampered back to his truck, and ran for it. We got on the radio, stopped all concrete deliveries and requested they redo the moisture tests.  \n\nOne hour later the next truck arrived with the owner riding shotgun, and we ran the full spectrum of tests; the slump and air retention on them; it was perfect.\n\nThe next one was just pure corruption. We rejected a lot of aggregate rock due to poor sizing. The sieve tests on the sample were way out of spec. Dad kicked it out and informed the district office of the end result, mailing them the reports.  Comes to find out later they ALTERED the forms showing it was in spec, gun-decking their own test reports to reflect the alteration. You could EVEN see the whiteout on dad's test forms. He got hot, and filed complaints with Region 1 and our own boss. The repercussions bounced up and down the line, and I THINK the district office's director \"retired\" early.  No one ever crossed us afterward.",
            "I was a supply officer in the military. What you said about once you take bribes, you belong to them is so true.  The people who provide the food, services, etc won't get in trouble for bribing you, so once you take a bribe, you can never reject a bribe, or they threaten to tell your boss.  You go to Leavenworth and they find the next sucker.\n\nApparently it is even worse in intelligence. Once you take a bribe from a foreign power, you get life in prison/death penalty if you are ever caught, so the folks who bribed you for a ship schedule now own you.  Side note, with a few exceptions most spies actually get reduced sentences in exchange for providing as much information as possible on exactly what information they shared, but 20 years instead of life is not a huge relief.",

            "A bit late to the party but I wanna share a 30 year old story from my dad. He often tells me that the construction/real estates industry is cesspool of bribe action. Once you give in to your greed, you are forever tainted and will lose respect by being recognised as the person who could be dealt with through bribery. It is a tough road for the few rare people who really uphold the correct moral values and professionalism.\n\nAs an architect and belonging to the compliance department in a real estate company, he has to screen over the contractors' application for a huge project. \n\nSo he was sent to the mainland China for a certain hotel construction project in the early 90s. Different companies tried different ways to bribe him into accepting their tender. \n\nThe most notable one was the contractor that was going to secure the contract anyways as their proposal was the best. Yet the night before the announcement, they bribe my dad's hotel staff and took his keys and put 10\\~20 hemp bags of coins in his room, saying that is the part payment if my dad is willing to accept their tender. Then the contractor emptied out the bags and all the money scattered on the bed, trying to show how rich my dad could be for accepting the offer.\n\nMy dad just told him that tenders are chosen according to the details of their proposal. Then he said he will check out and switch hotels as he don't want to sleep on a bed full of the smell of coins. Then he told the contractor to clean up his own mess and take their coins back home. The contractor called my dad a douche for not helping him put the coins back in the hemp bags. What a tosser.\n\nAlso, the face of the contractor shaking hands with my dad in the public event photoshoot after securing the contract was hilarious. Dude would have secured the contract anyways but the culture of bribery was deeply rooted in them. Pathetic.\n\nLastly, he said the people who are the most prone to such acts are either over-ambitious young bloods who want to get some quick success, or those who have been clean their whole lives but close to retirement but suddenly insecure about their financial stability after retirement. These advices never really helped me as I chose a totally different field of work. But I guess it still was great knowing that my dad was a good person.",

        "selftext": "This is the story of how I got hired at an old job I had a few years ago. The technical manager (who ultimately became my boss) was a great guy and was the one who embarked on a course of malicious compliance to get what he wanted. It happened like this...\n\nThe company was small, about 20 people, and run by a CEO who knew the company's industry but didn't know anything about technology. What she knew was that she had a team of five developers and one technical manager, and that the company's code was written in the a programming language called C# (pronounced \"C-sharp\"). One day, her favorite member of the development team quit, whom she regarded as their foremost expert on C#. \n\nTo the technical manager, this was an enormous opportunity. He had four other developers who knew C#, but what he was missing was an expert in database design and administration. The company processed a huge volume of data, and he knew enough about databases to know that theirs were a mess: the same data had to be recorded in multiple places and was always getting out of sync, operations that should have taken a few seconds would run for minutes, etc. He didn't want to replace the departed employee with another developer; he wanted a database expert. But the CEO wouldn't hear of it. Cue malicious compliance. \n\nSomehow he got a description of the person he actually wanted into the hands of a recruiter, who found me. (I had over ten years of experience in database development and administration at that point, but had never touched a line of C# code in my life.) The technical manager had a \"skills assessment\" he was giving to all candidates for the job, which was 100% database questions. There was a huge, boldface warning at the top, which I found extremely odd, stating, \"These questions are extremely difficult; it is unlikely you'll be able to answer them all. You may not be able to answer any. Do not feel any pressure to attempt questions you find too difficult, as these results are not related to the position.\" I was told I had 20 minutes to work on it. Well, I finished it in about 2-3 minutes, the questions were all actually very easy, and walked back in to the office of the technical manager to ask if I was missing something and what this was all about. He gave me the \"shush\" gesture and motioned me back into the conference room. Then he explained. \n\nHis office was adjacent to the CEOs office, so he couldn't talk in there. The warning was something he'd been forced to put on the test after a recruiter (who apparently had initially been just as confused as I was) had called the CEO to ask why they were giving a database assessment for a C# position. He'd had to play it off to the CEO as, \"Well, wouldn't it be good to know if we happen to find a C# developer who is comfortable with databases too?\" He explained all the backstory described above. And then we talked for about 30 minutes about databases. C# didn't come up. The job sounded really interesting and would be a chance for me to make an enormous positive difference. At the end, he said, \"OK, you're perfect, I'm going to recommend you for the position, but first you have to talk to the CEO. Remember, when you talk to her, you're a \\*\\*C# expert\\*\\*. Got it?\" I was worried, but I thought, \"Worst case, I get caught and don't get the job; best case, I can really help this company.\" \n\nInto the CEO's office I went. After an exchange of pleasantries, she said, \"So, what would you say is your #1 technical strength?\" I made a thoughtful face, and said, \"Well, it's hard to say. I have skills in a lot of different areas, but if I had to pick one, I'd say probably C# programming.\" Her face lit up. \"Ah, fantastic!\" she said, \"That's exactly what we're looking for!\" We talked for a few more minutes about salary requirements and start dates (I said I could start in two weeks), and at the end she offered me the job. \n\nThat night, I stopped on the way home and bought a book about C#-- I think it was literally called something like \"Learn C# in 14 Days.\" By the time I started two weeks later, I knew enough C# to do my job. As the technical manager had said, there was an enormous amount of database redesign to do, so the C# programming was maybe 10-20% of my time. I was able to get those database jobs down from minutes to seconds like they should have been, and the CEO was so impressed she never even questioned my background. I continued to learn C# on the job, and no one ever found out I hadn't been a C# expert all along.",

Old people, old machines, just old...\n\nThey wanted to hire someone who knew CAD design and layout.  Truth is I was great at all of it, but not too familiar with CAD due to simple lack of access.  \n\nSo, what I did was bootleg the CAD system and camped out in a friends dorm room for two weeks to learn it on their system.  I did not own a computer powerful enough at the time.  I had also done everything manually to that point too, which really helped.\n\nSame kind of scenario really.  Hire in for the \"required\" skill, but end up making a big difference due to other needed skills.\n\nFunny how it worked out too.  I ended up moving away from prototyping and manufacturing due to the major outsource wave in the 90's.  Had I not taken the job and stretched for the CAD part of it, I may well have had a lot tougher time of it all.  Turns out CAD was easy for me and fun.\n\nMoved again, into professional work associated with the CAD and related systems, eventually building up fairly large scale, multi user managed CAD systems capable of building cars!  Did a lot of that on SGI computers too.  Lots of fun.\n\nAnyhoo, great story!  Have fun!  You should given how you came in the door.  \n\n-----\n\n\nHey passersby! You just never know!  Deffo make that difference when you can, but also take the skill builders when they come up!  If you can scrape in, learn as you go and hopefully work with cool people that help one another, it almost always adds right up to bigger, better things.\n\nOver time, you end up able to do a lot, and it can all build on your core competencies! For me that was computers and manufacturing.  CAD and related systems amplified all that nicely.  Could just as easily be anything you are good at and or are putting time into getting good at it.\n\nOP is likely to have a similar thing happen.  Databases are their wheelhouse.  Adding the new language + some experiences bringing out the best in that company may = much higher value opportunities later on.\n\nWhat door you walk into the building matters.

There are 6 or so corpsmen assigned to take care of these patients. As part of our duties we are to chart our findings and observations as we make our rounds.\n\nThis surgery ward is usually a first assignment for corpsman and nurses coming fresh from school. I joined the Navy at 21yo so am a little more world wise than my peers who are all 18 or 19. I know, especially in the military, there is the book way of doing things and the effective way of doing things. We had volumes of manuals that covered every aspect of our jobs and duties that you could imagine.\n\nCue the new nurse who has been assigned and wants to show how good she is at managing the lowly corpsman troops. She was merciless. Always looking for opportunities to embarrass or cause trouble for us.\n\nOne evening I observed her shouting at one of the corpsman for using an unapproved abbreviation in a patient's chart. What was the offensive abbreviation? ASAP He had written that the patient needed an evaluation ASAP. You would have thought that he had personally offended her honor.\n\nI went and looked in the approved abbreviations section of our operations manual to confirm that it was not there. It was not. I did find that there was a very extensive list of approved abbreviations available to use though.\n\nCue the MC. I pulled all of the corpsmen on the shift and told them to bring their charts to the break room. We then charted all of the notes together using nothing but approved abbreviations. The notes looked like another language! I made sure everyone could read their own notes and sent them out to put the charts back.\n\nNurse \"pain in the butt\" came in to review the notes with the corpsmen. I take the first round. This is done while standing at the bedside of the patients. She opens the chart, looks at the note and says\n\nNurse: WHAT IS THIS?!!\n\nMe: I do not understand. What do you mean?\n\nNurse: I do not understand anything you have written.\n\nMe: It says that the patient is recovering well with little difficulty but will need further evaluation based on his comments and visible demonstration of discomfort and reduced mobility in his left upper limb.\n\nNurse: That is not what it says.\n\nMe: Maam, I assure you that it does and that those are all approved abbreviations. I am sorry that you do not know them. I do realize that you are new.\n\nI smile. She does not. This is the first of 60 charts she is to review. I have never seen corpsmen so eager to review chart notes. We did go get the manual for her, just to be helpful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPosted in  [r/militarystories](https://www.reddit.com/r/militarystories) as well.",

In walked a man with a serious case of Main Character Syndrome. He placed his order, then stood directly against the pick-up counter. \n\nShortly after, my food came out (and yes, they called out my order number). He quickly snatched it up, then looked in the bag and noticed it wasn't the right food. Since there was no chance he could have made a mistake, he started to complain. Yelling that they gave him the wrong food, he insisted they put his food in the bag right away.\n\nWith the joy of someone who doesn't get paid enough for this shit, they gladly obliged. Taking the bag back, they quickly piled all his food right on top of mine. The toxic levels of smug emanating from the man dissipated as the employee turned and handed me the bag.\n\n\"I'm sorry, sir. This bag wasn't your order. It was his [mine]. Your order will be just a few more minutes, as we need to remake it.\"",

            "I worked in a quick serve restaurant. Occasionally we would run out of a product, and we let people know and gave them other options. Most people were ok with it, but there were always those idiots who lost their absolute shit. I was a manager and I would immediately intercede between the idiots and my people. I have never lived by the customer is always right so I basically would tell them to get a grip or get out. After one morning of this nonsense, I went to a Moes. I\u2019m on my phone while waiting so I wasn\u2019t paying a lot of attention until I heard a grown ass man shouting at the young girl at the beginning of the line. He storms out. I move up and this poor girl is trying not to cry and said: I just want you to know we don\u2019t have rice right now.  I laughed and said: well I ran out of caramel earlier so no big deal. Just give me the rest.    I will never forget the deer in the headlight look she gave me. No one in the history of mankind needs to treat anyone like that, especially a child. That was 5 years ago and I\u2019m still mad about it!",
            "I went to a Whataburger in Texas last year and ordered some food. When they called my number, some lady that was standing right beside the pick up area, grabbed my bag and started rummaging through it. She complained that it was the wrong order. I spoke up and said, \"That's because it's mine.\" Then I told the guy behind the counter to remake my order since I had no idea where that bitch has had her hands. She didn't like that I said that, and I didn't care. Got a fresh new order. Grabbed the bag before she could shove her hands in it.",

            "I had this about six months ago in the Mc Donald\u2019s. There was a big queue as it was a national holiday. Almost everyone ordered from the order machines so it was just waiting. My order is up, they call my number, I go over\u2026 but before I can get there a man has taken the bag and thrown his ticket down (the wrong number of course!). My order was small enough but had a separate happy meal with it. I looked to the man who took it, \u201cI think that\u2019s mine sir\u201d to which I got a smug look like \u201cI don\u2019t think so!\u201d. So I handed my paper over and I told them they had just called my number and I think that man has taken mine, which they can for 90% confirm. They had to remake my part of the order and when it was finally ready I walked out with the apologies of the staff (of course I told them it was absolutely not their fault). Just as I am leaving out the door I see Mr-steals-my-food with a raspberry face. I don\u2019t know if I said it loud enough but my \u201coh? Took the wrong bag?\u201d Sounded much louder in my head. I really hope they treated him how he deserved while they prepared his bags again. May your fries be always soggy and your burgers always cold sir!!",

            "When I worked my first job, I would sometimes go pick up lunch for the shift. Typically it was McDonald's, and typically this happened during the lunch rush. I never asked any of my coworkers for specific orders because I wanted to keep the order at the restaurant simple. I'd just inform everyone I was going to pick up cheeseburgers, my treat. \n\nSo I get to McDonald's and I go inside. I don't see any sense in taking up the drive through when I'm ordering enough burgers to feed 5 teens. Wait my turn in line, get to the front, and order saying \"could I please get 16 mcdoubles? No rush, I know you're busy and I have time.\" Then I'd go stand away from the high traffic areas and wait for my order to be called. \n\nThe staff seemed genuinely appreciative. They had to deal with a lot of individuals like the hero in this story. And often they'd give me the benefits. Someone ordered 2 big macs, but for whatever reason decide they only want one? I got a free big Mac. Gentleman ordered an iced coffee then complains theres ice in his coffee? I got a free iced coffee. \n\nWhen my order was ready, I'd always take the bag with a smile and a \"thanks so much, have a great day.\" Its not hard to be decent to service workers and ill never understand why some people have such a hard time with it.",

People are very fast to complain, but rarely does someone take 2 minutes and compliment an employee anywhere.\n\nTake the time to ask for a supervisor, it really does make a difference. Don't just complain when you don't get your own way, if someone is surviving working with the nasty public, demand a supervisor... for a compliment.\n\nMatter of fact, if you are going to complain to someone, fine. Do it. But find two others somewhere that you can compliment. If you can't think of anyone to compliment, it's you and not everyone around you.",
