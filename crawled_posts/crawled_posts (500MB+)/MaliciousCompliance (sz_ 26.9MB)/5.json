        "selftext": "I've been living in Japan for a little over two years with my husband. He was born here and we decided to move to his hometown. It's a small city, but there's enough to do without getting bored. I'd describe us as an AMWF couple (Asian man, white female for those who don't know). It's not so common in western countries, and it can feel like we are some rare shiny Pokemon as AMWF in rural Japan-lots of staring, occasional secret picture, or even small chats if an old lady is brave enough to approach us. It can feel uncomfortable eating at a restaurant because kids will turn around in their seat and stare at us the whole time with an open fish mouth. Coincidentally, there's a small U.S. military base located in this city. The closer you are downtown, the more American families you see. I'm constantly mistaken for being military by Americans and Japanese which is understandable. Besides myself, I only know 5 other interracial marriages here. It's always locals who ask about my 'American husband' when I'm out alone, which I respond in Japanese \"Watashi no otto wa nihonjin desu. Koko ni sunde imasu\" (My husband is Japanese and I live here) or something along those lines. Americans never ask about my marriage as they assume my spouse is American. When we are together in public, we do abnormal couples behavior such as holding hands (no, couples rarely hold hands in public, let alone say 'I love you').\n\nWe don't go downtown too often since it's all pay to park and it's a nightmare to find a place. It was a beautiful warm day for the first time in months, but we decided to battle for a spot and walk around the shops. The crowd was heavy since the weather was great and winter was ending. The season for new American families to move here just finished, so I'm sure this was many peoples' first time to leisurely walk and shop outside.\n\nWe find a parking spot and made our way to the outside shops. Of course, we are holding hands and casually talking and laughing.\n\n\"WOW.\" I hear this from an American woman about 10 feet behind us. You should know that a Japanese stereotype against Americans is that we are rudely and obnoxiously loud. And this 'wow' was loud enough for me to turn my head around at the noise. She was with 2 other moms who had like, 3 kids each. They were staring at me, but perhaps we just accidentally had eye contact at the right time.\n\n\"Seriously, another little homewrecker is doing this in PUBLIC?\" Chill woman, you're so loud even I can hear you. We find a table nearby at the Starbucks outside. We are enjoying our drinks when the same group of women approached us with their strollers in tow. They definitely had some sort of purpose with something to say to us. Let's call her Onna (woman in Japanese).\n\nOnna: \"Excuse me, but you need to keep whatever you're doing in your messed up home. Doing that in public in front of families to see is disgusting and immoral. My kids don't need to see such a bad display of marriage.\"\n\nI'm SO confused, as was my husband who can speak English. Who knew drinking coffee outside was a crime against humanity and marriage?\n\nMe: \"I\\`m sorry? What...did we do?\"\n\nOnna: \"You know exactly what you're doing.\" \\*She points to my wedding ring\\*\n\nMe: \"No, I don't....\"\n\nOnna: \"Good lord, does your husband know about this? Is he on a ship right now? That's soooo like a dependapotamus!\" Her friends laugh. In case you don't speak military, a dependapotamus is slang for a military wife who stays at home all day, doesn't clean, uses their spouse as an ATM, and looks like Jabba the Hut. It dawns on me; she thinks I'm a military spouse and I'm cheating on my American husband! I started laughing because she's suggesting I'm cheating on my husband, with my husband!\n\nMe: \"This IS my spouse. I'm actually not part of the military community and have a Japanese visa.\" Onna looks at my significant other up and down. The two women behind her apologize, but the Onna didn't believe it.\n\nOnna: \"No one would voluntarily WANT to live in this little town. Nice lie, but you're not representing the military community. You make all of us wives look like whores! Who is your husband and what's his rank? Also I need to your dependent ID. MY husband is a high rank so he'll make sure your husband is aware of your infidelity.\" She pulls out her phone to probably type my response. I'm offended since this is actually a nice place to live and very open to foreigners.\n\nMe: \"Look, my husband's name is Rei (not his real name; I don't want to reveal personal info) and he's sitting right here. I'm not going to show you my military ID since I don't have one, and you're not the police. As proof, you can obviously see our wedding bands match and here's a picture.\" I show her my phone screen which is of us in traditional Japanese clothes on our wedding day. Her eyes became huge at the picture. Her two friends and their spawn have already started walking away.\n\nOnna: \"Why are you in a relationship with HIM? You should be in a normal relationship and start having a family with American kids.\" She says some other statements which I'd consider racist against the Asian race. It's so ironic because we are in JAPAN, and she's fussing about me being married to a Japanese man. My husband has been quiet throughout the whole exchange and says to me we should go. I agree and stood up.\n\nMe: \"STOP. The things you are saying are extremely offensive. I was part of the military community myself some years ago and what you're doing is against spousal conduct.\"\n\nShe smirked. \"Go ahead and tell people what I did, then. My high ranking husband is an E-7, and everything will be swept under the rug no matter what happens. You can't touch me.\"\n\n**So that's what I did.**\n\nNote, this is a small military community. Someone does something minor and it's talked about between wives like chickens. Later that day, I run into my friend who works on the base and she's well known in the community for being one of the main event coordinators. I don't miss this chance to comply with Onna's demand, and explain to my friend about the exchange and how it made my husband extremely uncomfortable with her remarks. She asked me if this person looked like so and so, which I said yes. My friend rolls her eyes.\n\nFriend: \"She just arrived a couple months ago and is already causing problems with rumors and drama. Looks like we have a racist, too. I'll make sure what she said is passed on.\"\n\nIt's been half a year later and I didn't hear anything about Onna again since I distanced myself from making military friends here. I've only been in my new city for a little over 2 years and experienced more drama from military families than I have my whole high school career. That is, until now. Last week, I ran into my friend who's getting ready to leave back to the United States. We had a little discussion about her moving and my family planning, and dropped a bombshell.\n\nFriend: \"Do you remember Onna, who accused you of cheating on your non-existent military spouse and called your husband a racist name?\"\n\nMe: \"Of course! I haven't heard anything from her since.\"\n\nFriend: \"Well, I mentioned we were already having problems with her not long after she got here. I told my boss that there's a person who was bothering and threatening civilians and asking for IDs which isn't allowed for someone with her status. My boss was extremely interested after I mentioned her name because Onna was scheduled for an interview in my department! I suggested we look at her social media accounts from her past behavior, because we don't tolerate racism. It was easy to find her Twitter and Facebook, particularly Facebook since we have many mutual friends. Her SNS was SHOCKING. While she set her Facebook to private, her Twitter was littered with malicious Tweets and reTweets. This included racism slang for many nationalities, colorful language, and using her husband's military rank to bully others. She made it very clear that she 'wants to see her current city burn to the ground' and 'why would anyone want to learn Japanese since it's sounds terrible'. We printed some of the more extreme things she posted and we still invited her to the interview.\n\n**\"Oh, and did I mention my boss is JAPANESE?!!\"**\n\n\"So she comes into the interview which I was part of. I asked three good things about her which is she says 'dependent, gets things done, and friendly.' My boss just looked at her for a second before he pulled out her Tweets and asked her to explain how she can friendly serve the local community if she hates it so much. Onna was FLOORED and said someone hacked into her account, despite there being at least 3 years of slanderous Tweets. We thanked her for coming and said we can't accept an employee with this conduct. As far as I know, she's still not working because some spouses found her Twitter not long after the interview and was shared in all departments. No one will touch her application now.\"\n\nMe: \"So all of this was discovered because I told you about her accusations?\"\n\nFriend: \"Yes! Oh, and she's kind of an outcast socially right now because she cheated on her husband a couple months ago.\"\n\nThere you have it folks. Because one person couldn't mind their own business, they lost a potential job and had their social media exposed. Super ironic since she became the dependapotamus and adulterer-the same thing she was accusing ME of.\n\nEdit since some posts say it\u2019s fake because my writing sucks: this is how I tell my stories online.",

            "As someone who lived near the Yongsan Garrison, Osan AFB, and Camp Humphreys in South Korea at various points, I am fortunate to not have too many horror stories with military spouses. That said, I have had quite a few issues with active duty and contractors. I don't know where the military finds these people. People you have no business representing the US to the rest of the world. People who probably would have never left their home county or state if it weren't for the military. That's not saying all, as some do learn the language and engage in the culture. But the vast majority stay in a country like SK or Japan in their little Americanized \"villes\" and tell themselves that's what the rest of the country is like. It's not.\n\nBeing an American expat I really hate the situation where my government sends these people to different countries. Wouldn't it be weird for Americans to walk down the street and see a French Airforce Base and a French community of generally young, brash soldiers and their families? I understand the historical reasons for them to be there, but it's time they went home. In SK they say they are defending from NK, but the division of the peninsula was entirely arbitrary in the first place. Germany was divided because they were the aggressor (and even then they were reunited decades ago). Korea was divided because of a pissing contest with the Soviets (who don't exist anymore). America's State Dept Dean Rusk just drew a line across the peninsula, not consulting any Koreans about the matter. Remove the American troops and let Koreans decide their fate. At least they are getting them out of Seoul, segregating them off in Pyeongtaek.\n\nSorry for the rant, OP.

I'd been working there part time since I was 16 and when I turned 18, I got a notice to attend jury duty.   I picked a week and I let my boss know. The owner of the hotel found out (he was always a completely unreasonable jerk to all the employees) and sees me in the hallway and tells me that I need to do \"whatever it takes\" to get out of jury duty because he needs me at the hotel that week for a large dog-show, ..clogged drains..etc and **If I'm not at work, I'm fired.**\n\nWhen I get to jury duty, day 1, I get selected to a week-long trial, and the judge asks jurors if there's any reason we cannot serve on the jury.  They go around... When they get to me, I'm nervous, never been in court before and too scared to lie.  I tell the judge that the owner of the business I work at will fire me if I'm not back today and said I needed to do everything I can to get out of jury duty or I'm fired, other than that I'm fine serving.  The judge looks pissed.\n\nThe judge has me approach the bench, asks for the name of the owner, location, etc.  Then he hands the court officer a paper and says something to the officer.  (the judge still looks pissed)  I'm told to return to the jury box.  About an hour later (still selecting a jury), the officer returns with the owner, visibly shaken, in handcuffs and walked to the front of the judges bench.  The owner is standing in front of the judge.  The judge asks him questions which he apologetically tries to worm out of.  Then the judge (looking even more pissed)  instructs him that I will be here for jury duty, I will serve as long as I need to, and he should NOT do anything to retaliate against me -- and that the judge is filing charges and will be instructing the clerk to check with me regularly and if, for any reason, I am fired or face any disciplinary action at work - he will hold the owner in contempt, violation of a court order, etc (a bunch of legal stuff) and he will spend time behind bars thinking about how important jury duty is.   Then the judge makes him apologize to me, in court!\n\nI made it onto the jury and I served the week.  I reported back to work the following week.  I expected some blowback, but I never got fired, none of my shifts were changed and I got paid for my time in jury - I didn't ask why I got paid.   The clerk did check back a few times and I was told to call the judges clerk direct phone number if anything happened.  It was awesome, I was pretty much bullet-proof and worked until I saved enough to go back to school.",

            "This happened where I live.  Some \"exec\" fired a woman for going to jury duty because it was \"important\" that the employee stay at work to produce some press release for the company.  When the lady went to jury duty and was visibly upset, the judge got the story and sent county deputies who dragged that exec out of the office in handcuffs.  The exec got a good lesson in civics, the lady got her job back (but I think she declined), and got another job pretty quickly.",

            "Was called to jury duty a few years ago. One poor guy also in the pool worked nights, he couldn't afford to take off. Judge saw him having a hard time staying awake, asked him a few questions and excused from jury duty. The judge called down to the jury room and told the clerk that this jury member had served his week and was marked excused. I enjoyed watching this judge in action. She was firm but kind when needed.",

            "The last time I got called in to jury duty, I worked in a legal office. I happened to get called into the courthouse just a mile from the office, and actually got put into a pool for a murder trial. Before anything interesting happened, I was chatting with an older woman who was a lawyer herself, and knew my boss. She\u2019s the one who said I should make sure to name him, as apparently, he had a bit of a reputation in the courthouse.\n\nWhen the judge asked for reasons why we couldn\u2019t serve, the woman next to me said she was a lawyer herself, and was immediately excused. They came to me, and I said I work in a legal office, that my boss didn\u2019t pay for jury duty, and when they asked where, I told them. The judge nodded, then smiled. \n\n\u201cI know him. He\u2019s a cheap son of a gun. Excused.\u201d",

            "I've been on the jury on one civil trial and one criminal trial.  People wanted to be on the criminal trial (home invasion) but no so much the civil trial (medical malpractice).  So the excuses for both trials were wildly different.\n\nPeople getting excused during voir dire in the criminal trial had legitimate reasons for being removed.  Caring for an elderly parent, work travel, and one person found out the day before jury duty that they had cancer.  The judge let those people go.  I'm surprised that the defense attorney didn't have me removed, as the crime happened about 10 minutes from where I live.  I even remember seeing it reported in the newspaper.  It was a fairly big deal in my city, as I'm in a low crime area.\n\nThe civil trial was a different matter.  NOBODY wanted to hang out for 2-3 weeks for a medical malpractice trial.  I get it.  The average juror would have been falling asleep listening to the dueling medical experts and details of a rare form of cancer that was missed in diagnosis.  I get it.  One guy however decided that when the judge was asking him if there was \"any reason why you can't be objective?\",  the guy INTERRUPTED THE JUDGE before he could finish the question.  He then proceeded to tell the judge (paraphrased of course) that \"he wouldn't be fair and he would vote however he felt and would probably ignore the evidence\" blah, blah, blah...\n\nThe judge just leaned back in his chair, let the guy finish his rant.  The rest of the courtroom was deadly silent as the judge just let the room marinate in the glory of this guy's idiocy for about 30 seconds.  He then said \"Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to have a 5 minute recess... EXCEPT for mister interruption (and the attorneys).  He was told to wait there.\n\nWe filed out of the courtroom.  After 5 minutes, the bailiff came out and said go take a 20 minute break.  So we all go to the court cafeteria and come back at the allotted time.  We watch as the guy comes out of the courtroom white as a new fallen snow shaking and carrying his signed excuse paperwork.  The bailiff comes out and tells us that the judge basically ripped the dude for 20 minutes, and told him that if he ever does that again he will go to jail for contempt.  Oh, and by the way, his name was recorded by the judge and would be circulated to all the judges in the county, so don't try and do this in any courtroom in this county again.\n\nI talked to the bailiff and he said that in 20 years working for this judge, he's never seen him that mad at a juror.  He was surprised that the guy didn't spend the night in jail",
            "I just called my father who is a retired judge, read this to him, and he said the judge in the story went overboard and may have overstepped his authority. Dad also laughed so hard at your story he cried. \n\n\nI reminded my dad of the time a lawyer claimed he wasn't ready for trial on the day the trial was scheduled. When the lawyer refused to proceed, Dad held him in contempt of court and had him taken into custody and the lawyer went to jail for the night. So OP\u2019s story isn't so out of the realm of judicial power, depending on where you live.\nAlso, I can confirm that this judge will be telling this story decades later, as will his family members.

            "The first time I was summoned for jury duty I had just started a job (as a lawyer) with a government agency. All my co-workers were envious because they\u2019d always wanted to be on a jury, so they asked me to take notes on my experience. A number of other attorneys were in the jury pool but we were all dismissed right after we mentioned our jobs. The only non-attorney to be let go was a woman who told the judge, \u201cI work for the defendant so I assume you don\u2019t want me.\u201d He said, \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d",
            "It's actually illegal to retaliatorily fire an employee for serving jury duty. I was a courtroom clerk for 20+ years, and now I'm a judge's admin for 5 judges in chambers. Lots of people would say they couldn't serve because of work, but that was mainly to get out of jury service. When they were pressed, they actually weren't being threatened by any supervisors or owners. \n\nI absolutely adore my job now, and I love my judges. But man, do I miss the courtroom.",
            "Similar thing happened to me.\n(Its a long one, so buckle up)\n\nStarted at a job, 3 months in (after probation period had finished) get a jury summons. Don't get picked because I informed the court officer I had just started at a new job. All well and good. Only 2 hours of time lost at work.\n\nCouple of weeks go by and I get called up again. Go in, inform them of my position and the lady looks at me and says \"this case isn't a long one at all. If you keep declining, you're going to keep getting called up, so that means more time off work to attend.\"\nSo I bite the bullet, lo and behold, I get chosen as a juror, case starts that day.\n\nAfter I get out for the day, I call to inform my employer that I have to serve and will be doing my civic duty for the next 2 weeks or so. \nHe tells me that I need to do my best to get out of it and I won't be paid by the company in the meantime. \nWhere I'm from, the employer has to pay for the first 10 days of the employee, as it is a government summons, and they cannot threaten no pay, or use of personal leave in lieu of it.\n\nLater that night, I received a text message informing me that i had to get out of it and that I didn't try hard enough. If I dont get out of jury service, I will cost 14 people their jobs, as well as my own, because of loss of productivity and the company will fall apart.\nNeedless to say that I spoke to a court official the next day, was called up in front of the judge and asked if I was still fit to serve. I replied I was and was then informed that my employer is not permitted to talk to me for the duration of the trial, or he will receive a fine and face potential jail time. Coupled with a promise that if I'm fired for anything at all, that the judge would help sort things out.\nFinished the trial and returned to work. \nI wish it ended there, but it placed a huge target on my back. I was reprimanded for all sorts of things. Not walking with purpose, only being able to work as fast as a machine was able to run and other things. It affected my mental health and self worth in such a negative way that I had to leave. The final straw was being told I'm not worth what I was being paid and that I needed to step it up or look for a new job.\nSo I did just that. Kicker was, I felt bad for doing it.",
            "Who paid for your time in the jury?  I worked in a big government facility (2,000 people) and the rule was you still got paid for your jury time but had to give your paltry $10/day jury check to the company.  Not sure how private firms handled it.",
            "IRL lawyer here. OP did *exactly* what anyone should do if they are summoned for jury duty and their boss threatens to fire them - tell the judge, and let them handle it. The judge's response to the owner is pretty much what any judge will do to such a bad boss.\n\nThe jury system in the U.S. only works if jury pools are a real cross-section of the community - all races, all genders, rich, poor, blue-collar, white-collar, retired, just starting out. (Yes, even us lawyers, which is why I don't think we should get an automatic exception.) So when you get your summons, show up, tell the truth, and if you get selected, be fair. The legal system can't function without you.",

            "I had to do jury duty once. I wasn't picked to be a juror. The day I was scheduled to serve also happened to be the second day of work at my new job. It was a mart that may or may not have walls. You can guess how that conversation went on my first day on the job",
            "I served on a jury and my manager would call me daily because he was angry I was selected. He would say nearly every day that I just needed to convict and get back to work (like I could just decide to convict as a single juror at any time in the trial).\n\nThe trial lasted longer than expected, and when I returned to work he went out of his way to make my life hell. I won a contest based on sales, but it was announced that someone else had actually won. That person called me saying they thought I had won and didn\u2019t know why they had been announced as the winner.\n\nI asked our manager about it and was told it was because I wasn\u2019t eligible, but he couldn\u2019t explain why. He hinted at dire consequences if I tried to find out anymore, and finally told me he thought it might be \u201cperformance issues\u201d. He next claimed the Regional Manager disqualified me for some unknown performance issues.\n\nThen it finally came out. He said it was probably because my sales had suffered during a previous month. Coincidentally, it was the same month I\u2019d had jury duty...\n\nSo, to recap, boss is pissed I\u2019m on a jury, hounds me to convict. I won a sales contest, but was disqualified because although my sales were the best for the period of the contest, one month was lower because I was on jury duty.\n\nThen one morning I got a call from a coworker who had overheard our manager telling someone on the phone he was getting rid of me, and asking if whoever it was on the phone would back him up for credibility. What was I being gotten rid of for?  Who knows? My manager certainly didn\u2019t, he was talking about different things he could claim that might justify him firing me.\n\nAt a loss, I tried to contact the judge from the trial to ask him how I reported an employer retaliating against me for jury service. He spoke to me, but said the only thing that could be done was for me to contact HR at my employer.\n\nSo I did, and found myself being laid off just a few weeks later after nothing happened to my manager. I managed to stall it long enough to find another job by hiring an attorney.",

            "I got called for jury duty today once. I had interviewed for a job the day before, and when I went to court, they asked who had no problem serving. I raised my hand and they dismissed us to come back the next day. That night I got called and got hired for the job. I went back the next day and explained it to the judge and he said \u201cenjoy the new job. We appreciate your willingness to serve on the jury\u201d\n\nIt was for a murder trial.",
            "I had just gotten a promotion into Treasury and I was very excited. I had been working ridiculous hours, finishing a project before the switch. I brought the jury duty notice with me on my first day. My new boss looks at it, shrugs and says, \u201cbe on time when you\u2019re done\u201d and goes back to his conference call. My father always said that if you don\u2019t want to be put on the jury, wear a suit. I showed up in jeans, an old college sweatshirt and Birkenstocks. I recognized a young guy from the financial district who was also sporting the jeans/ t-shirt uniform. We ran that jury - the old people didn\u2019t even know what to make of us. This one woman kept forgetting parts of the testimony and the first time the other guy recited it from memory, they must have thought they were in the Twilight Zone. The trial started at 11 most days and they let us go by 3. It was like a vacation, one I badly needed. The judge liked us. The jury hated us. Good times.",
            "I think some companies have adapted to the rule of law when it comes to jury duty by their own form of malicious compliance. I got a jury notice for an especially complex crime - a gang attack on a family - multiple victims with multiple defendants and a crapload of serious charges.  It was going to be months in the jury box. So being a good employee, I ask HR about the jury duty policy, and they respond that I will receive FULL PAY while I was on the jury.\n\nSo I start the trial, and the first week into the duty I check my income, and SURPRISE - the company only paid for *3 days*! So I go back and check with HR, and yes - that is the company policy!  When I ask her WHY that detail was left out, she said that I should have been aware of the policy because it's in the revised company employee handbook (electronically available on the internal server, etc.)\n\nI knew enough about the changes to HR, where the new version of \"Human Resources\" keeps a complete accounting of your value as a collection of \"human resources\" to be used by the company - Heart $25,000, Liver $22,000, Software Engineering skills  $xx.xx.  So I couldn't complain - like to whom do I complain?  The court empaneled me, based on my understanding of the \"company policy to support the employees' jury service\" and the legally affirmed fact  that it would not be a hardship to have %5.357 of my paycheck.  The company documentation (and my testimony)  indicated that they \"supported\" jury duty (for 3 days).   So I was officially and legally ***screwed***. \n\nFrom September until December I would be a member of a jury from 9:00 until 3:45 PM 4 days a week, then I'd drive for over an hour to my company and work from  5:30 until 1:00 AM then head home to wash, rinse and repeat, with 16 hour Fridays and weekend work. \n\nMoral of the story - what a company calls \"supporting jury duty\" and what you consider \"supporting jury duty\" are likely 2 very different things.   **Any employer will maximize profits, especially if they can minimize your income**.  And your jury duty is now one way they can do that.",

They told me someone must have accidentally used my email when they created an account. Our last names were the same and our first initial. I said Oh no problem, you must have additional contact information for them besides my email, could you please remove my email from the account and let them know so they can fix?\n\nWell, immediately that was a big problem for Netflix and well, no they couldn't remove the email because it was the only one they had for the account and how did they even know that it was mine? I said give me your email address and start talking, I will email you the words as they come out of your mouth. That wasn't good enough for proof somehow. More likely I was in the other person's Gmail account asking to not have Netflix?\n\nWhat they finally ended up doing was changing the account password so that when the customer went to log back in they wouldn't be able to and would need to do a password reset by calling Netflix and then they would confirm the email address. I kept getting Netflix emails so that didn't work -  I called again, same again - didn't work. I changed the password several times myself because I could use the forgot password function and get an email to reset it, that didn't work. I don't know how they kept getting the new password without updating an email address and I didn't really care at this point.\n\nFor the last eight to ten years I have had Netflix on everything thing I own. I have signed in on hotel televisions, used it on my phone, my XBOXs; My kid uses it. I only ever signed in under \"Family\" and told him to do the same. The entire history in \"Family\" is us. The other logins, \"Fred\", \"Softee\", and \"Lylla\" accumulated history. I would occasionally look because, curious. Never did a single new show appear in the \"Family\" watch history that wasn't because of me.\n\nWell, I woke up this morning to an email from Netflix telling me that this email address was no longer associated with that account and if I had any questions etc. \n\nThank you Softee! It has been an amazing run and I am not sure why you gave me free Netflix for the last decade but I think you are amazing!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTldr: I asked Netflix to remove my email address from an account that was not mine that I did not pay for, they would not because they needed to have an email associated with an account. It stayed that way for ten years and I used the account for free.",

I think it's derived from a small farming village, but also has a literal meaning that I could see being chosen as a surname too).\n\n\nFunnily enough, it is the g most people hesitate to pronounce when reading my name because they think the syllable it makes sounds rude/insulting.\n\nAnyway, I was worried someone might have had my credit card info or something one day when out of the blue I got a confirmation email about a vehicle rental in Tampa.\n\nGiven that I live in Alberta and visited Florida precisely once, for a conference, a few years ago (and it was Orlando, not Tampa) you can probably understand my confusion and momentary panic.\n\nI finally actually looked at the paperwork that was attached after confirming there wasn't a charge to my credit card and I didn't need to get my bank to cancel it ASAP.

            "About 50 years ago, cable was just getting going. They were giving everyone a \"free trial,\" where they would come in and install the cable in your house, and then start charging $15 a month after three months or so. My mother decided she didn't need the cable at $15 a month, so she called up and canceled it. They stopped charging her, but didn't turn off the cable. When my mother called up and told them about it, someone told her that the only way to turn it off was to remove the equipment, and it cost more to remove the equipment than it was worth. So, we had free cable for years.\n\nIn the blizzard of '78, we had a small roof over the back door collapse and take most of the wires to the house along with it. We got phone and electricity back quickly, but calling the cable company to fix a cable we were getting for free was not in the cards. So, one of my brothers who was smarter than I was climbed the telephone pole, had a look, went to Radio Shack and bought a few parts, and then climbed up and repaired the cable. So we had cable for another I don't know how many years before they were able to digitally block individual houses.",

        "selftext": "When I was 13 or 14, I decided I wanted a PS3. My dad refused to buy me one but my uncle made me an offer I couldn\u2019t refuse. He said that if I worked at his sweets shop for the two months of summer break, he would buy me a PS3 and some games in lieu of payment. For teenage me with no commitments, this seemed fantastic!\n\nMy uncle sold a kind of specialty snack known as a mini-samosa in his shop. They are like samosas, but smaller, about 3.5 to 4cm in size (about 1/2286 of a football field for my American friends). They were sold by weight, in sealed packs of 250gms and 500gms as these were the most common amounts people bought. Making those packages turned out to be my job. You see, sometime between now and when uncle started his business, he realized that 250gms was roughly the weight of 28 mini-samosas and thus 56 were 500gms. So instead of weighing each packet, I was told to just pack by counting individual items, which was easier and saved time.\n\nWe also sold them individually for people who wanted larger, smaller or unusual amounts.\n\nThis was also around the time when our government started airing customer awareness PSAs (\u201c*Jaago Grahak, Jaago\u201d* for my fellow Indians). Basically, just telling customers to beware of fraudulent business-people. This is relevant.\n\nSo, one particularly hot afternoon, it was just me and my uncle at the shop. In India, frequent powercuts were very common during summers and thus there were no fans or AC running. Both tempers and temperatures were running high at the shop that day.\n\nIt was then that the villain of our story, Mr. Karan made his entry. He was a local resident and a regular. He seemed angry from the onset when he barged into the shop. He took a look at the fans and saw that they weren\u2019t running, then angrily picked up a 500gm pack of samosas and asked, \u201cHow many samosas are in this thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s 500gms.\u201d, I said.\n\n\u201cI said how many, NOT how much!\u201d, Mr. Karan literally screamed, \u201cAgain, HOW MANY in this?\u201d\n\n\u201c56\u201d, I replied immediately since, you know, I packed them.\n\n\u201cHow can you be so sure? You didn\u2019t even count! You\u2019re trying to cheat me!\u201d, Mr. Karan was now in full scale Karen mode. \u201cI demand you pack me 500gms of those individual ones and don\u2019t you dare cheat me again!\u201d\n\nI looked over at my uncle, wet with sweat, fanning himself with yesterday\u2019s newspaper. He slowly nodded.\n\nI beamed a huge smile, \u201cSure sir! Whatever you want!\u201d\n\nSo I took a bag, picked up some samosas and started putting them on the balance. I kept counting samosas as I put them in until they were a little over 500gms. Then I removed the last samosa and the weight fell below 500. Now, keeping eye contact with Mr. Karan, I crushed the samosa and started putting its powdery remains in the bag until it was exactly 500gms.\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more! Mr. Karan apparently didn\u2019t seem to mind powdered samosa but instead asked smugly, \u201cSo how many samosas now?\u201d\n\n\u201c48\u201d, I claimed triumphantly!\n\nYou see, sometime in the past, my uncle\u2019s old chef retired and the new chef made samosas with a little bit more filling in them. They looked the same size on the outside and only weighed a couple grams more each and since he made them in bulk and also sold to other shops in the area, the price wasn\u2019t too much of an issue. So my uncle let it slide. But those couple grams added up on mass orders and that is what Mr. Karan found out the hard way.\n\nHe looked sheepishly at the pre-packed samosas and then at his own package and asked if he could buy the former instead.\n\n\u201cNo, my nephew made a package specially for you, at your own request. So that is what you have to buy.\u201d, my uncle finally spoke.\n\nMr. Karan silently took his pack, paid and left.\n\nHe was a lot more respectful during his subsequent visits.\n\nI was reminded of this story yesterday when my PS3 finally died. As evident, English is not my first language; in fact, it\u2019s not even my third. So please excuse any mistakes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Here's a printable [Mini samosa recipe](https://www.yummytummyaarthi.com/wprm_print/129156) for anyone who wants to make them.

This is somewhat amusing, because it reminded me of what we'd call an \"Indian coding style\". I don't know the origin of this phrase, but the point is that it describes a rather obscure algorithm that could be replaced with a more trivial one without any loss of efficiency. In this case the individual candy counting method is both more resource-greedy and more error-prone, because you could easily miscount any of the 28/56 candies which would lead to incorrect result. A more efficient method would be to pour a pile of candies onto scales that would roughly meet the weight target and then manually adjust the amount by adding or removing some candies. After a short while you'd get really fast and precise with pouring just the right amount that rarely needs to be adjusted.",

We just have to submit a claim with our receipts at the end of the busy season.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFood options around my work aren't great so I usually brought my dinner from home.  But sometimes I was too tired to cook after a long day so out of the 8 weeks, I purchased maybe 10 meals.  3 of those meals I spent $13.50, going $0.50 over the limit.  This resulted in a whopping $1.50 overage which my manager said it was no big deal and that I could include on my expense claim.  He signed off on it and everything.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA few days after I submitted my report Head Office emailed me saying they rejected my expense claim and that I could resubmit after I removed the $1.50 overage.  I wrote back saying my manager was fine with the $1.50 overage and even signed off on it, and they responded by telling me that they do not allow overages under any circumstances, that the $1.50 must be removed or they wouldn't approve any of my meal expenses.  They ended their email with the advice that I should \"actually read the company policy next time\".\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nFine, they were right and I was wrong.  So I decided I'd read the policy very thoroughly before redoing my expense claim.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nYes, the policy clearly stated a $13/maximum on purchased meals.  Oh, and what's this?  The policy also allows a $10 per diem for meals you bring from home.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nI very happily removed the $1.50 overage and added an additional $300 for the 30 meals I brought from home.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI should read the company policy more often!\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT:  Thank you for the gold benevolent redditor!  It's my first time.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSome of you are asking if I got paid the $300 and the answer is yes.  Many are suggesting the person was sincerely trying to help me out, but I'm not 100% sure because they were so snippy in their email.  Also, when we were emailed the meal policy at the beginning of busy season there was no mention of the per diem and no one else in my department knew about it.  Either way, I made sure to thank them just in case they were being sincere and I was just too jaded to see it!",

Loved every time I would point it out to her and she would get mad and walk away.  She was not my direct manager but she felt she would always be in everything. I was supervisor to some people under her though at nights so I had to deal with her sometimes.\n\nOne example was personal days off; aka sick days. She said they could only be used for sick and needed doctor note. I pointed out that it says personal days and needs no excuse really to call in. It started because a worker called in because her car broke down and she told her she didn\u2019t care if her car broke down and to ride a skateboard in if she had to or else she would get wrote up because sick day couldn\u2019t be used for that.\n\nSame with insurance. Everyone at our site thought you either could get glasses or contacts but not both. And it didn\u2019t help the eye places would reinforce this because they never fully checked coverage. I knew you could get both and everyone was surprised when I said it and I told them it\u2019s right in documents.\n\nTLDR: always read company policies. You would be surprised the stuff in them. ",

The company was getting pissy with people eating on the clock due to the high volume and needing to always be on the floor, you couldn\u2019t easily sit down to eat. When the company tried to say that no one is allowed to eat on the clock, some person found that rule and started to speak out and HR had to send out a company wide memo telling us that everyone working over 4 hours is permitted a paid 15 minute break and another if 8 hours are worked.

        "selftext": "Background: I work in a fast paced healthcare environment where every minute counts and I have both male and female co-workers on my shift. \n\nWe have lockers with opaque doors where we're allowed to store our things. When I'm in the office area I leave mine unlocked for easy access and I've started keeping a box of tampons in my locker. I've told my female co-workers if they're in a hurry and need a tampon they're welcome to just open my locker (when it's unlocked and I'm in the office) and take one, no problem. \n\nI got called into my boss's office the other day because a male coworker of mine complained that me keeping tampons in my locker was \"disgusting\" and he hated that he could see the box whenever my locker was opened. My boss (a male) told me that some men were really sensitive to \"this type of thing\" and that I should try hiding them in a different type of box so I wouldn't offend my coworkers. I asked what the point was because my coworkers would see someone reaching into a \"crackers/pop tarts, etc\" box and taking out a tampon instead of food anyway. My boss got all huffy and told me that it was for the best and I needed to do it. \n\nWell, fine. \n\nI made a cover for my tampon box that said \"Mother Earth's Bloody Nutrients Bars: with extra gooey, nutritious filling!\" with a photo of a bloody bathtub and placed it on the box. \n\nThat was two days ago, and I saw the male co-worker open my locker (trying to be sneaky) and he paled when he read the box, got all angry, and I received an email from my boss that my cover \"wasn't funny\" and that I need to take it down. \n\n... So I emailed our HR person a copy of the email as well as a summary of what happened and photos of the lockers, the box, and the cover. I also suggested that the male coworker sit somewhere where he didn't have a direct line of sight to my locker if it really offended him so much. She thought it was freaking hilarious and said I \"followed my supervisor's instructions\" and so I was fine. \n\nNothing else has been done yet, and I'm mostly angry that my time was spent on something as stupid as this and not on patient work.\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for the support and the awards!! I've documented everything and am encouraging my coworkers (male and female) to do the same. HR is now in the loop and they have told me they have had multiple people come forward saying similar things that they're doing some investigating. So hopefully things change.\n\nEDIT 2: Here is the link to the box! I spent maybe 3 minutes on it so it does not look good, fair warning. \ud83d\ude02 [The Box of Tampons](https://imgur.com/gallery/sRLXnDT)",

            "This story reminded me of a situation I had at a previous workplace. I was in charge of the equivalent of $1.3 million in electronic modules for military equipment, and I was held accountable if anything happened to it. Monthly I had to report on what I used and what was replaced etc.\n\nMy immediate supervisor tended to help himself and just take what he wanted and he might tell me or might not. Mostly after I got a warning end of the month when stuff was reported after stockcount. They refused to supply me with keys to the cupboards, so I replaced the locks with hardened locks on my own dime (My last hour at that place I spent stripping out my locks and replacing the old locks back).\n\nBecause I couldn't possibly be at work at all times, I needed to leave a way for people to get to the equipment. They would phone me anytime and I'd need to come in. Of course I didn't like this. Didn't get paid extra at all if I did come in. So I had a set of emergency keys inside a form they needed to fill out and left it in my locker fitted with a combination lock.\n\nI would supply my locker combination to the person that phoned me and they could then retrieve the keys. I would then just change the combination the next morning. My supervisor insisted on having my updated combination at all times, but this means that the biggest perpetrator could still just help himself. And he never filled out the paperwork so I know what he took and for what reason. Situation escalated as he picked up on my barely concealed rage and then refused to ever letting me know he took it so I wouldn't confront him anymore. I started giving him old combination codes. He started breaking open my locker to get to the keys. End of the month I would find out what was missing and slip into his office when he's not there to hopefully recover what he took so I could book it in again (with a tag to retest before deployment since I don't know whether he broke it). Healthy work relationship right?\n\nI was highly frustrated and he would just deny he did anything every month when I got called in to explain the discrepancy. My word against his. And his word counted more. He was fucking with my livelihood, and except for having to come in to work any time of the night to unlock the cupboards myself, I didn't have a solution. \n\nUntil one day a female tech asked me hush hush for some \"supplies\" for that time of the month. I just told her to go get some from my locker and gave her the code. He walked past her as she helped herself and went off on her on why she was in my locker, was she the one using the emergency keys and stealing from the company. She was flustered, having grown up rather sheltered and in a patriarchy where men didn't want to know that stuff existed like periods, pads and tampons.\n\nI heard the ruckus and walked closer. Now, side-note, I grew up really liberal. My mum explained to both my younger brothers and me how these things worked when I got to <that> age. She said they will need to buy supplies for their girlfriends, and later their wives, and she needed them to be informed and not grossed out. As such I didn't quite get how a grown man could be scared of a little bit of cotton fluff wrapped around a bit of rope wrapped in a plastic sleeve. I could easily as a teen scream from a bathroom at one of my brothers to get me a tampon, and they wouldn't blink at getting me one from my room.\n\nI gently pushed her out of the way while he still ranted and pulled out the box of tampons. My supervisor trailed off and might have gone a bit green. Maybe it was my imagination. But he did go quiet. I silently took out a tampon, gave it to the co-worker while staring at my boss straight in his eyes the whole time, replaced the box and slammed close the locker. Co-worker just siddled off and I turned around and walked back to my workstation.\n\nThat day the plan was born. The spare emergency keys went into a box of tampons, and no matter the halfhearted complaints my supervisor rustled up about my tampons, I would just mention that if he didn't like me having female supplies in a locker that is suppose to be so I could keep my personal stuff safe, we could go and chat to HR on where he would like my tampons to be. \"At my workstation? Hanging from the ceiling like a little bead curtain?\" I would suggest with a serious expression. He always backed away, he knew the company couldn't afford discrimination rumours.  \n\nFrom that day onwards I didn't have any discrepancies at the end of the month when I counted the stock until the day I left.",

HR backed me up and told him that him reaching into my drawer and into my purse could be considered an attempt to steal from me. They wrote him up. A co-worker who goes into your locker without permission is a security risk to all employees and needs to be disciplined for it. You gave permission for women to use your feminine products in your private space.

My boss, we'll call her Kerry, was a useless, she was one of these people that was always late, left early and took days off at short notice. The only thing of value she did was all the regular reports - sales, revenue etc. We suspected she got away with it because she was having an affair with her boss, we'll call him Stewart.\n\nOur CEO was a fairly decent bloke, he'd look for ways to cut costs and would pay regular bonuses for the best cost saving initiatives. Kerry was very keen to submit ideas and encouraged us all to automate our tasks so she could try and take the credit for the savings.\n\nOn one of her skive days, which coincidently Stewart was \"sick\" as well the CEO was desperate for the sales report my boss does. I said I'd give it a look and see if I could get it done. Normally she'd spend 2-3 days doing it each week but the CEO wanted it that afternoon. A quick inspection of the data showed it would quite easily be automated so I knocked up the necessary script and got it over to the CEO who was super impressed that not only had I got it done in a couple of hours but also that it could be updated whenever he needed it. He asked if I could also look at the revenue, churn and a couple of other reports. Over that afternoon I automated everything my boss did.\n\nBoth Kerry and Stewart were back in the next day but were immediately summoned to the CEO's office before being suspended and sent home. Turns out the CEO knew they were having an affair and all the times they were sick or late or had to leave early was so they could sneak off and have sex. He'd not done anything about it because how important these reports were. Now they were automated he was able to get them suspended and later fired for gross misconduct for all the time they'd taken off. I also got a nice bonus out of it.\n\nTL;DR: My useless boss encouraged us to automated our work so I automated all her tasks and the CEO fired her for.",

            "Two stories.  No one lost their jobs on these but I did some automation that cut costs and allowed people to focus on other tasks.\n\nIn 1986-87 I was a bookkeeper at a non-profit.   Each quarter they had a report for the county that took 3 days to compile.  The first two times we did it I realized a spreadsheet would help a lot.  I had a Radio Shack TRS80 and Microsoft Multiplan.  I was able to cut the time down to 3 hours.\n\nIn 1988-89 I was a programmer in an IT internship as a civilian with the Army.  A team of supply clerks were working weekends locating records in a production database and moving them to an archive database.  They were sick of working weekends and it cost a lot in wages.  I was able to automate and they were thrilled to not work weekends anymore.  I got a cash award for the tens of thousands my automation saved.\n\nHilarious side story.  Databases were Oracle running on Unisys midi-computers.  My first attempt used something called UFI, User Friendly Interface, so you know it is not.  In my ignorance I wrote a UFI script that copied all the records to the archive db and then deleted them from the production db.  I ran tests on a small subset of records and it worked great.  My team lead looked my UFI script over and said, \"Give it a go.\"  You know what happened next.  The copy failed but the delete worked great.  Thank God the DBA liked me and was unperturbed about rolling the records back.  To this day I don't now how that is done.  Anyway, my team lead had me learn some C with embedded Oracle SQL commands to copy a record, make sure it copied, and then delete from the production database if it copied successfully.",

That gave me time to liaise with the closing manager, tour the floor really quickly for any problems I needed to address, and check my e-mail for notes, news, or issues from my boss.\n\nI'd hold a short meeting with my people and go over what we needed to focus on, then give out assignments.  The first time I needed to do schedules, I told them I'd be tied up for about thirty minutes or so doing them because I wasn't used to the ones they had and it would take me a bit longer to do them.\n\nThat got a big laugh from everyone, and I was puzzled.  Even the most complicated front end schedules only took me about an hour or so.  When I asked why, they told me that the old manager took four or five hours to do the schedules.  She'd lock herself in the office most of the night \"working\" on them.\n\nI told my lead I'd hold off doing the schedules until the crew was going and everything was progressing well, so I could show him exactly what was involved.  He had no idea how schedules were done in the system, he wasn't allowed access to it, and the old manager never taught him.\n\nEven with me slowly going through the process step by step, and explaining all the tricks and tips to him, it only took about 20-25 minutes to knock out the schedules.  \n\nMy lead was flabbergasted.  He couldn't believe that the other manager had bullshitted everyone so hard about it for years.  She had them all convinced it was incredibly difficult and time consuming.  I let him know that once I got the hang of their schedule preferences and details, I'd have in knocked out in ten minutes.\n\nThe other manager was doing that in one form or another every night.  When they realized I wasn't like that, and I'd actually be out there doing my job, productivity and morale soared through the roof.  \n\nThey had many ideas and suggestions to improve things and most of them were good, so I implemented them.  The old manager just shot them down out of hand and didn't even consider them.  Not only did we try them, if they worked, I made sure they got credit for them.\n\nThe old O/N manager's habits caught up to her.  She couldn't pull any of her stunts on days.  She didn't last three months before she was fired.  \n\nWhen the O/N crew found out about it, they cheered, literally.  To say she was not well liked, was a massive understatement.  The O/N crew went on to win department of the year.  I was damned proud of them.  \n\n**TL:DR  Old manager on O/N had been goofing off all the time, and not doing her job.  When I took over and had huge increases in productivity and moral, her incompetence was exposed.  She got fired when she tried to do the same during days.**"

        "selftext": "This happened several years ago, and is a multi-year long story - I'll keep it as succinct as possible.\n\nWe installed cameras in front of our home that were looking at our vehicles. Part of the camera angles did overlook parts of two neighbor's properties (one back yard and one side yard).\n\nThe cameras were battery operated and had a function where you could \"gray out\" areas that you didn't want to film. When motion occurred in the grayed out areas, the cameras would not be activated to film.\n\nThe neighbors' entire properties and several bushes on our property were grayed out - we did this when installing them.\n\nOne of the neighbors was a friend - and had no issues with this whatsoever (we showed her the camera angle - and she said she didn't care whether or not we grayed out that area - we still left it grayed out over battery life concerns).\n\nThe other neighbor's name was Karen (not really, but we all know why I chose that name). Karen was on the HOA board and, as you can imagine, we didn't get along with Karen or the HOA Board. We told Karen about the camera and showed her the grayed out areas at the same time that we told our friendly neighbor about it. It was simply an FYI conversation (we are not on friendly terms) - not an \"asking permission\" conversation.\n\nShe told us to take the cameras down immediately or we would regret it.\n\nAbout a week after we hung the camera up, we got a notice from our HOA that we were violating the bylaws. The bylaw in question? A \"nuisance to your neighbors\" bylaw. There wasn't a specific bylaw preventing placement of cameras, so this is all they could find to try to punish us.\n\nWe responded with a letter detailing how we were not violating any bylaws or laws in general - and asked them to cease and desist.\n\nWe all know how these stories go though. They did not cease. And they did not desist.\n\nTheir first response?\n\n\"The HOA has the right to enforce these bylaws. Try to stop us, if you think you can.\" (These types of responses were, unfortunately, quite common from this board.)\n\nWe entered this battle with one goal in mind: to cost them as much money and time as possible. The HOA hired a lawyer specifically to fight us. To my knowledge, this has not happened to any other residents. In the following 4 months we ended up costing the HOA over $4,000 in lawyers fees fighting this battle. For reference, the entire HOA income was \\~$25,000/year.\n\nWhen it came time for our official HOA hearing over the matter, we had successfully postponed it (thanks to an attorney friend) 3 separate times. There were over 100 back and forth emails with the HOA attorney and ourselves. Each one of those emails was a 15 minute expense for the HOA. And I was happy to follow up a follow up question with another follow up question if it meant the HOA attorney was going to keep billing them (Did I say \"follow up\" enough times?).\n\nWe didn't actually want to take this battle to court, so we ended up removing the cameras the day of the hearing (to prevent being fined - even if the fine wouldn't hold up in court). The HOA decided in the hearing that we were guilty (surprise, surprise) of violating the bylaw. They couldn't fine us - as the bylaws don't allow a fine until after a hearing has been held - and the cameras were already removed.\n\nIn the end, the punishment was a sternly written piece of paper on the attorney's letterhead (delivered via certified mail) that stated that we were \"...not allowed to place a camera on our home that had the potential to invade a neighbor's privacy.\" Keep in mind, the letter specifically stated the camera could not be placed \"on our home.\"\n\nWe left the cameras off of the home for about 4 months -  until the annual HOA meeting. You should have seen the look on the HOA Board's faces when I asked them to explain the $4,000 line item for attorney's fees that simply stated \"Title searches - Attorney fees.\"\n\nThe Board actually tried to hide the fact that they spent $4k trying to fight us over a couple of cameras by putting the fees in as \"Title searches.\"\n\nNeedless to say, that meeting did not go well for them. About half of them lost their positions on the Board. The other half (including Karen, unfortunately) remained on the Board.\n\nAbout a week after the annual meeting, we installed new cameras - facing the same direction as the prior cameras - only this time, we installed a post in the ground and mounted the cameras to that post. The admonishment we received after the hearing specifically stated that we were not allowed to install cameras \"on our home\" - and said nothing about putting them on a post.\n\nThey did send a letter to try to tell us to remove the cameras, but a sternly worded response indicating that we were prepared to fight them actually worked this time around. I guess they didn't want to spend another $4k fighting us. We didn't receive any follow up responses. And the cameras on the post are still installed to this day (over 2 years and running strong).",

I\u2019ve not asked the neighbors to re-point them yet and certainly wouldn\u2019t go through the HOA, but it still feels like we\u2019re being watched 24/7.

It seems like someone should have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their backyard. As for a side yard I guess it would depend on whether or not there is a fence. \n\nThe grayed out feature probably isn't very comforting to other people. They'd have to trust that you did that, and that you don't change that. It would be unsettling.\n\nI think the neighbor whose privacy was being violated by OP should have sued OP, and I also think the HOA board should have used HOA funds to assist them. \n\nI don't know the laws in OP's city, so maybe that was not an option.",

They finally showed up about 3-4 months later with a fence installation company and started digging holes in my yard. They would put up the fence and bill us for it.\nNow why this is amusing is our home was not part of the HOA and they literally had ZERO say over what we could do. Once the holes were dug, we called police and had them all arrested for vandalism, terroristic threats, etc. Every member of the HOA and the fence installation crew now have criminal records. 3 of the HOA members spent a year plus in jail for conspiracy to defraud and extort or something like that. We used the holes and installed a chainlink fence and when we sold, made sure the buyers were well aware that our property was NOT part of the HOA.",

            "I\u2019m about to fight my hoa over them saying that we need to repaint our house by a specific date. I asked under what provision this can be enforced, and they pointed to a section that says the house must be \u201cattractive\u201d. The problem is that it\u2019s a subjective term with no definition within the rules , and therefore, especially understood Colorado law, is considered ambiguous and unenforceable. We have had plans to paint our house for over a year, but they require us to get approval even to paint it the same color. Twice last year I had painters give a quote and both of them had an immediate opening that would have saved us thousands of dollars. But it takes 45 days to get approval, so missed the opportunity to get painted and a good deal. Our house is starting to fade just a bit on the south side but still very much intact and I certainly find it \u201cattractive\u201d. I\u2019m also going as far as to argue that a newly approved paint scheme that one of our neighbors chose is incredibly unattractive, yet board approved, just to prove how subjective the term is. Their house is fucking ugly puke yellow. \n\nThis isn\u2019t my first hoa fight. I also cost another hoa tens of thousands of dollars after I sued them for failing to fix a flooding condition from the common area. One of the board members started to harass me after I filed, so I got police involved and threatened to file a restraining order. I even went to an hoa meeting and pointed out a rule violation on every board member\u2019s home, and demanded the president step down for her failure to prevent the lawsuit. They settled. A couple years later I had moved out but had a \u201croommate\u201d because they didn\u2019t allow me to lease the property due to rental percentages. However, the language in the laws was ambiguous, and therefore unenforceable. I got an attorney involved this time and they refused to step down saying they\u2019d fine me $500/mo, to which I responded that I\u2019d file a harassment suit against them. They never did shit and I sold the place about 9 months later to my \u201croommate\u201d. \n\nFuck HOAs",

I reply to everyone who provides suggestions even if we don't take up the topic (some of them are pretty crazy lol) I give the community an update after each meeting, and make myself available to anyone who has a concern or suggestion for the neighborhood. I didn't join the Board for an ego boost. I joined to move the community in a positive direction and help develop the culture in a way that gives everybody the opportunity for input and ownership of our neighborhood. I tell neighbors I am all ears to hear their concerns but they should also have some solutions in mind, because if not, they're just bitching and I don't have time for that.

They told me to ask any questions through their attorney. Each time I asked a question the attorney would contact each of the siblings to ensure they agreed on the response and then contact me. So each question resulted in four actions by the lawyer - at a minimum billing of 15 minutes each.  This went on for a couple of weeks until the day of the closing - when the lawyer presented them with a bill for nearly $3,000. The siblings immediately insisted I should pay it. The lawyer and the woman doing the title work both pointed out that I had not hired the lawyer and there was nothing in the agreement that said I had to pay their legal cost.

I was hired as a cashier. \n\nThe person that did the end of day butcher shop clean-up/sanitizing  quit. So instead of hiring someone for clean up,  the owners decided that the cashiers could just do it between customers.  \n\nThe owner sat at thier office  ( watching tv and fucking around) and when a customer came in ( door bell would ring) , they would buzz the phone in the butcher area for the cashier to come check them out. \nWhen I came in for my shift at 6pm and was told about the new set up, I told them \nNO. I was not hired to clean up the butcher area, I was hired to run the register and stock shelves. \n\nThe owner then said I would clean the butcher shop or I could consider myself fired and they walked away. I said Fine, I grabbed my things and left.\n\nApparently, the owner thought  I had gave in and was in doing the cleaning.  So they  buzzed the butcher area  when customers came in for about 2 hours before someone told them no one was coming to check them out. \nThe stores liquior area, cigarettes and scratchers got emptied out.  \n\nIt was 7:30 and I got a screaming phone call from the owner about how he was calling the police and I was going to get arrested. Yeah, right. \n\nOwner did call the police,  The owner  stated he wanted me arrested as an accomplice to the thefts, because I had left. Cops asked me to come to the store, which I did, and I explained that the owner had fired me, so I went home and the CCTV would prove that fact. The tape was reviewed, and plain as day, the owner said I was fired. \n\nI estimate they lost about $30.000.00.",

(if you're in the US)\n\nThis will depend on your state, but most states you can collected unemployment if you were fired without cause.\n\nWith cause: you broke the law in relation to the business, you blatantly broke company policy, you were bad at your job despite them trying to train you multiple ways, etc. etc. etc. Basically, what most people refer to as \"being fired.\"\n\nWithout cause: the company is losing business, the company is cutting your department, they're downsizing, etc. These are typically things people refer to as \"being let go.\" This does also include being fired for no reason whatsoever (yes, you can legally be fired for any reason, other than protected classes [which makes those businesses even dumber for firing someone for a protected reason]). If you were fired for no reason, then you generally can collect unemployment. \n\nThe owner will almost certainly fight it, and you can just tell the unemployment office that you were fired for not doing additional duties that you were not actually hired for, and that there is a police report with video to prove it. \n\nI'd imagine it's a pretty open and shut case, but worse case scenario is you lose and.... get nothing, but the owner still has to fight it. \n\nThere is a risk the owner gets even more pissed at you and harasses you, but it really does sound like you got an easy case here.",
