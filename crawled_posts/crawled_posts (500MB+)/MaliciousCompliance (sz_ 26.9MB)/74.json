        "selftext": "I used to work as a manager at a small business. I was the only employee on site during the day, so I was expected to answer the phone, check in deliveries, help walk-in customers, etc. any time they came in. Because I constantly needed to be available, I didn\u2019t have a real lunch break, I would just eat my lunch at my desk when I had time. \n\n\nOne afternoon one my boss called me on the office phone and very casually asked  \u201cHey, what\u2019s going on? What are you working on?\u201d I told him the project I was in the middle of, and he said \u201cReally? Because I\u2019ve been watching the cameras and you\u2019ve been messing around on your cell phone for the last five minutes!\u201d I explained to him that my fianc\u00e9 had texted because there was an emergency that had come up and I was trying to help him handle it, giving him the account information, logins and passwords, etc. since I was working and couldn\u2019t handle it. His response was \u201cI don\u2019t care! I don\u2019t ever want to catch you on your phone again!\u201d I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t get any breaks or anything during the day, so I didn\u2019t have any of my own time to handle things that may come up, but he didn\u2019t care. \n\n\nSo, knowing full well that the owners, the other managers, and staff members constantly texted me throughout the day whenever they needed something, I complied. \n\n\nThe next day I came in and I left my phone in my purse. I had a smart watch, so I could see when I got a text, but I didn\u2019t answer, because I wasn\u2019t allowed to be on my phone. After two days of me ignoring their requests during the day and only answering their texts after leaving (saying \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t see your text because I\u2019m not allowed to be on my phone at work. I\u2019ve already left for the day.\u201d), my boss came in and told me we needed to have a discussion. \n\nHe called me out on my malicious compliance, but also acknowledged that I was essentially locked in the office for 8 hours a day. So, going forward I could take a half hour lunch break where I didn\u2019t have to do anything else, and I was allowed to use my phone during the day, as long as I didn\u2019t abuse the privilege.\n\n\nEdit: for everyone commenting that it was illegal for them not to give me a lunch break, that\u2019s not the case in my state (breaks are not federally mandated in the US).",

            "I used to work as a Quality Control Supervisor for a fueling company at a major airport in the US. Standard policy for being on the AOA (Aircraft Operating Area, i.e. \"The Ramp\") is absolutely no cell phone use. This is for safety as that environment is full of hazards and even a momentary distraction can be disastrous. Well, as I supervised the entire operation I couldn't simultaneously monitor the 6 different radio channels we had. As such, my work phone was routinely my communication device.\n\nI was standing near the terminal building in an area far removed from aircraft, but still part of the AOA and the Ramp Patrol (airport compliance officers essentially) saw me, didn't care for my reasons and issued me a citation. Get too many of these and your ID is revoked, effectively getting yourself fired. Ok, no phone on the ramp, gotcha covered boss!\n\nPretty soon airline reps couldn't reach me and as such aircraft delays went up. The Fire Inspector couldn't reach me, so equipment was tagged out of service for minor things easily fixed. The Airport Duty Manager/ADM (Person in charge of the operations of the airport) couldn't reach me so all hell broke loose. I told everyone when asked that I was merely complying with the rules as I didn't want any more points on ID.\n\nAbout three weeks into it the ADM calls me and asks if I was available that afternoon. I go up to his office and he explains that they are amending the rules so as to allow the use of cellphones in designated areas away from aircraft as well as when in a stationary vehicle. Also, my citation would be wiped. Now, would I please start carrying my phone?\n\nI laughed for a while at that small victory.",
            "Your manager got on your ass for spending 5 minutes on your phone? I hope they pay great or you're looking for better.",
            "I love it. They can be so up their ~~asses~~ made-up rules that they don\u2019t notice how much they hurt employee productivity and, ultimately, business. \n\nAt my old job, they made up a greeting for the client care team to use, as well as a script for phone conversations to \u201crepresent the business professionally\u201d. They said they will be listening in to phone conversations to ensure compliance. Client care team argued that most of our long-term customers are used to having a small talk before jumping to business, they knew everyone there and scripts would just be off-putting. Nope, greeting, scripts, go. Four long-term contract customers ended up sending emails up the chain saying they enjoyed doing business with us because of established relationships with their customer representatives and didn\u2019t appreciate the robotic phone conversations. The scripts ended up canceled. Good riddance.",
            "You should also made absolutely sure you took all earned breaks and a full lunch, and of course not being on the clock refuse to answer any calls.",
            "I had a similar problem at a place of work over 5 years ago.  I was written up for cell phone use during working hours.  During the write up, I showed the supervisor and the HR rep that the text I was responding to was in fact work related, but the ass-hats wouldn't hear it.  So, I informed them that I would no longer be available by cell to the company on or off the clock.  This proved troublesome as I am the 'go to guy' for about 3 of the company's premier products.  Over the next few weeks the company lost some existing clients and failed to get a few new clients (if my buddy in Sales is to be believed), because the Subject Matter Expert for those things wasn't available in a timely fashion.\n\nWhen the supervisor and HR came back to me 'failure to answer my phone', I referred them back to my write up.  Later in the conversation they agreed that they were wrong about that.  Over the next few weeks I was able to leverage my recently discovered value into a promotion in title and pay.  I ended up leaving the company about a year later, as stupid spot policies like this made other companies more attractive all the time.",
            "Another dumb manager.  I have had this kind of micromanager who seems to know every second of your work day and what you were doing, but they often seem to have no idea what the output of your shift needs to be.  They end up obsessing over things like use of cell phones rather than watching work quality.\n\nI hate that kind of manager because most of the time they are covering up their own inability to do the job.",
            "UK, Many years ago I was working as a security officer, if you want to bring a tv or radio on site you needed permission of site supervisor, supervisor was on annual leave I wanted to bring a scanner to work, knowing the rules  sought permission from the area manager, all's okay.\n\nSite supervisor returns from annual leave, finds out I got permission from above him he went on a rant about going via him first, he then banned me from having the scanner, he is an ex cop he wrongly believed scanners were illegal, so he banned me from using radios on site.....\n\nThis lead to a row almost lead to punches, he told me that I was banned from using any radios or radio equipment on site, a key piece of equipment for security is the two way radio, okay so I cant use this (I slammed the radio down), if you want to contact me contact me via the page.. oh wait, it's a radio pager (I slammed that down), I rang head office and demanded to be taken off of site, I was a couple of hours later, during that time I never replied to him over the radio,",
            "I worked for a company that does a variety of classified work, and in particular I provided IT support for about four different classified labs. Since these were classified spaces, we weren't allowed any \"wireless devices\" such as phones or two-way pagers, but one-way (receive only) pagers were fine.\n\nThe problem was that if I was spending time working on something in one lab, nobody could call me if there was an emergency in one of the other labs, since my cell phone would be sitting in a locker outside the lab I was in. They'd have to go from one of my labs to the next, looking for me. So I asked my boss, hey, why don't we get a one-way pager for me, and then I can know when another lab needs me?\n\nSure, my boss said. Just get one of the projects you support to pay for it. You can probably guess that none of the individual projects were willing to pay the costs of a pager that all four of the labs could use to contact me; they figured this should be IT overhead and shouldn't come out of their budget. Meanwhile the IT position was, we have provided you a cell phone for customers to contact you, and therefore we aren't paying for another device.\n\nI never did get a pager, and until the time I left that job people always had to comb the building looking for me if there were ever anything urgent in a lab I wasn't in.",
            "Ha! This is perfect. We also \"aren't allowed\" to use our phones while working (as i am right now) but our bosses will legit text us and call us instead of contacting us using the radios. I even had one manager get pissy with me because i wouldn't add him on fbk so that he could give me work orders via messenger. Once i head out the door to work i completely turn off and stow my phone. It annoys them all, but i did not make the (federally enforced) rules.",

            "I got chewed out for leaving a charger in the break room overnight. That\u2019s it. I had my phone in the back charging because I didn\u2019t have a car at the time, if I didn\u2019t have a phone I couldn\u2019t get ahold of my ride.\n\nThe DM called me the next day and screamed at me then wrote me up.

            "My ex's employer makes all employees lock their phones in a locker when they arrive at the office. They can pick them up when they leave for lunch (and put them back coming back from lunch) and when they leave at the end of the day. That is some fucking bullshit, let me tell you. The dog was sick one morning and I had to rush her to the vet, it was a huge scare (in the end she was fine, thank the Elder Gods) and my ex didn't even know it happened until 9pm. It happened to be a day when she didn't take a lunch break and did some overtime. :/",
            "My first job (at a BBQ restaurant) when I was 15, we also weren't allowed breaks and actually weren't even allowed to keep our phones on us on the clock. NO EXCEPTIONS. I worked 8-12 hour shifts, no breaks unless it was for a smoke. I had a family emergency at home one day and kept my phone on me that day, making frequent trips to the bathroom to respond to my text messages. \n\nMy manager took notice of all my trips to the restroom, and followed me in without me noticing. She peered through the crack and watched me stand in the stall and check my phone, respond to a text, and when I came out, she was standing there with her hand out to take my phone from me and wrote me up. I cried the rest of the day. \n\nI wish someone would try to do something like that to me now",

I became impossible to track me down on the shop floor. I also had no idea what the time was so I missed my lunch slot constantly. One day no one could find me. When they checked the cameras it was hilarious. The supervisor just kept missing me. There were two staircases and a lift that I could take around the store. I was zooming around the store so fast that they just missed me every time. It was hilarious and eventually the store bought walkie talkies for us, then phones were allowed back. I also got in trouble for having my phone in my pocket after a staff member in test needed to borrow my sim card. Not a big deal, but I had no time to run up four flights of stairs back to the staff room with it. I just taped the sim to the back and carried on working. Of cause someone saw it through my jeans, snitched and it became a while ordeal. Luckily it ended when they realised one, the phone was useless without a sim, two, I only had it on me because someone requested my sim and three, it had been ultra busy and me leaving would have gotten me in trouble as well. It was a no win situation. I asked what I should have done. They told me I should have taken the phone back upstairs. I asked them would I have gotten in trouble for that, they said yes.

            "I have sort of a similar experience. \n\nWhen I was in my mid-twenties I was a lead dispatcher at a national HVAC company. My shift was always 4pm-1am. Most days there would be a total of 3-4 of us closing the building together. On Sundays though I worked alone so I closed the building & left alone. The company was located in an industrial area in Florida. Industrial areas are typically not a sade place to be in the middle of the night alone as a woman. \n\nOne time my team, me, our supervisor had a meeting with the owner of the company. He told us we couldn't have our cell phones in the building at all (we didn't have lockers to store our belongings in) & that we needed to leave our cell phones in our vehicle. I brought up how I leave my shift in the middle of the night & on Sundays I was alone for it, I needed my cell phone for emergency purposes if anything were to happen to me when I left the building at 1am. \n\nHis response was - carry a concealed gun \ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nSame company installed cameras in our building & there was one in the dispatch room I worked. The president, VP, & the supervisors all had access to the live stream of these indoor surveillance cameras & would watch the cameras when they were at home. \n\nOne Sunday evening I was working alone as usual. Weekend dress code was super casual since my small team was the only employees in the building on the weekends. I was wearing pretty short yoga shorts & a t-shirt. I got up from my desk to walk across the room & adjust the thermostat, then walk back to my desk. \n\nI could hear the surveillance camera turning to follow me from my desk to the thermostat back to my desk.

        "selftext": "Our junior high dress code was a pain. Most teachers didn\u2019t care so long as kids weren\u2019t distracting. The principal of the junior high, however, insisted on enforcing every single rule.\n\nA friend of mine wore a long sleeve shirt under a tank top. The principal insisted she couldn\u2019t wear the tank top because tank tops were against the dress code. But she couldn\u2019t take off the tank top because her shirt was slightly see through, another violation. Instead of allowing her to simply wear the tank over her long sleeve shirt, she sent her home.\n\nI decided this wouldn\u2019t stand.\n\nI studied every rule in the dress code to prove how stupid it was. I started off small and worked my way up.\n\nNo open toed sandals. - This one was easy. I wore open toed high heels. Nothing in the rules against high heels, and the open toed rule only applied to sandals the way it was written.\n\nShirts must be tucked in to pants. Belts must be worn through belt loops. - Knocked out two here by wearing a skirt. Skirts, or at least the one I wore, had no belt loops and wasn\u2019t considered pants so I was not required to tuck in anything or wear a stupid belt.\n\nBackpacks must be plain colored with no pins/excessive accessories. - I picked up a briefcase from a resale shop and slapped it with every sticker I could find. Any random logo or inspirational sticker I had laying around got slapped on it. Technically, a briefcase isn\u2019t a backpack.\n\nNo costumes allowed. (I verified this, my school considered a costume to be anything only worn for a certain period of time or for a certain reason. If you wore it all day, it was an outfit, not a costume.) - I abused this one so badly. Once a week I dressed up as a lawyer, a clown, a hippie, a Shakespearean actor, a superhero, a camera man, etc. complete of course with as many accessories as I could handle. So long as I never took them off (this made gym class interesting), they weren\u2019t considered part of a costume. I ended up letting kids pick out what I would dress as each week.\n\nNo crazy hairstyles. - Kept my hair natural colors, and kept the styles as something that was at least popular at one point. Beehive took forever but was the most satisfying. Bonus points if I could find pictures of adults who were still wearing their hair like that currently.\n\nShirts are not allowed to have logos or print, only patterns and consistent designs. - Consistent designs was my loophole here. No print, fine, but consistent print made specifically to look like a design? At this point, the principal was going mad and she didn\u2019t let this one slide. She insisted I change, which I expected.\n\nGym shorts must teach students knees or as long as their fingertips. - Guess who\u2019s finger tips reach about three below her butt? Me! I went from wearing a shirt that said bite me all over it, to an outfit that included short shorts. But my shorts were still longer than my fingers. I even offered to change back into my other clothes.\n\nAt this point in the year, we were almost done with school. Other kids were following my lead, and we were driving the principal mad. I decided to kick it up a bit further. I attacked what should have been the most basic rules.\n\nNo sunglasses. - Rose colored glasses aren\u2019t considered sunglasses because you can easily see through them. Still, the principal jerked them off my face and insisted I wouldn\u2019t get them back until the end of the day.\n\nNo tank tops. - I wore a dress with spaghetti straps. It wasn\u2019t a shirt, so I wasn\u2019t breaking a rule.\n\nBelts must be plain with no dangerous materials. - Plain it must be, so plain I went. I wore a shoe string as a belt. I wore a braided yarn string as a belt. I even wore a spandex band sewn to my pants as a belt.\n\nNo crocs. - Crocs are not the only rubber shoe my friends. I found every off brand croc I could get a hold of.\n\nFinally, at the end of the year, I wore one of my most outrageous outfits. I wore a see-through dress (think bathing suit cover up) over leggings and a shirt that barely classified as a t shirt. I wore shoes with a four inch cork heel. I had on fake glasses (no lenses) and a four inch wide headband. I wore bangles up to my elbows and anklets on each foot. I had a box to carry my books in that was decorated with blinking battery powered fairy lights. I walked right up to the principal and gave her a smile.\n\nKids paused to see what would happen. I waited to see what she would say. We\u2019d had this conversation all year. She would point out the rule I \u2018broke\u2019 and I would prove how I didn\u2019t. She sighed.\n\nPrincipal- Fine,  but if even one teacher says you\u2019re distracting to the class, you change clothes.\n\nWe shook on it. Only thing I had to ditch was most of the bangles. They kept clanging while I wrote. \n\nIn the end, I ended up getting the dress code rewritten and amended and the principal implemented a new procedure where dress code violations were not sent home, they were noted and students had to wear a piece of duct tape indicating the specific violation. (If you forgot a belt, you put a piece of tape on a belt loop.) Kids only started to get in trouble after three dress code violations in the same week. Since she lightened up on the dress code and how harshly it was punished, she stopped having trouble with kids breaking it all the time. It worked out for everyone.\n\n\n\nEdit because everyone keeps asking for photos. I am going to look, but this was several years ago (I\u2019m done with college now) and besides the fact we didn\u2019t take a lot of photos because this wasn\u2019t exactly an odd thing for me to do, we\u2019ve also had several hurricanes and floods that ruined most of my childhood \u2018evidence\u2019.

            "I\u2019ve been an educator for 15 years and among the most important things I\u2019ve learned is that the more nitpicky you are about rules that are not about immediate physical, mental, or emotional safety, the more time you\u2019re gonna spend trying to stop people from bending or subverting them.\n\nI teach English, right? So in my first year I would assign a reading. To check whether it was completed, I\u2019d do a quiz. Easy work around: glance through cliffs notes on your way to class for the details, you\u2019ll likely at least scrape with a pass. So I began assigning annotations and would do spot checks. Students would underline random words and sentences. Ok. Make it a requirement to highlight different things: a symbol had to be highlighted in pink for example. Well, page numbers are symbols aren\u2019t they?\n\nAfter about six months of this nonsense, I was spending half of my class periods checking homework for a set of rules that did nothing to get students to read. When I stopped doing homework checks and started making class discussion actually interesting and, you know, meaningful to prep for by completing a reading assignment, wouldn\u2019t you know it? More kids were doing the reading. \n\nThe lesson I learned? A real education is not about control. It\u2019s about releasing control. Making up pointless rules that don\u2019t actually get kids to learn anything is a waste of their time and yours.\n\nSo I say this as a teacher: I\u2019m proud of you.\n\nEdit: wording",

I am a bigger girl and in my 4 years there I wore one shirt that had a sliver of shoulder showing (it had like a window on my shoulder but it was where my shoulder met my arm) two times, and got in trouble both times. I was sent to the counseling office both times and forced to wear an over sized shirt for the rest of the day, then had to go home and wash it and bring it back. The last time it happened I ended up arguing with the lady about it because this other girl walked in to get a folder for her teacher, and her entire back was exposed, only thing covering her back was her bra strap.

            "My senior year of high school I was a part of a program called work exit, basically I only had 4 classes a day then left to go to work. I worked in a warehouse every day so would always just wear whatever was comfortable, which usually meant sweats. One day I was headed to the bathroom when the assistant principal called out to me and began reading my the riot act because of the small hole near my knee in my sweat pants. Once she seemed like she was done reading her monologue I very calmly said \u201cI will mend these after work today\u201d and tried to walk away into the bathroom. \n\nNope wasn\u2019t good enough for her, she tried to grab my arm and march me down to the principal\u2019s office. I pulled my arm back from her and said \u201cI\u2019ll go with u, just don\u2019t touch me.\u201d So off we went to the principal\u2019s office. When we got there she went into her tirade about how I was breaking dress code, began back talking when she told me and oh how disrespectful I had been. Once she was done the principal looked at me and I just said \u201cI was trying to go to the bathroom when she yelled at me for the hole in my pants. I told her I would mend them when I got home from work today. Also she put her hands on me, and I\u2019d like to file a complaint.\u201d The principal looked so sad and exasperated I honestly felt bad for him. He asked me to wait outside which I did, then about 30 minutes later I came back in as the assistant principal was leaving, she looked like she had just gotten out of a 10 minute time out. That\u2019s when I was given \u201cthe talk\u201d about not disrespecting teachers and following dress code. I looked at my phone and announced that I had to leave or else I was gonna miss work. On my way out I looked back at the principal and said \u201cso what about all the kids who r too poor to buy new clothes every time one of theirs gets a hole too big to mend?\u201d Then immediately shut the door behind me and left. Next year almost no one got dress coded for small holes/tears/rips.\n\nSo yeah dress codes r dumb",

            "My high school had a dress code (removed my senior year). The big thing was no hoodies on. Freshman year I caused a big problem about it because duck you it's cold in Michigan. Amount of times I was pulled out of class is insane. I ended up silently creating a movement with every student where we would slowly break dress code over the course of 2 weeks. The cycle of just kept continuing. Administration cracks down on dress code, over 2 weeks we slowly break it until we wear what we want (nothing crazy. Instead of polos and no jeans, ended up at black jeans and t-shirts/long sleeve shirts/ long sleeve shirts with buttons. All solid neutral colors because we were okay with it), after 2 months admins crack down again, rinse and repeat. I was the one who pushed it slightly too far by wearing beanies and calling them caps and not hats (hats were banned in the dress code). I wore button up shirts with stripes and said, \"do you want to argue with my family of 6 of who can use the washer and dryer in the middle of the week? Because I know for a damn sure me washing another shirt instead of wearing a dark Navy blue shirt with gray stripes isn't as important as my parents washing their work outfits\" and that shut them up real quick. Dress codes are worthless to be honest. Senior year I talked to the principal on the first day of school, handed him a paper that the main office prints with the dress code on it, and told him to rip it up the same cycle would continue forever. Senior year (my brothers first year in high school) had no dress code. Everyone was happy.",
            "The best school dress code is:\n- Breasts, sex organs, and butts must be covered at all times.\n- No tube tops without another top over them, because they can and will slip.\n- No profanity, hate speech, or explicit violence/sex written/depicted on clothing\n- Garments must not be visibly dirty.\n\nThat\u2019s IT.  It was my HS dress code, and it keeps distractions to a minimum without being draconian or punishing kids for being poor or fat.\n\nAny adult who is \u201cdistracted\u201d by spaghetti straps on an underage teen is a disgusting pervert. Any kid who\u2019s \u201cdistracted\u201d by piercings, revealing clothes, etc., needs to learn to deal with it, and they won\u2019t if they\u2019re forbidden from seeing it at school.",

We left as quickly as his face reddened and blood pressure rose, took our trench coats off at the front door for the start of the school day, and didn't hear a word to the contrary.\n\nWhile I no longer dress in all black or wear a trench coat, it's still all about the small victories and getting in a good \"fuck you and your stupid rules\" when and where you can.",

I said that my bf has worn it 100 times and was never told to cover it up, but he was insistent that it was inappropriate. So I put bandages on the arms and legs, effectively covering the offensive parts that he was complaining were inappropriate on me, and he was so exasperated with me, but the vice principal agreed that I did as asked, so they didn\u2019t make me change.  My boyfriend wasn\u2019t allowed to wear the shirt again though, which sucked for him because it was his favorite shirt, lol.",

            "First of all -AMAZING. Second of all - I LOVE THIS APPROACH!! I was sent home many a times from teachers/principals for violating dress code. And what sucked is that MY learning was impacted. One day I wore a v-neck shirt, you'd get at Wet Seal at the time, and a zip-up jacket over it. My math teacher told me to zip up my jacket because my shirt was too low-cut. But 2 other girls in the class had the same shirt (different colors) and they weren't reprimanded. Then later in the day the same teacher saw me in the hallway with my jacket unzipped and took me to the principals office, where they called my dad to pick me up. \n\nMy favorite was when my MALE vice principal made this rule that if you're wearing short shorts you have to bend down in front of him and if he \"can see anything hanging out\" you'd be sent home...OH BOY did that not go over well with the parents!! We were in 7th-8th grade.",

They didn't really try after that.",

            "I was an exchange student in Japan. If Japanese teens could have their way almost all of them would have dyed their hair back then, usually brown or blonde. It was stupid popular, and of course most schools banned it. We had monthly suprise inspections where everyone would gather in the gym and skirts measured, hair checked etc. It was funny how sneaky the kids were, the teachers had a card to compare against their hair to make sure they hadn't made their hair slightly less black then normal, they check your hair underneath to make sure there wasn't a dyed patch etc. By the time I got to the front of the line they had already found five students who had sneaking hair dying done. I noticed the teacher stop and look at me, look at his rule book, call over another teacher. They had a frantic debate. At that point the naughty kids caught on and started telling. You see the guidelines were badly written. It was stated that students must have black hair, and not students should have their natural hair colour. They rewrote the rules on the spot, and the naughty kids were later dragged to a group forced hair dying. Some might have later been executed, I dunno school didn't muck about.",

            "In sixth form I was elected as deputy head boy and I put up such a fuss when they tried to introduce uniform that it was delayed until I had finished at the school. For example whilst we were running for head boy and head girl we had an interview with the new head of sixth form and the chair of governors for the school. The interview was mostly to see that we were capable of talking confidently and such, one of the questions was what would you think of a new uniform, I started to give the answer they wanted to hear, then realised that having no uniform was more important to me than being head boy, so I said \u201cactually, sorry, scratch that I think that having a uniform would be a bad thing for the sixth form because...\u201d I expressed my victory by wearing shorts year round.

            "My school was fairly chill about dress code for the most part. We had one, but unless someone was blatently breaking it most teachers just let it go. That being said, I wouldn't be posting if I didn't have a story.\n\n\nIn 10th grade, towards the end of the year, it was starting to get hot. So I wore this tank top to school. I double checked before leaving home that it fit the dress code, because I didn't want to cause a ruccus. It went nearly up to my neck, so no issue with excessive cleavage. The straps that went over my shoulders were 4 fingers wide, which was the minimum allowed width at my school. So I headed out, happy with my choice to follow the rules and stay cool. \n\n\nI was in the hallway getting books for my next class when the vice principle came up behind me, tapped me on the shoulder, and said \"Now honey, I think maybe next time we shouldn't wear this shirt to school, don't you? I can see your shoulder blades and your bra straps.\"\n\n\nThe straps of the shirt came together in the back and went down the center of my back (still a good 5/6 fingers thick mind you). The straps she was referring to were my tank top straps, because I always wear tank tops under whatever top I'm wearing. I informed her of such.\n\n\nHer response: \"Well, I know that. But others might not.\"\n\n\nAfter that, we went our separate ways. So no big drama. But I was both mortified and offended. I'd done what I could, followed the rules, and still was called out publicly in front of all the passing kids.\n\n\nBonus story:\n\n\nThe only other time I saw dress code enforced was when I was in the 5th grade. There was this kid that I disposed, because he constantly picked on me and acted like he was better than everyone else.\n\n\nOne day, he wore a shirt to school with two hands held out across his chest. Beneath them were the words \"those look heavy, can I carry them for you?\" He was told to go to the bathroom and turn it insideout (which he was very not OK with). Sometimes, the rules exist for a reason.",
            "A girl in my daughter\u2019s 7th grade class was made to remove the dark footless opaque tights she had on under a dress because they were considered \u201ctights\u201d and tights weren\u2019t allowed. \n\n\nThat was the same year that we figured out bleached/highlighted hair was allowed but \u201cunnatural colors\u201d werent. My daughter dyed her hair green(the approximate color of bleached hair reacting with pool water) and Raggedy Ann Orange. That was an interesting conversation at the school.",
            "My mom is a lawyer and she got called to come to my sister's school to meet with the principal in the middle of both a meeting and her busiest day. My sister was wearing shorts that went past her fingertips (she had very long arms, so decent length shorts). However, this was Utah and the principal was very prudish. When my sister sat down the pants rode up some (as shorts naturally do) and the principal decreed that they didn't pass the fingertip test. By the time my mom arrived, my sister was sobbing in the office. \n\nMy mom went full protective mom. She was not a screeching Karen. She was the kind of person who put on a \"Lawyer\" voice that stayed level and calm but left the receiver quaking in their boots. \n\nShe started by asking the principal why her daughter was in trouble when the cheerleaders were all wearing short skirts that barely even covered their butt. The principal tried to tell her that didn't count because it was a school team uniform and thus not subject to the dress code. (The cheerleaders knew this and wore them every day to get around the dress code). My mom ripped in to him, telling him that she was a busy person with ACTUALLY important things to deal with, and he had better not DARE  to mess with her daughter or interrupt her at work again unless it was ACTUALLY important. Further, if he tried to give her a dress code violation for perfectly acceptable clothing ever again while the cheerleaders were still going around in their short skirts, he would have a discrimination lawsuit on his hands. \n\nFor clarity, the discrimination lawsuit was a reference to the tendency in Utah for non-mormons to be treated differently.\n\nEdit: They never told my mom why she had to leave work and come to the school. They just told her it was an emergency and she or my dad HAD to come NOW.",

            "In my senior year of high school we seniors decided to revise the spirit week from the boring class color day and sports day to other more fun stuff like meme day and gender bender day. The school was ok with everything except the gender bender day which was interesting because IMO it was better than someone wearing a high vis vest and carrying massive traffic cones or someone who did the mannequin head in their hoodie and couldn\u2019t see all day.\n\nI didn\u2019t participate in the gender bender day because I had a presentation I had to dress up for but they were calling boys down to the office for wearing skinny jeans, a sweater, and Ugg\u2019s. They could have worn the same outfit any other day of the year and it would have been fine. It was annoying but funny. \n\nA quick story from that day was that I was sitting in band and one of my friends was in the exact outfit I just described. As soon as he was called down to the office he quickly got up went to the band locker room and switched shoes and took the pants off to gym shorts under and took the sweater off. So now he just looked like one of the kids that wore sports clothing all the time. He came back 5 mins later and said the office was confused why he was there because he looked \"normal.\"",

I envision 2 codes, a gym/hot weather/special permission version, and a general version. \n\nMy basic code would be something like...\n\n* The main goal of our dress code is to protect the dignity, spirit, health, and safety of our educational community, and applies equally to students, employees, and volunteers. \n* Shoes should be appropriate for the weather and the walking surfaces in and around school. They should fit properly so as to prevent foot problems, and protect the toes and ankles (ie- heels and/or soles should not be over 2\" thick).\n* Torso- Think 'business wear' coverage- covered from below the kneecaps to shoulders and down to the mid upper arm. The area from mid-collar bone to the neck may be open. No midriff, sides, chest, shoulders, back, thighs, buttocks, or groin should be exposed. \n* Undergarments and what they protect should never be directly visible. Undergarments should also not be obviously missing. \n* No images, text, or depictions on clothing, shoes, or accessories should show disrespect to any group of people, or use words that are hateful or hurtful. No depictions of alcohol. tobacco, weapons, hatred, or violence are allowed. We encourage restraint on messages such as politics and religion (messages mocking people's beliefs are not allowed.)\n* Clothing should fit in a professional or business-like manner- neither too snug nor too loose. \n* Clothing, shoes, and accessories shall not be noisy, flashy, or flamboyant.\n\nThe gym/hot weather/special permission code would allow for things like shorter pants/skirts, exposed shoulders, etc.\n\nAlso- because I am a that kinda person, I would maintain a board of photos of the most interesting but allowable outfits.

The department closed at 9pm on Saturdays but it was often about 9:20 that I actually left. Closing down a department takes time, mostly because you can't do it when customers are browsing. Unsurprisingly, I consistently worked more hours than I was supposed to.\n\nAll store employees were on the clock, and for some reason the store took readings down to the second. You were paid an hourly rate to within a few seconds of how long you were clocked in for.\n\nMy manager (I'll call her Val, because that was her name) called a meeting at 3pm on a Saturday, which coincidentally was the time I was scheduled to start work. Everyone in the department was either starting or finishing their shifts within a couple of hours of then, so it was a logical time, but that was about the only logical thing about it.\n\nThe thrust of the meeting was that \"some people\" - she said, looking directly at me down the length of her not-inconsiderable nose - were claiming more than their allotted hours, and that this must stop. Henceforth, all overtime must be approved in writing. This was entirely her decision. Other departments didn't have this problem as long as you weren't taking the mick.\n\nFast forward to about 8:45pm. Val and I were the only employees left in the department. She started to gather her things, as is her way. And I started the process of putting our more expensive frames into their night display cases, where they could safely be locked away when the department was closed.\n\n\n**Val**: What on Earth are you doing, ThereShallBeWings?\n\n**Me**: I'm locking up. I have to make sure I don't go over my hours today.\n\n**Val**: This department has to be open until 9pm. It's in the store handbook. You can't lock up right now, my boss will be furious.\n\n**Me**: You know from experience that it takes a good 10 minutes (I lied, it's actually more like 20) to lock up. I'm not allowed to be on the premises after I clock out. I have to start locking up otherwise I'll be disciplined.\n\n\nI reached for the tannoy and my voice saying \"Good evening. Would Mrs Lock please come to the optical department? Mrs Lock to the optical department. Thank you!\" resonated through the store - code for \"Security, bring the keys, we're locking up\". Val goes white as a sheet. The first cracks in her caked-on makeup began to show, I could see the look on her snooty face as a very large penny began to drop. She yelled \"Wait here!\" while leaving the department with a purposeful stride.\n\nBy the time she'd returned, I'd explained to the security guard, what's happening. He agreed to play along. We start (slowly) locking down the spectacle frames.\n\nVal, with sweat starting to show on her brow, wordlessly handed me a hastily-scribbled note authorising 30 minutes of overtime. I showed it to the security guard, who nodded. Val left without a word, looking really flustered, just as a customer walked in. My friend from security unlocked the frames again and I went to serve.\n\nThe following day, Val's usual snooty demeanour had changed. She didn't look contrite, but there were definitely a few cracks in her expression. She took me to one side, and without preamble, handed me a new rota, and launched into what was clearly a well-rehearsed speech.\n\n\n**Val**: ThereShallBeWings, I have approved your request to extend your hours to 10 hours a week. I now expect you to work from 3pm until 9:30pm on Saturdays, and from 1pm until 4:30pm on Sundays. I trust that this will not be a problem?\n\n**Me**: Oh, that's fine, thank you Val.\n\n**Val**: And henceforth, if you should happen to work slightly over your hours, do not be overly concerned about it.\n\n\nTL;DR: Stuck-up boss who really likes the word \"henceforth\" for some reason announces an overtime ban, not realising the overtime was me closing down the department after the close of trading. As a result, I start to close down early as she's leaving. She has a panic attack, increases my hours, and reverses the ban.\n\n\n\nEdit Juan: Holy bus, thanks for the gold :)\n\nEdit Too: \"Overtime\" in this sense means \"working over your alloted hours\". It's nothing to do with hourly pay.",

        "selftext": "Phone user and Australian. Fear my autocorrected euphemisms. Tl:Dr at the end.\n\nPrior to being a bartender I worked at a retail chain called Big W. I'm a nerd, I tend to switch to autopilot when tired (almost always at the end of shifts) and can be a dick when annoyed. Me in a nutshell.\n\nIt's a slow Wednesday afternoon, the A/C is broken again and it's about 5 degrees C hotter inside than it is outside (29c). I'm in autopilot, rigor mortis smile on my face and retail greetings  are droning out of my throat. A guy walks into my register, demanding a refund for something trivial. Probably his panties were the wrong colour, I don't remember.\n\nI inform him in a monotone voice that refunds are issued by my supervisor, not me. There's a surprisingly substantial line at the supervisors desk, people wanting cigarettes, refunds or information. He informs me that he's not waiting that long for something trivial.\n\nHe demands I do it, because \"Even someone as dumb as you can do this\". Well that snapped me out of autopilot and the smile fades. I repeat, in a much more direct tone that \"Only the supervisor can do refunds.\" The customer is having none of it. \"Refund my item.\" He demands again, saying it very slowly as if I was the dumbest potato in the strawberry patch. \"I am unable to-\" He cuts me off.\n\n\"I want to speak to your manager, I don't want to talk to you.\" Now this is where people need to be careful with their words. As a cashier I report directly to my supervisor, one of the two at the desk. They're in charge of me. My Manager sits out back managing the store, and usually never has to interact with customers unless the supervisor calls him.\n\nSo I nod, calling through the headset for my manager (let's call him Fred). Fred's a great guy, he tells good jokes, he's always ready to help his friends and he's a caring soul. He's also a mute; and after wrapping his ute around a tree as a teen, he's also deaf. As such he knows Auslan (Australian Sign Language), but can't read lips to save his life. I also can't speak Auslan at all.\n\nThis probably took about 5 minutes for someone to alert Fred that he was needed and for him to come down. All this time I'm smiling but not saying a word to the gentleman, as he told me to. He comes up to the registers, sees it's me waving him down and pulls out his pda to communicate with me. \n\n\"What's up?\" Fred types. I take the pda and type \"Customer has a complaint, wants to speak to 'my manager' not me.\" Fred raises and eyebrow at me and I just shrug. The guy is turning red with anger, probably thinking we're ignoring him.\n\nFred turns to the guy who launches into a full on verbal assault that would curdle milk chcocloate. Something about incompetent employees and terrible service. Fred just stands there. Eventually the guy runs out of breath and Fred has a chance to show him the pda with the words \"Sir I am a deaf mute, please use this to communicate with me.\" The guy practically screams and storms out of the store.\n\nEdit: I didn't quite expect this to blow up so much, so thankyou all for reading. Much as I hate working customer service, I do enjoy helping people. If even one person walks away happy it's a job well done and I'm glad I could bring this to Reddit.\n \n\n\n\nTl;dr: Guy gets angry I can't issue a refund and demands to speak to my manager, who can't speak because he's a mute.",

        "selftext": "This is about a decade ago, but still well within the realm of the internet. I was a technical writer for the government and had slowly been transferring our old employee handbook (think government bureaucracy from the 1940s) into a modern and actually useful doc (think one page with our policies and links to useful websites, like Office of Personnel Management, forms for workman's comp, etc.).  My boss wanted the whole thing printed out, on her desk the next morning. This was Monday of the Thanksgiving weekend. I printed out the 200 or so pages and just had the links to the various websites in bold. This took about an hour, and I left it on her desk before going home that night.\n\nShe calls me in her office on Tuesday afternoon and proceeds to yell at me at how stupid I am, do I think people can just go to a website when it is on paper? No. I need to PRINT everything out. I calmly tell her that these sites are pretty dense and deep and it would be about 10,000 pages.  She says she does not care, it needs to be ON HER DESK DAMMIT first thing Monday morning. Mind you, this is now Tuesday and we usually had some of Wednesday off. I was not really planning to work Thursday Thanksgiving or Friday, as I had applied for leave and was looking forward to a nice relaxing long weekend. I don't have family, but I had plans.  But ok. I asked for, and got the request to have \"everything pertaining to the employee handbook online in a printed format.\"\n\nI also had real work and real deadlines. A quick bit of context: She was my boss, she did my performance appraisals and she could make my life miserable and possibly fire me. However, my clients were teams that put together engineering plans, biological assessments, scientific journal articles, reports to Congress, etc. that had real-world deadlines. On some of these, if you missed the publication date, your agency paid $100,000 a day in delay fees. Or you would piss off a congressperson, which is never a good idea.  And I was really getting sick and tired of  my bosses requests that took me away from my actual work.\n\nSo I was printing and printing all the rest of Tuesday afternoon, and then Wednesday. I had to go to the site, print, click on the next link, print, etc.  On Wednesday, we got a congressional (a letter from a congress critter that was actually important). Had we not gotten that, I might not have done what I did... I got overtime approved pronto to take care of this request. So I did work Thanksgiving.  As I was doing that, I kept on printing. And printing. I used up every sheet of paper in our 14 story building. I kept on researching the response for the congressional, printing, going to the next floor to carefully get that packet of paper to tuck under the appropriate page, etc. I had paper in about 20 different conference rooms.\n\nI could have done the congressional in about 8 hours. BUT it was not due until Monday. And all of this printing took me a good 24 hours of work. So I put in for 32 hours (Thurs, Fri, Sat, and Sun).  Got it done. This is now two stacks of paper, each about 6 feet high. I was waaaay under in my estimate of 10,000 pages as it was more like about 30,000. (Remember, I had at least 5 printers going at once for 4 days etc.).  I put this in my boss's office (which was already none too clean and pristine).\n\nI got written up, with a disciplinary hearing and everything. The charge was .... malicious compliance. I kept my job only because I did have her request in an email.\n\n===EDITS\n\nClosed my parens.\n\nUPDATE and explanations.\n\nI did not expect this to get more than a few hundred views, so thank you all for reading and being amused. A few explanations from questions in the comments:\n\n\"I kept my job only because . . .\" I say that because the boss was VERY UPSET and was going to HR demanding that I be put on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) where she could then take her revenge and create other issues that would have gotten me fired.  I was probably not in danger of being fired simply for this action. But I was not put on a PIP. I was given a  Disciplinary Letter. So the only actual fallout was that I could not get a bonus (we get $1,000 bonuses if our performance is above average). I would have been ok in a RIF as this is a mild punishment.\n\nYes, the charge actually and literally was \"Malicious Compliance.\" That was what was written on the Disciplinary Letter. She could not get me on anything else.  She had not set any limits (you can only spend x hours, print out x materials, etc.). And I had her instructions in an email to print out the handbook and all pertaining information from websites. I do not remember the exact wording. I probably should have kept that all these years, but when I left the government after 3 decades, I pretty much threw out everything.\n\nThe two six-foot stacks were not just the paper printouts. The handbook covered everything and was more of an intranet in itself.  I had been working on this project for a long time in my spare time.  The handbook covered everything. In short, this was a well-organized intranet where you could quickly find exactly what you needed and no more.  I had Human Resources policies on leave, tardiness, all disciplinary actions, retirement, health insurance, taxes, transfer requests, etc.; how to write all types of reports (planning reports, facility review reports, congressionals, etc.) along with all templates for the reports; project management and public involvement processes, etc.; every position description and how to write performance reviews, award letters, etc.;  emergency procedures for particular buildings, etc.; how to conduct and write a Job Hazard Analysis for any type of work on a facility, etc.. . . . There was absolutely no reason to print this out. And my boss never gave me a reason.  I had been arguing against printing this for at least a year before my boss gave me the order to even print the 200 pages I had in the first place. These 200 pages each briefly explained the situation (for example, why we do a Job Hazard Analysis, what it should cover, and who should do one) and then gave links (for example to the Word Template you could download and use and to good examples).  So, I already had had a LOT of material that I just put into the piles. So the piles looked like:\\* Index tab with sticky for the topic\\* Sheet of paper explaining the concept\\* Ream of paper printing out the internet (all of the pages with the related links), neatly put into a notebook.\\* Pre-printed examples of templates, reports, etc.\n\nWe did have a printing unit off site, so major jobs were printed there. Thus we did not have that many copiers in the building (one per floor). And yes, before you ask, my boss \\*\\*could have\\*\\* asked the copy unit to do the work. But the copy unit would only print things that were already in a pre-approved pdf format. They would not have printed the internet for my boss.\n\nYes, my boss kept her job. She was promoted soon after from being the group manager of about 15 people to being the Deputy Chief of a division of several hundred people.\n\nYes, I worked at the same job (technical writer) for 30+ years. First off, I loved what I did. I was good at it. I never wanted to go into management and deal with people headaches myself. Second off, I needed the health insurance and would not have been able to get a private company job because of my underlying handicap. So staying put in the government and doing what I loved worked out well for me. And I was quite effective at my job. I wrote documents that allowed decisionmakers to understand complex issues and make good decisions, employees use and protect our facilities, etc.. My colleagues respected me and we worked well together.\n\nYes, this is the U.S. Federal Government. And we did have a very ineffectual union where only a few people were allowed to be bargaining unit members. And the union could have done very little to save my job.\n\nThanks for reading my funny little story.",

Usually there would be 2 people working in case of big donations so one person isn't carrying everything. I was in my 20s at the time and a medium build woman. I could handle most things alone and genuinely didnt mind the work. It was nice to have help though for large furniture items or multiple truck loads. And it was standard practice to switch on and off as main donation taker. A woman in her 60s was hired as my partner. I had worked and been trained by women in their late 50s and 60s so was not worried about her age. However, she had apparently been hired and told that she would not have to answer the donation door since she was older, overweight (so she had trouble walking for long distances), and multiple health problems with her lungs and movement in general. I was told that I could take it upon myself to ask her to help more (that's literally not my job I wasn't her boss) or suck it up and take all the responsibility of donations. After about 6 months of escalating tensions and heated discussions about it, I noticed my arm getting sore and I was having trouble carrying bags. I told my managers and asked to be taken off donations. They said no, that I needed a Dr's note otherwise I would have to be let go since there were no other positions. I called in the next day, went to the Dr, was given a wrist brace, told to take the next 2 days off (which led into the weekend so off til monday), then had a Dr's note to be put on light duty work for a few weeks. That left the other woman having to do donations alone (I felt bad but she was also a really awful person in general so not that bad). Since she had so many health problems that meant management had to work twice as hard helping her with donations and running around the store taking care of customers and other employees.

(We were only open from 3-close, so it was the only shift.) For a $400/week salary. \n\nMy only day off was Monday, and it never failed I'd get at least 3-4 calls from whoever was covering that shift. So basically I had no life for no money, but I couldn't afford to work anywhere else (I don't have a degree or anything). Well, one Monday I got SUPER sick with what I know was food poisoning, from snacking without thinking on the precooked chicken on the make-line that my store owner REFUSED to throw away. I not only refused to answer the phone that day, since I was delirious with fever and a migraine that was photo and sound sensitive, I tried to call in the following day, Tuesday, and I was refused. Store owner was out on the beach and wouldn't come in to cover the shift. Told me if I didn't come in I was fired. So I did a bit of malicious compliance. Still running a high fever and spewing out both ends, I went in--but I explained to my skeleton crew of staff that I was very, very ill and i would be literally in the bathroom for the entire shift. We ran at least 2 hours on deliveries that night because one of our 2 drivers had to stay inside to take orders and make food, food cost was through the roof. And, before I left, I threw out that damned chicken.\n\nStore owner was fucken LIVID, mostly at the loss of the chicken!! I told him to get over himself, that all it would take would be one phone call from me to the Health Department to get his shit shut down. He couldn't fire me because it would have meant he would have had to do the work.

He told me that if I didn\u2019t show up for my shift, I would lose my job. I said, okay, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not trying to die today. I went to the hospital, and checked myself into a detox program because I had just gotten a lot of free time. When I was in detox, the district manager of the pizza chain was there too.

I would say average age of our dinner crowd is 30 to 60 although it varies more on the weekend. I only include this information so you understand why I didnt initially ask for identification (even though you should always check) \n\nThursday night a table of 4 comes in for early dinner. 2 Karens and their daughters. Excellent. I'm ready for them to split entrees and tip me 15%. Not the WORST type of table if we're being honest, but nonetheless. They order a pitcher of sangria and I tell them I'll be right back with that for them to which Momma Karen says to me \"you really aren't going to check these girls IDs? Her birthday was just last month. Aren't you supposed to check anyone who looks under 40?\" \nShe is correct, of course that I should have asked for identification even though they girls were with their mothers and I was being lazy by assuming they were of age since their moms did not stop them from ordering drinks. I agree with her and tell her that I actually am supposed to check ALL IDs regardless of age, and proceed to look at all 4 of the ladies IDs. Unfortunately for Momma Karen, her birthday was a few days previously and her ID had expired. In the state of Michigan it is illegal to serve alcohol to anyone with an expired ID regardless of age so I had to deny Momma Karen a glass for the sangria, while her daughter and friend shared a pitcher. \n\nI didnt reallllly have malicious intentions, however, it felt good that Karen's antics backfired on her.\n\nEDIT: I didnt include details of Karen throwing a fit when I denied her a glass of sangria. She informed me that she, a business owner, is more aware of the law than I, a mere server, could ever be. I simply couldn't \"just do my job\" and bring her a glass.

But for my 21st birthday, I was very excited to go back to the place where my friends and I used to hang out as teenagers and finally order a drink legally.  Only because 21-year-old me appeared to be approximately 30-something, I didn't get carded.\n\nSo my girlfriend spoke up, and said, \"No no, you have to card him!\"\n\nAnd my waiter shrugged and said, \"Okay.  Lemme see your ID.\"\n\nSo I handed him my driver's license.  And a moment later, he hands it back and says, \"I'm sorry, I can't serve you.\"\n\nAnd I'm like, \"No no, check the date!\" And I'm still expecting there to be a realization, so I've got this anxious shit-eating grin on my face like, \"Eh? EH!??\"\n\nOnly the waiter nonchalantly responds, \"No, I saw.  And happy birthday.  But I still can't serve you.\"\n\nAnd then he proceeded to explain.  You see, in Maryland, at least back when I first got my driver's license (they've changed since then), they took your picture in profile when you're under 21, and facing forward when you're 21 or older.  And that's something I knew, so I was planning on going to the MVA sometime soon to get my license replaced (I just didn't want to do it on my birthday because who wants to spend their birthday at the MVA?).  But what I didn't know is that regardless of your age, you can't be served without a forward-facing ID.  So because we had asked the waiter to check my ID, I now wasn't allowed to drink alcohol there.\n\nWe left, and found another place nearby, but because I now knew that I didn't have an appropriate ID to get served, I felt compelled to keep my birthday a secret.  In the greatest of ironies, I, a guy who had been drinking for at least a year without ever worrying about getting carded, spent the first night I was of legal age to drink keeping my birthday a secret and desperately hoping I didn't get carded.",

They gave me a laptop with some limited space and an old 1TB external drive with extra data on it, the kind which needed an external power supply to run (factors in later).\n\n\nNow there are two things which are worth noting about the company\n\n* Exteremly tech unfriendly (not many tech people in the company)\n* Very bureaucratic, even in the face of emergency\n\n\nSo as a programmer, I was subject to the same laptop restrictions as say, a sales rep or a business op. Which is really unfair when you have to work closely with an onsite team. And they had blocked transfer on all plain text files. Which is what all source code files happen to be.\n\n\nI was told I would have to email the admin staff EVERY TIME I wanted to plug in the usb drive, the admin would validate with my department, and they would generate for me a one time password for that usb 'session' which was unique to that device. That really annoyed the hell out of me because I knew I would have a lot of copying/backing up to do every now and then. So I came up with a plan.\n\n\nI'd use the password to grant usb access to the drive, copy a few files, then I'd cut power to it and reconnect it. New session, new password needed, new email sent. I told them that it being a construction site, power was very unstable, and the drive they gave me kept disconnecting because it needed external power. I did this every 10-15 minutes, maybe about 50-60 times a day, for 3 days. At the end of the third day, the admin head called me himself to grant me admin rights to the laptop so that I could disable the monitoring software for the rest of the trip.\n\n\nWhen I went back, they held a meeting to review onsite policies for technical and support visits.\n\nEDIT: I really didnt make this clear I think. Usually admin blocked USB access outright. In my case, after requesting, they allowed USB access, but they applied the policy usually reserved for sales reps (which blocks documents, videos, etc from being transferred to/from anywhere, which included plain text). It was an urgent short term trip to complete this project which was gonna run on an isolated system, so setting up an elaborate delivery was pretty much overkill. And the internet access onsite was pretty terrible anyway.\n\nI don't actually have a problem with putting in security measures to disallow unknown usb devices from being plugged in. I think thats required. But a device they already verified and vetted? Thats a bit much\n\n\nEDIT 2: This is actually from some time ago, things have been better since then and a couple other incidents. We get encrypted drives with passwords atleast.

I am now like the girl you don't take home to mother in \"Superfreak\".**\n--\nBack in the days before unlimited mobile phone calling plans and long distance, I had a company-paid flip phone. There were all kinds of fussy rules attached to using it - no texting (even though texting was free), no long-distance calls (with one exception as I'll explain below), no special ring tones, and no using the camera. Like I said, fussy rules.\n\nThe one exception to the \"no long-distance calls\" rule was for travel. In my job, I rarely would have to travel to a different calling area (i.e. \"roaming\") but if I did I was permitted one long-distance call per day to call home. That's it.\n\nSo. The day came when I had to travel and stay overnight in a hotel for work. When I arrived at the hotel, I called my wife to let her know I arrived and spent a couple of minutes talking to my kids. Got some supper, did some work in front of the tv in the hotel room, and went to bed.\n\nThe next day while at the conference I was attending, I got a call from my home office. As I was in a large hotel, the call dropped so I had to call back. Didn't think anything of it, went back to my session and enjoyed the speaker. Later, after I got back to the hotel, I called home to say goodnight to the kids. I got the answering machine and left a message. Didn't think anything of that either. The next day I returned and went on with my life.\n\nAt the end of the month I got a call from Finance. \n\n\"Brother_p, it's <<finance supervisor>>. I'm just reviewing your latest cell phone bill and it shows an unauthorized long-distance call.\"\n\n\"Really? What was the date?\"\n\n\"April 3rd. You made a call to <<my office number>> at 9:20 am then another one to <<my home number>> at 6:15 pm.\"\n\n\"Oh, yeah, that's when I was at a conference. The first call was to me from the office but I got cut off and had to call back. I called home from the hotel later.\"\n\n\"So, how would you like to reimburse us for the call?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\"\n\n\"The second call. You have to reimburse for the unauthorized long-distance call. You have an expense claim from the conference in so I can deduct it from that, or you can pay directly.\"\n\n\"How much are we talking about?\"\n\n\"Ten cents.\"\n\n\"Ten cents?\"\n\n\"Ten cents. Would you like that deducted from your expense claim?\"\n\nI thought I was being punked. Seriously. I sat in stunned silence for a few moments.\n\n\"No. You know what? I'll pay you directly,\" I said and wished the supervisor a pleasant day.\n\nI opened my drawer where I had some spare change, took two nickels, taped them to a sheet of 8.5 x 11\" paper, and wrote \"for cell phone charge\" and my name. I then took a company envelope, addressed it to the Finance office (in a different building walking distance away), folded the sheet of paper, and put it in the envelope. I put the envelope in the outgoing mail tray, the postage for which would be paid by the company.\n\nA few days later I got a call from the Comptroller herself. Three pay grades above me and usually wouldn't interact with someone on my level. Apparently the supervisor complained about me.\n\n\"What's with the nickels?\" \n\nI explained the situation, told her the supervisor had insisted that I pay the $0.10 charge and I complied. She laughed out loud. The paper, envelope and postage had cost the company more than what they recovered.\n\nThe following month the Finance department updated the cell phone policy. From then on, only long-distance charges in excess of $10 had to be reimbursed.",

I was very reluctant, but after discussing it with my wife I agreed but warned them I would be phoning home regularly.  \"Not an issue\" they said.\n\nI fixed the problem, customer was happy, boss was happy.

I ended up with a similar truck but with the largest engine you could get that year.   Normally they never got us trucks like that because they burn a lot more fuel.  That thing was actually kinda fun. I never had trouble merging with that thing. \n\nThe thing got horrible mileage.

(high compression engines like higher octane but you can detune one to run well on it. Efficiency suffers though. ) \n\nWith 93 octane it got significantly better mileage.  It was to the point that not running the right fuel was just stupid.  \n\nA few weeks into this, I got an angry phone call from some corporate bean counter pitching a fit because I wasn't buying the cheaper fuel.   I explained it to him and he wasn't having it.    \n\nI pointed out that he had all the data in front of him, and suggested he check the numbers himself.  \n\nNOPE!  \n\nI was told to run the cheapest dog urine grade gas and nothing else. \n\nOk, Mr Beancounter.\n\n \n\nSo for nearly 300k miles I ran that truck on the wrong fuel burning gas at 10 mpg.\n  \nWhen I turned it in, I crunched the numbers.  They could have bought an identical new truck with the money they wasted having me run the wrong fuel.  \n\nIf they'd listened actually listened to me when I told them my previous truck was dying they would been able to trade it in, and not have had to take what was available on short notice. \n\nThe truck would have been cheaper, it would have had the more efficient engine, and it would have gotten decent mileage on cheap gas.\n\n\nGood thing we had that guy there to protect the company from me being efficient.",

            "Although different, I'm reminded of the BofA class action suit where they were processing any withdrawals or charges per day by most expensive to least expensive, instead of chronologically, which ended up causing some major overdraft problems. If you have $100 in your account and make a $20 withdrawal, a purchase for $20, $10 and one for $15, and a charge comes in later for $80, you would expect there to only be 1 overdraft, for the 80. But when processed as biggest to smallest, you got 100, then 20, then 0, then overdraft for 20, overdraft for 15, overdraft for 10. And at $35 an overdraft you end up being over $100 overdrawn with 3 declined purchases. It was a hefty class action. But that was beyond MC. That was more like fraud.",

            "Not my MC\n\nA Housing Supervisor for a rental property where we lived for a few years had a similar story.  This would have been in the early 1990's.\n\nHe was responding during an On-Call weekend, and used the Company issued Cell Phone to let his Wife know he was done and heading home.\n\nApparently, this was flagged as unauthorized and he was informed that he would have to pay for the call.  I think it was a whopping $0.15, which would be an average charge per minute at the time.\n\nHe wrote them a cheque for $0.16 just to mess with them.\n\nA place I worked around that same time made use of a lot of Cell Phones.  Project Managers had them installed in their cars, and Supervisors carried around those old Motorola Bricks.\n\nOne Supervisor in particular, distinguished himself by making calls one weekend, while drunk, and presumably passed out without ending the call.  It disconnected when the battery finally died.\n\nThe charged hours of calls from his phone (@ $0.15/minute) exceeded that of the Owner, and he bragged about it.  They got rid of him no long after.",

I would get an email monthly telling me to be sure and check their phone bill amounts online, so I did.  No problems until one month a report's bill was triple the normal amount, but his usage wasn't.  I tried to find out what was going on and nobody I contacted could explain it other than \"we have different buckets of minutes people get put into so it's probably related to that\".  I never bothered to check anybody's bill after that because it turned out nobody actually cared or could do anything about it anyway.",

So the worker told me to go through and the state's automated system would bill me based on my license plate.\n\nA few months later I received a letter from the state demanding payment. $0.18 for the toll. The letter had a postmark indicating it had cost them $0.52 for the postage.

        "selftext": "This happened some years ago when I had just gotten hired for a part time position in a retail store. \n\nAll was good until the summer got close and he offered me full time for the summer ended which I gladly took. Less than two weeks in to the summer he changed my hours back to part time. I hadn't thought about getting the temporary fulltime thing in writing as he seemed like a trustworthy guy. \n\nIt made no sense as I did a good job and helped out with things my contract didn't mention when I had the time as I get bored quickly. I found out that even though he have years of experience in the field he had massively over spent on the wage bill and had to cut down to avoid getting fired by the head office. \n\nWhen I voiced my concern over this his only response \"I'm only obliged to give you 20 hour a week, as the contract state\". \n\nI wanted to chew him out verbally but I kept my cool and decided that if he wanted to play that game I would too. When I got home that night I read my entire contract and noted the clauses that I could use. \n\nOne clause stated that my responsibilities was unloading the trucks, take care of the stock room and keep the shelfs stocked. \n\nAnother mentioned that I shouldn't do other tasks as their insurance only covered me for the specific areas I was meant to work . \n\nNext day he told me to help out the cashiers as the lines were long. \n\n\"Sorry, can't do. As the contract states that isn't part of my job here and I should refrain from doing that. You can find it in my contract as clause 9a and 9b\" \n\nHe was fuming, face totally red and he just walked away without saying shit. \n\nAnother thing I had noticed in my contract is that besides my 30 min lunch break I had a 10 minute break I could take when I wanted so I gave him 5 minutes, walked into his office and told him I was taking my 10 minute break. \n\n\"What are you talking about? You only have one break and that's for lunch\". \n\n\"My contract says otherwise. It's in clause 10.\" \n\nWhen I got back from the break he asked me to clean something up out in the store. I couldn't believe that he couldn't take a hint. \n\n\"Sorry, can't do. Clause 9a & 9b prevents me from doing it\". \n\nNext day a costumer asked for help with something. \"Sorry, can't do. It's not my job. Find someone else\". \nMy boss heard about this and yelled at me but I managed to stay calm and answered with the clauses that prevented me from helping the costumer. Legally I was in the right and he couldn't do shit but I could see the hatred in his eyes. \n\nI was still on a trial period which meant he could fire me with only 24 hours notice but I could also resign with only 24 hours notice. \n\nI knew that once the summer ended and everyone were back from from their vacations he would fire me right away. I had started looking for other jobs and it was going all right so I decided to quit at the worst time possible when it showed itself. \n\nAt the last week of summer he had to fire one with suspend another for stealing from the store. It was the perfect time to quit and leave him badly undermanned for the week. \n\n24 hours and 1 minutes before my next shift I sent him my resignation before I sent a message to my coworkers about how they should remember to take all their breaks and not violate their contract by doing stuff they aren't allowed to do. \n\nI heard it gave him a little chaos when people followed my advice.",

After a quick perusal of my contract on my lunch break, I took a picture of the clause that states that I can only be scheduled for 7 days, and walked up to the office and sat down with the owner. \nIt went well, until he tries saying that it was okay, cause it was over two schedules. \nI politely asked how someone could work more than 7 days on one 7 day schedule. \nI walked out with another day off",
