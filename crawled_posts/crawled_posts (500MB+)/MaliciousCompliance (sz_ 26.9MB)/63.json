        "selftext": "About 10 years ago, my at-the-time girlfriend (now wife) and I moved from the area we went to college to an apartment near where we planned to start our careers. I say it was an apartment, but it was really the basement of a house that the landlord had walled off to create 2 \"apartments\" to rent. The place was kinda crappy, but the rent was cheap for the area, and we were close to work. \n\nEverything was fine for a few months, but the only parking for us was on the street out front - the couple that rented the upstairs \"apartment\" had rights to the garage and driveway (they paid more than we did). Suddenly my car got a couple BS tickets for parking on the street - I'm guessing some ass-clown cop needed to meet their quota - and my girlfriend's car got sideswiped in a hit & run. This crap had to stop, so we emailed the landlord (her preferred form of communication) to ask if there's anywhere safe for us to park. She replies, \"Park anywhere you want.\" We had noticed that our upstairs neighbors usually eschewed the driveway to park in the front yard (they were horribly lazy), so we figured that would be a good spot for us too. We parked in the front yard the rest of the year.\n\nWe figured that would be the end of it. We finished our lease, left the place in better shape than we found it, and requested our $1500 security deposit back. After a couple weeks, we got a check for $700... WTF!?!?!? Since there was no explanation, we asked the landlord for one, and she replied that the deducted amount was to \"re-sod the lawn\", claiming that parking on it had damaged it. \n\nNow, I was the one who cut the grass at this house while we stayed there, so I was well aware that the lawn was more weeds and bald spots than grass - picture the African savanna in mid-summer. No one had ever lifted a finger to landscape any part of the property, but the landlord wanted to sell the house once the leases were up, and she figured she could get the renters to pay for a nice, new lawn. I complained to the landlord: didn't care. I put in a complaint with the local housing department: didn't care. I threatened to take her to court: didn't care. So, that's what I did - took her to small claims court.\n\nI had never sued anyone before, so I was going in prepared! I took pictures of the entire front yard - the area that we \"damaged\" was actually one of the best patches of grass, though it did have a small rut that my tires made when the yard was muddy in the summer. I got testimonials from our upstairs and across-the-street neighbors. Most importantly, I printed out the email where the landlord told us to park anywhere. \n\nWe were suing for $1800 to cover court costs and us both missing a day of work on top of the full security deposit. In mediation we said we would settle for $1400, but she must have thought she was in the right because she refused to offer a penny more than the original $700 check, which we never cashed. When we got in front of the judge, it was pretty clear that she had no evidence, hadn't prepared anything, and just assumed that us \"kids\" would fall on our faces. We did not.\n\nWe put everything we had in front of the judge and made our claim (he was impressed). He stopped us when we showed him the email to ask the landlord, \"Did you really tell them to park wherever they wanted?\" When she said \"yes\", the judge replied \"Then what are we even talking about?\", and that was that. Judgement in full for us, and that bitch had to pay to re-sod her own damn lawn. \n\nNext time you tell someone to \"park wherever you want\", you'd better mean it. Or at least don't try to fuck someone over when they comply with what you said! If you made it this far, thanks for reading!",

            "My landlord tried to keep half our $1500 deposit because of some burn marks, a broken door, and some shades missing - all of which I had taken pictures of when we moved in. All were pre-existing.\n\nI told her (company) that if I didn\u2019t see my entire deposit back by the 4th of the month I was legally entitled to double that amount and I had lawyers on standby if they wanted to go to court over it.\n\nThey paid.\n\nThen I printed out copies of \u201cThe Landlord Tenant Act\u201d which she had violated on several occasions (including not giving my full deposit back) and distributed bound copies to every person living at every rental property I could find listings for.\n\nScrew crappy landlords.",
            "I once had a landlord who tried to keep our ENTIRE \u00a32500 deposit for flooding damage which she had refused to fix for months, and which SHE caused by deciding she could fix our broken washing machine herself by forcefully pulling it out without disconnecting it from the water or turning the water off first. \n\nIf she'd been reasonable we probably would have agreed to let her keep some of it, because we did break the bathroom sink (and then lived for months with the only source of water being the bathtub, because she wouldn't replace the bathroom sink and also hadn't fixed the damage she'd somehow done to the kitchen pipes in the washing machine debacle, rendering the kitchen sink also unusable). \n\nBut she wasn't reasonable, and two of my housemates were lawyers (which she knew) so they filed against her, she just didn't turn up, and she had to pay us the full amount back.",
            "Had a rental with a missing screen door. Tried and tried to get them to come put one on, as agreed in the move in inspection. We finally got fed up and went to the restore and installed one our selves. Come move out, our dog has messed some of the screen up, they tried to charge us 300 to replace it. Rolled up with my receipt from the store and a printout of all the emails asking for them to do it. Took the screen door off, put it in a friends truck and went about our day. They dropped the additional charge",
            "Yep, my last landlord tried to pocket the deposit - didn't even offer a pretense of a reason, just told me she'd referred the matter to her legal counsel and we'd be hearing from him (we never did).\n\nI assume the tactic was to make us thankful we weren't in legal trouble so we'd slink away and not cause problems, while she pocketed an extra grand without justification.\n\nThe thing is - I'm a lawyer at a very good firm, so it didn't go the way she planned.  In my state a landlord has to take certain steps in certain time periods if they'll not return the deposit.  She didn't.  As I'd demanded my deposit back and she'd not complied with the statute I was entitled to return of my full deposit plus attorneys' fees and a penalty of several hundred dollars more.\n\nI composed a precise and damning demand letter to her and had my colleague finalize it, sign it, and send it.\n\nA few days later my colleague received a sheepish call from her attorney asking if we'd drop everything in exchange for return of the full security deposit.  We said yes if they'd wire the money within 24 hours, else we were taking them to court.  The money was in my account that afternoon.\n\nI'm still annoyed when I think about that dishonest creep making me go through all that to get what was rightfully mine (well, most of it - I'd rented the place furnished, so there were some small damages she legitimately could have claimed for; but, pigs get fat while hogs get slaughtered, and instead of retaining $150 - 200, she tried to pocket the whole $1,000)",

            "Fun story! My last Landlord attempted to show our basement suite off before we gave official notice that we were leaving, and without providing adequate notice herself. This being very recent, so you know why we were so concerned- plus one of our roommates had a pre-existing condition.\n\n\nWe contacted the tenancy organization, and upon gaining the knowledge that we were fully within our rights to bar her entry, we printed out a copy of the residential act and taped it to all the entry points. \n\n\nWe then proceeded to block the front door with the couch, just in case.\n\n\nShe thought we were dumb students. Unfortunately for her, we weren't- and we would have gone to court if she'd tried anything.\n\n\nSucks to suck.",
            "I had a landlord once try to keep about \u00a3300 of my deposit to buy a new mattress because it was stained. I knew it was horrible when I moved in (I had to flip it because of all the stains) so I sweetly asked them to remind me which safe deposit scheme they put my deposit into, knowing full well they hadn't used one and that was illegal. They returned my full deposit.",
            "To landlords, it seems the deposit has just become a bonus check in their eyes. They can claim whatever they want and just keep it. And unless you took mad pictures before you moved in and when you left you have no evidence to disprove their claim. And even if you did they make you take them to court to get it back. A lot of people are too lazy and just say fuck it.",
            "Where I live, it\u2019s actually illegal to ask for security deposits (exactly because of things like this). When my former partner and I went to sign a lease a couple years ago, we read through it and said, \u201cYeah... we\u2019re not paying that\u201d. \n\nThey were so confident and assumed we, young adults, would just fold. Yeah, no. We had them alter and initial the lease right there. Gotta say, the looks on their faces was pretty priceless when we reminded them: \u201cYou know this is illegal, right? It\u2019s in the Landlord Tenant Act\u201d.  We had already moved half our shit in at that point so they clearly weren\u2019t going to fight us on it. \n\nIt was at that moment I realized that it really does help to read up on your LOCAL landlord-tenant rights. Please do yourself a favour and check out your local city guidelines! Given the kind of absentee landlords they turned out to be, I have absolutely no doubt that we would have never seen that $500 bucks again. Surely they had a plan to just make something up after we left. \n\nKnow your rights!",

            "Theres a house that i was looking to rent here in our little town in the midwest that about 6 months ago i know was going for about $500 a month, $500 deposit.\nNot really an issue but i got word that the tenants who grabbed the house before my fiance and i were able to even FIND the damn phone number, we're moving out.\n\nI was excited and went down to the place that was renting out this very small two bedroom (think one bedroom that had a wall built in the middle of it that they smashed down another wall to provide a doorway) house..... Then i found out the rent was now going to be $800 a month with a $1000 deposit.\n\nI wondered why and asked, the landlord told us she 'didnt want anymore white trash breeders in her house anymore' (im expecting in February)... I was floored.\n\nI know that the previous tenants had put a hole in the wall but that was because the adult man in the house fell over after a day of work and tripping on a rug.\n\nBut to increase the rent THAT much just because someone left a hole in the wall and nothing more? Yeah no. Sounds like a nightmare renting situation.",
            "The first place my ex and I rented was like that. We had to paint it before we could move in, couldn't flush the toilet when the upstairs neighbors were washing laundry, their kids constantly took baths that flooded our bathroom because they splashed... I'm pretty sure it was not legally converted. When we moved out, we put the keys in the mail box and let the landlord know. We paid a $500 deposit and expected to get it back, but a month and a half later, we finally got a letter from the landlord with a bill charging us for the replacement of a damp carpet, painting (we actually never finished because we didn't feel like it was fair to be paying rent when we couldn't move in and we were young and dumb, so we didn't know any better), and an electric bill that was from after we moved out. I went to the free legal clinic and got copies of the landlord tenant laws and sent one back to them with a copy of the bill and a letter as to why they were not legally able to charge us for those things and that we could sue them for our deposit back if we wanted to. Never heard from them again.",
            "Had this happen. It was only for $300 and a tree fell on their porsche the week after i moved out. \"Religious\" landlords too lol.  ...try negotiating a non refundable deposit next time you move. That way, nobody owes anyone a penny. Any wear and tear is on them to deal with",

            "In college we asked our landlord to fix some crazy problems that occurred due to circumstances way out of our control and she had the balls to claim we were destroying her house. She delayed fixes for months finding the cheapest contractor to fix it.  In the end the contractor found out it wasn\u2019t just some kids destroying the house there were serious problems outside of our control. So instead she tried kicking us out and selling the house. You can\u2019t just kick people out in my city so she tried raising rent which you can\u2019t do if repairs aren\u2019t done. We got tired of playing defense so we went to a lawyer to play offense. We sued her for a ton of money and her lawyer came back with the most bullshit counter offer of $100 per person. Our lawyer actually called her lawyer to ask him if he was fucking serious. In the end our landlord should have taken our first offer because she lost almost double our demand in market value to the house alone. Had she paid us what we wanted and fixed the house she would have gotten it all back in the value of the home. Instead she paid for the repair lost the suit and had to sell the house for less because she thought that would magically make the lawsuit disappear.",

            "Before I bought my current house, I lived in a small apartment which had brand new carpets and such when I moved in. A few weeks after moving out, we were told we'd have to pay around $400 for carpet replacement and ozone treatment (in the form of a bill we received), and we wouldn't be getting our deposit back (another $400). They also refused to prorate the rent back to us (we moved half a month before lease was up), even after I explicitly asked if they would before moving and they had said yes. Once we received the bill, I asked about this, they said that they *never* prorate rent. \n\nThey tried to say there were cigarette burns in the carpet, and a heavy smell of smoke.\n\nThing is, no one that lived there (mostly me, 2 others toward the end) smoked cigarettes, or even allowed them to be smoked in the apartment.\n\nI complained to them and they basically told me the work was already done so I had to pay. \n\nMy realtor happened to be a realtor from the same company who leases the apartments, so she was able to escelate the situation up the ladder and a few weeks later we ended up receiving our full deposit back, plus prorated rent.",

Also, they are still there (I sometimes visit my friend, who lives next door, and I can see). He also charged us for a broken window (I did break it with a Frisbee), and he never replaced it. Luckily, the window was already boarded up on the inside. The main reason why we left was because he let some random old guy in our apartment without telling us. I almost punched the guy in the face because I was coming back from summer camp, which happened to be at the nearby police station. We didn't call the police (dumb decision), but my mom did scream at the dude, who also admitted that the landlord was crazy, and thought he told us.

            "I had a crappy hole in the wall studio apartment in an iffy neighborhood. I joke that it didn't matter that we had restricted entry, since half the people that lived there were the kind of people it was meant to kick out. More than once i found distinctly human feces in the stairwell. I had a tiny balcony, that we really only there because i was between two bigger apartments in the corner so they just gave my little corner a slab of concrete that connected the other 2 balconies. My \"balcony\" was bordered on both sides, with my window on one side and the wall of my neighbor's apartment on the other and the open end with a waist high fence. I was only on the second floor of this 6 floor building and they apparently decided not to do this on any of the other floors, so i would get rain on my little 4ftx6ft patch of concrete. It had a drain, but the drain wasn't sunken enough so it didn't do much. I had noticed halfway through my year there that sometimes with heavy rain the carpet just inside the back door would get damp. I made 2 maintenance requests over the phone (so i didnt have any record i had done them) and both times they told me it was fine. I also had 2 bookcases near the door. When we moved out i noticed a small black patch, maybe the size of a quarter that i thought might be mold. I took a picture and made mention to them that i had noticed it. It comes time to get my deposit back and its half what i paid (can't remember the numbers now). When i contacted them about it they said they had had to replace the carpet and took the money out of my deposit. I asked why the carpet had to be replaced, since I'd cleaned it and despite the small black spot everything else was in order. She said that the people that went in to assess it said the carpet needed to be replaced and i was at fault. They documented no pictures, no description of the particulars, just that the carpet would be replaced and it needed to come out of my security deposit. I tried showing them the pictures i took on leaving and they said they couldn't accept those as i could have doctored the time stamp in my phone somehow. They wouldn't let me contact the person they had had assess it and refused to follow up on my behalf. I explained the drain problem and the wet spot and that i had reported it, but since i didn't have any proof i had reported it i had no case. I was about q month away from getting married and traveling to Japan and starting nursing school at the time and couldn't handle the extra stress and expense of trying to take legal action , especially without any hard evidence to make my case, so i gave up.

We ended up letting her be our realtor and she was annoyed that we wanted to look at so many houses, a lot of which she picked out and were in about the same amount of disrepair as the house we were renting.

            "During my second year of uni I moved into a house with some friends. I got the smallest room and wasn\u2019t really happy there, stayed in my boyfriends house most of the time. So I told the landlord I wouldn\u2019t be renewing my contract even though my friends would be staying. They tried all sorts of little tricks like saying they wont pay for the internet for the house if it was only 3 people, they had to find another person in my place as it was their responsibility etc just a bunch of shitty tricks basically to guilt trip me. Anyway I moved out a month earlier than my contract and let them know via email my new address they could mail my deposit check to.  A month goes by no reply and no check. Another month. They were first time landlords, and there was no other way to contact them. After months they finally got back to me in the middle of summer - my friends had gone back home before the new school year - to say they had put the check under the door of the room and what seemed to be the problem. I told them that I\u2019d moved out already and they didnt care, they even said I\u2019d have to ask whoever moved in there whenever that may be. I got super annoyef at this point and started taking screenshots of my contract and sending it to them. It stated in the contract the deposit must be paid in full no later than one month after the end date of the contract. They said ok we\u2019ll re-issue the check. So I waited, still nothing. At this point I was emailing everyday it had been 2 months after my contract ended at this point. They told me off for being rude etc turns out the idiots put the second check through my friends door. I threatened to get lawyers involved and said they were being completely unprofessional and my friends could also walk away from their contracts if the court found misconduct on their side (i was bullshitting at this point dont know if I was actually correct) but they said very bluntly that theyd mail me the check at my new address but to not cash it until a certain date. As soon as I got the check I said fuck that and cashed it.

My employer is a large IT company and we get quite a few bright sparks coming out of University and they generally think they know it all. The usual conversation goes along the lines of me pointing out something that the new employee might have missed in their code or where they might not be trapping errors in the way they think they are. \n\nThe good ones will ask for an explanation, but there will always be the odd one who comes out with \"OK Boomer, I just graduated with a great degree and I studied this stuff at university really recently, we moved on from punch cards you know\".\n\nThese ones I will give plenty rope to hang themselves. I know they are going to come out with one of three or four papers to prove how much they know about our specific technology.

This is of course my fault as we aren't paid to think, but now he needs that vac truck out for cleanup.\n\nThe kicker, he \"designed\" the piping rack and failed to install any drain points and controls, which are a regulatory standard, could've solved all these issues, but he told the other crew that did the initial install the same thing.",

Manager tells him this is going to the scrap yard, anything in there is trash, quit wasting time. guys sure, has the manager sign off on the shipment and sends it away.\n\n Two days later, someone from the NRC (Nuclear Regulatory Commission) stops buy to collect the radioactive pellet from the bottler (it's used to check the fill, IIRC). Nobody can find it. Plant manager pulls up the invoice, call the snotty manager and asked what happened to the pellet. Manager, of course has no idea, says he thought it was all trashed, didn't know he had to remove anything. Rail car already took the scrap away.

        "selftext": "To start with, my boss had his moments. Sometimes he was a dick who would push off me on my raises or screw with my system, sometimes he would hook me up and make my life pleasant. This was not one of the latter. \n\nSo, I had plans for vacation, but my boss decided I had to take my vacation time in  June instead of August because HE wanted to take his vacation in August and no other time would work. I lost some money as a result, but thats my fault for planning ahead I guess. \n\nWell. Ill start by saying...my position was vital, and being gone for 2 weeks, with nobody able to access my terminal, was not ideal for the business. \n\nAfter forcing me to take my vacation early, and losing a chunk of my deposits, He told me to change my passwords before I go for security reasons. Welp. That is exactly what I did. I didn't leave notes(its a security system. I dont leave passwords laying around.) I didn't leave anything for his part timers to work with. I did PRECISELY as he demanded. And when I go on vacation, my work phone does not ever get turned on. I straight up left it at home. (I told him on the way out the day before, that if he has questions, ask em now. He said \" I know what I'm doing\".)\n\nApparently, while I was gone 2 weeks, his part time techs ruined the server system, destroyed my work terminal, managed to screw up and lose several clients, got my account hardlocked(was easy to fix.) And all around, cost my boss about 100k in damages/profits lost. Most of these part timer techs were fired for the amount of property damages they did. For the life of me, I can't figure out how they ruined so much tech while I wasn't around. \n\nI still don't know how he runs a business. But he stopped giving stupid requests like that.\n\nQuick edit: he also, had another master admin account i set up for him. But he lost the information I made for him, on a handy little laminated wallet card. So.....\n\nEdit 2, electric boogaloo: yes the boss still left for his vacation. He did not admit he made a mistake, and things were not fully repaired or fixed when he went on vacation. Also, I booked my vacation with him, and and made my reservations in December. He knew for months.",

She says it's fine and I'm able to get the request in, and send her an email to cover my ass.\n\nWe're nearing August, and the blackout dates are announced.

The agent in her mastery ended up saving us something like 15% off most of the holiday AND we avoided a major typhoon that would have hit us had we gone on our original date.  \nBest part is when I got back, all the upgrades were done early as we were ahead of schedule, so it was a nice ease back into the work rhythm.",

        "selftext": "Hey reddit! Not 100% sure this counts but i want to share my story\n\nI used to work in a Grocery store back in 2016, I was 16-17 at the time, (I don't work retail anymore) but i wanted to share this story i still remember to this day.\n\nIt was a pretty normal night right before the end of my shift (I was one of the few closers at my store) so it was just me, my supervisor, and a cashier (i worked the self checkout/customer service desk). My supervisor had just collected the tills and was in the back counting, and I was starting my rounds to take back the non-perishables that were left at the registers. (i also might add that our store had terrible camera placement, basically it showed all the registers, and the supervisors office door which is where the safe was, this is important later).\n\nAfter putting up all the items that were left at the registers, I did my final checks of the store to make sure there were no misplaced/damaged item on the floor, I find a case of beer that was leaking in our beer/wine section and since i wasn't sure how damaged the bottom of the cardboard case was i had to drag it to the front so i could inform my supervisor about the damaged item before taking it to the back (we kept a cart(s) full of damaged items to be taken out by the morning crew).\n\nSince the supervisors office is locked while they are counting the tills i call over to her and let her know that there was a damaged case of beer and i was taking it to the back. She responds with an absent \"Ok, sounds good.\"\n\nSo I take it to the back place it with the rest of the damaged items, and go back to the front to see if there is anything else my supervisor needs me to do before I clock out, there isn't.\n\nNext couple days are fine as I finish up the week and wait for the next weeks schedule to be posted, and I find out that I'm not scheduled for the next week, I figure there must have been a mistake as there was someone working at the same Grocery store who shared my first name. I go upstairs to my managers office and ask him about the schedule and why I wasn't scheduled.\n\nHe responds with a \"Oh, My bad I forgot to tell you that you are suspended until the investigation is over, by the way can you train \"your replacement\" today on the self checkout/customer service desk?\"\n\nMe confused and annoyed at the moment don't really pay attention to the second part of his comment ask him what he was talking about.\n\nMy Manager: \"We caught you STEALING that case of beer that you took to the back, and until the police investigation is complete you won't be working here anymore. Please turn in your uniform, name tag, and badge.\"\n\nI AM FURIOUS, but I decide that I would just go with bit of MC in this situation. \"Well \"bossman\" I took the DAMAGED case of beer to the back to be thrown out in the morning as per procedure, but since I won't be working here anymore I guess you will just have to find someone else to train \"my replacement\", since I clearly CANT be trusted.\" (I was the only person who could train someone for the Customer service desk other than him)\n\nHis. Jaw. Dropped.\n\nThe look on his face was priceless as I took off my uniform and handed him my name tag, and override card. I then proceeded to walk out get in my car and drive home.\n\nAbout 2 years later I join the army, and I'm going for a job that required a Security Clearance, Guess what shows up? That suspension with an unfinished police report and the tapes from the security camera. I sit there with my interviewer as we watch the tape together clearly showing that I did not steal ANYTHING (needless to say I was approved for my clearance). I ask if I can get a copy of the tape, and my interviewer agrees, it took 2 years but I finally had the evidence I needed to sue for wrongful termination, but as the time is well over the statute of limitation, I am unable to actually do anything about it.\n\nEither way I decide to go pay my old workplace a visit over my Christmas block leave and a couple people recognize me (including my old boss). He tells me that thieves like me aren't welcome in HIS store, and that I need to leave or he would be calling the police, I told him to call them, and that his claim would surely hold up when I showed them the copy of the video footage of me \"stealing\". (the store had one of my favorite muffins and honestly I really wanted one since they are only made there)\n\nThe police got called and did nothing and I got 3 muffins free of charge thanks to my favorite supervisor!

            "I once worked at a Grocery Store as a cashier, and had an incident where I was suspended pending investigation and it took weeks to figure out what the hell it was all about as I was an incredibly anal, meticulous, careful and hard worker. This happened well over 20 years ago and still is crystal clear in my mind due to the absolute ass-fuckery of it all. \n\nTurns out it was based off a customer complaint and threat to call the liquor board over me \"Taking a bribe to sell to a minor\"... Once I was finally able to get the details and after combing through literally a hundred plus hours of footage I was able to piece together what happened and never even got an apology or support. \n\nScenario as Follows:\n(apparently the busy body bitch that caused all the pain and frustration for me was in line behind this customer)\n\nGuy walks up to the register with 2x 40oz Old E (Malt Liquor)\n\nMe: ID Please?\n\nGuy hands me ID, I check it and show camera over my shoulder, (policy due to sketchy neighborhood) The guy is in his early 30s.\n\nMe: Thank you\n\n(Scans beers and total is $4.xx) \n\nMe: Your total is $4.xx\n\nGuy: How about $1?\n\nMe: Your total is $4.xx\n\nGuy: How about $2?\n\nMe: Sir, your total is $4.xx, if you don't have enough there's nothing I can do.\n\nGuy: Ok, ok, ok.. Here's $5.\n\nI take his money and finish the transaction. And go on about my day annoyed but none the wiser that the next customer in line decided to selectively overhear what was happening and make up their own story about it, the proceed to spend days raising hell demanding I'm fired and brought up on charges, etc over \"taking a bribe to sell alcohol to a minor\". Fuck BBB and all those self entitled meddling \"Karens\" like them.  \n\nI was 19 years old, living as a Caregiver for a T-7 Paraplegic who was my best friend at the time, and working two full time jobs to meet our needs.  We almost lost our apartment due to the loss of income during that time, as well as the pain and frustration the confusion of it all cost me and the most devastating part was the feeling of loss of trust in me as I always worked so hard to be the most dependable, hard working, and over achiever in everything I did that time.

While an 'investigation' was ongoing, I was told not to serve that customer and let my supervisor deal with him (there were only two of us in the shop).\n\nFun part came that very day. My supervisor went out to run errands, and the customer came in to buy materials for a job. I told him, sorry, can't sell you anything. He freaked out and complained to management again. Unfortunately, I was following orders. The next three times he came in, I was alone, and he couldn't buy anything.\n\nManagement finally declared the 'investigation' closed. The was no investigation, really, they just wanted the customer to think they were doing something.

I knew I hadn't done anything wrong, and spent the last hour of my shift on the verge of angry tears. I mean, there I was, 32 years old. Homeowner, been working since I was 16 without any issues, and being accused of stealing a pittance on my first day as supervisor. Because apparently I'm not only a thief, I'm stupid too. Risking my job and reputation for next to nothing. \n\nCame in the next shift a couple days later, and am told, \"Oh yeah, by the way, we found the money. No one had been able to reconcile the fried debit terminal, but the bank sorted it today and the total matched the missing money.\"\n\nShe was so excited, but weirdly didn't like when I flipped out and yelled, \"You didn't even confirm that it was missing *cash*?! You just leapt to the worst, most insulting conclusion?!\"\n\nI stormed out and went back to the corporate world. Which sucks because I loved working there. But there's no way I could've reconciled working for such absolute morons.",

Essentially I wasn't happy in my position and requested a transfer because I did not plan on staying on in my current role for another winter season. My sudden loss would hurt the people left behind and I did not want to abandon them. After no further news 3 months later there had been no further discussion I grew concerned they weren't preparing for my departure.

Basically \"know your your place\" transfer denied.\n\nAfter that I kept my head down, did my job and left it alone. And then near the time I said I would I stopped coming in, talked to HR and said I was leaving, turned in my ID badge and that was it. No exit interview or anything. Later heard it took them nearly 4 months to find a replacement.",

            "for everyone wanting a recipe here you go\n\n Ingredients \n\n2 large eggs, room temperature and separated \n\n1 and 1/3 cups (160g) all-purpose flour\\* (spoon & leveled) \n\n1/4 cup (32g) cornstarch\\* \n\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda \n\n4 teaspoons (6g) natural unsweetened cocoa powder\n\n 1/4 teaspoon salt \n\n1/4 cup (60g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature\n\n1 cup (200g) granulated sugar \n\n1/2 cup (120ml) canola or vegetable oil \n\n2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract \n\n1/2 teaspoon distilled white vinegar liquid or gel red food coloring\\* \n\n1/2 cup (120ml) buttermilk, room temperature\\* \n\ncream cheese frosting for topping\n\nPreheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Line a 12-count muffin pan with cupcake liners. This recipe makes 14 cupcakes, so you will have 2 cupcakes to bake in a 2nd batch. With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat 2 egg whites on high speed in a medium bowl until soft peaks form, about 2-3 minutes. See photo at the bottom of this post for a visual. Set aside. Sift the flour and cornstarch together to make sure it is evenly combined. Whisk this, along with baking soda, cocoa powder, and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside. Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on high speed until smooth and creamy \u2013 about 1 minute. Add the sugar and beat on high speed for 2 minutes until creamed together fairly well. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Add the oil and beat on high for 2 minutes. The butter may look \u201cpiece-y\u201d and not completely combine with the oil. This is normal and ok. Add 2 egg yolks and the vanilla. Beat on medium-high speed until combined. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Beat in the vinegar and the food coloring\u2013 until you reach your desired color. I use 2 Tablespoons. With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients in three additions alternating with the buttermilk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients, and mixing each addition just until incorporated. Do not overmix. Fold whipped egg whites into cupcake batter with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. The batter will be silky and slightly thick. (If there are still pieces of butter \u2013 and there were in 1 test batch for me \u2013 again, this is ok. They will melt inside as the cupcakes bake. Making them even more buttery.) Spoon batter into cupcake liners filling 1/2 \u2013 2/3 of the way full. Bake for 20-21 minutes or until the tops of the cupcakes spring back when gently touched and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Don\u2019t overbake; your cupcakes will dry out. Allow to cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. Prepare cream cheese frosting. Frost cooled cupcakes immediately before serving. I used a Wilton #12 tip; I don\u2019t recommend a star tip. This frosting is a little too thin.",

            "When I was younger, I was working at a family owned camp ground. I was housekeeper for the cabins. A holiday rolled around and it was a huge money maker for the campground. They were short a cashier and they knew I had experience. I had only one rule, no one but me was allowed in my til. The first few hours went by pretty good, the. The owner said that her daughter would be helping me at the desk and the register. I did not like this idea one bit. The daughter, being the owners daughter, started letting her friends run the register as well. I backed out. I didn\u2019t want shit to do with that mess. I told my boss that her daughter was letting her friends run the register and handle the money so I wasn\u2019t doing it anymore. My shift ended and I went home. The next day, when I arrived at work, my boss met me at the door telling me that the register came up short and that I was fired for stealing. I\u2019m dumbfounded. I simply told her \u201cok, I\u2019ll be here payday for my money, please have it ready\u201d. I go in a few days later to pick up my money and i was short about 100.00. I ask why and she tells me that it\u2019s to replace what I had stolen. I was furious. FURIOUS. I told her that she needed to be asking her damn crack head daughter about the missing money instead of automatically blaming someone that wasn\u2019t a member of her family. I told her I\u2019d be back in a few days for my damn money and it better be there. I go back a few days later and received an envelope with 400.00 in it. She apologized to me for wrongfully during me and blaming me. She said that the days following me being fired, the money kept coming up short and decided to ask her daughter about it. Yes, her daughter broke down and admitted to stealing the money to support hers and her husbands dope problem. My boss asked me to come back to work since her daughter or SIL was no longer employed there. I politely told her no thank you, that I\u2019d rather not work for people like her or her family. She told me to give her the extra 300.00 back that she gave me as a bonus. I told her that I\u2019d be keeping that money as settlement for the pain and suffering she caused me by wrongfully terminating me. I turned around and walked out. Never saw those horrid people again. \n\nThe daughter and SIL both had opiate addictions. I know this for a fact because my second day there, both asked me if I had anything for a headache. I offered some Tylenol but they refused. The daughter told me that they like to \u201calter their reality\u201d while working then giggled about it. Sad thing is, they had a two year old son they let just run around the camp ground. There were swimming pools but they were fenced in but the huge ass pond wasn\u2019t fenced. Not to mention all the strangers that would come through for overnight stays while traveling. Their altered state could have easily caused their son to drown or to be kidnapped.

After graduating with a business degree, she was offered a job managing one of the shoe stores. This obviously seemed like a fantastic opportunity for her first role as a graduate. She was on a probationary period for three months and after that her salary would increase, although the probationary period could be extended.\n\nShe HATED it. The owner would give her instructions and later that day his girlfriend would come in and give her opposite instructions, then criticise her for the way she had worked and micromanage her until she did it her way. The girlfriend wasn't part of the business at all but SIL didn't want to cause any issues, so didn't argue. However, it was causing her a lot of stress; I noticed she lost quite a bit of weight. It came to a bit of a head when SIL had spent a few hours sorting the filing out, then went to the shop to serve customers. When she went back to finish the filing, girlfriend had gone through it all and messed it up, saying she'd organised it differently for her, wasting hours of SIL's time and causing her more work.\n\nSIL suspected they were going to extend her probationary period to screw her over, even though she was doing a great job despite being sabotaged and micromanaged. Her staff loved her and sales were higher. So she started looking for another job. Surprise, they extended her probationary period but she found a job paying more and 10 minutes from her flat. They wanted her to work ASAP but she was sure she had to work her notice period, which was 6 weeks. She asked me to read her contract to see if I can confirm. The notice was indeed 6 weeks...except for staff on probation. Either party could terminate with one weeks notice.\n\nSIL tells owner she's quitting and giving one weeks notice. Owner is caught on the hop and can't find another manager that quickly. Tells SIL her notice period is six weeks, to which she takes great delight in pointing out that her probationary period has been extended and the required notice is one week.\n\nSIL has been at the new job for quite a while now and is much happier.\n\nEdit: Lots of people saying you can quit when you want. I should have clarified that we're in the UK (some of you have correctly sussed that out), where contracts can be enforced.\n\nWhat could they do if she was contracted to a longer notice period and refused to work it? It's never happened to me or anyone I know but the internet tells me they could theoretically bill her for the cost difference to bring someone in to cover the remaining notice period, although this could be costly and unlikely.\n\nReally enjoying the puns, trying to get through and give everyone an up vote \ud83d\ude42",

I said fair enough.  \n\n6 months go by and the client is relocating me and my colleagues who got to stay from a kind of proof-of-concept demo team that was self sufficient to a live production team.    \n\nI tell my employer that I am ready to negotiate my pay and they tell me that because I'm changing team that counts as a new contract and my trial is extended 6 months so the pay stays.  I told my manager that it's not a good way to do business to trick me into thinking I can renegotiate my pay and then say I can't, she proceeds to tell me that I can quit if I don't like it.  \n  \nSo I did, a month later. Got a job lined up and handed in my 2 weeks, The client was quite angry because they were \"invested\" in me since they had moved me to a production team with real employees and \"intended\" to hire me at some point.

            "At the end of the 1970s, I was substitute teaching when a teacher quit at the end of the third week of school. They asked me to fill in on a daily basis until they found a replacement since it was my license area. I asked to be considered for the position which they agreed to.\n\nIn my US state, schools can only use subs to fill an empty position for 15 days before they must put them on a temporary contract an pay full teacher salary (and benefits). I taught the last week of September, all of October, and into November still being paid at sub pay. And the principal wasn't being very supportive. Apparently he had wanted to hire a friend but was told he couldn't. I think lack of support for the teacher that started the school year is why he quit at the end of the third week with no notice.\n\nSometime before Thanksgiving (second half of November) something came up (don't remember now) with the principal that flipped my switch. I'd been accepting all the crap because I was hoping to get the position. Now I didn't care. I mentioned to another teacher that this was my last day as a sub, that I wouldn't be coming back. Lo and behold, at lunch time the principal arrives with a temporary contract for the rest of the school year. \n\nI caved and signed. Still no support from the principal (as compared to the other 17 teachers in the building) but full teacher pay and benefits.

Many places send them to you and ask you to sign and send back, try and 'forget' to do this, they often forget themselves and you've got a much stronger case if you decide to just walk out. (Keep the contract and sign your own copy, so if they claim later not to have it, in order to try and swindle you, you can say you sent it back so they must have lost it, there's nothing they can do about that, the burden of proof is on them, not you)\n\nEven with a contract, companies won't sue you to enforce a notice period. There no point, it'll cost them more than its worth, in time spent preparing, attending court, sending letters etc and it's very unlikely they'd win. If they're saving \u00a32000 by not paying you for the notice period, they might only be out of pocket by a few hundred quid if they have to hire someone else.  Unless you're the CEO on a major salary and you'll cause huge financial loss of contracts, they'll just absorb the costs. (A shop, for example, will just move staff around for a bit).",

            "Every time I read one of these I can't help but feel there is another side to the story.\n\n\nPersonally, I have extended someone's probationary period as they were overly confident about their abilities while making fundamental errors and jeopardising relationships. This person did not react well to any feedback I provided. Still, I could see some potential, and she was expecting a child, so instead of letting her go I extended her probation and worked on a development plan with her. She was not receptive to the plan I put in place. Finally, she ended up burning bridges with some clients in a colossal outburst to a point where she was unable to do her job. At that point her contract was terminated. I can't help but feel like her version would be very similar to what OP has posted. This person thew alogations around, saying that I had orchestrated the whole thing and that extending their probation was my plan to get rid of her. If you really want to get rid of someone during probation period you can, you don't even need a reason to do so. I extended her probation in the hopes that she could learn and grow. I put my neck out in front of my own managers and extended probation against their recommendation of immediate termination at the end of her first probation period. \n\n\nSaying something like \"sales were higher\", and \"her staff loved her\", would be exactly what my example would have said. Unfortunately, a periodolical uplift in sales does not unpick a severely fractured relationship with a key client. Reactive sales and team building are basics/quick wins. Strong business planning and relationship building with zero immediate uplift is preferred IMO. learning the fundamentals and ropes to ensure future growth and success are fundamental to owning any career. My example did not show any belief in the latter.\n\n\nI have no idea what your SIL's experience was like, so no disrespect intended.

There was a new department manager after I'd stepped down from that position, from too much stress and a lack of support from upper management.\n\nA little about the new manager, she was a nice enough lady, but perhaps more ill-suited to the position than I had been. I was helping her learn the ropes of how our department worked. All fine except for a major inability to self-solve, which led me to turning my phone off outside of my working hours. She'd call me constantly in a panic with minor questions that plenty of other people in-store could have answered.\n\nThe store manager was an all-stick-and-no-carrot kind of person, who treated every question and issue as an inconvenience. She was a nightmare to work for even if she *liked* you, many good people quit when she took over our store. Myself included, after about 6 months. I'd worked for that company for 10 years.\n\nThere was one particular day, where we were already going to be short on staff and it was a busy shopping day (Thursday - pension day). I needed to leave by a certain time in the afternoon (lets say 3pm) for an important doctors appointment. I'd given plenty of notice but the day before I was told I couldn't go. It was too late to reschedule without being charged the entire appointment fee.\n\nCue whining from DM: But I *neeeeeeed* you, it's so busy and I don't have enough cover! What's this appointment for anyway?!\n\nMe: It's an important doctors appointment. I'm not telling you any more because last time I shared with you, the whole store knew my personal business.\n\nDM: But what am I supposed to do?!\n\nMe: I don't know, you're the manager.\n\nCue later in the day, I'm summoned into the store managers office. I'm informed in no uncertain terms, that I am *not allowed* to leave early on this day, because the department is short staffed and they need me. Being a meek little thing I bend to my store managers will. I say \"Okay\" and shuffle off with my head down.\n\nNow, I'm understandably upset, my fragile mental state is in tatters. I feel that this is all really unfair and somehow wrong, so I call the only resource I have: The union.\n\nI'm crying and explain the situation to the kind lady on the phone. Now because there was never any paperwork submitted for leaving early (normally rearranging shifts etc was done verbally then updated in the roster), there wasn't anything she could do in an official capacity. But then she threw me a lifeline.\n\n\"You're going to the doctor anyway, right? You're within your rights to take a sick day, get your doctor to write you a note. They can't force you to come in, you can't get in trouble for it, and they will have to pay you for it.\"\n\nSo that's what I did. I did as I was told - I didn't leave early. I called in sick and just didn't show up at all. Instead of losing 1-2 hours of staffed hours, they lost a whole day for being unreasonable bullies.\n\nThe next day I heard all about how the department was chaos. I felt bad but it also felt good to set a boundary with these people that were taking advantage of my good nature.\n\n\n**TLDR** Told I can't leave early for important doctors important. So I don't, take entire day off paid instead.",

We were told that they couldn't have the manager written up because it was my word against his and there was complications with the managers and supervisors jobs and it would look like I was slating him so my stepdad could keep his job.\n\nWe were advised however to go to the doctor's and get a sick note for mental health, for stress from being over worked and not having proper breaks, from bullying in the work place etc. The doctor signed him off for 6 weeks initially, which the store paid full pay, then the doctor was still unhappy so he signed him off for another month, which again the store paid full sick, as they didn't want my step dad to report them for the mistreatment of employees.\n\nThey couldn't contact him at home because he was off sick and they could be done for harrasment. He was in the middle of fighting for his job, so he trained for another one in that time off.

None of this leave was excessive or terribly frequent, however it was enough to trigger the manager. They then insisted that i was to provide a sick note irregardless of the amount of time taken. So, instead of taking a day off to feel better I would have to make an appointment, get dressed and travel to the surgery to waste the doctors time just for a note.

They contacted me and asked me to design and build a new website for her business. I gave them a quote and they asked if they could pay in three instalments. After we all agreed to the terms, I had written approval and I received my 33% deposit, I got cracking. \n\nWe had regular check-ins and they were happy with the progress until one day they just went quiet. They were already behind on the second payment and I was growing impatient. I was done with the site and just needed final approval and payment before launching it but I couldn\u2019t get hold of either of them. I eventually got hold of the lady at her day job after weeks of being ghosted. She calmly told me that they found someone cheaper and that they won\u2019t be paying the remaining 66% even though the project was complete and all their feedback was addressed. She told me that I could just give her 33% the files and move on with my life. I made it clear that websites don\u2019t really work if you only upload 33% of the files, sarcastically, at which point she hung up the phone. \n\nI still had their ftp details for their brand domain that housed their current (old) website, so I decided to take revenge. I created a page with an animated, fake loading bar that was stuck at 33%. Underneath the loading bar was the message: \u201cThis company does not pay their suppliers. They decided to pay only a third of the price so now they have only a third of a website.\u201d\n\nI went as far as to download the website files, split it up in roughly three portions (file size), and upload a zip folder containing a third of the files to the ftp folder. This way I actually gave them the 33% they paid for and I could show the file size to prove it. \n\nI also permanently deleted the old site\u2019s files from the folder so they couldn\u2019t restore from a backup.

The building was essentially a tin building on the job site where my grandma and I (the only two office workers besides my grandfather who was the foreman) worked.  \n\nBasically when the new hires would come in that had missed the initial hiring round I was the one that would make sure all their paperwork was in order and that they had all of their OSHA classes finished, and if any safety training hadn't been done I would just put in the VHS and confirm on a written copy that they had finished it \"under my instruction\".\n\nThis went on for two months with no issue until one fateful day, a regular Florida Man (record and all) came in as a new hire and came to my office to finish his new hire paperwork.  Once he was in my office I found he had no safety training to speak of and I informed him his next day or two would be spent in my office watching safety videos (all of this was paid of course).\n\nHe immediately flew into a rage, screaming about how he wouldn't \"have some little girl teaching him how to do his job\", which again I was a 17 year old female (at the time, I now identify as non-binary), and was only going through company standards and OSHA rules with him.\n\nI went to my grandfather who was my boss at the time obviously very confused and uncomfortable and unsure of how I should proceed.  To which my grandfather said, \"You wanna fire him?\u201d\n\nCue my excitement, my grandfather follows me to my office and I, as a 17 year old, get to fire this grown ass man sitting in front of me.  I start directing him to gather his things and leave and he starts up a huge fit, yelling and cursing at me, before he noticed my grandfather standing in the door with his gun holstered on his hip (my grandfather usually kept this locked in a safe on the ground or in his truck, I hadn't realized until after he'd pulled it out just for me) and very quietly then he got up and left.\n\nThe most satisfying moment of my life.\n\nEdit: Changed queue to \u201ccue\u201d, sorry y\u2019all I wrote this drunk at 3AM.\n\nEditEdit: Enough with the transphobia please, obviously gender has a lot to do with this story so I just wanted to include that I identify differently now.",

        "selftext": "So, I have a Karen for a neighbor. She's a grumpy old C with a live in son in his 40s and no other family or friends. And when I say she's a Karen we're talking to the point that she came into my property to yell at our landscaper about a boulder he was installing... on our property (something about believing it would fall over... onto more of our property...)\n\nA few months after we moved in we receive a letter trying the HOA saying they'd received complaints and asking that we make sure we're mowing watering and maintaining. I chalked it up to moving into a nicer neighborhood and made an effort to mow twice a week instead of my normal once, added a little time to the sprinklers, and figured all was good...\n\nApparently it was not all good as we received another letter stating the complaints had continued and the HOA wanted to talk with us to see what the problem was. \n\nI should note, we had just moved in not that long ago, and hadn't landscaped the back yet so were letting our dogs pee on the front at night, which lead to the inevitable patches of bright green grass that grow stupid fast. Now I'll freely admit I don't keep my yard to the level of some of my neighbors, but it was in perfectly good shape outside some green spots in an otherwise average looking yard and I do my best to keep things mowed and looking decent.\n\nTurns our grumpy C had taken real offense to this and started complaining to the HOA. The \"hearing ended up bring mostly incoherent rambling, but the bottom line was she didn't like how our lawn looked with the green spots...\n\nWhile the HOA agreed this was not her business and definitely not theirs, I decided she was right and we should stop letting our dogs out in the front to pee as I also don't like the green spots. Now, I put them on the leash and let them do their business in her yard (read: tree lawn). And I'm clearly not the only one as her entire yard is now COVERED in pee spots and dead spots on her actual lawn which my dogs don't step for on. I'm pretty sure she's complained about everyone with a dog, and now the entire neighborhood takes their dogs to her yard.\n\nThe best part, she actually does a shit job taking care of her lawn, weeds and crab grass everywhere, she just waters it almost non stop. So today I got to report her to the HOA for her yard looking like total shit. If it were any other house (there are much worse) I wouldn't care at all, but this lady wanted lawns without spots so I'm just doing my part to enforce her rules...\n\nEDIT : to everyone hating on HOAs - they're hit and miss for sure but in this case THEY didn't do anything but tell me someone complained and then tell her I wasn't violating any rules and they weren't going to be involved... Also, HOAs are often surprisingly easy to take over, you just have to skip the whining about how terrible they are and do the work instead. If the HOA is that bad, talk to some neighbors, tell them you're going to run for the board, and get them to vote for you. Then, help others do the same... and remember what you hated about the previous board. Be forewarned, everyone finds a reason to complain, no one is will to help out...\n\nEDIT 2 : for everyone about green grass from dog pee... Urea -> ammonium -> nitrogen for plants... If you don't water it stays concentrated in one area, killing the grass. If you do water (or just spray the spot with a hose quickly) it's diluted and gives the grass a big boost of \"organic\" nitrogen fertilizer",

This means that when vehicles access the alley they manoeuvre as close as possible to my house.\n\nDo you think if I cultivate a particularly tough and scratchy piece of vegetation they will swop sides?\n\nCan anyone recommend a plant (one that does not damage foundations/brickwork etc) but is resilient enough to deter trucks and vans?",

She took pictures of a work truck entering the site five minutes before the permitted time, which resulted in us getting fined $250 by the HOA.

So some people finally got pissed and ran for the board, and won because they just showed up with 20 neighbors and out voted the karens.  Their first action was to change the bylaws to just follow country rules, dropped fees to just over minimum to handle common areas, then changed the voting structure to require a quorum of 51% of the voting block to be present to vote in any new bylaws.  So in essence  you're going to have to get 140 homeowners to show up on a tuesday night to vote in any new rules.  That's not going to happen. \n\nThe three board member dudes just sit around drinking on their meeting days, and laughing at the complaint letters that come in, and sending out form letters that say, not in our rules, call the county code inspector.",

The nighbourhood is awesome and the people are friendly and everyone's dogs like to play together happily. Our yard is mostly moss so we pay it little mind. So much more content without one!",
            "I hope you all then complained to the HOA about all the bright green spots on her lawn.",
            "You must have a superdog or you are doing some amazing diet management. You say that your dog peed in your front yard and you have patches of overgrown grass. Yet when the same dog peed in her yard, the grass died there. How?",
            "Five years ago I moved from an HOA that charged ~$1000 per year. The only perk I knew of we garbage pick up. The PGA level golf course, marina, pool, clubhouse and tennis courts were extra. They also charged you yearly for the tag to enter th community, paved the roads only once in 15 years (the length of time I lived there), snownplowing was spotty, especially since the drivers had a side for  (with HOA property) to plow non HOA neighborhoods for a fee. Reported with proof and was told to stop trying to cause problems. Everything on the exterior of the house was controlled and even doing repairs/ maintenance required a $50 application fee and approval. Can you guess why I detest HOAs? \n\nAnd yes, I did try to join the board and change things from within, but the board was rum by those who could afford the million dollar homes on the lake. Guess who threw money around to win and who didn't have that kind of capital?",
            "When a neighbour complaint is so bad the HOA side with you",
            "You can report someone based on how their front yard looks? That's so first world lol",
            "Finally someone understands HOAs",
            "Shouldn't be cutting your lawn so often it isn't for biodiversity. Once a month if that.",
            "My HOA covers the maintenance of all outside areas. If it didn't, id be like, \"wtf am I even paying for?\"",
            "I dont understand people who choose to buy a house with rules. I think people who go to an HOA have a fetish of being bossed around.",
            "Everybody is always quick to bitch about HOAs without looking into any of the positives, or even bothering to consider when one could be a \u201cgood\u201d investment. I live in a small, secluded suburb in the country that\u2019s main housing network is a bunch of attached townhomes, usually 6 per \u201cblock\u201d. My HOA takes care of all lawn work, trees/flowers, removing snow and ice in the winter, repaving of roads, roof repair, deck maintenance/staining, etc\u2026 I\u2019ve been living here for 2 years and have never even seen anyone associated with the board. My HOA fees are $200 a month, which I consider a small price to pay for all the stuff they do through the year that I don\u2019t have to waste my time/money on. Also it\u2019s nice to know I\u2019m supporting my neighbors in the event something happened to their homes. We just had multiple blocks need a roof repair, which out of pocket would have cost these people thousands of dollars, all of which was done for free using our dues. My HOA dues, mortgage, taxes, and utilities all come out to less a month than a single months rent would be in the city for a two bedroom apartment that is half the size of my townhome. I live in a well manicured area, with tons of green space, and my property value has gone up nearly $20,000 since I bought it. Best investment I ever made. The best thing you can do is your own research into a community, call and ask for their community guidelines, talk to neighbors if you\u2019re considering moving there, etc\u2026. Don\u2019t miss out on a perfect place to live because of some Internet stereotypes/ echo chambers.",
            "Sorry but this belongs in /r/AmItheAsshole , I don't agree with your neighbor at all but taking your dog to do its business in her yard makes you no better (and quite frankly worse) than her.",
            "Why would ANYONE buy a house with an HOA? Unless you're doing something extremely dangerous or incommodating, no one should be able to manage what you do on your property... Jeez.",
            "This definitely went a different way than I expected, but I always love some poetic justice.\n\nAlso, PSA: If an HOA is giving you too much shit for a change on your property, get a HAM radio license and install a radio tower in your yard. It's a federal law that every citizen is allowed full access to the radio, so they can't stop you and it'll be a good bargaining chip to get them off your back.",
            "I get the sense that people who buy into HOA's haven't ever resolved their elementary school issues.",
            "Why in the ever-loving fuck do people live in areas with HOAs, aside from the obvious reason of why they were created in the first place...",
            "This is why I will never live in an HOA. Never have, never will. My money, my house.",
            "That's some petty shit to bring your dog to pee on her lawn. Who's the bigger man here? Nobody.",
            "Mowing twice weekly!? Fuck HOA",
            "I don't go about trying to force people to maintain their lawns to my own standards, but if I saw you letting your dog piss on my lawn, I'd poison my grass.",
            "[removed]",
            "God damn i would become an arsonist if i lived in one of these things.",
            "If I ever looked at buying a place that had a HOA I would ask for a reduction in Price based on 20 years of HOA dues and maintenance.",
            "This is exactly why I refuse to move into ANY property covered by an HOA.  The original intention was likely good but you never know when a nosey busybody with nothing better to do than tell you how to maintain your property will make life hell for you.  We don't need to codify, \"don't be a dick,\" into a formal, binding contract.  And if you feel we do, then maybe you're the problem...",
            "Home Owners Associations are a fucking menace.",
            "lawns should not even be a thing",
            "In fighting Karen you\u2019ve become Karen",
            "You couldn\u2019t pay me to live in a HOA",
            "I like how your defense of HOAs is that, sure they're a bit annoying, but what you can do is take that minor annoyance and feed it your entire life. You are the HOA now. Everything is HOA.",
            "Dude, your explanation of how to win the HOA is exactly why HOAs suck",
            "The bright green patches of grass are not from where your dogs pee...those are the brown spots...I'll let you contemplate grass, fertilizer and the like too figure out the green spots..\n\nEdit for your edit: thats not how that works..."
