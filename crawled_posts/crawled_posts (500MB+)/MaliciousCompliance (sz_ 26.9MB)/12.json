        "selftext": "Hello everyone, this is my first post here and wanted to share my greatest work story. My native language isn't English, so please excuse when my grammar is a bit simple.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe story starts with me and my company, I'm a 30-year-old businesswoman who works in an IT service in a bank space. I'm the girl for everything basically, but I'm a specialist for first level support, administration and backup, sometimes even networking.\n\nEven when I'm not head of my it department, I'm basically had all the responsibilities of them, but unfortunately my pay grade doesn't reflect that at all. I think of my Boss of my IT department as kinda lazy if not incompetent, he even brags about getting so much money for basically doing nothing.\n\nI have a 40-hour week, but since the whole IT department is my responsibility I need to keep track of the servers and maybe problems that can occur 24/7, this is mostly done via emails. When the server status gives out a warning or a failure, I will get notified, and then I'm fixing the problem over remote desktop or going to the company itself (even in my free time). I wouldn't mind this, but I'm not getting paid for this, but on the other hand, I'm getting punished when something is going wrong.\n\nMy Bosses Boss wasn't that much better. Since it was a fancy Bank, everyone should be in a suit the whole time, to let it look professional, best with a skirt and high heels. Only problem is when you work in the first level support  you need to do a lot of \"behind the scenes\" work, like slipping under the desk to do or repair cable management, doing work on the server rack and doing lots of other activities that makes you dirty. You can imagine that this worn out my business clothes really, really fast and not only that, they were so impractical and really made my work harder. So I changed my clothes to a comfy Hoody and work pants to fit the work I'm doing a bit better. When my Boss saw me, he was furious, demanded I can't look like \"a poor hobo\" inside his bank. I told him that I demand work clothes for both occasions because they are expensive and gets worn out quickly. He refused, and I wasn't really happy about this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo this, so much for the introduction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSomeday, my Bosses Boss (head of the whole company) called me.\n\nHe had a plan. He wanted to create \"quiet hours\", means he didn't want his employees working on weekends to let them rest properly. *(At first glance, you could say : Hey, that's a nice idea. Yeah.... no, he just didn't like to pay them for overwork, because he got in some legal trouble with overwork paying in general. Not only that, some employees have strict deadlines and need the extra time to get work done.)*\n\nTo actively ensure nobody can't work over the weekend, he wanted the following : \"Please make sure NO ONE can access their emails and remote desktop over the weekend, no exceptions!\"\n\nSince we had a ticket system and be able to attach emails to tickets, I ask him to write and official work task. *(this has two reasons. First, I like everything documented. Second, I have a something to protect and secure myself if the task I was giving is incorrect. And it's exactly this that saved me)*\n\nSo I was in my office desk again, thinking how to get the task done and what implication it will have and then... it was clear to me what it meant!\n\nThe email came from my Boss with the Task and indeed he wrote :  \"for EVERYONE, NO EXCEPTIONS\".\n\nI was thinking to myself : Should I write them, the implications it would have? After thinking, I thought of how I am treated as a worker and I... decided against it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was working immediately at this task and made an automated process to block every access to emails after Friday 6PM to Monday 6AM.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWeekend came, and it was Saturday, and I was calm relaxed because if you have not noticed by now, by cutting down EVERYONE's emails, means of course... that I don't receive any updates on the Servers. I can't possibly work on it because my remote access is also cut, of course. *(IF you think : You could forward your work email address to your private address, no I can't because we have a very strict data protection. Nothing is allowed to go out.)* I'm happy!\n\nIt's still Saturday, middle of the day, I'm cooking myself and my husband a nice meal and my telephone rings, it's my Bosses Boss!\n\nHe talks with a stressed voice and told me that he can't access his emails. I needed a second to process this, but I responded : \"That doesn't surprise me at all, since you ordered me to cut EVERYONE's email access, without exceptions\". He was angry, very angry, and told me that this obviously doesn't count for him. I told him that he specifically told me that they are NO exceptions, and he stated EVERYONE. He then argued that this wasn't how he phrased it, so I reread him his own email. After that, he was silent for a moment. He noticed his flaw in his logic. I broke the silence and ask him : \"Sir, if you still want access to your emails on the weekend, that's no problem, please send me a request per email and I work on first thing on Monday.\" A bit angry again, he replied that he wants to have it done immediately, and I calmly explained to him that I can't do this, since my remote access is also blocked, like he ordered. He hanged up...\n\n10 minutes later, he calls me again. He asks me calmly if I can fix the problem right now when he pays me for my overwork. He also wants me to be available at any time (means I should receive my emails and be able to remote work)  and that this will raise my pay grade by a lot. I thought that this is the perfect opportunity. I agree to that condition and pay raise, but only when my coworkers and I finally get work clothes. He agreed.\n\nSince then my work situation drastically improved and mostly only because I Maliciously complied, well aware of the consequences of the given task.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit : Thank you so much for all your comments and love, I'm glad you liked it!\n\nEdit2 : I want to add something here to the 4 types of comments.\n\n\\- To the people with positive comments and their own stories : Thank you so much, I had no idea this would blow up this much.\n\n\\- To the people who complain about my English : Yes, I'm German, not a native speaker. I'm giving my best here and I'm trying to improve on it every day, that's all I can do.\n\n\\- To the people with hateful comments : If you don't like it, that's totally fine, but there's no need of sharing insults, really. In my honest opinion, it was a valuable lesson for my boss to let them have a well though concept before giving the official task.\n\n\\- To the people who don't believe and say it's bullshit : I'm not here to convince you, if I can reach even one person to empower them to improve their work condition then that's a complete win in my eyes",

We did a lot of work that required taking down servers for maintenance after hours to reduce impact to +5K users.  The next day we took down the customer billing servers for patching.  Almost immediately the helpdesk got slammed with calls.  We got called into the boss's office and we were asked why the billing system was down.  We told him we had to patch the servers.  Since we can't do it after hours, we had to do it during the day.  The no overtime policy was reversed immediately.",

            "I'm reminded of a story I read about two decades ago, when smartphones weren't as much a thing as they're now. Some company was about to perform some major upgrades to their servers.\n\nA week beforehand, they sent out emails stating that come next Thursday (or whatever day), workers were to save their work before noon and log off.\n\nThe day before, a reminder email was sent and on Big Upgrade Day another email was sent at 11am: within the hour, all workers were to save their work and shut down their computers.\n\nNoon comes to pass. Then 1pm, 2pm, 3pm... No word from the IT department, so the protagonist of this story finally decides to give them a call. \"Hi there. Just wondering how much longer this upgrade is going to take. Will we be able to resume work today or should I just head home?\"\n\nThe IT clerk on phone duty that day responded with the legendary counter question of: \"didn't you read the email?\"\n\n\"No. I've shut down my office computer as per your instructions. With no office computer to access my office email, how do you imagine I would have gotten your email?\"",

This was a military base, no amount of cleaning will get machine shops clean enough to crawl around in a suit. \n\nThey made it one call before getting pissed their suit was dirty and said wear what you want as long as you wear a polo shirt",

            "I had them pull that workplace dress crap on me once before.  They called me to an office 6 hours away to help virtualize the server room there.  They have an expert coming in and we are there for grunt labor.  Urg.  So the expert is delayed by two days and they want us to work remotely back at my home office, and OK I can do some things hands off but not everything, but the real kicker was when the director came in and tried to bitch us out for being in casual street clothing.  Um, we were supposed to be moving stuff around in the server room, you know, on the floor and all that.  Even worse was I knew more about what we were doing that the hired gun.  I have no idea where they found him but he was pretty useless.  The good news was we got it done on time and it worked as expected.  So well that they sent me off to do the rest of the US offices along with the local IT people there.  I had been working with some of these people for many years and it was fun getting to see them all and spend some time hanging out.  Also I had a pretty free hand in the budget and broke the rules a bit.  We worked late and called out for pizza and kept it cheap, but when we were done I took the guys and they spouses out for a bice dinner.  It did not cost more than going out for a nice dinner every night, but it really brought the team together.  I am sure management was not happy but the job was getting done on time and on budget.  And it was kind of fun living like the sales guys do.  They have no rules, as long as they are selling...",

            "I love those moments!  When I was working at a car dealership, I entered the finance deals to the bank.  I was told to follow the form to the letter, no exceptions!  Had a manager drop a form off, all hot under the collar because it was an important deal.  I noticed that the downpayment was written down as only $100, when I was pretty sure I'd overheard the down payment was $10k.  So I started to ask for clarification, and he got ultra rude and pissy.  \"Just fucking enter the deal!\"\n\nSo I did.  Exactly as written.  Surprise, surprise, the deal was instantly rejected, and we had to resubmit the whole thing, which is 1. time consuming, and 2. dings the customer's credit twice.  So he was pissed, and almost wound up not taking the car at all.\n\nOh did I love dosing out that humble pie.  The manager was much more subdued afterward, and if I asked for clarification, I got it without question after that.",

            "This is beautiful. Not because of the malicious compliance, but because you seem like a genuinely nice person.

            "sometimes when they want to fuck around, you have to let them find out. I had a boss like that as well, who thought he knew way better than everyone and routinely fucked himself over.\n\nMy favorite story: ive been swamped in the field because im busy fixing mistakes made by the rotating door of field technicians we had, which was preventing us from closing out projects. My actual job was to be in the office doing system design schematics, BOM writeups, proposals, system programming, etc. So for about 2 weeks straight my email is closed and my tool belt is on as I'm trying to unfuck about 4 different job sites in 3 different states at once.\n\nApparently the business is such a ponzi scheme that me being in the field for 2 weeks and not putting together BOM's and proposals meant we were going underwater. Rather than hiring a subcontractor to come do the field work, he decides \"i know way better than nivek_c, hes really the reason none of these systems work,\" so he draws up a BOM for an AV system upgrade and sells it to the customer... without reviewing their existing schematics or drawing up one to go with the BOM he put together.\n\nA week later he drops the BOM on my desk and goes \"draw this\", i say \"ok, proposal too?\" He responds with \"no i did all that, proposal is signed and this is bought. make it work and dont bother me unless its an emergency, im going to my cabin\"\n\nSo I start reviewing the existing systems drawings and our BOM to see what we're adding and what the system needs to do, and I realize the boss has made a HUGE error. Hes omitted 4x proprietary cards that are needed for the video switcher matrix to support the additional inputs and outputs hes adding, these retail for between 8,000 to 12,000 each and he needs the expensive ones. We have to either eat the cost on these or start deleting stuff from the existing system, which will put us outside of scope of work and cause many missed deliverables.\n\nSo to make the ending short; I call him, hes pissed im bothering him, I explain hes fucked up and this projects 48k in the red before we have even purchased a single piece of equipment, he starts screaming at me about how its my fault because i wasnt in the office when he needed me and **literally throws his cellphone through the drywall**. (note: he actually made it a rule that I and the sales person couldnt actually sell a proposal unless there were team reviewed schematics to go with it. He broke his own rule on this one).\n\nI made it about 2 more weeks there before my psychiatrist put me on TDI for severe depression, rapid weight loss, insomnia, and generalized anxiety. Guy was a raging alcoholic with a napolean complex and likely some personality disorders so my psychiatrist really did me a favor there",

        "selftext": "This all started December of last year and just finished last week.\n\nSo bought a car from one of those buy here and pay here places. I love the \"car\" it's a Mazda 5 from 2014, basically the smallest minivan I've ever seen.\n\nWell on Christmas we drove to some family for dinner and celebration. When we went to leave the car would not start.\n\nWe checked everything and found out the horn wasn't even connected, any fuse that wasn't absolutely needed was simply missing and the tires were thr original tires...\n\nBeyond that we hooked up to the computer and it read several errors but the one getting in the way was the immobilizer. I had never known the van had one.\n\nI called AAA and set up towing but because we were in the middle of nowhere AAA couldn't get a tow truck to us under our membership (free) so we had to call a tow truck and then submit the bill to AAA after the fact.\n\nSo family let us borrow their car and the van was towed to a shop. A few days later and the shop calls and tell us what's wrong.  I live in texas, a single party consent state and i record all my calls thanks to an app on my phone. The long list if car issues isn't important,  the point of this van is a basic work van. The only issue they found stopping it from running is the immobilizer is active and they can't touch it without talking to the dealer. \n\nI 3way call the dealership and the shop and we talk for 17.43 minutes during this call the dealership acknowledged we were not behind and everything should be working unless it malfunctioned. The dealership also gave permission for the shop to bypass it and we would be reimbursed the towing and repairs.\n\nAll the shop needed to do to get the van running was bypass the immobilizer and a couple days later we picked up the can and paid the bill.\n\nBoth bills came to just under $300 and we started calling the dealership.  The first few conversations go well and the phone rep seem interested in helping. but mostly I end up getting tossed around from department to department and then disconnected. \n\nThat went on for some time and I of course took to reddit to find out options. As almost always happens reddit users know some crazy facts and how to get stuff done.\n\nSo I followed their advice and kept calling eventually getting to a supervisor and the first supervisor said he'd get it taken care of and we ended the call. Two more days go by and nothing is heard. \n\nSo I call back, get tossed around and then get another manager who says \"we are not responsible for mechanical issues and hangs up. I call back now quite annoyed and eventually get back to the same manager. I explain I have all the information and call recordings including the repair shop 3way call.\n\nHe cuts me off and says \"what, are you going to take us to court over $296.47, I don't think so but go ahead and sue. We will Win and if that small amount is worth suing to you, you probably don't have the resources to actually sue.\" \n\n\nThis of course made me quite upset. So off to a justice of the peace and explain what's happened.  They give us a small claims form and explain the process.  We can fill it out and pay for a constable to serve the dealership or fill out the paper and take it to the dealership unfiled and explain everything to a manager in person. \n\nWe chose the cheaper route because the manager on the phone was right, we didn't have the money to have it served, only filed. So we transcribed the phone calls. Found out how to fill out the paper, the hardest part was finding the agent, we didn't know what that meant but we again turned to reddit and learned. We gathered the bills and all the paperwork and made our way to the dealerships payment center.\n\nI wait in line and see the name of the manager is the same as the manager on the phone that told me to sue. I wait in line and when it's my turn I ask to talk to John and he comes over and sits across from me, after making introductions and I confirm it's the same guy I start to explain the situation again.\n\nAs I'm explaining I see when he recalls talking to me on the phone.  Se starts to dismiss me and I explain that he asked me to sue and I'm here with all my evidence and the unfixed suit. Giving him one final chance.\n\nHe starts to look over the papers and asked if I still had the recordings. I said yes, I could email him a copy.  We sit and talk for about an hour as he reads, then I sat with a slight aggravated tone, if something isn't done today not only am I going to head right back to the courthouse and file as well tack on as much for emotional distress and whatever else the clerk hinted at. (The clerk was very open mouthed with \"ideas\") as well as send a copy of everything to every email on the corporate website.\n\nAt this our conversation drew the attention of a woman in a power suit who rushes over for a recap. I find out she's John's bosses bosses boss and she's none too happy about how far things have gone. \n\nShe assured me that all would be made right and gave me her cell number and email I gave her the papers and left.\n\nThe next Monday at 8:00am I got a call asking if credit being applied to the account would be acceptable.  I say yes and she explains they will credit $500 to the account as payments (the payments are only $155 every two weeks)\n\nI agree and we talk for a few minutes when I ask why it took this much just to get things done. She laughed and said \"it shouldn't have and certain people are no longer employed at the company\"\n\nWell today was Wednesday and the day of the payment but when I went to make the payment it was already done.

Handle all of the paperwork and go about our life. The van served its purpose, and a few years later when we no longer needed it we went to sell it.

And come to find out that the dealership never turned in the title change paperwork that they were supposed to. But they did put their standard lien on the title as if we were financing. So we go to the dealership and realize it's a new company and have to track down the previous owner.\n\nWell he just flat out refuses to sign anything, even though we have all of the other paperwork, bill of sale, everything.

I have no doubt given how they treated you that the dealership bilked you on the value of the Mazda. Given your income situation, I am confident they hit you with the \"What really matters at the end of the day is how much you're writing that check out to monthly\" line when you asked about price, right?

They probably got it on trade in for like $1000 from someone else they were screwing over.\n\n$155 every two weeks is about 4.1k per year. (edit for math correction) Mazda 5 from 2014 MSRP is like 14k if it's low mileage and good condition. For the amount of hardship they put you through, and the amount you ended up having to pay to AAA/other towers, $500 credit towards your payments is a fucking robbery, especially considering those payments are probably inflated.\n\n**And having worked used cars, I guarantee you 10000000000% that the \"girlboss\" upper management knew all about this at every step of the way.** You don't end up in finance in a dealership without being cheapskate that counts every single penny the dealership spends. I would bet you my paycheck for next month that if you show up randomly at that dealership in like 2 weeks that sales manager who was being a dick to you will be still working there.",

Long story short, there's over 20 people who had similar experience at this dealer. They would walk in, ask to test drive a car, be told yes or no depending the car and come back to a pre-arranged contract over MSRP.\n\nThis experience was for a 2021 WRX premium and the dealer didn't test drive. There was no mention of this over text or the 3 calls I had with them earlier in the day. The sales rep had a predrawn up contract for $44k (sales price was 41k with tax, title, reg), an $800 payment a month at 5% interest. My credit at the time was 760's and I was throwing down a large chunk of cash. Things were not adding up. I called out the Bs and we walked. As we are leaving, the sales rep tries to walk everything back AND move cars around for me to take a test drive. During this whole conversation, he didn't ask if I was putting anything down nor did he run my credit. All numbers he had were \"rough\" numbers even after talking with finance for 30 minutes with all my information to run my credit. When I asked him straight up for my interest and OTD cost he would say \"welllll these are rough numbers, but you could sign the contract now...(insert bad numbers).\" Filed a report and 6 months later the state AG's office calls me asking if I can be contacted by lawyers concerning my issues with said dealer. At one point their business license at the dealer was suspended. Since the dealer is still there and opperating, I figure they were given the green light to continue business but I'm sure they're waiting on the state to finish their investigation.",

        "selftext": "Apologies if the English isn\u2019t perfect, it\u2019s not my native tongue. \n\nNearly two years ago I started work at Company as their digital marketing person. After I started, it turned out that I was brought in to put out the fires left by my predecessor, the VP Marketing, who had a team of 4 plus himself, spent over $1 million in one year and brought in 5 deals, 2 of them for under $10K. \n\nAs you can well imagine, after a performance like that, I had lots of work to do, and very little to do it with. Aside from 1 or 2 paid tools, everything else was to be done using free tools only. I\u2019m gonna do some bragging here, I beat the previous year\u2019s figures in all categories with 10% of the budget. \n\nWhen I started, I thought Bossman (Founder/CEO) had a really good management style, saying things like: \u201cYour successes are yours, your mistakes are mine\u201d, and \u201cThe enemy of good is great. I don\u2019t expect perfection, I want you to make sure things work and get them done\u201d. In essence, I was allowed to run my own (one-man) department and outsourced freelancers, and as long as I was getting results, he left me alone. Since I was the only person on the marketing team, I also had to learn a large number of skills and platforms that weren\u2019t directly related to digital marketing. \n\nNot to say everything was perfect, but things were pretty good. One of the main things that weren\u2019t perfect was that Bossman had serious anger management issues. As I said before, he left me alone but I saw him blow up at and fire other people for stupid shit. He lost it at me too once or twice, but he\u2019d calm down after a coupla hours and things would be back to normal. If it looks like an abusive relationship, that\u2019s because looking back, that\u2019s exactly what it was. \n\nAs the year came to an end, I approached Boss and initiated a performance review. I ran him through everything I had done in the past year, and he was pretty surprised at how much I had done with so little. I asked him for a raise, pointing out that I was currently making 8,000/month in local currency (average is 4,500/month) when people with my (now augmented) skill set were making between 13-14,000/month. I asked him for 12,000. He said he\u2019d get back to me, and never did. Every time I asked him about my raise, he had another excuse. After the last excuse, I began looking for something else.\n\nThe other day we had a meeting, and it turns out that two months ago I made a mistake. It wasn\u2019t a critical mistake, and it was rectified within a few hours of discovering the mistake. No harm or damage was caused whatsoever to Company, but Bossman flipping LOST IT. I mean slamming on tables, yelling for the whole office to hear, what have you. Then he said the magic words: \u201cPack your things up and go home. Think about whether you want to keep working here\u201d. So that\u2019s what I did, and 10 seconds later I said \u201cNo, I don\u2019t\u201d. \n\nI started packing my shit up while he turned an even deeper shade of red and got even louder. I didn\u2019t answer him at all, just kept on packing up my things and saying goodbye to my colleagues. Turns out that being ignored really pushed his buttons, to the point where he started threatening to call security to have me removed, while I was **actively** removing my self and my things from the office. \n\nHere\u2019s the part where it gets beautiful: My country is very strict on employee\u2019s rights (sorry, Americans, I feel your pain). His words and behaviour are considered an improper dismissal. By law he\u2019s required to give me 30 days notice of dismissal, which he didn\u2019t. When he realized his mistake, he convened a pre-dismissal hearing, but it was already too late, he\u2019s opened himself up to a lawsuit, which I\u2019m already talking with lawyers about. \n\nBecause by law he **has** to give me those 30 days\u2019 notice even though he already fired me, for the next 30 days I\u2019m eligible for ALL the benefits and social rights in my salary, but I can do jack shit for him and there\u2019s nothing he can do to me without making the incoming lawsuit 10 times worse. I\u2019ve already got 4 interviews lined up for next week, paying almost double what Boss was paying me, and best of all, I\u2019ll be interviewing for other places on his dime. The cherry on top is that because I\u2019m the only marketing person, without me, nothing happens in the marketing department for the next month, and if he doesn\u2019t hire someone on in time, I won\u2019t be around to answer any questions the new person might have.",

        "selftext": "This happened many years ago, I've only just found this sub and while my story is nowhere near as witty as the ones I'm reading, it still makes me chuckle.\n\nWhen I was around 19 I was working as a receptionist, front of house at a Solictitors office. It was quite small but very successful - 4 partners (main one was the lady it was named after who was kind of fierce in a Judge Judy kind of way so I'll call her Judy). A new Solictor we will call Anna joined the team. We had a Conveyancing, a Personal Injury, Financial and Criminal department Solicitor and she would be working Family Law and her speciality and main focus would be helping domestic violence victims. At this time, all of the abused clients were women.\n\nShe was awesome at her job, I saw so many victims of abuse while they waited in reception, and because they were so stressed and worried they would sometimes just tell me their life stories while they waited. I did my best to comfort them, sometimes they'd have to wait an hour or longer if something else was happening. Anna advocated *hard* for these women. Restraining orders, emergency hearings, police interviews, protection, arranging safe houses, custody of children. I really admired her, and still do now.  Those women needed her. \n\nThe thing about Anna was she was extremely posh, well educated she spoke better than the characters on Downton Abbey or even the Queen, but she was also very opinionated and she swore *a lot*. Hearing her talk about one of the husbands of a battered woman \"what an absolute twatting little cunt\" in a voice that sounds similar to the Queen made us giggle, but she reigned it in and was mostly professional in front of clients.\n\nMost of my job was filing, typing voice dictation statements and logging calls from the women with restraining orders who had been contacted by their ex partner/abuser. So I'd get a lot of calls \"Hi Sabrina, he called me at 8.15am and 10am today also an email at 9pm through his mother's account\", things like that. It all had to be logged and reported for the court files. I got so many of these calls I'd recognise each by voice (this is important later).\n\nAfter she'd been there for maybe a month, she was featured in an article that put the office in a very good light, the article highlighted her important work in keeping these people safe, we celebrated with her. But it went to her head and she became arrogant and snappy, with little put downs here to the secretaries and other workers. She became pretty full of herself, getting snarky and barking out \"coffee!\" to me as soon as she walked inside. I let it go, she was stressed and doing something important. \n\nAs it was so long ago, most documents had to be faxed. Her office was two doors away from Reception. She would let me know if she was expecting something important and I would drop everything to rush the documents to her, waiting for lega stuff, police reports or restraining orders could quite literally be a life and death situation for the clients. Sure enough, a restraining order document came through for a female client who was sitting with Anna in her office. She was crying, looked like she had no sleep, her story was horrendous (I had to type up some statements of hers), I felt desperately sorry for her. The rule was if something important came through, I had to rush and interrupt any client meeting. The papers came through, I rushed to the office and handed them to Anna and left. Moments later Anna was in Reception screeching at me because the timestamp said it was delivered a whole hour earlier. I was confused  I'd given it to her the moment it came through. She would not stop yelling that I had put this woman's life in jeopardy over my laziness and stupidity and I should be fired. She made so much noise that Judy came out of her office to listen (the founder of the company). Her face gave absolutely nothing away and afterwards she quietly just said \"please make sure to give the documents quickly in future to avoid any more problems\".\n\nIt happened again. An 8 (or so) page document came through for that same client who was in there with her, I rushed to her office handed them to her and went to leave. Before I could, Anna started yelling at me again, \"THIS WAS AN HOUR AGO! WHAT THE FUCK SABRINA WHAT THE FUCK DID I TELL YOU?\" This time she started swearing and I couldn't get a word in and all of this in front of the poor client who looked wildly uncomfortable, Judy came to the door again and again, her face gave nothing away and just asked me to come with her. She asked if there was a problem, I explained and she thanked me. Anna then followed us out and started yelling at me that I had no respect or kindness in my heart for these women and I was lazy, utterly  incompetent, and ridiculously not right in the head. I cried in the toilets. \n\nOver the next few days, the same client came in. Things had escalated further and had hit the newspapers (it was an awful case) so the 4 partners along with Anna were meeting with her in the same office. I went back in to give a file to one of the other partners there and Anna piped up \"was this from an hour ago too? There seems to be a pattern here\". Again, in front of the client and her 4 bosses. It didn't bother me this time though.  I'd had one of those moments in bed the night before, the moment when your eyes snap open while you're trying to sleep and you have that BINGO! Realisation moment. \n\nSo I calmly just said \"the reason why the documents appeared to be an hour late was because the clocks have changed for daylight savings time, I should have realised that when the ink was still not dry as I handed them to you\". Sure enough, the document on her desk yesterday was a little smudged. The fax machine was old and didn't update the time.\n\nMy little victory moment was spoiled because as I was leaving the office I tripped over my own foot and knocked my head on the doorframe giving Anna a good laugh.\n\nThe next day a staff meeting was called about professionalism in the office, the client who witnessed Anna's meltdown had approached Judy - she was really upset to see Anna treat the staff that way and her swearing had frightened her. Judy was very clear that this was not acceptable, the woman had heard enough yelling and swearing for a lifetime.  Anna begrudgingly apologised to me and I shrugged it off. Judy also apologised privately for not stepping in when she should have. No problem.\n\nMy malicious compliance was next, every single call I had to log (instead of the main list I used on the computer) from the women I wrote on an individual post-it. So I'd be in and out of her office sometimes 10 times an hour. Her desk was flooded with post-its that just said \"10am call from husband to client X\". She was annoyed but this was what she asked for. I wasted a lot of post-its.\n\nThe next bit got a little strange. A lady who was in a shelter/safe house with her daughter called and said she was reconciling with her husband and she wants to drop the case completely and did not want to be contacted again. This happens, sometimes abused victims go back when it gets too much. This was a particularly brutal case, she'd been beaten really badly. I told Anna straightaway who said she would call her in a few days (calling right then might jeopardise her safety if he was there) and I said no - call the Police. She asked why, and I said it wasnt her on the phone, I recognise her voice every time she calls, it wasn't her. We called for a Welfare check and sure enough, her husband had taken her forcefully back home and had his older daughter call the office pretending to be her. He was arrested.\n\nWhen it all worked out well and the lady was again in a much better safe house, Anna gifted me a bottle of wine and a thank you card, and then asked me to stop with the post-its and that the message was received. She also apologised again properly. \n\nSorry for the long post, moral of the story is don't treat people like crap even if your intentions are pure, and trying to help someone. We can all be kind.\n\nEDIT Thank you for the awards and kind words. You're all awesome. I think I didn't make clear that I'm not in that field anymore, it was a job I took after dropped out of college. I left after having my first son and then started working safeguarding 1/1 support at a school. The nice comments really made me smile, thank you very much\n\nEDIT 2. I honestly did not think this post would reach so many people, and people with lovely, good hearts that would say such nice and genuinely kind things to me. Some people have asked me for a TL:Dr so here goes:\n\n*TL:DR* I was treated badly and belittled in front of a client and cried in the toilets. I bombarded boss Anna with individual updates and progress updates on post-it note's -(so  she would see what I was handling minute by minute). Her office was flooded with yellow post-it notes. And we handled a situation afterwards together. We ended up working together,\n\nThank you for your kind words.",

You\u2019re acting like a child. I\u2019ve apologised and now you\u2019re just yelling at me\u201d.

A month later it was no longer busy (as the novelty from the review died down) but it retained the high prices.  I don't think it was around a year later.

So the \"give a care\" is completely gone. I'm in charge of inventory of specific pieces of equipment. Smaller pieces that are used by many people at my job. From time to time these pieces \"disappear\". Most of the time that just means things are misplaced, but we just got out of a certain period where we had **MANY** hired contractors at our job that tend to take things. Now every once and a while we conduct an inventory of these pieces of equipment for accountability reasons. When we lose things, it looks very bad on my work. More specifically, bad on my bosses.   \n\n\nSo I prepared the inventory and was startled by the amount of missing pieces. I did everything I needed to do and presented the inventory to my boss. **He didn't believe we had so many pieces missing and asked for me to inventory them again**. so I did, got the same number, and put the inventory in his inbox. Few months go by and I get the same thing. \"There can't be that many! Do another one.\" So I'm very compliant and do it again, and again.....and again. **This gets dragged on over a year** and I'm starting to notice something. **My boss is about to leave soon and he is deliberately pushing this off to the next guy to cover himself.**   \n\n\nSo last week I was sleeping since I work nights and I'm woken up. My boss tells me I have to do a specific survey with my co-workers that will get sent up to the head honcho. This survey allows the small guy have a voice directly to the top. I tell him that I have the night watch, but he doesn't care and demands I go and do this survey. Fine. Before the survey starts our boss tells us we need to be completely honest and all these surveys are anonymous. Rad. I wrote down what had been happening with the inventory and directed where they could find the documentation of the done inventories.  \n\n\nFast forward to yesterday. All my bosses are fired and now I'm reporting to new people who are now fixing the issues with the inventory.   \n\nEdit: Thank you so much for the Silver! \n\nTLDR; Boss was avoiding issues to cover himself.

            ">This gets dragged on over a year and I'm starting to notice something. My boss is about to leave soon and he is deliberately pushing this off to the next guy to cover himself.\n\nFor those curious, in the Canadian Forces these are called SCA or DA accounts, and ultimately what they are is a list of things you are accountable for in your section as the supervisor. Like for example, I was responsible for the radios in Cold Lake, Alberta once upon a time and they were on my DA.\n\nIf you can't find something on the DA, they can (although they typically don't as OP posted) investigate it. They can though, and they can hold you accountable.\n\nCommon practice was to make your Corporals and Privates account for all the things *you* needed to sign off on. This is called a DA verification, and goes to the person who fucked up most last.\n\nThe thing is, the only people who can actually sign for the DA are the person holding it, and the person accepting the transfer. I refused to sign for anything I didn't see, negating the common tactic of trying to slough the DA off on the next guy without having to account for equipment.\n\nThis happens every time there's a posting, and it's un-fucking-real how many people act surprised that this thing they know is coming when they get a posting message is suddenly required.\n\nGreat story OP. Lots of nostalgia and hatred towards SCA verifications myself.",

It was highly unionised, but the management tracked login times to the minute. \n\nOne incredibly ridiculous thing they did was if you were a minute or two late, they would literally dock your pay by that many minutes. It wasn\u2019t really enough for us to really notice, and I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t actually save any money - I mean, if you were 15 minutes late I could understand not paying but 3 minutes late? \n\nWell, eventually the union discovered what they were doing, and were completely pissed that they hadn\u2019t been consulted about this dick move. This is where their MC comes in.\n\nThe union demanded logon and log off times for everyone in the call centre. What management hadn\u2019t counted on was that all of us would often need to wrap up calls and clear the call queue before the call centre could officially close. This often meant that operators would leave several minutes after their shift. On bad occasions it could be 15-20 minutes delay before they could clock off, but mostly it was only a few minutes.\n\nThe union made management recalculate everyone\u2019s pay for the year based on clock on *and* clock off time. They also pointed out that staying past end of shift triggered penalty rates. It turns out everyone (and I mean everyone!) had spent more time wrapping up calls at the end of the day than they were late clocking on. Each of us got paid for lost wages, at overtime rates. \n\nIt cost them a fortune and they never docked the pay of anyone who was late ever again.\n\nEdit: wow, this got more response than I thought it would!

My pay for that hour didn't get included in my paycheck, according to my boss it was a \"personal call\" so it didn't count as work, even though the caller had an account and an issue that needed to be dealt with (fixing the issue took 45 of those minutes, the 15 of personal help was interspersed between various steps of the resolution). \n\nAt that time, the call center was under major fire for unethical practices already. I told the local news about my experience, where they were refusing to pay me for an hour of work because I spent 15 minutes stopping someone from having a major breakdown/panic attack instead of just ending the call and letting them, who knows? self harm seemed likely. The office even had the suicide prevention hotline posted on all the walls as a way to try to \"show\" how they were not as unethical as it was claimed.

Someone field a Department of Labor grievance and a class action lawsuit.\n\nThe company ended up having to convert everybody to hourly and recalculate pay for a few hundred people for a 15 year period, plus pay nearly a million dollars in fines. There were a few guys who ended up getting nearly $20,000 in back pay.\n\nThe company retaliated by exploiting a loophole that allows them to change an hourly employees rate every pay period, so they did to make it so nobody ended up getting paid for overtime anyway and stayed at their salaried level.

            "I had a similar situation with an employer. He was rounding down if I clocked out at 8 to 10 minutes after instead of up to 15. \n\nOf course, after I clocked out, turned on the security alarm, locked the back door, then chained and locked the gate on my way out I wasn't paid for that. Or for opening it in the morning. \n\nI ended up just quitting. No union at that job.",
            "What an expensive mistake",
            "The call center I worked at allowed us to clock in +/- 3 minutes of our start time without penalty. We were expected to stay on the phones until our clock-out time so if we took a last-minute call that went over 5 minutes we were supposed to email our team lead to give them a heads up and explain the extra time. Our pay was calculated exact to the clock times.",
            "Corporate just floated the idea of forcing the salaried, non-union employees to use time clocks.  The immediate response from the non-union management was \"when do we start?  Related, are [the last day of the pay period]s a good day to not have support?\"  Since non-union salried folks can flex over a pay period (80 hours in 2 weeks), but the first four (4) hours of overtime are unpaid freebies for such a behemoth organization, the non-union management expects people to flex like crazy and basically skip a day every other week.\n\nCorporate is still considering the option, but is being reminded of the non-union attrition rate.  The going rate for those statements of work in other large organizations is about 25% more, as such most people only stick around for a year or two.\n\nNo MC, yet, but a similar example, I felt.  I'm surprised your org hadn't done the cost calculation for on and off the clock for disrupting the status quo with the union!",
            "I worked in a place that did something like that once. They would \"round up\" your 3 minute late clock-in to the next quarter hour. But if you clocked out late? Those got rounded down. Took me quite a while to notice, I got something like 90 hours in backpay.",

            "I was reading the first line and became utterly confused, and started wondering \u201cso there is actually a fully ionised call centre...?\u201d\n\nI read the story and the comments and realised what an idiot I am....",

            "I'm a unionized worker aswell. I honestly don't know why so many people are anti-union these days. It's literally the only thing that makes sure I'm treated fairly and like a person.

        "selftext": "Obligatory long time reader, first time poster, on mobile yada yada.\n\nThis is a story of MC that a previous boss had done, but involved me directly as will be explained.  Timeframe is early 2000s for reference.\n\nIn my late high school / early college years, I had a job doing telemarketing work during winter and summer breaks.  While it was boiler room cold calling, we primarily were soliciting donations for agencies that had contracted us to do the work, so felt less scuzzy.  Think police departments, fire departments, etc.  We kept a portion of donations for operating expenses, everything over a certain threshold went directly to the receiving party.  Everybody wins.\n\nI enjoyed the job as the scripts were simple, I was allowed to read a book and such between calls, and a number of my friends were also employed there so we could hang out during lunch breaks.  The pay was a decent chunk above minimum wage at that time, so it was a good gig.  I also had a knack for it, and at one point was 5th in \"sales\" across all their sites they had in operation, 2nd in our building.\n\nOne summer, while driving to work, my car promptly dies with no warning and I'm left stranded on the road.  As you do in this situation back before cell phones for poor college students were a thing, I walk to the nearest house and ask to use the phone.  I call my dad who starts driving to get me, and call my work to let them know I'll be late.  My boss says fine and that he will chat with me when I get in.\n\nFather shows up with my mother in two cars, I take the extra and he begins the arduous process of \"towing\" my car back to the house.  This involved tying a rope to the front of the car and to the back of his vehicle and crawling back home so he could fix it himself.  I've been in that back car, and did not envy my father being in the back car with only 10 feet of space between him and the car my mother was driving, but I'm off to work.\n\nI arrive to work, clock in almost an hour after the start of my shift, and am promptly told by the front receptionist that my boss would like to see me in his office.  So I head on back.\n\nBeginning details completed.  Cue the start of the MC story.\n\nMy boss and I have always had a good rapport.  I'm a good worker, get good reviews, and he and I have some similar interests outside of work we can chat about occasionally.  When I arrive in his office, he's shuffling some papers around and has laid out a few documents facing me.  As close as I can recall, this is the conversation that followed.\n\nBoss - \"Hope everything worked out with the car, glad to have you here.  Couple things I need to discuss with you.  First of all, as I'm sure you are aware, being more than 30 minutes late to work is considered a class C violation (3 classes, from C to A, C being the least egregious) if insufficient time is given prior to the occurrence.  This is your first violation, so I'd like to talk to you about what happens next.\"\n\nI'm sweating at this point.  I've never even been talked to about being out of order on anything while working here, and getting my first violation scared the heck out of me.  So I'm sitting there, white faced, and he continues.\n\nBoss - \"No official writeup or anything occurs for a first violation, or even the first few Class C violations, but it is managers discretion on the punishment depending on past behaviors.  Now, you are a good employee and I've put in to corporate a few times to give you a raise, but because you only work during your school breaks, it is denied as you aren't considered 'full time'.  So the papers I have here are your termination papers and an offer letter I'd like to extend to you to hire you back on again.  So, in short, before I file these, I'd like to ask.  Is it ok if I fire you?\"\n\nSo we go through the process of him \"firing\" me, which then allowed him to extend an offer to me to rehire me at roughly a 25% increase in pay, since he could justify to corporate the bump as he was hiring someone with experience.  In talking with him, he let me know it was something he occasionally did to the high school and college workers to get around the corporate's policy of not allowing raises to people that didn't work 1,000+ hours in a year.  It was his own way of being maliciously compliant with a policy that didn't allow him to reward some people that he thought deserved it.  He had been apparently waiting for me to do something that he could technically fire me for.  The way their back end systems worked, it wouldn't even show up as a break in service, since the firing and hiring happened on the same day, and since I never worked more than the minimum 1,000 hours each year I didn't have any tenure or anything to be worried about losing.\n\nThe laugh he and the receptionist had when he walked me back to the front to introduce her to the new employee was enjoyable, and I've had a fun story to tell ever since.\n\nTLDR - Boss fires me for minor infraction so he can then rehire me at a higher rate of pay.\n\n\n\n\nEdit - Thank you everyone for the comments and awards.  I had to Google what the awards meant, as I've never made a post or comment that has had more than a few upvotes in the past.  I've been doing my best to keep up with comments and thanking the award people individually, but I know there are many I missed or just didn't have the stamina to keep up with.  I also wanted to answer a few commonly asked questions.\n\n1 - Why do the fire department and police department need more money?  - This was more for affiliated agencies and charities.  Think the firefighters boot drive they do every year.  They don't keep your change you toss into the boot, it goes to a charitable cause.\n\n2 - Did your dad fix the car / what was wrong with it?  - I'm not a car person, so don't know what was wrong with it, but yes, my dad was able to fix it.\n\n3 - Do you keep in touch with the boss?  - This was close to 20 years ago, and unfortunately I don't keep in touch with very many people from my hometown including this wonderful man.  Last I had heard, he was still working there 4-5 years after I had left, and it was still a great place to work.\n\n\nMany of your comments had me laughing, and I've enjoyed responding to them throughout the day and into the wee hours of the morning last night, and they are still coming in.  Thank you all again for this enjoyable experience, I'm glad you had fun with my little retelling of years gone by.",

            "It\u2019s really cool to sometimes see stories on here of really good bosses, cuz I\u2019ve only had like 3 of them out of the several dozen in the last 10 years. Even though I generally consider wage labor to be a form of theft, there is a lot to be said for good bosses who kind of get that and strive to get their good employees the pay that they actually deserve. On a similar note, I worked at an upscale seafood restaurant on the East Coast for a while, and the manager I had there was the best manager I\u2019ve ever had-restaurant industry or otherwise-and server minimum wage in that state was only 5.15/hr in one of the top 5 expensive cities in the country to live. She couldn\u2019t just give raises out because it is a corporate restaurant chain, but if you were a really good server and your sales were consistently pretty high, she would fight tooth and nail with corporate and payroll to push a raise through because it was a real touristy area and a lot of people came in from Europe and didn\u2019t tip (cuz ya know, European restaurants pay their employees a livable wage). But she made an honest effort to try to make it so the servers would end up having a paycheck of more than $50 biweekly so that, if we were having a bad string of tippers, we could be assured that we would still be able to pay our bills.

            "From the title alone, here's what I imagined: The boss knew you were planning to leave the company. He got a directive that for budget reasons, layoffs are going to happen. Boss politely asks to include you in the layoffs, which results in you getting a compensation package, and him having to lay off one fewer employee.\n\nI worked at a company when there was a corporate restructure going on. My boss was aware that restructures like this often involve layoffs. Although he'd never admit to this, here's what he did: If someone in his department was under-performing, or otherwise a poor employee, he would not fire them (unless they were totally toxic). Instead, he'd keep a mental note. Eventually, word came down from corporate that he had to lay several people off. He submit his list of under-performers, and they were laid off. No doubt this also made his job easier -- he didn't have to tell someone he was firing someone because of poor performance -- instead, he could blame it all on corporate. \n\nFortunately, these sort of restructures didn't happen too often at that company, but having lived through a few under that same boss, I came to appreciate his style because I always knew that my job was safe.",

That [list of campaigns is available to the public](https://ag.ky.gov/Priorities/Protecting-Kentuckians/charity/Pages/active.aspx).

With $412k collected so far, they've kept $354k for themselves.\n\n* Fraternal Order of Police Kentucky State Lodge fundraiser operated by Midwest Publishing (those guys again) between 4/1/2019 and 11/30/2022 has collected $104k so far and has passed $15k to the charity.  \n\n* There are 5 active National Volunteer Firefighter Alliance campaigns operated by various companies.

The campaign operated by Midwest Publishing (sensing a pattern here?) has collected $434k so far and they've kept $391k for themselves.\n\n* Muscular Dystrophy Association fundraiser operated by InfoCision, Inc?

Essentially if taxation worked properly there'd be no need for the middle man. \n\nCompanies like this exist for charities and it's why a lot of them have such large \"marketing\" budgets. They send people out who get hundreds of pounds of new donations every day, the person gets minimum wage, their company takes a similar sized cut and the charity ends up with about 1/3 of the money handed over. These charities usually provide services for vulnerable and needy so for me it reinforces the notion that it's a failing of the state.

After the group session where they explained how stuff worked, the manager took me apart and told me that they would be hired as minimum wage employees, but that I could have my old job back. The way this worked (in the Netherlands this is), was that the job title \"Saturday employee\" is a part timer function with full responsibility from mail sorting to delivery including parcels and signed-for deliveries. The other is \"mail deliverer\" which only entails delivering regular mail; no sorting, no packages, no signed-for.\n\nI guess this was a form of MC on his behalf, similar to what happened to you.\n\n3 years later we had another manager and he had found either a loophole or he was willing to risk his neck more than the previous, as he was able to give me a permanent contract on the premise that I would likely leave after my uni graduation.",

        "selftext": "This happened when I was 15.  My mom was (lets be real, she probably still is) a mentally, emotionally, and physically abusive narcissist.  Some highlights are when she was teaching my twin sister and I to read at the age of 4 or so.  It was around 2am and my sister was having trouble learning so my mother's solution was to beat her with a sandal every time she got a flash card wrong.  Same thing happened when my mother had me transcribe an essay she had written to my handwriting when I was 7. Everytime I started a letter from the wrong position (like starting a capital M from the bottom line) she would beat me with one of her birkenstocks.  This too happened later at night so when I got too delirious for the exhaustion and pain she would drag me, by the neck, and literally throw me into a cold shower to wake me up so we could more easily continue the waking nightmare.  When I was 13 I told her to wanted to live with my dad (they were divorced) and she told me she didnt care what I did after I turned 18.  I later figured out that this was because the child support stopped at age 18.\n\nAaaaaanywho. Fast forward to age 15. Our relationship was understandably strained. We had had guests and she liked to use guests as a way of controlling our behavior through shame.  It's easier to be an angsty teenager when your grown up friends from church arent watching and judging everything you do.  This make it easier for her to pretend to be a firm but loving mother all while slipping in sideways comments like velvet daggers.  Well I decided I wasn't going to subject myself to the whole thing and spent the day outside in the woods nearby (we lived in the mountains at the time so it was less than 100' from the house).  When I saw our guests had left I went to go back inside.  My mother, perhaps unhappy at being denied a day long emotional abuse routine, told me I wasn't welcome and that I should leave.  My 15 year old brain heard her words and knew that she only meant for a little while but it also recognized that failed to specify anytimeframe at all.  So, I hiked a couple miles too a friends house  and asked if I could spend a couple days there.  When my friends dad found out that I was there and why he was pissed and said I could stay as long as I needed.\n\nI didnt go home that evening, or the next. My mom became concerned and contacted law enforcement (LE) to report me missing.  This is a big deal for several reasons. We lived in the mountains on a national park so it was a very real possibility that I had been attacked by a wild animal, become injured while hiking, drowned, or been kidnapped. Nobody knew of my mother's abusive tendencies or the squalor and neglect my sister and I lived in.  Most importantly the law enforcement was the local park rangers with which she worked daily. LE immediately contacted my dad's side of the family to see if I had turned up there or contacted them (they promptly freaked the fuck out and came to my house with lawyers on standby.  LE then hired dogs to track my scent and then everyone freaked out because the dogs tracked me to a nearby river where my trail died because the dogs couldn't pick up any more scent.\n\nOver the next couple days there were people going in and out of my house, Rangers, lawyers my family etc. And several noticed the over powering scent of cleaning chemicals but only the lawyer considered why a 'clean' house would reek of chemicals. \n\nLE started to canvas the nearby woods and 'neighborhood'.  My friend's dad came to me and asked if there was somewhere else I could stay.  He told me that he wouldnt kick me out didnt want to have to lie to the police or let the dogs on his property.  My friend and I figured we just go camping for a week or so but instead I looked up my dad's side of the family and called and they picked me up right away.\n\nUnderstandably, everyone had questions. When I told them what was happening the lawyers, horrified, pounced.  A judge issued an emergency change of custody and prevented her from gaining custody until she underwent a psych eval and therapy(which my mother would never allow).  The rangers, equally horrified, completely shunned my mother and she eventually lost her job. Since she was only allowed to live on the park because she worked there so she was kicked out of her house. My friend's father and the trackers were members of the local community and churches and they too shunned my mother.  \n\nShe lost her job, her house, her church, and her friends all because she told me to leave and I did.\n\nTL;DR: Mom told me to leave the house. When I didnt come back she call LE and reported me missing.   When LE got involved my mother's abuse and neglect came to light and she lost her job with local LE, her house which she had through the local LE and her friends. Judge finally awarded custody of us kids to my dad so she lost her child support payments too.\n\nEdit for clarity: I'm 32 now this happened a while ago.\n\nEdit: I wasn't clear and didnt want to make it longer.  When my dads family got involved they were able to reach an agreement where I would leave with them for a time but my sister stayed. I had to go back to my mom's for a short while but the the judge issued an emergency change of custody and my sister and I went to live with our dad.  My sister and I have been in therapy and she is teaching now.  Life isnt perfect but its better.\n\nEdit: people keep asking about the chemicals.  The house was normal trashed.  My mother kept an untrained dog and the carpet was soaked with dog feces and urine. The few times we had guests we would have to crawl around the dogs potty spot and clean it up and make the house smell good.  My mom freaked out when she realized that rangers and CPS might come round.  She did a deep clean of the house before reporting me missing because she couldn't afford to have them realize what they were walking on.",

It was primarily designed for vets and victims of sexual assault, in other words, the sort of people that if the therapy they\u2019re taking retraumatizes them, they may never revisit therapy and are part of an extremely vulnerable population in regard to self harm (nuff said). \n\nMost private practices have at least heard of BST or EMDR, both work off of similar established science. I\u2019ve taken BST, my partner has taken it, my mother, and my aunt, and now, my mother is a licensed therapist working in a private practice here in CA dedicated entirely to BST, my aunt is a lifelong nurse and is licensed to provide BST to nurses in the emergency room, my partner has recovered from a crippling depression that put them in the ICU twice, and I\u2019m studying for my Masters in Counseling and Therapy to get my own certification and provide the same therapy. \n\nI thought I\u2019d reach out and provide a resource in case it helps.

I dated someone with NPD and it ruined my life.

People use this ableism crap as a means to victim blame and silence trauma sufferers from voicing their trauma. And probably also makes it harder for people suffering abuse to escape because the PC gang are gas lighting them into believing you have to forgive everything their abusers does because it's not fair to judge them for their illness. I get that not all NPD sufferers are bad but there are many people who are affected by them and stopping people from talking about it is dangerous.

We also noticed that she had to be calm and feel safe in order to participate in any reading or counting or adding.

        "selftext": "Hello Reddit,\n\nI lurk a lot and realized I had my own malicious compliance a few weeks ago. \n\n\nMy job is very mentally taxing. I also have my own mental health issues so I try my best to balance, but I just want to help so I get caught up taking more responsibilities than I am actually able to.\n\n\nSo a couple of weeks ago I realize my mental health is in steep decline, I was ignoring the signs to push through, but anyone with mental health issues knows that you can only ignore the signs for so long. I try to get ahead of a mental crash and talk to my supervisor to tell them that I need 3 days off (W, T, F) and as I had the weekend off after the days I requested I figured that might be enough to get a good rest and reset. I did tell my supervisor why I needed the days (burnout, mental health) and they said they understood and would get back to me.\n\n\n\nThey contact me back (I say they because right now I technically have 2 supervisors running my division) and say they can probably give me Wed., Thurs., but that they couldn\u2019t give me Fri, I ask if we can do Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday instead and I could work the Friday, have my long weekend and that should still be fine. They say they will get back to me, I get a text soon after to ask me to help cover other shifts. And I obviously can\u2019t, so I decline.\n\n\nThey get back to me the next day.\n\n\u201cWe can get your shifts covered for Wednesday and Thursday,but not Tuesday and you have to make up the hours\u201d\n\n\nThat was the straw. I just broke, I was asking for a break because I was working too much because it was hard for me to say no. I even call them (they had me on speaker) in tears and explain even further why I need the days, I have been going through trauma therapy and my mental health has been declining. I had told them that I had spoken to my doctor and that my doctor said I was showing signs of burnout and recommended some days off (which is true, as I had talked to him the day before). All they heard was doctor and said \u201cwe need a doctor\u2019s note\u201d.\n\n\nOkay fine, good thing I have another appointment. I had to work that day just defeated because they couldn\u2019t find anyone to cover my shifts. I talk to my doctor and he says that he can tell I\u2019m in distress and he puts me on 2 weeks of leave immediately. \n\n\nThey did not look pleased when I handed in my doctors note. That was 2 weeks ago, I went back to the doctor and he extended my leave for AT LEAST another month. Cause you know straw broke the camels back and my mental health just went down the drain. \n\n\nOh also, when I gave them my doctor\u2019s note with 4 weeks on it, one of them wouldn\u2019t even look at me and the other just said \u201coh doctor\u2019s note, thanks.\u201d\n\n\nTLDR: So that\u2019s the story of how I asked for 3 days off to try to rest and reset and ended up with at least 6 weeks, with no confirmed return date.\n\n\n\nEdit 1: holy barnacles this blew up! I thank everyone for all their support! Also for all those asking, no I am not in America. And I was able to apply for sickness benefits.\n\n\n\nEdit 2: I can\u2019t thank everyone enough for the support, it is immensely encouraging! My husband has been reading your lovely comments, I wish I could reply to them all. For everyone having their own struggles and still being so kind, it is very appreciated, and I\u2019m hoping everyone gets what they need to recover / get better! \u2665\ufe0f",

            "I ended up getting a 6 month vacation due to a job requiring a doctor's note.\n\n15 years ago, I had a seizure at my job.  I've taken medication since I was a kid for seizures, but this was at a time when I was having to work 12-hour shifts 7 days a week due to work being so busy.  I missed getting my medication filled, and on the 3rd day of no medication, a seizure happened.  I got sent home for the night, and, being used to these happening most of my life, thought nothing of it and tried going into work the next day.  They wouldn't let me come back without a doctor's note.\n\nI go to the doctor and bring his note back to HR that day.  The doctor recommends no operating heavy machinery for 6 months.  Due to work writing this up as a short-term disability, I ended up getting 6 months off with full pay.\n\nThis happened in March, so I got to enjoy the entire spring and summer getting paid to not come into work due to them wanting a doctor's note.",

The other side were just scorched earth pieces of shit--no matter how simple the issue they had to make it huge. And it was a contingency case so I only got paid if we settled. And it was kind of a loser of a case (client lied to me before I took the case--I technically could have gotten out but there was still a small chance of winning with a huge potential payday).\n\nMy wife sees I'm starting to crumble and she's trying to be as supportive as she can. Finally she tells me I should go see my doctor. I go in and tell him how much trouble I'm having, and even just saying it I'm barely holding back the tears. I was a wreck.\n\nHe says \"don't worry I'm not going to let you leave here without getting some help.\"\n\nThat did it. I actually started crying. Only this time it was from relief instead of stress. Just hearing those words made me feel better.\n\nGot on some anti depressants and prescribed xanax and referred me to a psychologist. Just walking out of there with a plan made me feel 100% better. \n\nGot through trial and the small chance at winning didn't work. But at least I still had my sanity.

            "This happened to my sister....twice. the difference is she is pretty much the entire HR department for a fairly large car dealership. The first time it happened was around Thanksgiving. The woman she shares an office with is antimask and was talking nonstop about where she was traveling for Thanksgiving and how she was only going to wear her mask when they made her. My sister is in an at risk group and told her boss she was planning on working from home the 2 weeks after the coworker returned since they weren't going to make the coworker quarantine or get tested or anything. They got really bent out of shape and asked for a doctors note......which her doctor (who is awesome) wrote that my sister could work from home until MARCH. \n\n\nThe second time this happened needs a little back story. Mt sister works really hard and has been telling this company she needs an assistant or coworker or something for years. Longer than the pandemic for sure. And of course the pandemic is added stress and the company keeps opening new dealerships without hiring new employees so the burn out just got worse and worse. She kept having meetings with the higher ups and they would always give an excuse. They didn't have the money to hire anyone or they couldn't find anyone qualified.  All while piling more and more on my sisters plate and then being mad when it didn't get done.The work from home was supposed to help but it just  wasn't enough. And they tried micromanaging her to try and prove one person could do all the work. It became too much. And my sister again, told them she needed to take leave. She wanted 2 weeks to sort things out and rest (and try and find a new job honestly) and again they threw a fit. So my sister got a doctors note and since she's in hr she also got her short term disability paperwork in order and took an open ended leave of absence. Effective immediately, fuck yall \n\nSo they had no one to do their onboarding or benefits or extra accounting stuff (which she shouldn't have been doing anyways) and they had to hire someone to take over while my sister is gone. And that person they hired was in a better bargaining position and makes significantly more than my sister does.\n\n\nThe break is actually really good for my sisters mental health and I hope she finds another job before she has to go back but it just goes to show that these companies should just give the time people ask for instead of throwing a fit",
            "Having worked in management I can say this is the biggest struggle. Having enough people to effectively cover all the work vs keeping costs low enough to keep profits up. I always tried to get one extra person, just one. Not enough to cut into profits too bad, but one person could often reduce the work load of everyone else just enough that sometimes productivity would actually increase. \n\nWhen I was in the oilfield, I had the fortune to be connected (through my wife) to the right people at several producers that my company wanted to work for, so naturally I advanced very quickly and soon found myself overseeing several crews. I insisted that they bring all the crews up to a certain level of manpower (16 operators plus a crew leader, up from 12 operators plus crew lead). The company fought me on it at first, but a few threats to go and take my contacts elsewhere eventually got me what I wanted.\n\nThe result could not have been better, operator fatigue plummeted, the speed in which jobs were completed skyrocketed, job quality was up, the rate of all injuries and safety incidents went to zero, plus we could afford for a guy to take a sick day, they didn't even feel the loss. All this was in the first month since increasing the crew size. At the end of the second month every single crew was ahead of schedule. This meant they had more yard times perform maintenance on the equipment, so the equipment became a lot more efficient. At the end of the third month we were starting jobs ahead of schedule, sometimes more than a week earlier than planned. This made our customers very happy because they want to get those wells producing as soon as possible. By the 6 month mark the increase in revenue was 4 time more that the cost of the extra employees. I'll admit, I was pretty smug when I went in and showed them those numbers and how right I was.",

They said \u201cIdk if you\u2019re not feeling that well you should go to the doctor\u201d. Well I did and handed them a note that told me to stay home for two days. Cue the pikachu face. They were not happy lol never asked me for a note again. \n\nThey also treated themselves like they were my main job and career and it was so annoying. My main career (a M-F government job) had me back to back booked for mandatory out of state training in March of 2019, which was less than 2 months before my wedding, so it was already not an ideal time as I had a lot of appointments but such is life, I worked around it. It was 2 weeks for one work trip and 3 days for another but they arrange the travel dates and transportation. For the 2 week one, I had to at least leave the day before and wouldn\u2019t return until the day after, both which were weekend days, so I submitted a leave request for two+ weeks (16 days). And since this make up store was open 10AM-9PM, I went ahead and asked for 2 days before departure and 2 days after since I usually worked early Sunday mornings and knew they\u2019d do their best to get me back in ASAP, plus I had some wedding vendor stuff I would need to catch up on. \n\nThen I knew I had the second training the end of the month for Tuesday - Thursday except since this one was within certain miles of my work station, I had to drive. But it was still a 5-6 hour drive. So again. I took another 2 days before and after off. Again, they were my part time job and I didn\u2019t have normal 8 hour shifts there. I didn\u2019t work during the weekdays, so when I say I took the day off, I mean I\u2019m really just saying I can\u2019t come in that night. \n\nI explained the situation thoroughly to management and they had the audacity to say they didn\u2019t know if they could approve both. I also did not have any benefits or vacation time or holidays so I was going without pay and not costing the company any money.  I told them \u201cno no, there\u2019s no \u2018if\u2019. I literally do not have a choice about this, I\u2019m sorry. I know it\u2019s a lot\u201d. They said they would think about it (???)\n\nOk well whatever. It was out of my hands. I had no choice. Whether I was on the schedule or not, I literally could not come in. \n\nAgain, the assistant manager pulled me aside and said \u201ci can\u2019t approve you for all this time off. You\u2019re going to have to cancel one of your vacations\u201d I was like \u201cvacations? These aren\u2019t vacations. They are work trips\u201d. Then it hit me. She thought the last one was a vacation because it was in a state I had gone to before with my family for vacation so naturally she assumed the first one was as well. And then she proved it by saying \u201cisn\u2019t [insert state name here] a vacation spot for you and your family?\u201d  I was like \u201cwell yes I\u2019ve *been* there with my family but its not like that this time\u201d. And not that I have to explain anything to anyone, but I showed her my work emails confirming my travel packages. She still gave me a hard time and continued to make the schedule and kept saying \u201cidk idk I\u2019ll see\u201d\n\nSo I quit \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI wasn\u2019t about to potentially get written up or fired for something I had ZERO control over.

Sure, they may have a wellness policy, and may even say nice things, but ultimately it is your responsibility to get a doctor's note and take a break if you need one.\n\nHaving the doctor's note in hand before you talk to your manager or co-workers is the best strategy. Your manager likely has no idea about mental health issues, and may look for ways to get rid of you. Your co-workers probably know even less, and will offer you the same unhelpful \"get over it\" type advice, and also start talking about you as a bonus.",

This leads to me splurging on dinners. They have a rule that any meal over $35 after tip must include an itemized receipt. They also had a rule that no alcohol could be on that receipt. Now this wasn\u2019t too compliant per the policy, but whenever I\u2019d have those dinners I\u2019d put food and drink on two separate receipts to ensure neither got over the $35 limit and submit the cost separately, meal 1 meal 2 with the restaurant name. I\u2019d always tip big on the food receipt to cover both that way if it did go over the limit, I had that receipt for the accountants. ",

            "My boss pissed me off once about per diem.  I picked up the check for some lunch at mexican place for me and the customer i was with.  It was a grand total of like 20 dollars.  We got 50 a day for meals and i always booked hotels that included breakfast so i almost never came in near 50 for the day,  most times it was maybe 30 max because even if it is company money i am pretty cheap so thirty felt like i was splurging.  Anyway,  Week later my exspense  report got kicked back because the reciept showed two meals and two drinks and i was not cleared to be purchasing lunch for clients.   Ohhhh thats how we want to play this game?  I made many  trips to mcdonalds or some other fast food places at the end of the day and purchased cheeseburgers or whatever and handed them out to anyone in sight. homeless guy? have a few burgers, Kid at mcdonalds with mom?  want a happy meal?  have two on me.   I also started ordering apps and a dessert often if i was at a real reesturant and not eating fast food.  Did not matter if i wanted it or not.  I made many a hotel desk clerks happy or very often confused as to why this random guy just gave them free dessert or apps.  It was also the last time i turned in an itemized reciept.........that was my original mistake.  I went from an avg of maybe 20 or 30 a day per diem to 49.99 every fricking day!",

            "Same exact thing happened with me. I had to travel to the home base city frequently so I found this awesome B&B on Airbnb that was only about $100 a night...the lady who ran it was awesome, home cooked breakfast every morning, she'd even do my laundry! (I didn't even ask, she just did it!).  Corporate didn't like that because it wasn't one of their \"approved providers\" and nixed it. So I just booked the absolute max hotel I could from that point on...(usually $275 or so...as much as $400 during convention times). Idiots....same thing happened with the food allowance, they had a hard cap of $100 per diem so even though I'd stay a week and spend 4 days eating cheap ($40-50 day), they'd refuse the Friday night where we'd go to a nice restaurant and I'd spend like $110 that day or something. So again I said 'fuck you' now I go out of my way to spend $95-100 a day, every day. So so dumb",
            "I had something similar happen recently. \n\nOur corporate policy is to use US Government per diem rates when we travel. For CONUS travel, this generally is okay but sometimes sucks. (e.g. SF per diem is ~$300/day hotel, but the cheapest is often ~$500/day) However it typically is outstanding for international travel. \n\nI had to schedule a last minute trip to Tokyo on project. Looking up the per diem rate I found that was $227 per day for m&ie - not bad but it\u2019s really easy to rack up fees for trains and taxis. The good thing is that with per diem we don\u2019t need to retain receipts for meals and misc expenses. \n\nTypically I don\u2019t spend that much and this trip was no different. I probably spent $100 day or less on food and $75 on transportation/supplies. \n\nAnyway I got back to the states. File my expense report, and the division admin notifies me that their division policy is to reimburse actual expenses but I needed receipts! (In the 8 years I\u2019ve worked here, I\u2019ve never had a CONUS or international trip that used actuals). What a pain since most transportation doesn\u2019t give you a receipt unless you request it up front and since many of the machines were in Japanese often an attendant would help me, but skip getting the receipt. Basically the division was going to try and stiff me about $1k since they failed to notify me of their conflicting policy with corporate (after I netted an extra $30k revenue for the project). It was the first time I traveled and worked with this division. I complained enough apparently to the right people. Took a few weeks to sort out (turns out the corporate policy trumps division policy) so I eventually got the full per diem. \n\nWhat\u2019s crazy is that this division\u2019s policy sets no limits. So while $227/day is high for per diem, with the policy they were using, as project lead, I could have spent $1k per day, and as long as I had a receipt - it would be within their policy. \n\nWhat baffles me even more is that our rates are so high, it literally makes zero sense to have accounting have track meals as the time just needed to manage just eats into the margins.

            "I got this once too.  I don't leave less than $5 in most places, but I got things fairly cheap.  I pointed out that he still saves money with me, as I don't spend my full meal allowance.  I also told him that I'll start tipping out of pocket if he wants, but I will spend as close to exactly my meal allowance every day as I could.  For one week, I spent within 10 cents of my meal allowance every day.  When he got my expense report, he called and apologized for telling me not to tip as much, told me to add my out of pocket tips to my next expense report, and that he wouldn't bother me about tips anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince he apologized, I just went back to eating the way I was before.  He also revised the company's tipping policy right after, saying that we could be generous as long as we don't go over our meal allowance for the day.  He was a good person overall, but sometimes got bogged down in little details he shouldn't.",

They just micromanage people because they can.\n\nThankfully when I traveled, I got $100 a day that I could spend on any meals or incidentals.  It was like extra salary, so I didn't have to turn in receipts.\n\nOne girl sat down at the table with me and the menu and helped me find stuff that would work for my food allergies.  She treated it as if it were her problem to solve.  I got a $25 lobster (90s) and gave her a $25 tip because she was so helpful.\n\nI left cash on the table (a $50) and walked out.

My hotel had amazing free breakfast and my lunch was $5 from the office cafeteria. But my dinner... my dinner was $61.76, over because of the tip. The accountant flipped out over it. Didn't matter I didn't buy breakfast or only had a $5 lunch... I was over by $1.76 for dinner! I had to pay out of pocket for that $1.76. It became the running joke of the office. \n\nSame accountant also didn't trust Uber or Lyft so she started demanding we took the city taxi instead... which was easily twice as expensive.",
            "Back in the day, my old company allowed $25/day for meals while traveling.  This was barely adequate at the time, but if you were careful, you could make it work.... unless you were travelling to a particularly expensive destination.  This was not a $25 per diem - you were to submit actual meal expenses, and they would be approved \"up to\" $25.  My friend went to Switzerland for two weeks, and food was incredibly expensive.  He submitted his expense report (with explanation and receipts) showing his actual meal expenses, far in excess of $25/day.  Our new L2 manager - our boss's boss - sent it back for rework because the limit is $25/day.   He reworked it down to $25/day and resubmitted, again with receipts and explanation. Same L2 sent it back for rework because \"the $25/day limit is not a per diem, resubmit with actual expenses.\"  So he reworked it back to actual expenses and resubmitted.  Same L2 sent it back AGAIN because the limit is $25/day.  \n\nHe requested an immediate conference call with his L1 supervisor, this L2 jackwagon, and \\*her\\* L3 supervisor, and made his case.  The call lasted less than ten minutes and included L3 telling L2 to \"stop jerking him around and approve his actual meal expenses, and don't screw with people like this.\"  Sweet, sweet victory. "
