        "selftext": "3 months ago, My company had a 2 hour long seminar about e-mail phishing and how to prevent it. This seminar also included a update to our Email Software, Our software has a preview feature, If you hover over a link, It opens a preview of the link. Anyway I got an email from our \u201cIT Director\u201d saying I was in violation of their internet policy by using social media (a main part of my job) and I was stupid and opened it. It was a phishing test and they made me do another 2 hour long seminar. That week, I get the following email from our director\n\n*SENT WITH HIGH IMPORTANCE*\n\n*Subject: Phishing Email Test*\n\n*Hello everyone,* \n\n*This is a reminder to stay aware of phishing emails. Please review the PDF guide and take a short quiz (link) to test your skills by 5pm.* \n\n*Thank you,*\n\n*(IT Directors Name)*\n\nNow on this email attachment, One of the signs to report a email is if it is pressuring you to click a link. So I feel like that I should report this as phishing, So I did.\n\nI get this email from the director 1 hour later:\n\n*Subject: Reporting Emails*\n\n*Hello Everyone,*\n\n*We have received numerous phishing reports about the email about the phishing quiz. Please note, any email sent from: (insert IT director email here) is not phishing. We have included a new link for your convenience.*\n\n*Thank you,*\n\n*(IT Director Name)*\n\nTo me, This email looks even more suspicious then the last one, So I do the natural thing and report it to \u201cstay vigilant\u201d. I have been doing this over 2 months and everyone keeps getting an email saying that \u201cThis email is not phishing\u201d. Please don\u2019t make us sit through two hour seminars.",

            "My university makes a big deal about fishing once or twice every year and sends out a round of test emails to all of the faculty accounts to see who remembers the rules. When they sent out a round while I was last working there I think everyone but like 7 of us failed and had to take an hour long class about it. And then to the people who passed they sent out another email saying that we didn\u2019t have to go to the seminar because we passed and all we had to do to not take the course was to fill out a form. That little trick caught the other 6 people. Then my department head came up to me and told me he was proud I didn\u2019t fall for any of those traps. And he made a big deal out of it and I never had the heart to tell him I didn\u2019t know what he meant because I\u2019ve never once checked my work email.",

Can't be too careful these days!",
            "Our work used to have a huge thing about sending everyone in the company an email, telling you to click the link to read the announcement (went to a read only Google doc)\n\nThen IT security started doing phishing tests and sent the same style email.\n\nI think a lot of people reported IT security to IT security. I certainly did.\n\nIt only took a couple months and company wide email are now formatted very differently.",

At one training, we were given a list of 4 signs of phishing, and then later the company sent us an e-mail that contained all 4 things.\n\nDifferent story: once our company phished us: sent a suspicious e-mail, and anyone who clicked the link had to go to training. One of my co-workers assumed the e-mail was not legit, so he opened the link with cURL (for non tech people, that's a command-line tool where you can view text info about a page, but cannot execute anything like javascript)... and had to go through training. He knew a ton more on the subject than the trainer.",

            "I did tech support at one company and the CEO avoided the Service department. But about once a year he'd ring up the night support line to check that we were responding correctly. Apart from recognising his voice instantly (there were only 60 in the company), he also gave the game away by not knowing what kind of problem to ask for or not even knowing which 'lab' he was pretending to call from. Not all of our clients had a support contract.\n\nOnce when asked what lab he was with, the response was 'one out west'. Couldn't even name one. Another time he said he was from a city on the opposite side of the continent and demanded a field tech right then... a service we don't offer, and he knows we don't offer. His memory of the service department was him bootstrapping the company 25 years previously and being on-call 24/7 to the two labs in the city that ran his gear. Uh, things have moved on from then, guy. It's a four hour flight to cross the continent, even if we did want to go. We're not a single-client-city company anymore...",

You can do this in ways other than reporting the email as phishing. Call the person that sent it and ask them if it\u2019s legit if you need to. For your director to say that any email sent by any specific address is not phishing is just plain fucking irresponsible. Any account can be compromised at any time. No single user is 100% safe. Fuck me. To say a single specific email was not phishing is acceptable, but suspect. It should have come from someone else in leadership. \n\nExample: a client get an email from the CFO of another company that she regularly corresponds with. It has an attachment that the email claims is encrypted and she needs to login to view. This client happens to handle attachments in a very specific way and it\u2019s suspect right away. She calls us. We investigate. I call the CFOs company. His account was compromised through a spear phishing campaign. Same type of email sent to my client. \n\nI fire up a VM and open the attachment. It\u2019s the most convincing Microsoft login page I\u2019ve ever seen. The fucking support and help links even work. The icing on the cake was the loading animation was spot on. It sends your login credentials to some rando server in Azure and then it PROMPTS YOU FOR MFA. This shit is no joke these days. You\u2019re right to be cautious. Continue to do so. Fuck them if they get annoyed. That just means they don\u2019t take security seriously enough. \n\n*Steps down from soap box.*\n\nThank you for reading.

We\u2019ll call her Amanda. \nA few years ago, there was a big sporting event my family all wanted to get together and watch. We decided to all get together in my sister\u2019s house to watch it. She needed to upgrade her TV package to include more sports channels, which she was able to do online, on the TV providers website. Great.\nWe had a great day, watched the big event and ate and drank far too much. The issues started when my sister went to cancel the subscription, so as to not keep paying the higher rate for future months. Apparently, while you can upgrade your package and give the company more money online, removing the package was much more difficult, of course. They said the only way to cancel the package was over the phone.\n\nMy sister is deaf.\n\nSo needless to say, this was an issue. My sister had been emailing and complaining to no avail. At the time this happened, my brother was temporarily staying with my sister, and he called the company for her. The exchange apparently went like this (I am relaying what my sister and brother told me)\n\nBrother: \u2018Hi, I need to cancel the subscription to ExtraSports for Amanda Secondname.\n\nWoman: \u2018I will need to speak with Amanda.\u2019\n\nBrother: \u2018My sister is deaf, she can\u2019t speak with you over the phone.\u2019\n\nWoman: \u2018There\u2019s nothing I can do, I have to speak with the account holder if you want to cancel your subscription.\u2019 \n\nBrother: \u2018You need to speak with a deaf person on the phone.\u2019\n\nWoman: \u2018Yes.\u2019\n\nBrother: \u2018... and you don\u2019t see anything wrong with your current system?\u2019\n\nWoman: \u2018All changes have to be done by the account holder.\u2019\n\nBrother: \u2018Yes exactly, and the only reason this was set up was because she was able to make changes online.

When the offer was over, we were pretty happy with the service so we added it as a pay convenience. Meantime, ATT, our ISP, has not yet been out to repair the wiring so we decide to cancel. I call in, wait time to speak to someone is 2.5 HOURS. I don't have that kind of time, so I go online. Chat won't help me. So I go to ATT on Facebook. They won't help me. I go back and forth with these people literally six months, until finally, earlier this month I got a letter from them claiming I owed them over $400. So I called again, but was able to get someone on the phone fairly quickly. The first person I spoke to said there was nothing they could do as the account showed usage during that period. I explained to her that it was impossible to have any usage at all since April because the wiring for the internet was STILL hanging in my front yard of my house. We went back and forth for a couple of minutes then I asked for a supervisor. I got the huge no-no of \"they will just tell you the same thing\" then put on hold for ten minutes.\n\nSupervisor immediately apologized upon hearing my story, confirmed that she could see I had been trying to cancel for months, ATT had indeed not reinstalled my internet and deleted the bill immediately.

He yelled at kids for chalk drawings on the sidewalk. Total dick.\n\n2) We didnt speak often and he never mentioned the ice wall. I do not have any photos ... unfortunately. It was hilarious. Even sat on the edge of it and had a beer with my other neighbor!\n\n3) He moved to Iowa a year or so later. Hows this for passive aggressive? Thank god he moved because Iowa might be just nice enough to handle him.\n\nIs it malicious compliance, just malicious, or just compliance? I guess that's up to you.\n\nxoxo",

            "OMFG, what is wrong with this guy??\n\nOur neighbor got a new snowblower a couple years ago and we came home from work after a big storm to find him snowblowing our driveway. He apologized and said he was having so much fun he got a little carried away.\n\nWe told him he is welcome to continue getting carried away and thanked him by bringing over baked goods and helping him and his wife bag leaves the following spring...and fall... and ever since then we have a nice yard work exchange going on.",
            "I live in a place where 6\" of snow is not a big deal, it happens frequently enough. Not everyone has a snowblower, my family included, we have always just used shovels. My neighbor with the snowblowers is a GODSEND on heavy snow days. I don't care if it's 6:30 am or 11 pm. I try to time my shoveling when he does his, and he lets me borrow his spare blower, which we usually team up and get the whole sidewalk for the cul-de-sac.\n\nAt least you tried to be a good neighbour",

By the time I got my snowblower back in my garage to put a new shear pin in my neighbor was already over, with his much nicer snowblower, finishing my driveway for me. Told him I have mine fixed so he could stop, but he said to not worry about it and he'll be done in a few minutes. I need to figure out what type of beer he likes.",
            "Michigan here. \n\nI embrace no single possession, nor value any relationship, like my 3 stage snowblower. It is without question the coolest thing I will ever own or even consider owning. Self propelled, heated grips, treads instead of wheels, head lights, and almost 400 cc's of absolute snow demolishing fury.\n\nThere is nothing more satisfying than blasting a few thousand pounds of snow off of a city block for all of your neighbors. And the perks that come with it? Bottles of bourbon, fresh cookies and desserts, smoked chicken wings and sausages, never buying beer at neighborhood cookouts...\n\nGod dammit I love that snowblower.",
            "Moved into a new house in the country with some really old neighbours so when it snowed i used my tractor to clear their driveway as well as mine. After the third or fourth time the old man came out and bitched I was doing it too deep and moving the gravel (which maybe a moved a couple but it's impossible not to with gravel).....\n\n Well no problem you crotchety old coot, feel free to pay someone to do it, been 2 years since and I just smile and wave while doing my driveway.",

First snow they shoveled the snow into my drive and that did not go well for them. They got a snowblower after that snow and while I was out shoveling they snowblowed the snow where I had to still shovel. That also didn't go well for them and now I have to buy a snowblower. Their driveway is maybe 40 foot long. Mine is 109 foot long. His car is going to be buried along with his shed he keeps the snowblower in. I ain't telling him a third time.",

            "I live in Boston. I'm a cripple. When it snows, some of the neighbors don't bother to do their sidewalks.

            "I had that same neighbor here in Minnesota. Got mad at me once when I DIDN'T clear his sidewalk. I was out of town that week for work and my wife chooses not to blow (ahem...). Well, she's not going to hand shovel anything more than what she has to. So his walk didn't get done.\n\nThere was no agreement in place, no compensation. I did it because what's walking another few feet behind something that's self-propelled to help someone out? He moved away a couple of years later, but I never cleared his snow again after the choosy beggar confronted me.",
            "I snowblowed my neighbor's sidewalk last night, and was worried I'd wake up her toddler, but instead she just texted me a heartfelt thank you.",

I knocked to tell him I was done and that I wasn't willing to accept any compensation as I enjoy doing it. He invited me in, smoked a joint with me, then sent me on my way with a half ounce of homegrown weed. I now have another driveway to blow every time it snows and I'm good with that.",
            "I have had a 24/7 migraine for over 16 years now and even though it hurts when I hear the noise, I always silently thank our neighbors. I dont usually leave the house and my husband works a lot, its increasingly difficult to get everything done maintenance wise and its kind that for a neighbor who is a shut in like me and who only interacts by thank you notes that they still help. So thank you from a neighbor who appreciates neighbors like you more than I can say!",
            "My neighbor has a huge ass snow blower he bought in the fall of last year, but won't do our driveway even for money because we don't go to church. He got a lawn ornament wedged in there. The auger broke, third time he used it. I opened my garage door and started welding on a project. He stood there for twenty minutes staring at me.  I finally yelled 'Thoughts and prayers, ya snob'. \n\nI put a plow on my garden tractor shortly after he announced he would help atheists, and drive around offering to help anyone who wants it. We've had about ten inches since that incident, and the blower is just sitting in his driveway, he shovels around it. I guess the repair shops are swamped in a four day snow storm.",
            "I just moved to Ottawa and our neighbour owns a snow blower. He fucking loves that thing and will have it out even after only an inch of snow. He blows it at the weirdest times in the morning like 4 or 5, but that means our driveway is clear when we wake up for work.\n\n He's a fucking hero, not a nuisance.",
            "I had a co-worker, an older guy, who got a new snowblower and would race home everyday to beat the other guy in his neighborhood so that he could snow blow his neighbors sidewalks and driveways. He even left early a couple days so he could be the one to do it.\n\nI also live in Wisconsin. It really is the entertainment in winter.",
            "My neighbour has the snowblower, he gave me a key to his shed. If he's at work when it snows, not home or I get up first, I go get the snow blower and do his drive, my drive, sidewalks, and the neighbour on my other side and his other side. He does it if he's home and I'm not, or he wakes up first. \n\nI pay for all maintenance and gas, since he paid for the snow blower.",
            "Noise sensitivity is a real thing and effects a lot of people. Thank you for accommodating his wishes.",
            "Maybe this man has migraines that are triggered by noise? Or maybe his hypersensitivity causes him to be come agitated. I'm extremely sensitive to noise myself (as well as light), and the sound of yard work, vacuum cleaners, or power tools is enough to blast my agitation into the stratosphere. I get really irritable and upset with loud noises.",

            "My neighbor (older gentleman, been retired for a while) has a sweet little John Deere tractor with a snowblower attachment and will just ride up and down the street, taking care of just about everyone's driveway after the snowfall.

And the 4 neighbors to our left are all elderly.  \n He will then cross the street and plow down to our friends house (past an empty house, and a few houses that have older people in them) , and does their driveway and their sidewalk because they are a young couple with a newborn baby. \nNo one has ever complained about the noise.  And we gets lots of baked goods, and beer from our neighbors .",

            "My neighbor would clear out our driveway when it snowed all the time. My husband would tell him he didn't have to and offer to pay him for it. He would always refuse and tell us \"you guys have a baby and you never know when you might have a emergency and need to get out\". He is such a sweetheart and you are too.

One heavy snowfall I was out and decided to carry on and do their driveway too.  The husband came out and was actually mad that I would dare to do their driveway.

And when he does reach that precious state of deep sleep, he still wakes up at the smallest noise. I ve seen him cry out of frustration, it is horrible not to be able to sleep. So we have ear plugs, heavy curtains, magnesium, sometimes I sleep in another bed so my turning in bed won't wake him up and he can get some fckn sleep at least a few days a week. \n\nIf someone was doing us a favour by blowing the snow, I would also kindly ask them not to do it depending on time.

        "selftext": "A few years ago, I worked in an office with some pretty strange and crappy rules. One such rule was that while we could apply personal PTO (paid time off) for any reason, management needed a detailed summary of the reason before they would approve. This resulted in several instances of coworkers applying for PTO for things like funerals and birthdays and being told \"the current project deadline is more important than your neices birthday\" or \"do you really need to attend your mother's cousin's funeral? That doesn't sound pressing.\" It was a really toxic system that resulted in some turnover from coworkers who were sick of being held hostage over PTO. \n\nFurthermore, both the department manager and the HR manager needed to sign off on the PTO request, which resulted in some frustrating situations where one approved, but the other did not. It did not help that the HR manager was a dick. Pretty much the only time you could expect to be approved was for court dates and important medical appointments. But you still needed to provide details-- even if it happened to be a very personal medical or legal situation. (This does not strike me as legal but, sadly, this isn't the first time I've run into this working in Texas.)\n\nOne more bit of context-- my department manager was also a jerk. Without going into too much detail, he was a power tripping sloth who liked to harass women (like me). Let's call him Jerk, and the HR manager Dick. We all hated both of them.\n\nOn to the MC...\n\nI had an important appointment with my psychiatrist coming up. My meds for anxiety and PTSD were not cutting the mustard anymore and I was in a bad place mentally. I *needed* a med adjustment, so I took the soonest appointment available. Work would have to cope with a couple of hours without me.\n\nI submitted my PTO request to Jerk and Dick for approval. Given the intensely personal nature the appointment, I left the details sparse. It was rejected. Both Jerk and Dick said in an email that I needed to give details about my appointment \"in accordance with company policy.\" Jerk had the nerve to call me into his office and chide me over my \"unacceptably terse\" PTO request. \"You know the rules, why would you waste my time with such a brief request, you know I can't approve this,\" etc. \n\nI was pissed. But as I stewed in my cubicle, it dawned on me that I could get back at Jerk and Dick merely by complying with their own rules. I formulated a plan...\n\nI sent an email to Dick and cc'ed Jerk (always CYA folks.) I said are you SURE you need the details of my appointment? Are you POSITIVE? It's really personal. Both Dick and Jerk said yes, we need the details of your PTO circumstances, you know the rules. I replied that it's very private, are you SURE I need to talk about it? We sent some emails back and forth until I was sure I had a solid paper trail.\n\nThen I decided, welp, if they really need my personal medical details, which I still think is illegal, but whatever, then I suppose I better give it to them!\n\nI submitted a new PTO request with all the relevant information. That I was going to see my psychiatrist for an urgent appointment. I needed to be seen at the earliest possible time because I was having thoughts of hurting myself, because I have PTSD from being raped in foster care. I threw in some details about what my foster father did to me, how I went numb and used drugs to cope, how I was hospitalized as a teenager for a suicide attempt.\n\nI also screenshotted and emailed my request to a few of the higher ups, saying my previous request was insufficient so I wanted to make sure I got it right this time. \n\nI submitted it. \n\nThere were no snippy emails this time. Only \"approved\" appearing in green text to my request in the system maybe four minutes after I submitted it. \n\nI blissfully went about my day, happy to have my PTO. Curiously, neither Jerk nor Dick emerged from their offices.\n\nThe fallout:\n\nWhen I showed up for work at 8 the following day, I was immediately called into the VP's office. One of the higher managers and a woman that I recognized from legal were also present. \n\nVP politely asked me to sit and kindly explain the \"grotesque\" email I had sent out yesterday. (He was a polite but rather... out of touch older gentleman.) So I made myself clear-- I needed PTO for a very personal doctors appointment, and my previous request was denied by both Jerk and Dick for being too brief, and Jerk even called me in his office to complain about my wasting his time. I didn't want to be rejected again so I made sure my request was as detailed as possible. I also passed it on to management to verify that the level of detail was up to snuff when it came to corporate guidelines. And yes, I do have PTSD, it's all true, and they can reference my ADA paperwork in HR for more information.\n\nVP asked me a couple more brief questions. He then apologized for the hassle, said I was being credited some extra PTO for my trouble, and that the company would be \"reviewing its approach\" to the PTO approval process. I was then dismissed back to my desk.\n\nI received written apologies from Jerk and Dick that very morning, hand delivered by a tense and rather petrified Jerk. I think legal put him up to it.\n\nBoth Jerk and Dick went out of their way to avoid me for the remainder of my time at the company, which was a blessing. The few times we were forced to interact, they spoke very quickly and looked desperate to end the conversation. I guess my PTO request was a little too intense for them. Whatever the case, it was the end of Jerks little power trips, at least with me personally.\n\nAlso that same morning-- we received a company wide email marked as important. There was a change in the PTO policy. Requests with regards to medical and other \"sensitive\" reasons no longer required detailed explanations, effective immediately.\n\nBonus: one of my friends in HR-- well not really a friend, but a woman who liked to discuss crocheting with me at the water cooler-- showed me an internal email from Dick to all HR staff: every PTO request from me personally was to be approved immediately and without question. I tested this later that summer by requesting a day off to watch Netflix. That's specifically what I put in the request field. (I planned on quitting soon so I was in a flippant mood.) It was approved immediately. I think they had me flagged in their system. Truth be told I could have probably taken a whole month off and gotten paid for it, but I didn't push my luck.\n\nI left the company for a much more tolerable, less toxic, higher paying job about six months later.\n\nAnd yes, my appointment went well and I'm doing better now. I started attending a trauma support group, met my SO, and I've even been able to reduce the dose of one of my meds. :)",

            "Had something similar happen to me, but much less extreme. I had to deal with a health issue several that was quite...gross. Basically I had a giant roundworm infection that went unnoticed for about 5 months. It got really bad and I ended up with an intestinal blockage. Id been in China, so when I started pooping worms, I figured I had some kinda parasite. I asked my manager for a shift change so I could go to the doctor.

I was working for a bank a couple years ago and I have a spinal condition that has me on intermittent FMLA leave that I had to submit documentation for every day that I was out. If I didn't have a doctor's note, the request was denied, despite my doctor saying in the original paperwork that I don't have to see her every time, some days I just need to lay flat, take my pain meds and do stretching for five or six hours. Usually, it was a day or two that I was out, maybe once every other month or so. So I took a day because I literally couldn't breath from the pain. I was stuck on the floor in a strange position and every movement felt like my spine was being broken. I didn't go to the doctor, because I was tired of wasting her time. I took my pain meds, slept for a couple more hours, got up at about 10am and calmly stretched, rested, and stretched more until the pain went away by about 7pm. I was good to go for the next day. I go in and my boss asks me for my doctor's note to submit to FMLA. I told him I don't have one because my doctor doesn't require me to go in every time. They rejected my FMLA day and somehow rejected six more from the past year despite them previously having been approved (something about suspicion of fraud because I didn't have a note this time). So suddenly, without warning, I was over the HR set limit for unscheduled days off (FMLA doesn't usually count toward them, unless they get rejected) and I was immediately fired.

            "I shaved all mine off during the first wave of COVID. I'm a nurse and I worked in ED. I had an angled bob, with the longest front pieces at chin length. I found it difficult to keep it in a ponytail too because the short pieces at the back were too short. It was actually short enough to be able to wear down per the uniform policy, but it was getting in my face all the time. We weren't being supplied with surgical hats back then (a lot of my colleagues wore shoe covers on their heads, quite useful because you can wear them backwards and stuff your bun/ponytail into the toe) but I have a head like a bucket and they were too tight and gave me headaches, and that early on we weren't allowed cloth/reusable head coverings. It was also getting trashed with being washed twice a day (policy was before and after work) - so off it came. Did a #2 all over first time, but when it needed trimmed I went full skin. Grew it out a bit, dyed it blue black, waited until I had roots and then I intended to do a #2 again to get rid of the colour but we fucked up the guard settings and I ended up with an inverse mohawk so off it all came again. Now I'm growing it out, I'll grow it until it's back where it was and then decide which length I like the best. \n\nIt's been an adventure - I see my face very differently now and I realise how much of my life I spent hiding behind my hair. I'm more confident about my looks now, and realise that for me at least, hair \u2260 femininity. I felt weirdly *more* feminine and sexy without hair, which was very, very strange and unexpected. My hair has also thinned quite a lot as I've aged and although I'm nowhere near bald - not even patchy, really - I'd found it very upsetting and it greatly affected my confidence. But now I know that even if it all fell out I wouldn't mind, and if it came down to it I'd rather have no hair than patchy, wispy strands. So it was very helpful in that respect too.\n\nNot saying every woman would feel the same, or should do it, of course - but if you've ever wondered, go for it!

        "selftext": "My first job was waitressing at a 50s diner style burger-joint. I think I was about 16? It was a sweet gig. My coworkers were generally nice, the customers were a mixed bag. Though we did have one homeless guy that would come in and do our food challenge weekly for a free meal. He was cool.\n \nAnyways, to the story at hand, I had a family come in. If I remember correctly it was the tradition dad, mom, two kids. It was lunch rush and basically all the tables and the bar were filled. So, I\u2019m taking their order and the dad asks for a burger. \n \n> Me: \u201cWhat would you like on that burger?\u201d \n \n> Dad: \u201ceverything\u201d \n \n> Me: \u201cWell we have a lot of options\u201d  \n \nI gesture to the menu section containing the topping choices. The dad does a once over (clearly not long enough to read) looks back at me and states. \n \n> Dad: \u201cEverything.\u201d  \n \nAt this point, I should note we had a bunch of choices. Looking at the restaurants menu they currently have;\n\n- Mustard   \n \n\n-  Onions \n \n\n- Slaw \n \n\n- Chili \n \n\n- Mayo \n \n\n- Ketchup \n \n\n- Lettuce \n \n\n- Tomatoes \n \n\n- Pickles \n \n\n- Grilled Jalape\u00f1os \n \n\n- Grilled Mushrooms \n \n\n- Grilled Onions \n \n\n- Grilled Bell Peppers \n \n\n\n\nI feel like there was even more choices when I worked there. The place also had 4-5 cheese options. \n \nI ask the dad a few more times if he\u2019s sure. Even tried to list the toppings. His wife even tried to explain the situation. I could tell he was getting agitated but I also knew he\u2019s didnt know what \u201ceverything\u201d meant. Eventually, I take his word for it and attempt to get the rest of his order.\n \n> Me: \u201cdo you want cheese?\u201d  \n \n> Dad: \u201cI said everything!\u201d \n \n> Me: \u201cWell we have 4-\u201c \n \n> Dad: \u201ceverything!\u201d \n \nYikes.  \n \n*I want to point out he\u2019s literally yelling here. Those exclamation points are not for emphasis*\n \nWell I finish taking the tables order. On the ticket I remember specifically taking the time to meticulously write out every ingredient as clearly as I could. The tickets were small and each ingredient was denoted by an acronym so it was a challenge to fit \u201ceverything\u201d. I also made sure to include every possible cheese.\n \nI knew this monstrosity was going to be sent back. I knew it was an abomination. But I was determined to give that man what he asked for. The line cooks looked at me like \u201cyou sure?\u201d With a simple nod, I pulled the trigger.  \n \nI walked that burger out to the man with the biggest shit eating grin. It had to have been 2 pounds of sloppy, wet burger. The annoyance on his face would have been reward enough, but as predicted the father called my manager over and complained. \n\nMy manager came to me fuming. Clearly had been chewed out by the man.\n \n> \u201cYou know you have to ask the customers what they want on their burgers?!\u201d \n \n> \u201cI did. I-\u201c \n \n> \u201cWell the man at table 11 said he didn\u2019t ask for that.\u201d \n \nMind you I was still 16 at this point and timid. Still, I explained the situation. My managers demeanor change and he had a little smirk on his face. My manager asked me to follow him back to the table and grabbed a menu on the way.\n \n> Manager: \u201cHi sir, I need some clarity. What exactly did you ask for on your burger?\u201d\n \n> Customer: \u201cuh, everything but-\u201c \n \nMy manager opened the menu on the table pointing to the topping options. \n \n> Manager: \u201cSir, this is everything. This is what\u2019s on your burger. I\u2019ll be happy to remake the burger to your specifications **if you can give them this time**, but we are very busy and it could take a while. Classiestrobin please take his order.\u201d \n \nSo I did. I can\u2019t remember his actual order anymore, but it was definitely a more traditional burger. Probably took about 10 minutes to come out so his family was mostly done with their meal while he was beginning. We could\u2019ve taken another burger off the line to make his, but why make a chill table wait?\n\n  \n \n______ \n \nEdit: thanks for the gold/silver guys! \n \nAlso some people have been saying \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you give him the standard option?\u201d  \n \n1. This is /r/MaliciousCompliance I was maliciously complying \n \nB. My job didn\u2019t have a standard. The menu is set up so the customer first chose the kind of burger they want, then the cheese they want, then the toppings.  \n \nThis is a newer menu that what was there when I worked there but it kinda explains it \nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g59175-d12096365-i242780312-Hwy_55-Huntington_West_Virginia.html \n \n- if I were to guess what he wanted I probably would\u2019ve given him lettuce tomato mayo ketchup mustard pickles ... someone commented saying mustard is basically a sin. Other people have commented that if they asked for an everything burger they\u2019d want what I gave the dad. \u201cEverything\u201d doesn\u2019t mean the same thing to everyone \n \n-The guy was yelling at a 16 year old",

I am going to the liquor store next door.\" I tried to ask what he meant by everything and he just gave me a shitty look and walked out. I put every ingredient we had on that sub including all the sauces, mayo, mustard, and every veggie we had. Got finished wrapping it right as he walked back in. He paid and left.

            "\nReminds me of an \u201ceverything\u201d story about my dad. We would regularly go to a local mom and pop sub shop, the kind of place that didn\u2019t really have an ingredient list, but had a large assortment of toppings in a large stainless steel tray. Since you can\u2019t really see what the toppings are, the person making the sub would just ask, \u201cDo you want (blank)?\u201d Now my dad likes a lot of toppings on his subs so he would always answer yes. One day he got sick of answering yes to every question so he ordered his sub (possibly a roast beef I can\u2019t remember) with everything. The person talking his order ask \u201cAre you sure we have a lot of toppings?\u201d to which my dad confidently answered \u201cyes, everything.\u201d So they obliged him, but still asked about 3 ingredients. The first was relatively mundane I think it was shredded carrots, I thought a little odd for a roast beef sandwich but not too bad. Without missing a beat \u201cyes\u201d, my dad answered. I think the guy making the sub was just testing him on that one because at the end he ask in a confident tone, \u201cand what about raisins and peanut butter?\u201d My dad\u2019s a pretty stubborn guy so he still answered yes. As we walked home with his roast beef sub with lettuce, tomato, spinach, cucumber, green pepper, onion, mushroom, olives, pickle, banana pepper, roasted red pepper, sprouts, shredded carrot, provolone cheese (you could only get one), probably half a dozen condiments, raisins and peanut butter I asked him, \u201cDo you think that monstrosity is going to be any good? He replied, I\u2019m not sure but I didn\u2019t want to prove them right about having to ask about every ingredient and now I know all the stuff they have. After we had our subs he said the peanut butter wasn\u2019t as bad as he thought but he would pass on the raisins next time.\n\nA couple of months later the sub shop changed their policy of free toppings to a max of 5 free toppings. I like to think my dad was the reason for that.",

Humans aren't the brightest :)",
            "I was a manager at a burger joint (read a hometown - greasy fries and great burgers) The owner taught everyone how to make burgers his way.  He also had a long list - but if everything was ordered you rang the bell three times - after each time you ask to clarify. Had a dude order two burgers with everything. Ask him what he wanted on them - he didn't miss a beat - largest burgers with everything. - rang the bell and asked \"Are you sure you want it all?\" - he said everything - rang the bell a second time. I said, \"You see it will add to the cost of the burger. Are you sure you want it all? He said yes - rang the bell for the third time and rang up the order. Our largest burger was 5 half pound patties, 5 different cheeses, baron and sausage patty, a egg, chili, and a mountain of veggies.  Each burger was 18 bucks so I rang it up and he paid by card.  We started and finished it, then packed them in their own boxes.  He took the (double bagged ) meal of heros and drove off.  The owner relates when this guy comes back in breathing fire about us charging him forty bucks for two burger and a fry - and that we threw tons of unnecessary stuff on it. The owner looked at the board for we put the everything up and read it back to him. He then asked \"did you hear the bell chime three times?\" - He said \"yes but...\" - Boss then back me completely - and shut this guy down. Good times.",
            "Similar situation at a pizza place I worked at years ago. Guy comes in and says he wants \"a large pizza with everything.\" Not sure he read the menu or just thought he'd be getting a standard specially pie. \n\nThe girl ringing him up at the counter said, \"sir, we have a very extensive list of toppings. Are you sure you really want everything?\" Of course he was. So she dutifully rang in a large pie with onions, green peppers, mushrooms, sausage, spinach, beef, chicken, pepperoni, bacon, broccoli, steak, fresh tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes, black olives, green olives, banana peppers, red peppers, jalapenos, artichoke hearts, fresh mozzarella, cheddar, basil, pesto, tempeh, ricotta, and probably a dozen more toppings I'm forgetting.\n\nOh, and these each cost like .75 each for a large, some are double that since they are \"premium toppings.\"\n\nGuy's one large pizza ended up costing him something like $80-90. Of course he changed his tune after he saw how much \"everything\" cost.",

Pizza Hut uses a conveyor belt oven which has a door about 1/2 down so you can fix problems or cook for more/less time.\n\nFinally one time he decided he was absolutely done with this customer and decided to royally fuck up his pizza. He sprayed it with water before tossing it in the oven. He opened the middle door and misted it again as it went through. Then, he sprayed even more water when it was in the box. He said it was a mushy mess, almost impossible to box by the time they sent it out. \n\nGuy called back. He was *thrilled* with his disgusting, sloppy pizza. He asked for every future pizza to be just like it. And no, he wasn't fucking with us. He was actually happy. He ordered that monstrosity at least once a month.",

They were hands down the most disgusting pizzas I ever made. But the driver came back with a $10 for me. And then, every time that family ordered, they asked for me. It got to a point where only I was willing to make the monstrosity. *but they liked it*\n\nA few years later, still working there, they call in late one night, about 40 minutes to close. It was snowing like a bitch outside and I was actually hoping to close up on time and get my driver's home. The drivers themselves were also  weary of the roads and had already told me it was time to call it . And then I realized, the customer lived in the same neighborhood as me. So I made a deal. You let me bring it after we close, it'll still be hot and ready, and if you pay cash I'll give you 50% off. Dude jumped at the offer. He had just gotten back from a job that ran waaayyy late, and he was fine with waiting (gave him enough time for a shower).\n\nSo I show up, at 12:10am, in the middle of a blizzard to give this guy his disgusting pizzas. \"Mercury, you the only person who will make my pizza right.\" Then he gave me enough cash for the full amount of the pizzas, and a tip (under the impression that that I keep the extra). I jaw dropped and thanked him. Him, his family, and his crew had been great customers at this point. For years. \n\nHe just smiled, said marry Christmas, and handed me another twenty. Then said, text me that you got home safe. I ended up making a $60 tip that night. It was perfect timing too, as I hadn't had enough money to buy boots in a few years. \n\nMr. Kidwell, where ever you are, I hope you and your disgusting pizzas are doing great.",

I live in a small subdivision and have 5 neighbors total on my street.\n\nFor the past few years during the winter when we're getting a lot of snow or a bad storms, as I'm leaving for my overnight shift at around 8-9pm I'll put my wifes windshield wipers up on her car and do a quick walk around to my other 5 neighbors and put their windshield wipers up on their cars (obviously not if they're outside or something, but if it looks like they're in for the night). Many of them forget to do this, as many of them have children and it typically slips their mind, and their wipers will be frozen to their car in the morning.\n\nIt's just something nice I like to do to look out for my neighbors. They're all always grateful of this and thank me for it. Many of them started doing it too and there will be nights where I'll forget to put mind and my wifes up, and in the morning one of the neighbors has done it for us.\n\nAnyway recently one of our neighbor's moved and a new family moved in as of last week. It's a young couple and their two young children. The other night I was leaving for my overnight shift at around 9pm. It was snowing really heavy and we were supposed to be getting almost 30cm of snow and it was FREEZING out. So I put my wifes wipers up and do my usual quick walk around to the other neighbors.\n\nI was hesitant when I reached my new neighbors house, as I've only introduced myself once, but did it anyway. As I was putting the second wiper up on their pick up truck the husband came charging out of his front door yelling \"HEY WHAT THE F\\*CK ARE YOU DOING TO MY TRUCK?\" I tried to explain to him I was just putting his wipers up to help him. He continued to scream at me to \"get the hell off my property and don't touch my shit AGAIN!\". The wife then came out and started yelling at me too. I apologized and started walking away. Some of my other neighbors heard the commotion and came outside to see what was happening.\n\nThey tried explaining to him too that it's just something we do, both of them wasn't having it.\n\nFast forward to this morning, I'm arriving home from my overnight shift and as I'm walking in I see the wife of this couple struggling outside to break the ice off the windshield wipers of the truck. Guess she was trying to take her kids to school and the wipers were frozen solid on the car.\n\nShe sees me and yells over \"Hey there! Do you mind giving me a hand please?\" I look over to her and yell back \"No sorry, thought I was to never touch your shit again ma'am\" and walked back inside. She yelled back at me \"wow AH!\".\n\nTold my wife about this, she thinks I should've helped her because she was just trying to get her kids to school. I disagree as I was just following what they told me.",

            "So this story rings too true for me.\n\nI live on a very quiet street in Ontario Canada as well. When I saw that we were about to get 10-20cm of snow followed by rain I fired up my snowblower and went to work clearing my driveway and then began clearing the sidewalks and the driveway aprons for my neighbours. I do this whenever we have a heavy snow event so that people don't feel barricaded in or out of their driveway. Also we live on a street that is one of the last to be plowed by the city and when the plow comes by it will create huge snowbanks that once again i help clear with my snowblower. I don't want my neighbours to hurt themselves shoveling and I feel like I'm being a good neighbour and topping up my social contract with my neighbours.\n\nWell yesterday as I was clearing the snow from one of my neighbours, their next door neighbour (new renter) told me to clear their entire driveway for them. I said no problem, can you give me like $20? The fuel isn't free.\n\nHe said I was working for free clearing their aprons so I should just do it for free as well. I said, so that's going to be a no and didn't do his apron, I had already cleared his sidewalk but I almost went and blew it back (I clear the sidewalks every snow fall since the city takes forever to clear the sidewalks and when they do they tear of the grass on either side of the sidewalk).\n\nSome people are just dicks.",

Talk about how all the neighbors do it.  Offer to never do it again, or to start, whatever is their wish.  \n\nMaybe the new neighbors come from a place where NOBODY is ever nice.  Where the only reason people would ever touch your stuff was to steal it, or mess it up.

But that's about it.\n\nGenuinely curious, what's the climat where the wipers get that frozen?

Karen continues to use us a reference and was clueless we protected fellow business owners\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's call her Karen, just because it fits.   She came in and applied for a job and when I looked at her resume and application, I realized she knew some of my old neighborhood friends and schoolmates.   She interviewed well, so I gave her a job.  Told her to be in Monday at 9:00 a.m.\n\nMonday morning, she is not in, she no calls, no shows.  Tuesday, no call no show, I had now written her off.  Wednesday, she shows up about noon.   Claims she was in her basement Sunday night and her brother was working out and he accidentally knocked her out during his intense workout.  She claimed her doctor told her she had a concussion and she should stay home for a couple days.  She had no doctor's note, no marks on her head, but thinking her story was so off the wall it could almost be true, I  let her come to work the next day.\n\nShe worked Thursday and Friday.  We paid at the end of every week and I gave her a check Friday,  I also did NOT deduct the days she missed.   She came to me and asked about the full paycheck.  I told her we were a family business and realized people had lives outside work.  He tried to make sure people knew they were appreciated and tried to take care of our people.   She teared up and thanked me and said we could count on her.\n\nShe worked the full next week, did OK.  She seemed to fit in.  Seemed.\n\nThe third week, she showed up Monday, but Tuesday was another no show no call.  We did not hear from her for over TWO WEEKS!   When she finally showed up, her story was the stuff of legends.  She claimed her husband had forged divorce papers a couple years previous.  Thinking she was divorced, she moved back into her parent's house.  She claimed her \"ex-husband\" was at her parents' house when she got home the last night she worked.   \n\nHe told her he made up the divorce and the paperwork was phony so they were still married and he wanted to get back together.  She claims she refused and he kidnapped her.  She said it took her until a couple days ago to get away from him.  She wanted to come into work the next day.\n\nShe did not call the police and he wasn't arrested.   There was nothing in the papers or on the news about any of this.  She was not hurt (thank God!)   She asked if I believed her.  I did not, but told her that I really needed someone I could count on coming in reliably everyday.   I gave her a paycheck for one week (she had worked 1 day) and told her I wished her good luck.\n\nI had already replaced her, and her replacement was one of the best employees we ever had.\n\nHere's the malicious compliance. \n\nThe next month, I come in to a phone message that someone from XXX Company called for a reference for Karen.  As my secretary is handing me the message, she's laughing at the look on my face.   I asked if she was kidding, she said she was not.   She said she got a call from a man saying he was the owner of a company in the area and he asked about Karen.  Then my secretary asked if she could listen in on the call.   (she was a pistol)   She then goes and gets my partner and tells him I am going to call and give Karen a reference.  Now he is in my office laughing too!\n\nI call the guy and we make some small talk.   I tell him what we do and he tells me what he wants Karen to do for him.   I tactfully avoided answering any of his questions about Karen directly.   I think he was beginning to suspect something.\n\nRemember folks, employers can get in a ton of trouble for bad references.\n\nHe finally asked my opinion of Karen, and what I said was, \"IF you can get Karen to work for you, you will be VERY lucky\".    He heard what I said and how I said it.   He repeated that back to me exactly as I said it.   All my words were the right ones, it was my tone and intonation that got my point across.   He thanked me and hung up.  \n\n\nKaren comes into the office a couple days later, she looks mad but is trying to be pleasant.   She told me she is having trouble finding a job and mentioned she has used me as a reference.  She wanted to know if anyone from XXX Company has called me (she knew they did).  She told me she really want the job at XXX Company.    I told her I had been called and that I told the guy he'd lucky to get her to work for him.\n\nMy secretary confirmed that's what I told him, she told him she was right next during the whole conversation.\n\nKaren smiled and thanked me and headed to the door,  She said she wondered why she was having so much trouble getting a job.   She asked if she could continue to use me for a reference and I told her absolutely!   I also told her I'd tell everyone the same thing, that \"any employer would be lucky if they can get you to work for them.\"\n\nShe walked away smiling, happy and clueless.",

However, most every one of us can point to the organ called the \"brain,\" and like any other part of the anatomy, it can suffer illness and/or imperfections.  Ergo (I like that word), you are *not* \"mentally\" ill, but rather, suffer from a brain illness.\n\n3) Take care of yourself, first.  If your heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, colon, etc., were ill, it would be well understood and accepted that a) there is no shame in being unwell, and, b) you are *expected* to do those things necessary to preserve your health and life.  Medical treatments, time off work, rest, and anything else to help you return to a functional life are within the realm of *expected*.\n\nThis next part, I'm going to state plainly and bluntly, because it's important that *everyone* off-load the bs stigma of \"mental\" health (choices), and instead apply the fact-based evidence of brain illnesses.\n\nWhen someone dies from a \"multi-pharm overdose\" because they swallowed all of the pills they could find in their home, because thought of additional \"life\" in so much pain became intolerable, I don't consider that a \"multi-pharm\" suicide.  It is an avoidable death due to improperly treated brain illness.\n\nFuck the stigma; fuck the shame; fuck self-blame.\n\nIt is not your \"fault.\"  If you're still with me, I don't need to explain the \"J curve,\" and will encourage you to use that energy not on the past you're exiting, but on the future you deserve.  Yes, that J pit may happen again, but just like as in the past, it *can pass*.\n\n4) Take care of yourself, first.  Your brain is sick, but since that's the organ that defines our \"selves,\" your harsh judgement of yourself may be skewed against yourself, when those who know and care about you view your condition with much more compassion and understanding than you may accept.  It's not a *pity* thing.  It's a *s/he's ill and deserves our support* thing. \n\n5) Tell us how we can help, tell us what you need, in taking care if yourself, first.\n\nYou may not know, exactly, so tell us *that*, too.  Most of us care and want to help, because human, but many are clueless as to what you need, or how to help.  Whatever it is, we need to hear it.\n\nThink how many times you've heard and read, *\"If I had only known...\"*\n\nTake care of yourself, first, and let us know, let us help, let us be the loving, compassionate humans you deserve to support you when you're ill."

I ordered one and the barista looked me up and down and sneered \u201cthat\u2019s a Christmas drink\u201d\n\nMe - \u201cYes\u201d\n\nBarista - \u201cIt\u2019s after Christmas\u201d\n\nMe - \u201cYes\u201d\n\nBarista, smirking - \u201cSo I can\u2019t make you a Christmas drink\u201d\n\nMe - \u201cBut you\u2019re advertising it and you\u2019ve still got the ingredients open behind the counter\u201d\n\nThis drink is basically a shot of the flavoured sauce, hot chocolate, and cream on top. It\u2019s not that onerous or taxing to make compared to a normal hot chocolate. It\u2019s literally a normal hot chocolate with a flavour syrup put in.\n\nBarista, sighing and rolling his eyes \u201cit\u2019s not available right now\u201d\n\nI wondered if he was being a tool for some unknown superiority complex, was being lazy and didn\u2019t want to make this beverage, or if there really was some directive. So I threw up a weather balloon question\n\nMe - \u201cok fine. In that case, would i be able to buy a single shot of a flavoured syrup please? It says they are 35p on the board\u201d\n\nBarista, dismissively - \u201cI don\u2019t see why not\u201d\n\nMe - \u201ccan I order a shot of the black cherry syrup there, but in a medium sized takeaway cup?\u201d\n\nBarista tuts and silently turns, gets a shot of said syrup in a cup for me and contemptuously places it in front of me. \u201cAnything else?\u201d he sneers.\n\nCue my malicious compliance...\n\nI slide cup back to him and say \u201ccan you make a medium hot chocolate in this cup for me please, and stir it well before you put the whipped cream on top?\u201d\n\nBarista grimaces and realises that I\u2019ve followed his Instructions completely and still got myself a Black Forest hot chocolate.\n\nI stand and watch him make it, which he does with the most reluctant and bitter energy imaginable.\n\nFor the record, it was pretty good.",

When he did return, I asked for my drink and he told me he couldn't make one. I asked why not as they clearly had all the ingredients. He said no, that he would have to charge all the ingredients separately and it would cost too much. I told him that was okay, I was willing to pay, I just really wanted one at that moment. Nope, absolutely refused to make me it. I ended up with a pint instead. Very bizarre exchange, I still don't understand why he wasn't willing to let me pay over the odds for it.",

Also, definitely no other flavors of tea can be iced except for the pre-determined ones.
