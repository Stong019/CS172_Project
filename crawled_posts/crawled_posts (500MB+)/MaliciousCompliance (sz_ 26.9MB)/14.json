        "selftext": "This happened a few years ago, around the time I was 17. I had just started working at a small-ish cafe run by a well known family in our area.\n\nI knew some people who had worked there before and they told me for the most part the owners were great, very chill and laid back when it was slow and normally weren\u2019t bad about breathing down the employees\u2019 necks. Their oldest daughter who also helped run everything was the one who was very *peculiar*, and we\u2019ll call her Karen.\n\nI am officially diagnosed with a hearing deficiency: Not enough to be considered deaf, but more than hard-of-hearing, so I wear hearing aids. My first day before we opened my coworkers asked me if they could do anything else to help me out, and we eventually started talking about the hearing aids in general. While talking about everything I mentioned they had Bluetooth capabilities so I could play music through them. Not that I WOULD, but I COULD.\n\nKaren had been in the room at the time, and said \u201cYou can\u2019t wear those, no earbud policy.\u201d and tapped on the policies paper on the wall. I protested, explaining they\u2019re hearing aids and not earbuds, and that I wouldn\u2019t be using them to listen to any music while I was working. Her reasoning was I didn\u2019t \u201cNEED\u201d them because I wasn\u2019t considered fully deaf, and I was doing this to get around the no earbud policy, directly quoting when I said they could play music.\n\nI can\u2019t wear them? Okay, let\u2019s see how this goes. Placed them into the case in my bag and started my shift. \n\nI couldn\u2019t understand my trainer, couldn\u2019t hear the customers, couldn\u2019t hear when orders were called to be sent out. Things were going extremely slow, a couple of warmed pastries burnt since I wasn\u2019t able to hear the timers. Simple sentences had to be repeated multiple times with people basically yelling at me just for me to be able to piece a few words together. I guess the cherry on top was me \u201cignoring\u201d one of the owners when she tried speaking to me. Karen came up to me and tried addressing me about it, until she finally realized what was going on after she had repeated herself 5 times.\n\nBy the end of that shift, I was allowed to wear my hearing aids, no questions asked.",

            "I think there\u2019s a lack of understanding around what it means to be hard of hearing or deaf. My mom is deaf but wears cochlear implants to hear. I think it can be hard for her because people don\u2019t know right away that she\u2019s using a hearing aid (the cochlear implants) so they don\u2019t give her the benefit of the doubt when she has trouble understanding them.\n\n https://www.washington.edu/doit/how-are-terms-deaf-deafened-hard-hearing-and-hearing-impaired-typically-used",

            "Literally the same exact thing happened to me. I worked for a summer camp that didn\u2019t allow counselors to hang onto their phones during the week. My hearing aids connected to my phone so I can adjust the different settings and crap, so I got permission from the camp Director to keep my phone during the week. The counselor lead however went on a power trip and told me that I had to turn my phone in. I cited the ADA codes but he wouldn\u2019t budge. I turned in my phone for the day, then snuck into the main office and stole it back and went to the camp Director and told him what happened. The guy got fired by the end of the summer. He was pretty incompetent.",
            "I worked at an airport where they would get you hearing aids if you needed them after 3 months work\u2026. I got the blue tooth ones! Love em, they take calls great, they let me listen to audio books and rock out! They would get mad bc I was night shift and pretty much did my own thing, you could see me rocking it down the concourse on the tapes, but ADA and all that. They would try and yell at me saying no earbuds, I\u2019d say they were HA, then they tried to single me out and say no phones, but just for me, then when I pointed out my stuff was way better than others and said I would just leave and take my $3000 dollar toys with me (stupid expensive but not my money lol) HR got mad and told them to leave me alone, they had invested to much in me for me to leave after 4 months lol.",
            "If you were totally deaf hearing aids would be worthless to you. Plus this is a MASSIVE ADA violation.",
            "My wife has a similar issue and was prescribed hearing aids. She got Bluetooth capable ones because they came with a remote mic she could give to her college prof during lectures and whatnot. \n\nI got a chuckle at Karen stating you're wearing what was in my wife's case $8000 hearing aids just for the purpose of getting around the no earbuds policy.\n\nGlad you were able to take it in stride and hope the customers didn't give you any grief.",
            "Similar situation, but not hearing-impaired:  I had a job running a  loud piece of machinery, and got some noise-canceling headphones to filter out the roar of the machine, thus saving my hearing and making it easier to converse with coworkers.  The headphones were capable of music or other input, but I never used them that way, only to filter noise.  They helped me a lot, much quieter while using them.  But my boss refused to let me wear them, just because there was a possibility of listening to music.  Not uncoincendentally, I don't work there anymore...",

            "My sister had the exact issue. But she is a school teacher. There were complaints from students, parents and staff about why she got to use her earbuds but they weren't allowed to.

I tried to start a conversation and he didn't look over until a few words in. He then apologized that he was listening to music.\n\nI was so impressed with his invisible head phones that I had to ask for the brand, since they probably wouldn't fall out during workouts due to the slim profile.

I laughed at the comment the supervisor made about they are not deaf enough. \n\nOP mentioned that they were diagnosed which to me means that a qualified person has assessed the ability to hear and determined to be deficient from normal range either in volume or specific frequencies.  Regardless of any auxiliary functions that the hearing aid may have, it's still a medical device for assisted living - to hear. \n\nWould you take away someone's wheelchair away because their legs aren't paralyzed enough because the can take a few steps?   \n\n I assume the bluethooth's intended purpose is to assist with other activities like taking phone calls, etc.  Music is a bonus function that comes along with the audio bluetooth connection.",

However, at 3000 Hertz, I am sitting at (most recent hearing test 2 year ago) 110 ish dB, which is considered profound hearing loss. \n\nI do have newer hearing aids that support Bluetooth and it is nice considering I can not wear ear buds (can further damage hearing), but I probably shouldn\u2019t because it is similar to earbuds. It\u2019s kind of funny because my current boss knows I am hard of hearing so he can\u2019t really get mad or frustrated if I don\u2019t understand him while everyone else gets him frustrated.",

No nights or weekends. \n\nI ran into a similar issue where I was working at the movie theater, and part of the job is to check the temps and hand them to a manager so they can adjust in a theater if need be. Policy is no cell phones/electronic devices. If something is needed, you are to excuse yourself and walk to the corridor near the exit where no one can see you. Obv if its a call, leave the theater. I witnessed a Mom/Karen take out a bigger than normal and much brighter than a cell phone device. It was also buzzing super loud. I politely asked her to turn down the brightness or take it to the corridor and she turns to me loudly and says \"IT'S FOR MY SONS DIABETES THE TIMER WENT OFF!\" so I said \"Okay, so you knew there was a timer on it and you chose to let it go off in the middle of a theater? You could have easily excused yourselves and left before it went off to safely take care of whatever it is you needed to do.\" As she was unpacking it and trying to either test glucose levels or administer insulin...in a dark theater.

The Manager then reiterated the policy and advised next time she take her and her son out of the theater as any medial issues need to be dealt with away from customers and not in a dark theater unless it's an emergency which this clearly wasn't. The lady got pissed, started yelling at the manager, and finally I stepped in (I was also fresh out of Basic Training and at this point in my life did not care about this job or entitled twats..still don't) and I said \"Listen we got two options, you can either knock the shit off and go back in quietly, but if I see the device again you're kicked out without a refund, or I can kick you both out now without a refund as it's been longer than 20 minutes into the movie.\" - let's just say spent money is a really good motivator to get someones mouth closed lmao take another Xanax with your Merlot, Susan.

        "selftext": "Many years ago I worked for an outdoor activity centre/playland in the retail department. Throughout the park there were many different shops that we manned and I absolutely loved working there despite it being hard work for little pay. One day I had a run in with a manager who seriously berated me in front of the entire team along with others from different departments. I was advised by a manager from a different team to make a formal complaint which I did. Others came out with similar complaints and said manager was advised to find employment elsewhere, but not sacked. Now, unbeknownst to me, I triggered the chain of events that would lead to me leaving the company.\n\n\nNow before the main story there's some background info that is relevant to my malicious compliance. There were a few rules in place that were designed to prevent theft including no more than \u00a310 to be allowed on the shop floor which was to be checked before your shift, anything over this must be declared to management and left in your locker and all staff had to agree to random locker/pocket searches. \n\n\nIn the two years I'd worked here had never been picked for a random search. There were around several hundred employees so the odds were incredibly slim. As soon as our disgraced manager left I suddenly found myself picked at random for a search. This involved turning out my pockets, removing my shoes/socks and then being escorted to the locker room to empty the contents out. Nothing was found so I was sent back to the shop floor. The following week I was again picked at \"random\" for a search which again turned up nothing.\n\n\nRumours were soon doing the rounds that I had upset my departments remaining management team after instigating the action against my former manager and they were going to force me out using any means necessary. I realised that I needed to act so started job hunting and then began my malicious compliance. I started taking a backpack to work filled with \u00a320 in pennies . Every morning I declared the amount in my locker as required and sure enough after a couple of days I was once again selected for my weekly \"random\" search. I got paid to watch a security guard and supervisor count  2000 pennies. As expected I passed said search and off I went. This happened a second time with now \u00a330 in pennies and I decided to up my game. \n\n\nAt the start of the following week I patiently awaited my \"random\" search with glee knowing what awaited them. The day soon arrived and off I was marched to the lockers ready for their treat. I lift out my backpack and pass it to the security guard and supervisor who dive straight in without any gloves. Oh, how they retched as they discovered what was in there. I had several pairs of my period soaked pants waiting in there especially for them. They were gingerly laid on the floor beside my bag as they counted my bag of pennies. The smell from the pants was unreal, they'd been festering in there for days in anticipation. Once again the search revealed nothing and off to work I went.\n\n\nAfter that I was not picked for another search again. I left after a couple more weeks to a new job and keeping in touch with some people I discovered that new rule was introduced that tried dictating what you could and couldn't take to work with you. This soon led to a mass walkout of staff and after a year the place shut down due to unrelated matters.",

            "I had a similar thing happen to me. I complained about a safety issue at one of our monthly meetings when the corporate safety coordinator was present. He later pulled me off the floor and questioned me about the safety issue. It had been a problem the entire time I had worked there (at that point 3 years). Our operations manager didn't want to shell out several thousand dollars from the maintenance budget to fix the issue because spending it affected his yearly bonus. The corporate guy went around to all the machine operators and asked them if they had any safety issues with their machines. He then forced the plant to fix the issues. Every. Single. One. It cost over 40 grand.   \nAfter that I was picked for a \"random\" drug test every two weeks for the next 6 months straight. I loved it. I got paid to sit in an air conditioned office while I drank ice cold water till I had to pee. You see, it could get over 100 degrees in the plant and the only air conditioning was in the managers offices. I was constantly dehydrated by the time they would pull me to do the test so it took anywhere from half an hour to an hour before I could go.   \nThe Human Resources manager was a friend of mine and she was required to sit with me while I waited. My wife worked for the company that conducted our drug testing and I already knew the lady that conducted the test at our facility. So every two weeks us three got to hang out and catch up while I cooled off.   \nThe HR manager kept telling them that I was never going to fail the test. She thought it was hilarious that they were paying me to hang out while my supervisor had to do my job. Eventually they gave up.",

Part of my job was to get up into the ceiling and run Cat 4 cable so my group was able to come into work in jeans and a nice shirt.  New company wanted everyone to be in a Suit no matter what what.  After the change over, I get a phone call asking why I wasn't at work?  I said I didn't work for you.  They said I was going to be fired if I didn't come in immediately. I replied that you cannot fire someone that never worked for them.\n\nMeanwhile, I had already lined up two interviews for that day.  First one went very poorly.  I am a US Military brat.  Lived in all 50 states, half of Europe, and Turkey by my 19th birthday.  It required me to fill out an application for a computer position where there wasn't a place for anything tech related.  Even asked me for elementary school and junior high school.  It seemed more like an application for a job at McDonald's making minimum wage instead of a job making 100k a year.  I got everything transferred to it the best I could.  Got called into the interviewer's office.  He started out saying what the position entails. Asked me if this was something I would be interested in and I said yes.  He sounded more like MLM sales person than an HR person.  He ask me more questions and I answered to the best of my ability.  He then got to my schools. One was DoD Schools Izmir, Turkey.  He asked what DoD meant. In my mind I was thinking did grow up under a rock being that NASA was a big employer.  I answered Department of Defense. He asked why I would be going to school in Izmir, Turkey.  I really thought that it was none of his business. However I told that my father served 30 years in the US Army.  I was asked some more questions about my ability to work that the position and I answered them to the best of my ability.  He returned to my schools. I once again said that my father served 30 years in the US Army.  We moved on so I thought.  He asked more questions about my computer work. I answered them. He returned back to my schools. I had it at this point  so I grabbed the paperwork out of his hands and ripped into a million piece.  I threw them over my shoulder saying as loud as my voice could be that I don't need this job that fuckin bad. I slam the door so that I thought the glass was going to fallout. I actually got a stand ovation from people working in the common area.\n\nI went to my next interview.  The person I was interviewing with knew me.  I got the position.\n\nThe morning the first call I got 2 calls. 1st called was from the company that I don't work for that insisted that I did saying that I was fired for not showing and asking were to send my final paycheck. And, the 2nd one was from my 1st interview the day before.  The guy that identified himself as the president of the company.  He started of apologizing for the way interview went.  He said that he wanted to hire me. He had pieced my resum\u00e9 together and read it.  I said sorry I had already accepted an offer.  He said if I ever change my mind or am looking that he would be sending me his business card with his direct contact info. He apologized again before we said our goodbyes.  The next day I got his card.  Still have it.  The last I checked he was still president.\n\nTwo weeks later I received a $2,000 check from the company I never worked for that insisted that I did.",

        "selftext": "My first job out of school was as a language teacher in a private school, and it sounds like it's straight out of a fiction book. I was employed to teach Grade six to nine. However,  because  I was the only teacher for that language, the owner begged me to teach grade one to five when I had any time to spare( I wasn't paid for the extra work). I taught each of the classes I was employed to teach, twice a week, and the other classes once a week. Aside that, lunch duties were added to my work, so I hardly sat all day.\nThe school had a preschool at a different location, and all the teachers there wore uniforms. The preschool workers(all females) were the only ones required to wear uniforms.\nI was the only female teacher on the Grade one to nine staff. \nOne day, the owner calls me to her office and asks me why I'm not in a uniform like the preschool staff. I tell her no one informed me about wearing uniforms in my department, and also the male teachers do not wear uniforms.  She gets slightly angry and orders me to sew one with my own money.  I try to protest but I see there's no way getting through to her. My parents convince me to let it go and sew one.\nWhen she sees me in the uniform, she goes off about how figure flattering the uniform is on me, tells me I'm trying to seduce the boys, and  calls me a prostitute. She orders me to sew a new one or don't come back. My uniform was not short(way below the knee) didn't show cleavage, nor was it tight. \nI ignore her and she fires me a week later, while I'm in the middle of a class. I just packed my stuff and left. \n\nThe next day, the principal calls me to tell me the owner is asking why I didn't show up that day. Duh. You fired me. She calls me herself and orders me to come back to work, talking about how do I expect the kids to eat lunch. Good luck finding a donkey like me to work for that pittance. I went back though, but not without double my pay. I then quit the next month.\n\nEDIT: I'm glad the whole ridiculousness of my story makes its authenticity doubtful, but it's not uncommon behaviour in sole-proprietorship schools where I come from.

So if you managed to beat the record, that was the new standard for everyone he timed.  He would fire you, send you home, and then call you screaming for not showing up for work the next day.

Staff turn over was real high, with the vast majority being on temporary contracts and the promise of a permanent contract being hung over people heads to make them suck up being treated like crap. \n\nAfter working there for about two years, in late February of that year I was offered a permanent contract because they wanted to put me on their team leader programme. \n\nThe pay was slightly  better, the job security was better, the only major difference was how holidays where handled. People on temporary contracts where paid for any unused holidays at the end of the working year in April. People on permanent contracts had to use their holidays or they would lose them. \n\nI had just over 3 weeks holidays saved up, so the day I accepted I booked 3 weeks of in March so as i wouldn't lose them in April. \n\nMarch rolled around and my manager told me that my holidays had been refused. I said that's fine as long as they pay me for them, and he replied that no if you dont use your holidays you lose them. I said that i was trying to use my holidays and they where not letting me. He shrugged said it's the \"duty of the employee to manage their holiday time wisely and I should read my contract\" despite the fact i had only gotten that contract 3 weeks earlier and the holidays worked differently. \n\nUnderstandably annoyed that evening i went home and read my contract from beginning to end and discovered my manager had overlooked one crucial part of the paper work. \n\nThe contract clearly stated I had to give a weeks notice, and that any holidays not used would be paid to any leaving  employee in full on their last paycheck. \n\nThe next day I came into work and announced I would be quitting unless paid my holidays or allowed to take the time off, and if they accepted my notice then to be sure my holiday days was included in my final paycheck. \n\nMy boss asked me if I was really going to quit over this, and I replied was he really going to lose one of his most reliable employees over this. \n\nHe wouldn't budge, I assume he thought I was bluffing. \n\nSo I handed in my notice, and on my leaving interview with my managers manager made sure to explain exactly why I was leaving. \n\nAnd yes my final paycheck did include my unused holiday days.\n\nThe end.",

My union steward filed a grievance which became a National grievance and affected all of the USA.  Now, if a person has accrued a lot of vacation hours, and a manager refuses to grant the employee vacation when requested, it became mandatory that the assigned workload had to be reviewed by both upper management and the union.

Company policy.\"  \nMe: \"Then I'll quit instead.\"  \nSupervisor: \"Wait, maybe (Guy who trained me) can do that position that week.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor why their policy screwed them over? The only guy who worked overnight (barring weekends) hadn't taken a paid day off in over 25 years. When his PTO got high, he'd cash in a couple weeks for more money. When the company discontinued that, he instead took a month off. Manager suddenly realized they had literally nobody who could cover for this man because it's never been needed.",
            "Similar situation for me lead to my quitting. \n\nThe company I was working for dumped the entire Paid Time Off balance into your account 2 weeks after your hire date anniversary. So everyone knew exactly when their PTO would be available and would request time off well in advance, even though \u201ctechnically\u201d the PTO hours weren\u2019t even in their account yet. \n\nWe had 100-200 security guards at this company, so you really had to request time off WAY in advance or it would get denied. \u201cThe contract comes first\u201d bullshit.\n\nMy PTO balance always hit my account in May, so in like January 2014 I requested time off in June/July to go on a cruise with family in the Mediterranean. They begrudgingly approved my request then decided to change the rules. \n\nThey made it so that in order to request time off you had to have at least the same amount in your account balance already. So in 2015, I had to wait until May before I could put in for PTO. By then, the \u201cwaiting list\u201d was already into January 2016. \n\nI was 100% going to Africa in July/August and so instead of putting in PTO, I filed a 2 week notice of resignation. I was \u201cmoving to the Caribbean\u201d. Lol. \n\nMy trip was fucking AMAZING and that job sucked ass anyway. Fuck em.",

            "Id worked at this place for about 8 years. I was the Plant Supervisor and my direct supervisor the president of the company. President and I were discussing mine and his upcoming travel plans. My wife was also pregnant with our 2nd son at the time.  Since we were talking leave plans he told me to take 1 week paid paternity leave when my son is born. I thanked him for that, knowing I still had a few months to go before then. \n\nIt so happens my son was born while the President was on vacation himself. I called our Director of Sales and told me what was up as he was the only other senior manager on-site. He would handle things, he said.\n\nPresident calls me asking where I was, he heard I was not yet at work. I told him I was at the hospital because my son just arrived. He congratulated me, and then asked when I expected to be at work to oversee production. \u201cYou told me I had 1 week paternity leave when he\u2019s born.\u201d I say.

            "I had very similar. \n\nI worked in the last shop in a mall that was closing down. We all knew this, the shop was only still there because of a contract dispute. \n\nThere was only me and two other members of staff, but the job was easy if boring. This meant I couldn't get holiday as there was never cover. \n\nNot the end of the world. I was promised I'd be allowed to roll that time over to the next year. \n\nOne day the security guys who worked for the mall rather than the store dropped in for a cuppa. Lovely guys. They asked me what I had lined up when the shop shuts next month. \n\nExcuse me? The company kept telling me the store was going to be open for months. Security guys assured me they were both employed at other places starting the next month. If I turned up for work, the building would be locked. \n\nSo I called my boss. He begrudgingly admitted the shop was indeed closing down on the set date, and I would be moved to another store in another town. I didn't want a job in another town. So I asked about my holiday that was to be deferred. He hadn't even thought about the 4 weeks holiday I had accrued, and bluntly told me the it would be my new manager's problem, and not to expect a new manager to honour it. Since it was after the end of year, and there was nothing written down to say I could defer it then I'd lose it. It became obvious he knew exactly what was happening and wanted to keep me working until start of financial year when the shop would close down and none of this would be his problem, or on his budget. \n\nRight. Screw you then. It was 5 weeks until the shop shuts, and I had to give one week notice. So I quit there and then. \n\nThe boss was aghast. \n\n'Can't you stay until we have packed the shop up, there's a lot of work we need to do.'\n\n'No feller, there's a lot of work you need to do. I'm not helping you for free.'\n\n'It isn't for free, you'll be paid.'\n\nHe couldn't fathom that if I stayed and worked those 4 weeks, I lose 4 weeks paid holiday. That work would essentially be unpaid. If I leave now, they legally had to pay me the holiday pay and I get a month off. \n\nSo I settled down, spent a week relaxing and playing Nintendo, and found myself another job after a couple of weeks. \n\nSeveral phone calls and voice mails from the old boss in that time begging me to help him out, and that his workload was too much. \n\nNope. You're a manager. Manage. You bought this on yourself by trying to screw me a month's wages. \n\nThey say shit rolls downhill. True, but every now and then you get a chance to throw some back.",

Simply put - hated the 'unique' spelling of my first name and wanted to ditch my surname.\n\nDidn't have much trouble updating my name most places. Social security, driver's license, insurance, yada yada. No bumps in the road until I got to the very last thing to update. My credit card. I use this particular credit card a lot. I'm self employed and use this card to rack up travel points for flights, hotels, rental cars, etc. However, if you've ever checked into a hotel or picked up a rental car, you'll know the name on the card must match the name on the ID.\n\nSo I call the CC company. Told I have to fill out a certain document and mail that in, alongside a copy of the court document. Fair enough. Two weeks go by. Hear nothing, so call again. They say they haven't received it. I'm then informed they have a fax number that I can use to send in the documentation.\n\nSo I fax in everything necessary using an app on my phone.\n\nAnother two weeks go by. Still nothing.\n\nI call again. Same spiel on the other end of the phone. \"Please mail or fax......\" You get the deal.\n\nI once more did what they asked. Yet another week passes. \n\nI call.... *again*. Told the same damn script. I'm starting to get annoyed by this point. I have an upcoming trip planned and need the card to match my ID. So I ask to speak to a manager. They give me some BS of a manager not being currently available\n\nAnyways.\n\nI fax in the document and court order once again. However, this time I decided I was just going to keep hitting send after the previous one had shown as delivered. I thought I'd repeat the process a few times. Just to \u2018make sure\u2019 they got it. \n\nAfter sending it 25 times the first day, I got no response. Next day I was sitting on my couch watching football. Thought I'd send the fax a few more times. By the time I realized how many times I'd hit send, I had sent it over 130 times.\n\nThe very next afternoon I got a call from a manager at CC company. She sounded quite angry over the phone. I just played dumb. \n\n\"You guys asked me to fax it in...\"\n\nI got my updated card in the mail 3 days later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**tl;dr** - Spent almost 2 months trying to update my name on credit card. CC company gave me the same run around every time I called \"Just fax us x and y.\" Faxed them X and Y about 150 times. They finally sent me a new card with the correct name.\n\n\nEdit: holy heck this blew up! Glad I could provide some entertainment. Go forth and maliciously comply my friends!\n\n(I\u2019d also like to mention how painfully easy dealing with Social Security and the DMV were in comparison. For whatever reason, CC companies would look at my updated driver\u2019s license, social security card, and court order document, but still not be convinced my name had changed.

        "selftext": "Throwaway because it'll be easy to find my real identity.\n\nIn 2008 I was involved in a Federal lawsuit when my rural Texas High School tried to suspend me for wearing a shirt supporting then democratic hopeful John Edwards. (Hindsight is 20/20). They said it was a violation of the dress code, which was only ever selectively enforced.  My parents had my back and agreed that it was, to quote my very white dad \" redneck cracker nonsense\".\n\nI'll never forget during the initial meeting when my principal called in a school board member.  He said that if I got suspended I would probably get kicked off the football team, and that could hurt me getting into college.  It didn't matter, I was a miserable player and a smart kid so it wasn't gonna be what took me to college. But the slimy fake concern as he tried to leverage my future against my speech is something I'll never forget.\n\nAnyway as the case goes on the squeeze gets tighter.\n\nFirst they have the football coaches try to get me to drop it, having the football coach's talk about how my \" selfishness\" means that they can't wear Fellowship of Christian Athlete shirts anymore, trying to embarrass me in front of the team.  I'm a fat kid who openly plays Magic the gathering in highschool, hit me with your best shot i have no shame.\n\nNext they host a meeting with all the teachers telling them I'm a \"problem\" and that they need to keep an eye on me in case I \"slip up\". I found this out years after the fact when I bumped into my English teacher at a friends wedding.\n\nFinally, they just start pulling in students from my classes to get them to say bad stuff about me.  I was a class clown so this turns into every single dirty joke, rude comment, or loud fart i ever made getting reported to school administration.  Which then leads to this awful little toady vice principal calling me and my parents in and reading them back **in front of my mother.**   That one stung.  My parents still knew it was bullshit but who wants their locker room jokes aired in front of their mom.\n\nThey used this as pretext to expel me for 6 weeks, citing \"inappropriate sexual conduct\". They shove me into the Disciplinary Alternative Education Program, and i am fucking steaming.  The Program is basically where they warehouse kids with emotional problems they can't handle, you just sit in a room in a refurbished insane asylum and can't do anything but read or use the computer for monitored educational purposes.  You also get booted from extracurriculars while you're in there.  I know at this point they want me to make a scene so they can punish me further, so I do the exact opposite.\n\nI channel all my rage and new free time into my school work, doing homework I would usually ignore because I knew I could ace the test.  Now I'm doing both and my GPA is climbing.  I start looking into scholarships and find a bunch that are really interested in political activism and guess who now knows a little bit about that, I apply and rip my school a new asshole in every one. Then, i work with my dad and we find an attorney who will take our case pro bono, which means while the school bleeds fees it doesn't cost us anything to keep it in court.   I spent those weeks like a monk, motivated entirely by spite, doing everything i could to make their bullshit work for me.\n\nI got out, got back on all my teams, and ended up  applying for a prestigious honors program at my dream school.  Not only did I get in but I got way more financial support than I thought I would.  Eventually we lost the case, but the school had to abolish the dress code anyway because they couldn't afford to get sued over it again.  I don't like the idea that a school lost money but man they made the choice they could have backed down whenever. Now I've graduated law school, am taking the bar in two weeks, and already have a job investigating government corruption. I'm getting paid to be a pain in the ass of petty authority, and it's pretty sweet.  \n\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the awards. To the many people who have expressed concerns about my Dox, it would be more or less impossible for me to talk about this story without doxxing myself.  I have no other social media,  and i'm completely comfortable being linked to this story.  Therefore, i am largely unconcerned with the information being out there.  I'd rather share the story than live in fear of some truly motivated maniac committed to targeting me. ",

            "I attended high school in the Metroplex and ran afoul of the \"Zero Tolerance\" policy twice. First time, as a freshman, I was shoved head first into a cinder block wall which split my eye open at the eyebrow. I then punched the kid and while it landed, it didn't really mess him up at all. I wasn't really a fighter or a tough kid, so while I knew how to throw a punch, it wasn't like I was prepping for MMA or anything. Before either of us could continue we are separated and we both get 3 day suspensions, but I also get 5 stitches. I decided that if I am going to get punished either way, I might as well win the next fight, right?\n\nSo, I switched my PE class to weight lifting and focused on just eating better. I wasn't looking for a fight, but I didn't want to weak anymore. My sophomore year was when the growth spurt happened and by the end of it I was 6 feet and about 220 pounds. I didn't get picked on anymore, but there will still jerks. Still, no fights, until Senior year.\n\nDuring a lunch break I met up with friends in a hallway before going to the last class of the day. One of the girls in our group had just broke up with her boyfriend who was a douche and was just chilling with the group as she vented about it. Well, the Douche, came up and started saying shit to her and trying to make her leave with him \"to go talk\". She is refusing, the rest of us are calling him out...you know the scene. Well, he grabbed her backpack to pull her and she lost her balance and fell. From where I was standing it looked like he had intended it to happen, so I challenged him. He turned with a fist and I basically directed it past my head, grabbed him, and flung him head first (using his own momentum) into a Coke machine. The plastic sign broke and he got a few cuts. My friends and the girl defended me so no charges, but I was suspended for 3 days again. Spent them at the airport and made $800 by washing planes.\n\nStupid rules are stupid.",

        "selftext": "So I am a business consultant, and usually during the week we are at client site and get paid for travel, meals etc. The meal reimbursement policy is quite flexible, and doesn't limit what we can claim, like some of the other consulting companies. So we can claim lunch, alcohol, whatever. The policy, however, does lay down a GUIDANCE for a daily limit for food expenses, based on the country where you're travelling. I capitalised the word GUIDANCE, since that is exactly how it is written in the policy - it is a guidance, not a hard limit. For the UK, where my current project is, the limit is \u00a340 per day, which is mostly ok, but can be a bit low if you're in the centre of London for example.\n\nNow I do Intermittent Fasting, so most of the days I don't have breakfast and lunch, and just have one big meal a day, and have no problems keeping to the \u00a340 (usually around \u00a320). On some days, I might go to a fancy restaurant, have a couple of scotches with a steak, and run up a $60 bill. But during the course of a 5 day week, my average meals would run about \u00a330 a day, if not less. \n\nI've never had a problem claiming these expenses in my 9 years with the firm, but recently a new project manager (read bean counter) came on board, and he sent back a couple of my expense reports for having meal expenses in excess of the \u00a340 for a couple of days, even though the average meal expense over the week was much less than \u00a340.\n\nI tried to reason with him, told him that anyway it was a guidance and not a hard limit, and I was keeping the costs down on other days, he refused to budge and said I could only claim \u00a340 a day for food.\n\nSo guess what, I started doing exactly that. Every day, I made sure I was claiming \u00a340 or thereabouts for food. I started buying meals for the homeless people around the train station to make sure I could make up the \u00a340. \n\nSo now, where I was claiming less than \u00a3150 a week for meals, I now claim \u00a3200 and get some good karma for it.\n\nEdit: Wow! This blew up! I went to dinner after work (gotta make sure to get the \u00a340 worth of food in), and got back to thousands of upvotes, hundreds of comments, gold, silver, front page, and god knows how many subreddits I\u2019ve been added to! \n\nThanks a ton folks! Glad to see my little way of getting back at the man has given you some entertainment!",

            "Went through the same thing couple years ago, but ours has limits on oer meal per day.  For example $15 for breakfast and $20 lunch and $30 dinner. \n\nMost of the team we would usually skip breakfast and have cheap lunch on the go and have a nice dinner.  So depending where you are at it wouldn't be shocking to see something like this.\n\nBreakfast $0\nLunch $7\nDinner $45\n\nWe all got slapped on wrist pretty hard couple months in the row.

            "The company I work at used to have a daily limit on how much you can spend on food expenses when you travel, something like $70 per day. They noticed after a while a lot of people would try to actively spend the entire $70 limit on food each day, similar to what OP is doing. \n\nThe limit was there kind of as a worst case scenario. It\u2019s like \u201cyou can spend up to $70/day on food\u201d not \u201cyou should be spending $70 on food each day\u201d.\n\nSo they ended up changing the food expense policy to not have any limits. It just says something like spend as you normally would when you eat out. It\u2019s really interesting because now it\u2019s a like a personal moral limit that\u2019s in place. Saves the company money and it\u2019s pretty flexible, if you wanted to splurge one of the night and get $100 just on a sushi dinner no one would really care.",

            "I did this exact thing when my supervisor also tried imposing a limit, where the company policy literally stated it was a \"guideline\" and \"discretionary depending on the event\".  She rejected about $20 of my expense report because of ONE meal that went over, even though I was more than $10 under the so-called limit for every other day of the trip (and she would not budge even in light of that fact).  I was incensed... to say the least.\n\nThe thing was, not only was I normally falling well under the supposed meal \"limit\", there were dozens of items that I normally left off of my expense reports out of sheer laziness (or, more accurately, an unwillingness to keep up with such trifles because of how time consuming they were and how cumbersome our vastly antiquated expense reporting system was).\n\nWell, no more.  From then on I hit every meal limit every single time, and no expense was \"too small\" to leave off my report... plus, there were all kinds of things that I could quite reasonably (and legally) ADD to my expenses...\n\nBy way of example, on my previous (14 day trip), when they flew me to Alaska, my personal expenses and meals totaled exactly $308 (not counting fuel for rental vehicles).  I know this because, even though I have not worked for this company for more than 6 years, I still have all my old expense reports still sitting in my filing cabinet (now on my desk as I type this).  Roughly 6 months later (and only two months after this disagreement over the $20), they sent me on the exact same 14 day trip (which was awesome because I got to experience Alaska in the dead of winter, and then smack-dab in the middle of summer... but I digress).  Again, not counting fuel, my personal expenses for that second trip totaled $804... a difference of $496 and a 161% increase.  And it wasn't just this one trip... ALL OF MY EXPENSE REPORTS more than doubled after her refusal to reimburse me for that $20.  Prior to that event (excluding those two Alaska trips), my average reported expenses for the prior three months were $423 per month... for the three months following... they were $918... a 117% increase.\n\nThe moral of the story being...\n\nDON'T FUCK WITH EMPLOYEES OVER EXPENSE REPORT TRIFLES.",

            "I had a manager who killed per diem for us because he thought people were somehow making extra money off of $50/day by eating cheap food. Per diem was great because we didn't have to track receipts -- if you spent a night somewhere, you got the money. The new limits were $15/25/45 for breakfast/lunch/dinner, and now I have to track receipts, so I made sure that I spent near the limit for every meal. I rarely eat breakfast so I would just go to the grocery store and buy a bunch of food to take home then submit it as a breakfast expense. For dinner I would hit steakhouses and get a couple beers instead of going to cheaper places. Per diem is supposed to cover other incidental expenses as well, so I'd expense random shit I needed for travel too. Instead of paying me $45-55 per diem they ended up paying me $70-80/day for food expenses, plus whatever else I \"needed\" while traveling.",

So I made sure to tip in cash. \n\nAnd he says, \"But this is just one meal.\"\n\n\"Yes, it was.\" \n\n\"You shouldn't spend that much on one meal.\"\n\nThere's nothing in the policy about per meal. It's just a daily limit. But I had to spend half an hour listening to him lecture on how I need to not go over my limit, and how could I have spent this much on one meal?

It was like $5 because I didn't want to stiff the server, I didn't have any cash on me and my lunch was just about $14.\n\nI pointed out where it said that the total for the day is $70 and as I had a light breakfast and dinner so my total was less than $50 for the entire day.

            "So back in the nineties to curb the crazy excessive expenses of my boss, our CFO sent out a memo with a pretty generous $60 per person per meal cap. Up until this point we hadn't had any caps on expenses. About a week later my boss holds a department breakfast meeting at a notoriously cheap pancake chain - and tells us all that we can only have coffee and a roll. Weird but whatever. The next week I take a couple of new hires to lunch to welcome them and go over policies etc., And when the time comes, submit my expense report. My boss flags the lunch, crosses out the actual total, puts a new total of $60, signs off on the report and gives it back to me saying there's a cap of $60/per meal. Oh. Ok. I take my ER over to the CFO that evening (they always did expenses after hours) and I'm like \"Mike, he thinks it's per meal.\" The CFO choking on laughter said that for the past few weeks all my bosses meals had been $60 no matter how many people were with him.

The hotel we were staying at served breakfast and dinner so no one was coming close to their limit each day. So at the end of the second week we all went out for a huge diner and drinks night. Each person's bill was easily over $100. Over the daily limit, but way under if you averaged it out over the week. Needless to say we all got slapped on the wrist and told it was a per day limit and it did not roll over. So we all just made sure to spend the $20 everyday for the rest of the trip.",

Well, perhaps unsurprisingly, folks in accounting had many issues about what counted for reimbursement and what was considered proper documentation (e.g., credit card statement showing expenses was not ok -- needed all receipts).

            "I\u2019m a stripper in the US. How it usually works here is you show up with everything you need for a 4-10 hour shift, no exceptions. We\u2019re talking LUGGAGE. Shoe bags, undie bags, makeup, purses...whatever you need. Now, lots of girls travel and don\u2019t have exclusive contracts with any one club. They move about. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m a homebody, I like to get into a nice place and just put down roots. I also had a regular wage job for nearly 10 years before I decided to put on heels,  this means I have the benefit of knowing what a regularly scheduled workday should be like based on hours spent there alone. If I\u2019m working a 4 hour shift, guess what, I\u2019m shoving a candy bar in my face and calling it good and hitting the floor as hard as I can, no breaks until it\u2019s over. A 10 hour shift? I\u2019m bringing everything I need for either two 1/2 hour breaks or one full hour for lunch.  \n\nWhy do I do this? Because managers will take advantage of the real possibility that the girls have never worked a real job before. They don\u2019t know that they don\u2019t have to pound stage the whole time. They don\u2019t know that they can stop to eat when they get hungry 6 hours in. A manager will never come to you and say \u201cyou look like you could use a break, go sit for 10.\u201d Or \u201cyou haven\u2019t eaten since you got here, there is pizza in the break room.\u201d   They want every inch of flesh and time from you and you are responsible for your own upkeep. \n\nWhy all this wall of text that doesn\u2019t seem to make sense? It\u2019s to tell any other girls or people in my situation how to lay a trap. Treat your \u201cjob\u201d like a real job, show up at the same times and take your lunch (bring it if you have to since some clubs go as far as saying you can\u2019t order food in), have an easily accessible copy of [employees rights 101](https://employment.findlaw.com/employment-discrimination/employees-rights-101.html) to check against every time they impose a \u201cnew rule\u201d on you like saying you can\u2019t take your lunch if it\u2019s busy. Most clubs in the US are on a \u201cindependent contractor\u201d basis. They don\u2019t operate that way and once you\u2019ve found the discrepancies (things that define you as an employee and not a contractor) you can build a case for misclassification.\n\nThis works for ANY job that has you sign a contract as an independent contractor and then proceeds to treat you as an employee. So I just show up, treat myself exactly how the rules say I should be treated, let the bosses dig themselves in further and further by just thinking they have the power, me maliciously complying with federal and state law until I get to walk into an employment lawyers office and have them salivate over my case.",

        "selftext": "Someone\u2019s story about their friend wearing a skirt to school and getting bloomers reminded me of my own malicious compliance in high school. \n\nWaaaaay back in 2013 I was a sophomore in highschool, and there was a tradition that on fridays, the cheerleaders, football players (without their pads of course) band members, and the other groups performing wore their uniforms to class. This wasn\u2019t a written tradition, and only the cheerleaders and dance team\u2019s uniforms broke \u201cdress code\u201d, nobody really batted an eye to it. \n\nI wasn\u2019t a skirt person, but I liked dresses once and a while (once IN a while *sorry*). As one can tell by my user, I grew up in Texas, and it\u2019s still significantly hot in August/September. So one time while wearing a casual sun dress in September, I was pulled out of class and reprimanded because the end of my dress was 4 inches above the knee, when the dress code said no shorter than 2. I pointed out the cheerleaders and dance teams uniforms every Friday and how they reached mid thigh at their longest, but was told that was okay because \u201cstudents can wear official school uniforms\u201d. And was sent home to change.\n\nClearly, somehow someone had forgotten I was on the golf team. Immediately my mind was turning to the next Friday.\n\nThe school had recently upgraded the golf team uniforms the year prior, and the girls team uniforms consisted of a short sleeve collared polo shirt, and a skort. If you don\u2019t know what a skort is, it\u2019s essentially a skirt and short shorts combined. It looks like a skirt, but they essentially act like built in bike shorts, and these fuckers were SHORT, I\u2019d argue shorter than the average cheerleader skirt. \n\nSo that next Friday (about 3 days later) to my parents surprise, I was ready to go that morning in my golf uniform, as compared to taking a bag to keep the clothes in to change into after school. But I just said \u201cFridays, we can wear our uniforms to class\u201d, and they accepted without question and took me to school. \n\nWell by second period, I was sent to the office yet again and the first thing the assistant principal asked me was why I would \u201cdeliberately disobey her right after our last conversation\u201d and threatened in school suspension, I\u2019ll never get anywhere in life by not listening, yada yada yada. \n\nWhen I finally had a chance to get a word in, I said \u201cbut this is my school golf uniform\u201d and I pointed to our schools logo that was sewn into my polo shirt. \u201cYou said students can wear official school uniforms to class, why are the cheerleader uniforms okay and mine isn\u2019t? This isn\u2019t even a skirt, it\u2019s a skort, it has pants!\u201d \n\nI still remember how pissed off she was. She stared me down for what seemed like a millennia. Then she snapped and told me to get out of her office, and go sit in the lobby area. That I knew what she meant and she would be calling my parents about this blatant disrespect. So I waited and played on my iPod and chatted with the nice secretary, trying to keep myself distracted, because in reality I had been really trying not to cry. I had massive anxiety when it came to authority, but I still had my naive sense of injustice, and I didn\u2019t just want to let this go.\n\nAfter about 20 minutes, she popped her head out and in a very monotone voice, told me I could go back to class and to let teachers know I had gotten permission from the front office to wear my uniform. Then she went back in and closed the door before I could even think to respond. I spent the rest of my day dealing with teachers questioning me about my outfit and 1 or 2 calling the front office to double check my claim that I had in fact gotten permission, and went to practice after school as normal before being carpooled back home. \n\nMy dad met me at the front door with a small smirk and I asked him what in the world happened because I knew he was the go-to contact for my school, so I knew she called him. He explained that when she called and tried to get him to come to the school and get me and talked about punishments for my insubordination, he immediately began to argue with her and admitted he raised his voice quite a bit, asking why I wasn\u2019t allowed to wear my sport uniform that the school provided to me as a dress requirement at my golf practice, and mentioned taking this all the way to the school board and resolving this \u201cobvious favoritism\u201d.\n\nHe then asked me not to do that again, but that he was proud of me, and told me \u201cI know I had told you never to start a fight, but to always fight back, I always thought physically, but you damn sure took the advice.\u201d\n\nEdit: I\u2019m sorry for hurting my fellow 20 somethings with the reminder that 2013 was 8 years ago, please don\u2019t look for gray hairs in the mirror for too long\n\nEdit 2: an even deeper apology for my 30-60 year olds who I offended even further with my edit\n\nEdit 3: I do actually need to clear something up. The band did not wear those heavy wool uniforms to school, they had their own custom shirt/nice pants combo the directors were apparently really strict about all the band kids wearing every Friday. \n\nAlso sorry to my 30 year olds for grouping that age range, sorry to my 60+ for not mentioning it, those responsible for sacking those who are responsible for the edits have been sacked",

            "My son in 4th grade had been picked on by a neighbor kid from a tough family. After the 3rd time I taught him how to punch properly and throw his weight into the punch. \nAfter a few more tussles and him dealing out a few bloody noses, he was not bothered any more. \n\nOne day at school two kids, The neighbor included, were beating up a smaller child. My son simply stood between the smaller child and the bullies. They pushed him into the smaller child and the playground aides sent them all to the principal's office. My son and the two bullies all got detention the next day. I kept my son home sick the next day and  I went in to see the principal. He said to me that the detention would stand because he was too busy to look into the matter again. AND that he had the right to act in loco parentis. I then drove to the superintendent's office and asked the secretary to call me as the superintendent was tied up. The Secretary called my wife and asked when to meet with the superintendent. The secretary asked if a date 3 weeks in the future would be convenient. My wife explained that my son was home sick today and that it would be a shame to keep him home sick for 3 more weeks.           OH!      OH!     I SEE!\n\nI then got a call from the Superintendent and I explained what happened. I made it clear that I was perfectly capable of appearing before the school board and asking them to resolve the matter. She called the Principal and he called the parents of the child who was being bullied, who set him straight. He then called me and said that although he was of a mind that the matter should not be reopened, He would not make my son go to detention.\n\nDamn, He was too important to do his job correctly?  He was a big tall guy who was used to getting his own way. I simply was too hard headed to allow him to get away with it.",

            "This reminded me of a time in my Junior year. I collected headbands, not the regular colorful ones but the holiday themed ones, and I wore them to school every day during the holidays week. I had one for saint Patrick\u2019s day that was a little green top hat with a four leaf clover on it. Now my school had it in the dress code we couldn\u2019t wear hats so my friends tried to warn me I may get in trouble. I didn\u2019t care, it was a headband not a hat. I go to first period and all is well, which was surprising because that particular teacher was a massive enforcer of the dress code. But when I got to second period my art teacher had a problem with it. Basically the conversation went \nTeacher: what\u2019s on your head\nMe: ....a headband\nT: but what\u2019s on the headband\nMe: a hat\nT: so you\u2019re wearing a hat\nMe: no, I\u2019m wearing a headband. It\u2019s not against the rules to wear a headband. Plus it\u2019s not like the hat is really big enough to hide my identity (that was the reason hats weren\u2019t allowed according to the principal) \nT: I don\u2019t think your headband fits dress code\nMe: well you just called it a headband so it does. I\u2019m not breaking dress code. If you really have a problem talk to name of vice principal.\n\nThe teacher just kinda walked away with a sour look after that.",

            "Amazing.\n\nBack when my sister was in high school, she had a necklace made of hemp with a clear, plastic sphere on it that had a mushroom in it. She had wore this all year and no one batted an eye.\n\nProm season comes. The school wants to crack down on drug paraphernalia and my sister is targeted. Already on thin ice, for other, unrelated reasons, the staff thought my sister would make an easy example. Wrong.\n\nThey call her to the office, She refuses, stating she's worn it all year and she should have to take it off. (It was also one of those deals where it was woven together around her neck, so it was a huge hassle to remove)\n\nSo in-school suspension happens. Following day, she refuses again, 1 day out of school. My sister and her friends decide to ramp up the opposition. They all got necklaces. All get suspended. It started as about 4-5 kids, but after it became a known thing, it swelled to around 50 kids.\n\nPrincipal calls my mom, begging her to have my sister stand down. I was in the room for this. Mom shrugs, says, \"Its her fight. I'll back whatever decision she makes, but she chose to fight.\" Mom's general attitude is that my sister needed to learn to stand up for herself. Mom was proud, even if she thought the exact reason for the fight was kind of childish (on all fronts).\n\nIt escalated. The kids were wearing mushroom shirts, turning in mushroom art projects, even graffiti was showing up at the school, and yes, mushroom related. The district had a huge problem on their hands.\n\nEventually, a week after prom, they conceded and told my sister and her friends and supporters that they could continue wearing that stuff. Victory...!\n\nExcept not really. Following year, a new rule was instituted banning all mushroom related clothing. This was years ago, but I had some coworkers that went to that school and they did tell me the rule exists.\n\nAt least my sister has a legacy now.",

I went out and purchased a full on \u201cschoolgirl\u201d uniform. White button down, plaid pleated skirt, blazer, tie, and knee high socks. I made absolutely certain that the skirt was EXACTLY as long as it needed to be to comply with dress code regulations. And I wore that to school EVERY SINGLE DAY for the rest of the school year.

They're almost entirely well-behaved which is a good job as there's not a lot we can do about bad behaviour beyond a stern voice (although one time a lad kicked one of our rabbits so a girl brained him with a shovel, rough but effective justice).\n\nThere's this one lad who came for the first time last week, don't know him but we made him very welcome. He only lasted half an hour before storming off in tears after his THIRD telling off for spinning round and round holding a tool and then letting it fly off at head height. This morning his mum (I assume) came with him, I saw him point out my friend and me, but he didn't ask to join in so after shouting hello we let them be. After about ten minutes he started wandering and my friend shouted to him \"don't go round behind the greenhouse mate, it's not safe round there\". Well, his mum had obviously been waiting for this because she went 0 to 100 in two seconds flat, demanding to know do we OWN this garden, and if not what business is it of ours where her son goes? We explained we just want him to be safe and she replied that she's quite capable of taking care of that herself, thank you. Fine, on you go.\n\nOff he went, exploring behind the greenhouse, which is not safe because it's the compost heap, which is very unstable, and the muck mound, which is a giant pile of horse manure we get delivered every autumn. By the spring the inside is all nice and rotted down, and the outside is hard, crusty... and less strong than you think. After a minute there was a crunch, a squeal... and I think we did very well to drag him out without saying \"I told you so\" or breaking into guffaws. He was *absolutely* black from chest-height downwards, and although well-rotted manure doesn't smell *really* bad it is very thick, and sticky, and slimy. \n\nHis mum grabbed him without a word and they headed for the gate, he started bawling as soon as the surprise wore off. My friend said \"would you like some bin bags to spread out in your car\" and to her credit she did say thanks when he handed them over.\n\nI wonder if we'll see them again next week?\n\nEdit: to everyone saying we should have made a point of some kind - if you\u2019re mean to kids or they think you\u2019re making fun of them they just don\u2019t come back. Kids (and adults!) do stupid shit all the time, and you quickly get into the habit of just dusting them down and getting on with things. Don\u2019t get me wrong, we *definitely* laugh about it later - but how\u2019s a little nobhead like this going to learn, if he doesn\u2019t come back to the allotment and get his hands dirty?",

One call to the city to say \"they're climbing all over it and ignoring your caution tape\" lead to them sending out a crew t put up even more serious obstacles to climbing on it while we wait for the assigned crew to show up and deal with it.\n\nAn absurd number of people take the view that communal spaces mean they get all the privileges of them but none of the responsibility.\n\nThey literally think that a community garden means that anything goes, ignoring how (at least in our case) the city parks board is who dictates the rules and actually places obligations on those of us who manage it and of course all our community gardens need insurance in order to operate so if you need insurance clearly there's more than just \"whatever goes\" happening. \n\nOf course during COVID we've also noticed an awful lot of cross over between the \"I don't have to listen to you\" and incredulous lack of concern for the basic requirements to be in the garden during COVID, which the parks board has made pretty clear and have been quite restrictive at various stages.\n\nTL:DR People are fucking awful even when you're just trying to grow some nice stuff in the garden.",

            "So, I have mixed feelings. Good for you being such a good person. Obviously the kid and mom were at fault. But I know someone like this (less combative) and I can't help to see another tragedy here. \n\nThe kid acts that way because the mom made poor parenting choices. Most of us can see where those choices will end up but not everyone is as tallented. I have a sister who genuinely believed she was being the best mom she could be. She spent far more time going to parenting classes and reading books... than anyone I know. Unfortunately there is a world of people out there trying to make money off all the people who never forgave their parents for punishments the deserved. She refused to say the word \"no\" to her kid until I pointed out that rasing a man who never heard \"no\" would probably have dire consequences when he started getting hormones. She tried so hard to avoid \"stifling his creativity\" and crap like that. Kids all of 15 and dealing drugs now. \n\nHe was always the problem at every gathering. Meaning he was always the kid to get picked on (usually for doing something outrageously hurtful to others) and so she became reflexively protective. But she knows he is a problem. She tried to change, but it was too late. You get five years to shape habbits and then it becomes a lifelong struggle. \n\nSo the point is that that mom probably felt humiliated and defeated at the same time. She knew it was her kid that was the problem. She knew that she only made it worse. And she probably knew that her life would always be a series of these exact experiences only with increasing severity and humiliation until she dies knowing he will be all alone with his ineptitude.",
            "\"Told ya so\" is so over the top in this situation. The kid was already covered in literal shit, I thing egging someone on after that is far from the right thing to do.\n\nShe already ate her own words after all, no need to add insult to injury.\n\nEdit: This is in reference to most all of the top comments telling OP they they SHOULD have said I told you so.

There is enough going on for people who come to us they don't need things being messed up because others don't want to do their jobs.\n\nEdit again: Thank you everyone for the awards, I didn't expect this to gain any real attention, I just wanted a place to share. \n\nAll the people who have worked in these services. You are all awesome people, thank you for sharing and all the work you do. I don't think you can ever hear that enough.\nEveryone who has used services - you guys are great too, remember take everything one day at a time, and be super proud of yourselves every day.\nDon't be afraid to ask for support there are lots of people who care out there for you.\n\nFor people asking yes I now have a mangers job in a new service which I am helping to create, my ex manager went sick for several weeks and hasn't returned since.",

I got paid the same and he got to tell me to do things while he stayed at home managing from his desk. I got fed up one day when the marketing manager came around because I had to do his tasks while also managing the storefront. He asked if I was getting promoted and I said I wasn't sure and no one told me I had a chance. My manager was investigated and then fired once they found out he was clocking in from home and them clocking off with manager time (5 hours for 7 days) and never hired an assistant manager.

If I needed something,  I could call him, but I had others around who could answer the questions. He was GREAT to work with- mostly because he left me alone. \n\nI screwed up once. I sent out a truck that shouldn't have been let out. I did what I could to fix it. I called  the other shop (where the truck was stopping a mile away) and begged them to send it back. They did. The next morning, it being fixed, he sat me down and we calmly discussed the situation. He said he hadn't told me the proper procedure for sending out a truck because no one had ever not had someone else watching them do it the first time. Every other time,  word was sent ahead of the truck going out. He took the ultimate blame.

            "This is part of whats wrong with America. I just left my job at a convenience store, I worked there 4 1/2 years. I was the assistant manager for the last 3 years. The only reason I stuck around so long was because the GM was about to retire. The GM trained me to do everything, I never called in, I always covered shifts, I knew more about the business than most GMs at other locations. Well the GM finally retires. They closed another location down, so that brought that GM over. I was somewhat okay with this, at least it showed that they took care of their GMs. Now the new GM called in a lot. Within 4 months she missed no less than 10 days. Also she was on salary and almost never worked her full 50 hours. She would pawn all of her paperwork of on me, saying it was my job. It wasn\u2019t. I was there to assist, not do it all. When she was there, she would just sit on the stool and watch TikTok for hours, or \u201cplay\u201d in the cooler and get nothing accomplished. When others would call in, she would berate them. However, it was not my business when she wanted to call in , yet I had to cover her. Somehow some of these GMs or other mid level management get away with so much. My attitude eventually soured, there were GM openings for other stores, I told my district supervisor that I was interested, he said I would be interviewed. I find out a month later that they filled the positions, and I wasn\u2019t interviewed. Apparently the new GM was saying things like I had a bad attitude.

            "Completely different industry/situation here, but I\u2019ve had a manager like this.\n\nI used to work at a local family-owned restaurant that was fairly upscale but not excessively formal. Awesome food and awesome regulars, and I really miss the people I had the pleasure of serving when I worked there. Some truly amazing people. \n\nThe two owners were a married couple, and they were both major alcoholics, so most of the time if they were blitzed enough, they were tolerable enough to be around and things went smoothly, for the most part. Issues came about quickly when either of them wasn\u2019t drunk or was hungover or (at least for the male owner) when he was irritated about literally anything, quite frankly. I worked there when it was just starting to get really busy and they didn\u2019t have enough staff to keep up a lot of the time, even though I was always able to handle volume along with another couple of employees there (but it was a serious struggle when it got full with two of us working a lounge and full restaurant); hence they were always fighting amongst themselves too. A lot of restaurant regulars were good friends of theirs and there was often drama, lots of good times but also a LOT of bullshit and it was taken out on the staff regularly. \n\nAnyway, my female boss would often take tables for herself and would even get pissed off and scold servers for taking tables that she wanted to serve, typically because they were good tippers and she wanted to pocket the cash; she always said that they were her friends and came to see her, even though she was always busy in the back of house filling in for someone who didn\u2019t show up in the dish pit or filling the constant stream of takeout orders. The plan was always for one server and her to split the 8-table plus bar lounge at lunch, and that was a seriously busy job with the insane volume and turnover we had (and we had NO support staff, not even a bartender). One day, it got super busy all at once and we also had a bunch of huge take-out orders coming up, and I think maybe 3 tables of 2 and 2 singles came in all at once (along with one or two bar stools) and I took care of them all basically immediately, not a SINGLE issue whatsoever and by the time my boss came back out to the floor they were happy with a drink waiting on their food or already eating their food, and she literally screamed at me in the middle of the restaurant in the most passive aggressive way one can bitchily scream at someone because apparently, I \u201ccouldn\u2019t handle it\u201d and \u201chow dare I think I could handle that many tables\u201d even though she was nowhere to be found and everyone was fucking happy and fine. I used to work at a massive busy chain in a huge busy mall where I often had sections of 10+ tables on busy days that were constantly full and she knew I could handle the volume of that place since it was vastly smaller, but I was only 20 at the time and far younger than her and a lot of the other females who worked there so I\u2019m not sure if it was a petty jealous thing because I could handle a whole lounge no problem and made wicked tips doing it and she wasn\u2019t able to pocket the extra change, but if she had just learned to delegate and not be horrible about things like that, it would\u2019ve been better for everyone. \n\nSome people just hate when other people can do their job as well as they can, even though they\u2019re in a position of authority; this does NOT always mean their skills in all areas are better. My boss was an awesome bartender and was great at hosting, but she would\u2019ve avoided a bunch of BS had she not tried to micromanage everyone so intensely. I think she *did* appreciate what people did to keep the place afloat deep down, but didn\u2019t necessarily want to acknowledge how many people contributed to what was supposed to be \u201cher\u201d business. Not all business owners know that the true value of many businesses lies in the people that work there and keep the place operating day by day, the ones who build the lasting relationships with customers that truly make a business.",

Told him I didn't know what their workload was, but had an easily availible copy of what it wasn't (my written copy of MY responsibilities, per my Home Manager.) \n\nHome Managers didn't get their raises, because they couldn't prove their workload.
