        "selftext": "(On mobile, sorry for formatting, etc.)\nI\u2019m a hairstylist. Last Wednesday, between clients, I decided to run to the gas station to get an energy drink and was hit by a car coming out of the parking lot. My own car was totaled, the cops came, both cars were towed from the scene.\n\nI texted my next client, apologizing and telling her that due to a serious accident, I would need to reschedule her appointment. She said she needed her hair done before the 4th of July. I was standing in the street, looking at my car in pieces, on the phone with insurance, fielding questions from the cops, and still texted the salon owner asking if anyone could take my client today.\n\nThe owner said she\u2019d figure it out, and would make sure my client could still be seen. I passed this info onto the client, who said she only wanted me to do it, and needed to get in ASAP. So in the melee, I\u2019m still worried about this client (who is a bad client, btw, and constantly complains about her hair, demands free redos, and only pays about 70% of the typical cost of her services because she managed to manipulate me into that price point when I was a newer stylist.) I see in my schedule that I have absolutely no room to fit her in before the 4th, so I walk back to the salon, after my car was towed away, and just take her anyway. \n\nOnce I get in, she doesn\u2019t ask if I\u2019m ok, doesn\u2019t thank me for taking her anyway but instead launches into a 3 hour long brag about all the guys who are super into her and how\u2019s she\u2019s dating a business mogul from Newport. The service goes as usual. I finish her hair 3 hours later, and am about to take her cape off and send her on her way when suddenly, she has a problem with the color. She says it\u2019s too ashy. It\u2019s the exact same formula and color I\u2019ve done on her for years, but today, it\u2019s wrong for some reason.\n\nTrying to remain cheerful and professional, I tell her that I\u2019ll put a new toner on her, no problem. At this point, my grandma is on my way with my daughter to pick me up. I text my grandma saying I\u2019ll be a little later. I tone the client again, and blow dry her for a second time. The client insists that the color is still \u201ctoo ashy.\u201d \n\nI explain that the second toner I used is the most golden toner that exists, and there\u2019s nothing less ash that I could put on her, except for an opaque, sort of gold pigment. She\u2019s clearly just being a sadistic bitch. At this point, my grandma comes into the salon and asks if I\u2019m ready to go. My client is looking at her hair and says \u201cyou need to do something else. I can\u2019t leave like this.\u201d\n\nSo my grandma goes back to wait in the car. I decide to use a very, VERY gold color and tone it again for the third time. She comes back to the chair and her hair is noticeably less ashy... because it\u2019s practically orange.\n\n\u201cI hate this,\u201d says the client. \u201cI\u2019m going to dinner with the guy from Newport tonight. I liked it better the first time. You need to do something else. Just do it like you did the first time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done your hair three separate times at this point,\u201d I say, packing my stuff up. \u201cAs you know, my grandma and daughter have been outside waiting for me. Unfortunately, there\u2019s nothing else I can do, since now there\u2019s layers of toner on there and a fourth layer will only make it worse. I hope up you have a great week!\u201d I took her payment (which she scoffed and forcefully handed to me) and I left. It was maybe not my most professional moment, but I\u2019d been looking for an escape from that client for years, and it was worth it.",

The time you spend with this bitch is time you\u2019re not with a client who will actually pay you what you\u2019re worth and not be shit about the service. Fire her and be freeeeeeeee!",
            "Oh, sweetie. I'm so sorry! I love my hairstylist. Mercedes is a queen of shears. If she doesn't pay you what you're worth and is a bitch, fire her. You don't need clients like that. And fwiw, there is no such thing as too ashy in my world. I love my ashy blonde hair. <3 She takes it full on silvery-platinum and in a week or 2 it fades to a glorious ashen blonde. Just how I like it.",
            "If you're looking for some verbiage to fire this client, \"it is clear after your latest appointment...as well as many of the previouse sessions, that I am not able to provide you with the results you are looking for. At this time, I believe it is best that you find another stylist that is able to create your expected outcome.\"\n\nIt puts it on *you* instead of what the reality is....\n\"Your a crap client and I honestly don't want to deal with you any more.\"\n\n\nJust a suggestion.",
            "She does not deserve your energy or patience, especially since she is paying less for 3 times the work. You should block her number and tell the salon receptionist not to book her with you.",

            "I'm a barber... not my story but years ago, my  former manager got a new client.  Cut his hair, gave him the mirror... and the client went ballistic, claimed the cut was not what he wanted. So, the manager apologized and told him \"no charge\".  Same dude comes back a month later, sits in the chair next to the manager... and does the exact same thing at the end of the cut.  So, he gets another apology and is told \"no charge\".  One month later (you guessed it), dude is back and he sits in the manager's chair again.  Manager spins him around and says... \"Look here... you didn't like my cut, nor his cut... so I've no idea why you keep coming back.  But, if you want me to cut you again, I don't give a damn whether or not you hate it... YOU'RE PAYING ME!  IS THAT CLEAR?\"\n\nClient is all, \"Yeah, yeah... of course... no problem\".  He never complained about another cut again and became a good client after that.\n\nThe point is, if you're established (and even if you ain't), you don't need this bitch.  And it sounds to me like she needs you... so, new ground rules..  1 - She's paying you regular shop rates from here on out.  2 - If you have a family issue in the future that conflicts with her appointment, her choice is either go to another stylist in the shop, or postpone... no customer gets between your personal emergencies.  And if either of these rules is unacceptable... she can find a new salon.\n\nAlso, if she decides to leave, watch your reviews and let everyone know every detail of this story if she tries to leave you a negative review.",
            "Totally different industry but I\u2019ve had similar scenarios and similar clients. One of the hardest things I ever had to learn was the ability to say No. it\u2019s a hard lesson to learn, but since learning the ability, my business has not declined and I\u2019ve had less stress. Give it a try sometimes...",
            "I owned a business for 13 years, and my bff is a stylist.  We fire clients that act in this way.  They can hire us, we can fire them.  \n\nThank the gods I am DONE being a business owner bc of people like this.",

            "How\u2019s your car? Were you hurt at all in the accident? \n\nAlso, raise her rate, it sounds like she is using 3 times the product that any other customer does so shouldn\u2019t she be paying for it?",
            "People like that complain to make themselves feel superior.  It's her issue, not yours.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBTW- I met my wife due to a client she had like that.   She went online to blow off some steam about her and we wound up talking and have been together since 2003.   If I ever run into that old client of hers, I think I'll say \"thanks bitch\" and smile!",
            ">and only pays about 70% of the typical cost of her services because she managed to manipulate me into that price point when I was a newer stylist\n\nThere's zero reason to continue that price point. You're not legally obliged to. You're not even legally obliged to do anything at all for her, ever, in the future. She pays full price or she finds another hairdresser.\n\nSeriously, even if she has an iron-clad contract in writing that you will provide that price point for the rest of your life, there's nothing to say you have to have free slots when she calls.",
            "Can you fire her as a client? There's no pleasing some people, and she's clearly one of them.",
            "Here's what I've learned from working a bunch of customer-facing jobs and running my own business: generally, there are two types of people who ask for exceptions or special treatment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne type is the person who will ask for an exception or favor once, because they really need it. If they're someone that you work with for a long time then they might ask for a favor every once in a while, but it will still be pretty rare. If you agree, they will be grateful. If you don't agree, they'll understand. They know that you're under no obligation to do what they're asking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe second type of person is the type that you described, OP. They'll ask for a discount, then demand special treatment on top of it. When they have an afternoon appointment, they'll text you in the morning and ask to reschedule. You'll say \"yes\" and schedule a new time with them. Then they'll text 10 minutes before that new time and say, \"sorry, can't make it, can we do tomorrow instead?\" The saying, \"give them an inch and they'll take a mile\" describes this type of client exactly. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis will never end. It might be because they think everyone in the world should cater to their every whim. Or they might not mean any harm, but they're totally disorganized, commit to too many things, and can't keep up with anything going on in their life. Either way, you have a choice. You can do whatever they ask, or set boundaries and say, \"no.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll almost always make an exception the first time that a client asks for one. \"You need me to do this thing for you? Sure, I can make an exception this one time, but as I mentioned before, our policy is *X*.\" If they ask again, I'll say, \"I'm sorry, but as I told you before, our policy is *X*. I can't make an exception this time.\" Some clients will become easier to deal with when you set boundaries like this, even ones who feel entitled. Others will stop giving you their business, which is fine. You're better off without them anyway.",
            "I had an appointment with my stylist this morning.  If she'd called/texted me at 7:30 and said she'd had an accident and had to cancel, my reaction would have been, in this order:\n\n1. Are you okay?\n2. Were your kids with you and are *they* okay?\n3. Call me back later today or tomorrow, and we'll reschedule.\n\nYou don't need this kind of sociopath client In your life!",
            "I would have told your client: \"1. Youre a very toxic bitch, 2. You show no respect to anyone in my salon, 3. You underpay us plenty of times where my financial binder is full of your underpaid transactions, 4. Your rapport is very unprofessional and Im feeling sorry for your family that raised you, and 5. You will not be welcome back into my salon nor will be receiving services for entitled people like you. Goodbye and never come back you selfish narcissist\".\n\nYou should have put her in her place. Yes its extreme but show her your worth and make sure she gets it.",

            "So what if you were a new stylist when she first came to you. The better you get, the more you charge, the more she pays. The next time she calls, I would let her know your current prices, and that she is expected to pay that amount. When she makes her snide comment about the increase, (and she will, I promise!), you can tell her  at that time that since the demand for your services has increased, so have your prices, and if she can't swing it, there are plenty of new clients who will.",
            "First, I hope you're okay and are unharmed from the accident.\n\nSecond, you are right that this wasn't your most professional moment. If you were a true professional, you would've told that you will no longer accept her as a client. It sounds like this woman is walking all over you. You deserve better.",
            "It\u2019s ok to fire rubbish clients. We have a tendency to take anyone on when we\u2019re new at a profession, but it\u2019s perfectly acceptable to weed them out over time",
            "80/20 rule.\n\n80% of your problems will be generated by the lower 20% of your clients.\n\nJust as clients are free to choose their service providers, we are free to choose our clients. Always fire that bottom 20%, they do nothing but drag you down.",
            "As so many others have said, she \"prefers your work\" because you only charge her what a brand new, novice stylist would charge her. \n\nAt my job, I sometimes help bid on upcoming projects. As a company, we want as much business and profit as possible, but we also recognize that NOT ALL BUSINESS IS GOOD BUSINESS. When there's a particularly difficult project, it is not unheard of to specifically bid it in a way that we hope not to win. Because we're a major player in the local market, we're obligated to put in a bid instead of just saying no. But that doesn't mean it has to be in good faith. \n\nSo basically, we calculate how much of a headache this job will cost us. What other clients will we be unable to provide good service to because of this job? And that all gets added in to the bid. The bottom line is \"We do not want this job. But if you insist on accepting our proposal over someone else's, we're going to make damn sure it's worth our time.\"\n\nThis is the approach you need with this woman. Decide how much money is her business worth. You're the provider. You're the one in charge here. Inform her of the new pricing policy, and go from there. (My suggestion: starting point should be about 105 - 110% your normal rate, to account for bitch tax and time-consuming do-overs)",
            "You already bent of backwards for her. Tell her to get lost. Although I guarantee she will be back because you've been giving her a discount. The moment she finds another salon she'll realize how good she had it. These customers are pretty common and it drive me nuts. Good luck to you and sorry about your car!",
            "This is the epitome of win bitch games, get bitch prizes.",

            "This sounds like something my ex would do. A few years ago she went to a place as a walk in and basically demanded she be seen and said she'd pay $400 dollars for it. So they took the money and did a poor job probably because they had no time for it. She knew this going in and still complained when it looked bad.",

            "Oh man, I hated these clients back when I was a hairdresser. Good riddance. Hopefully she doesn't come back but you never know! \nYou came in to do her hair after having been in an accident. Any normal human being would have been just fine with going to someone else when something like that happens. Some clients just don't give a shit about you and I'm glad you finally put your foot down. Some clients have no idea what the hell they want or what they are talking about. And all you can is try to make them happy (which usually doesn't work half the time). But you have to draw the line somewhere. \nI went to a barber shop after years at a salon and it was the best decision I ever made. I missed doing color and what not but male clientele is so easy going and most of them don't pull this shit. Of course there's always the occasional pain in the ass. But most of them knew exactly what they wanted. Or would just leave it up to you.",

It's the end of the marking period, and my school has a U.S. standard A, B, C, D or F grading system. I teach an Algebra class to 8th graders (a year ahead in our parts) who are either smart enough, or their parents *want* them to be smart enough (parents are allowed an opt-in, it's \"the law\"). As we come to the end of the year and I'm posting grades I'm reminded of this time last year, when I got to serve up some compliance that was as delicious as it was malicious. \n\nI had a parent of one young buck actually come up to me in person while I was on after school duty to discuss an issue he had with grading. For all the teachers out there I am feeling the wave of \"FERPA Violation\" coming over you. Yes, this is true, and I told him I can't discuss grades in a public setting. I didn't get to the word setting entirely before he interrupts and says \"Bullsh\\*t we're at school this is my kid... I'm the one giving permission here so let me ask you...\"\n\nI'm thinking to myself (been doing that a lot lately) *Great, I guess we're doing this while I'm directing traffic*. I then realize the issue of safety so I'm like \"Sir I need to direct tr-\" and then he continues talking utter nonsense (I could only imagine, I wasn't really listening at this point) while I'm looking down the road for more cars to wave down for pick up. He's just going and going, I hear a word or two like \"you said..\" and \"...he's already turned in that..\" and finally as I get to a lull and look at him he says to me \"...and there is NO way that you can FAIL my child and put the comment *Pleasure to have in class*!!! You need to change this right now!!!\". \n\nEnter the lightbulb of Malicious Compliance. \n\n(that's my third lightbulb reference today, btw)\n\nThe lull was about to pick back up when I say \"You make a good point, I don't know what I was thinking, I'll change it the second I'm done here\"... Which is actually possible because I always have my iPad on me pretty much at all times (my wife gets jealous). \n\nThe Karen of a dad walked off back to his parked car with his child visible and looking at me from the passenger side, and I swear he actually said \"That's what I *thought*\", which, if you're unfamiliar, is the thing said to you when you've lost an argument that could have been a fight because you chickened out. Not responding to this is conceding defeat, usually. \n\nAs the dad finishes his little strut to his car I give the kid a thumbs up, ala Bloodsport (just google \"Okay, USA\"...definitely a laugh), and the kids slowly gives me a sheepish thumbs up back. Hilarious, the kid seems to somehow know what the dad doesn't...\n\nThe second I get to a secure (private) location I go into the gradebooks and change the comment from \"Pleasure to have in class\" to \"Respectful to teachers and staff\", which is more than I can say for this kid's dad. \n\nNeedless to say, he still got an F. Deserved. And yes, I made this change on the toilet.",

One got in touch with me demanding a re-mark of an assignment (summative not formative) because \"I paid good money to you lot so I can get a good degree\". OK, I referred to my staff tutor who authorised a remark and told me to make sure the marks allocated were in exact agreement with the marking scheme. I went back through the work they submitted and count find anything I wanted to change, if anything I had given the benefit of the doubt in a couple of places so I comment don the paper, let the mark stand and sent it back.\n\nThe entitled student escalated to the faculty, complaining they were treated unfairly and demanded a remark with better marks. It was remarked by the course author who applied the marking scheme to the absolute letter, overruled the places I had given the benefit of the doubt, reduced the marks accordingly and provided the student with very detailed feedback on the reason their marks were reduced. I understand that the fallout was well worth seeing as the student brought a parent in who also played the \"paid good money for this degree\" card only to be told \"you pay for the tuition, the marks you get depend very much on the effort put in, not the price paid\".",

I explained my side of the situation. I could see that the head of the department was on my side but his hands were tied (vocational schools really suck sometimes). They handed me a CD of his \"completed\" assignments. None of them were anything I would have accepted in class as a completed assignment and this guy knew it. \n\nI gave the guy a C-, because that was the absolutely lowest passing grade I could give. And yeah, even almost 20 years later, it still pisses me off when I think about it.",
            "So some fuckup who did fuck-all all semester finds out he's getting a C in art. His parents come in and demand that he be allowed to do \"extra credit\". The teacher tells them that he can do as much \"extra credit\" as he wants, just as they syllabus says, no problem. \n\nPer the syllabus, you could do anything artistic you wanted and turn it in at any point in the term and the teacher would spend his own personal time providing feedback and even take time to demonstrate or teach something the class wasn't even doing - no charge. What he wouldn't do is give you points towards your grade. The kid turned in a massive amount of low-effort crap the last week, his parents probably figuring he'd get at least some credit for anything he turned in. It was all returned to him with comments and suggestions, but no change in the grade.",

People seemed to mill around the office at the end of the day to gossip, catch up unit teachers on each classes progress.\n\nPrincipal (young, clean cut, newbie maybe hair older than me in his late 20s) emerges from his office with a parent and a male student. The mom just looks like everything on the planet only exist to annoy her. For reference she's a jersey housewife type.\n\nThe principal calls over the music teacher in this sing songy voice that very patronizing. \"Ooooh, Mrs. Xxxxxx! We have a little problem here.\"\n\nMrs. X is the aged hippy dippy music teacher grandma. Very chill lady. Just loves that kids love music. Loves to hear their new music for her seasonal shows. None of that is coming though as she see which parent and student it is.\n\nThe mom starts yelling, not just talking loud but straight up yelling, at Mrs. X about how dare she fail her son. Music isn't even a real subject, she's a baby sitter for when the real teachers need a break, etc. Just really nasty stuff like that. The whole while she waving his latest report card around.\n\nWithout missing a beat, Mrs. X turns to the student says \"You've done no work. Your only participation is to agitate other students. What grade do you believe you deserve?\" This kid can't even look up at her. Staring at the ground he mumbles \"An A. I wanna A.\"\n\n\"Fine!\" Mrs. X takes the report card right if the moms hand, places it on the office counter top, and changes all of his past grades to As. \"I'll change it in my grade book tomorrow.\" and she storms out the door.\n\nBefore the mom can retrieve the card, the health/pe teacher and a math/science teacher go up to the card with pens out. The pe teacher makes a quip like \"In case you were here to yell at me about his grades too.\" They both change the grades and leave the office. It's dead silent.\n\nThe mom picks up the card and starts stammering to all of us or none of us about how her son is a good boy or some shit. The kid is now just looking at the card in his mom's hand as if to check the changes were really made.\n\nThe other teachers leave. I follow my student teacher mentor out. The principal is still just standing there.\n\nFrom what I gathered through my mentor and the few staff who would share it with me since I had to witness it, the superintendent chewed the principal out really bad for facilitating the whole ordeal. The mother was lightly addressed for engaging in such behavior but she got what she wanted to she didn't care. \n\nTo make the teachers who gave the protest As feel like they had some semblance of control and respect, the student had to write reports for each class. The music one was essentially a list of songs and artists he likes. The math one was about what he'd do of he were rich. In any event, they just all gave him As to be done with the whole ordeal and his grade was adjusted in some manner.\n\nYears later, I subbed there and there was a new principal. Idk if he was eventually let go, quit, relocated. But I'm sure it wasn't a great working environment after you've shown staff you're willing to feed them to irrate parents and just stand there watching it happen. \n\nTLDR: Principal sides with mom about teachers changing failing students grades.",

        "selftext": "I worked minimum wage as a retail EVERYTHING. I mean, I was half manager, half cashier floor worker, half inventory... What I'm trying to say is, I did too many things. But this was a small business, mom and pop style shop. There were only three of us at a time running the whole operation. These were family friends. I felt I had a responsibility to this family. Minimum wage wasn't enough for a stranger, but it was enough for me... For a while.\n\nAfter three years, I had tripled their business profits. I know this because one of my many tasks involved balancing the books. I knew exactly what our sales numbers were. I knew our profit margins. I knew what our inventory cost. I knew our landlord on a first name basis and I knew what bills we paid. I was good at my job. This store was like my family and I made them proud. My wage had not increased in those three years, but looking at the numbers, I thought now was a good time to bring it up. So I did. It was November, entering December. I asked for a dollar more, and my boss agreed.\n\nThat December my boss \"forgot\" to pay me. I had nothing to cover my Christmas holiday. The next month he didn't mention it at all when I returned to work after the holiday... I had to remind him that he was nearly seven weeks overdue. When he finally paid me, he did not include the raise we had agreed upon, so I brought it up again to ask for clarification. He sat me down in the back room and told me he couldn't believe how demanding I was, that in all his years, he'd never seen someone act so rude and disrespectful to their elders. If we were strangers I'd have left on the spot, but we were family. I was in tears.\n\nBut I was also very, very angry.\n\nHe wanted to go on his own holiday. He wanted to go for three weeks. But to teach me a lesson in respect, he also wanted to slash my hours. What's a store owner to do? He hired a new employee to cover the hours he was cutting from my schedule. He made me train the new girl for him, to teach me \"respect.\" After this training period, my shifts went from four days a week to one day a week. This way he could give me a decent raise on paper but pay me a quarter of what he did before, and his new employee accepted the lowest minimum wage. I didn't object. As a last ditch effort to save the business, I offered to spread my shift out and come in for one hour at the end of each day to check the new employee's numbers, but he refused. He wanted me to feel bad. I felt terrible... For my boss.\n\nAs hard as I tried, the new employee had never understood numbers. I had tried and failed to teach her how to calculate her sales numbers at the end of each shift. This poor girl was straight out of high school and had too many other subjects to think about. If we'd had more time for training, she probably would have learned it, but my boss cut my hours too short for me to go in depth about it, and who was I to argue with his schedule?\n\nThat's why, when he went on holiday and I couldn't be around to check this girl's work during the rest of the week, the business lost money. On the days I wasn't scheduled to work, thousands of dollars in sales went unaccounted for. Hundreds of dollars of cash were miscounted. Numbers were typed incorrectly into our computer system, rendering our inventory counts useless. After three weeks, he returned to an absolute mathematical nightmare. The sales numbers from my three days of work were perfectly accounted for, and three times higher than what our system reported we sold the rest of the week, although who knows what the real numbers were.\n\nI think this made him angry. He really wanted to teach me a lesson in humility. In my last full shift, a customer tried to return something large, and I told them our store policy to the letter: only my boss had the power to return that item. To make sure it would be returned properly, I did write a note on their receipt that they had tried to return it to me but I was following store policy and leaving it for my boss to handle when he returned from his holiday. Apparently, according to the angry reviews left on our social media, he refused to accept the return and told the customer she was \"a stupid idiot\" for believing me.\n\nIn my next scheduled shift, I asked him point blank if the review was true, and he laughed about it. He told me he was just showing us all who's boss. He admitted to the whole thing. He also mentioned he was giving me more hours as a reward for all my hard work. He wanted me to come in every day from now on to review all the numbers. I came clean: he'd given me a lot of time off in the past few weeks, and during that time I'd found a new job. I made it clear, also, that I had never once disobeyed his instructions or broken store policy. Every action I'd taken had left a paper trail. However, he had broken every single agreement he'd made with me: my payday dates, my wages, my scheduled hours. Things that could be proven by my expert paper trail to our Ministry of Labour. And his behaviour and comments around customers were posted on every social media review, which he admitted to, so I knew exactly what he thought of me. I was only there to hand over the keys to the store.\n\nHe cried. He couldn't look me in the eyes. Part of me is sad, because for a long time, we were family. Since my departure, reviews of my old family-run shop have absolutely tanked.  Meanwhile, my new job is incredibly wholesome, my hours are solid, my benefits are excellent, and my rates are triple what I made before.\n\nAnd I wouldn't be here if I hadn't followed instructions to the letter. I've learned so much about respect.",

He refused to hire anyone and was planning on waiting a few months for a girl he knew to finish high school so she could start.\n\nAn old employee that had initially trained me said he had gotten a raise just by asking for it and that I should do the same, especially since I had a workload meant for 2-3 people. \n\nBoss refused and instead made a system where I had to prove I was worth it by hitting higher targets over a month or so.\n\nNew girl finally starts, things are a little better but we also had to put time into training her. I still don't have my raise even though I'm doing so much  work.\n\nShe goes on a pre-agreed holiday and I tell him I'm done.

The other didnt want us to do anything unless she said so. Like I'm standing there doing nothing and a coworker with their arms full of stuff shouldn't ask if I could open the door bc only the manager could authorize such a request. 2nd manager in retaliation punished two of us by making us scrub the place down (because we dared to clean a station after it was closed and we had downtime) at which time I got stung by a bee. \n\nI told the scheduling manager who didnt care.

A scoop of ice cream was supposed to be a quarter of a pound and they had genius ways for scooping to make sure each scoop was perfect.\n\nI notoriously bitchy regular ordered a scoop.  After receiving his scoop of ice cream began to loudly complain that it was NOT  1/4 of a pound. \n\nThe manager asked the customer \u201cWho scooped your ice cream?\u201d He immediately pointed directly at the scared AF tiny 16-year-old girl\u2026 \u201cShe did!!!\u201d\n\nThe manager marched the young lady up to the front of the store while everyone, employees and customers stood in tense silence. \n\nShe pulled out a digital scale\n\nTook the men\u2019s ice cream out of the cone and placed it on a sheet of waxed paper on the scale\u2026 0.35 lbs\u2026. The manager proceeds to grab a knife and cuts off the over scooped ice cream and scrapes it into the sink.   Now\u2026EXACTLY 0.25 lbs!   Puts what remained of the ice cream back on the stunned customers cone. \n\nManager Quite Loudly says, \u201cSusie our customers are paying for 1/4 of a pound of ice cream. If I ever catch you scooping more than a 1/4 of the pound for this customers, we may have to let you go.\u201d   \n\nManager then says \u201cMr. customer, I have watched you come into this ice cream store for years. You have regularly received more ice cream then you have paid for while embarrassing and intimidating our workers. I\u2019m sorry this has been happening to you for so long and I will see to it that it never happens again.\u201d \n\nIt never did.\nWichita, Ks. \n\nEDIT For those who are curious - \nBraum\u2019s on Tyler Rd - circa 1987 (which is likely the last time it was remodeled unfortunately)",

Management would calculate how many scoops per barrel with the actual sales whether it was in cones, cups or shakes. Staff would get Write-ups if the measurements were excessive.\nI, (21 or 22) on the other hand, worked at one that was privately owned by a too young, inexperienced woman. Daddy gifted her the shop when she turned 18. We were allowed unlimited ice cream. Between employees and her friends eating the profits, she lost the business within 3 years...",

I explained several times it was my mistake and just take the damn soda, I didn't charge more. She INSISTS on talking to the manager to make sure I didn't charge her the extra $.50 or whatever petty amount it is. He confirms it and then tells me to make her the proper size. She protests, now realizing she's losing her upgrade and had to watch me dump the drink out, throw the cup away and make her a smaller one. \n\n\"There you go!

        "selftext": "Was reminded by another post about my time in fast food and how I maliciously complied. No TL:DR because it's not that long and reading stories is the whole point of the sub.\n\nAnyways back in college I worked at an on campus fast food place. Your basic burgers, fries, wraps and small salads. My shift started at 11:25 doing wraps until 11:55 when Josh left and I manned the grill and someone else did wraps.\n\nNow Josh was a typical Josh and it was his way or the highway. He'd get really mad when I'd throw more burgers on the grill or flip something while he was trying to chat up the dishwasher. I did this because he had no understanding of how much food was required to feed college kids during the small breaks between classes. Eventually he complained enough that I was told \"Josh is on the grill until 11:55 so stop pestering him and do your station\"\n\nSo I did. I stopped touching the grill.\n\nThe next shift he leaves at 11:55 and I get on the grill and immediately throw down 40 frozen raw burger patties. 2 minutes later the cashier starts yelling \"where are the burgers\"\n\nSorry, I just got on the grill and Josh only had 5 in the warmer and 3 in the window. I know we always have about 100 students between 11:55 and 12:20, and they almost all get the burger meal but I was told not to touch the grill.\n\nThe burgers  finish after a few minutes and the next batch goes on but the grill has cooled a little so they take even longer. The line of kids waiting for food is longer than the line ordering and management is pissed. I get chewed out for not being fast enough and just ask \"do you want raw burgers, or to talk to Josh\"\n\nIt only took 1 more shift of this for them to realize that my meddling was actually what kept us afloat during the lunch rush. I'd often cook an entire grill of burgers while he was swinging and missing with the dishwasher. They eventually printed out a sheet of how many burgers/chicken etc needed to be prepped for certain rush times and gave Josh a very stern talking to about how to be a team player. \n\nAlso, josh sucked because he'd cook all the burgers well done. Like really well done. Then they'd sit in the warmer for another 5-15 minutes (he didn't know how to rotate either) so you were eating God damn hockey pucks. He ruined so much ground beef. He eventually got moved to salads and stock because he couldn't be trusted with anything that was fast paced. Management saw how much faster everything moved when he wasn't joshing everything up.",

I work at a big bank where the only thing that matters is years of experience. It doesn't matter if you have a PHD or a Bachelors, they both mean the same thing. I came in as an entry level 28 year old because I got so many degrees. I was doing so much better than an entry level analyst that once my minimum years experience hit, I told my director that I wanted 80k or i'm going to apply to another team. He told me that there was no way that I was going to get 80k from any team. I asked him if he could just ask HR because I didn't really want to change teams but I was going to get as much money as I thought I deserved. After I asked him he said \"I'm not going to ask HR because I know 100% that you are not going to get paid that much no matter what. If you want to waste time applying to other teams just to be told the same thing, then go ahead!\". \n\nI applied to another team in the same department the same day, this was Monday. On Wednesday I got called by the director of that team for an interview and I got an offer on Thursday. The offer was for 92k. I instantly accepted it and told my current director that I got an offer and had accepted it. He got so mad at me and asked me why I would apply and accept a position without telling him. I said \"You told me to\". \n\nAfter 2 weeks I started my new position on my new team and I got a call from my old VP. He asked me why I left without letting him/my old director counter offer. I told him what happened and he was shocked. He told me they would have counter offered me on the spot. It turns out my old director never thought I would leave...jokes on him.\n\n***EDIT: Wow! This blew up more than I ever thought it would. Thank you all for the support and words of encouragement about leaving jobs. I have been asked about or pointed out that I should be able to list my degrees and \u201ctoo many to count\u201d is not possible. That is very true, I was just exaggerating and being lazy. For those who wanted them, I have a BS in mathematics,BS in education, BS in computer science with a concentration in cyber security, MS in theoretical Mathematics, MS in data analytics and currently finishing up my MS in Data science.",

It was the holidays so I intended to blow it off, but he kept bitching about it and forced me to work on NYE. I spent that day at work applying to take the California Bar exam, buy study materials. I got a job offer a week after the exam and called him on his cell (on Saturday- something I\u2019d NEVER done before) phone as a courtesy to tell him I was giving notice. First he refused to pick up. I left a couple general messages to call me back. 2 hours later i called his house. His wife answered and he refused to come to the phone.

Two weeks later, late one Friday I got offered a job, which paid 50% more. The awkward thing was, on the Monday I was flying to Spain for a two week holiday. \n\nSo, Monday morning, I drove to work to hand my notice in. It was before even my boss got in. I handed in my notice to his boss. I left the office, drove to the airport, then went on a two week holiday.

I watched time and time again as management would deny raises just to squeeze as much as they could out of the bottom line, causing us to bleed experience. Every single person that was denied multiple raises was told they would have received a counter offer if given a chance. Seems like it's just a mind game of vengeful managers.",

            "Never accept a counter-offer unless it comes with a whole lot of written guarantees about the minimum length of the position (and a pro-rata payout if not completed), and the guarantees are viewed and approved by HR.\n\nIn addition, if you accept counter-offers internally, you become expected to accept the next counter-offer, meaning that a current team or department has no incentive to give you pay rises or listen to requests for salary increases because if it ever comes to the crunch, they can just counter-offer.\n\nBeing known for never accepting a counter-offer which isn't ruinously expensive to the offerer makes it more likely that a manager or team will want to keep bumping your pay and conditions a little bit every so often so you won't go looking for far more lucrative positions elsewhere.",

His point is you need to move up as fast as you can while you are young.  At some point, you will level off and stay.\n\nI had been there 3 years, and finally gave my notice (It was a 50% raise too).  I actually didn't want to leave, but there was no career path for me there.  I came in to his office, gave him my notice.  He was ecstatic.

            "Many employers just say no to everything. The manager may want you to stay but the company itself, well they don't care if you leave because in the aggregate they save money since most employees are not ambitious enough to look for the job then follow through. And even those who are the company gets one last kick at the can with a counter offer in many cases.\n\nI am actually kind of surprised OPs employer let's him do this within the same bank since I have worked for some large engineering companies with HR strategies to prevent competing between departments. You may get a pay raise if the job involves higher value responsibility but HR is overseeing it all so not that big and no competing between managers.\n\nThe truth is that ambition and self confidence are worth more for getting a higher salary than competence or experience. If you have all three you are super star but you have to be mentally wired to be prepared to leave.\n\nThis is especially true for us young people. It's often the same old story. Manager is happy, older peers were doing the same work and younger employee is making 25 percent less than the older people.\n\nCan you get paid better? Sure I convinced my great boss I deserved 10 percent pay raise and I did get it and we were all happy for awhile. But when I eventually moved on I got got. 25 percent pay increase on top of that.

They gave me permission to post. \n\nQuite a while ago both my mom and my grandmother worked for one of the local casinos. \n\nAt the time the casino had a 90-day trial and then you would get insurance.\n \nDuring the course of them working there during the 90 day trial the Casino switched their policy to 18-month trial before getting insurance. So they then proceeded to \"find\" reasons to fire all of their employees who are coming up on the 90 day so that they would not be grandfathered in. \n\nMy mom knew this was coming because she saw a person after a person who had gone hired a little bit before her get fired for ridiculous reasons. \n\nSo when she got called in the office the day after she had to go to the hospital for a severe allergic reaction she knew what was coming. (They marked it as a no call no show because she started having a severe allergic reaction on shift and her EpiPen didn't work). \n\nShe walks into the office, she's informed that due to her no-call no-show she is being let go effective immediately. \n\nShe asked for her final check. \n\nThey informed her that she would receive the check after she turned in her uniform. My mother proceed to strip down to her underwear and bra, drop the uniform on the supervisors desk and demand her last check. \n\nShe stood there, in her underwear, for 40 minutes while they tried to convince her to turn the uniform in at a later day. \n\n\"Nope, you said I'd get my check when I turned in my uniform. There is my uniform. I want my check.\"\n\nEventually they wrote out a check. She then walked out, taking the LONG route through the casino, saying her goodbye to all the staff and regulars on her way out. \n\nSo, a couple days later when my Grandma had her shift she knew what to expect. Because she was coming up on that same time frame. And my grandma proceeded to do the Exact. Same. Thing. \nMy grandma, walked through the crowded casino, in her underwear!",

The company was going strong when I started, but after 10 years there the place was going down hill fast. One day we discover the bosses had not been making superannuation payments to us (my countries required retirement fund that employees and employers are required to pay into) for over 2 years, owning tens of thousands over all the employees.\n\nThis was the final straw for me and I gave them two weeks notice. As I was basically the last manager there most the employees also quit with me and this really pissed off the owners who thought I was somehow overreacting.\n\nI made them ensure they would pay me what was owed or I would get the tax agency involved. A few weeks later I get an email detailing repayments *significantly* less than what was owed. When I emailed back they told me they had taken hours I owed in time in lieu out of what was owed in superannuation, and if I had a problem with that they would have no issue speaking to the authorities about the hours I stole from them. \n\nThis is of course, highly illegal. For one, we had no contract laying out that I would have to replay owed hours. Secondly, they most definitely can not take that money from my superannuation repayments.\n\nI decided not to reply, save the email and move straight onto the tax agency (they look after superannuation affairs) \n\nThis took a very long time as the process is very slow, but after about a year and several different tax representatives, I one day got a call out of the blue from one of the owners. This was a very angry, threatening call asking why I had reported them to the tax agency and why I was determined to ruin their lives. I told him exactly why I did it and that he reaped what he sowed.\n\nA few days later I get an email from the tax agency telling me they will be repaying all that was owed plus interest accrued over the now 3+ years that they didn't pay. They would have also been put on a blacklist of employers had they not sold the business a few months after we left. \n\nFor more background; after I quit I took two weeks off to be alone with my thoughts and relax for a bit before accepting one of the many job offers I received once my departure had been made public in our industry. I walked away with a higher pay, a more secure job and the position every company in the industry was fighting for at the time, as the company I chose won the contract and they gave the position to me.",

            "I had a very similar situation many years ago. The boss pictured himself as a mighty entrepreneur so spent most of his time at the golf course or the 19th hole, rather than running his businesses. Generally that was a good thing because when he would get involved in the business, they usually lost money. \n\nI wasn't aware of the details of superannuation procedures here (the govt mandates 10% of all wages/salary to be paid into a 3rd party fund) so I sucked up the lies the bookkeeper was spinning. It wasn't until later that I learned she was fucking him. \n\nLong story short, I got diddled out of $15000 that could've been sitting earning compound interest for ~30 years now. I did notify the tax office at the time. He phoenixed the operation (sold all the assets for $1 to a new company owned by his mistress, defaulted on every creditor then simply opened up with a new name *in the same premises*). Company went into liquidation, the liquidator ate up 99% of any money it used to have then said \"so sad\" to the employees. Tax office said \"so sad,  nothing we can do\".\n\nOh the nights I have dreamed about the myriad ways in which I would hurt those two people.",
            "Good for you, that's fantastic!",
            "Yeah. I had an employer not pay my super contributions for about 6months, then the owner skipped the country.  The ATO managed to get back 50c out of the dollar. Better than nothing I guess.",
            "You 100% did the right thing.\n\nThey were stealing from all employees retirement. And unfortunately, Australians are fucking horrible at keeping track of their super, so most wouldn't have even noticed or followed up.\n\nYou saved yourself and your staff a lot of money.\n\nMy dad's boss did the same thing. However, I'm almost certain they did some dodgy book keeping that resulted in my dad getting less than what he was actually owed after the ATO investigation - I'd say his employer was running 2 sets of books.",

            "My coworker (I'll call him \"John\") previously worked at a combination funeral home/cemetery.  In our state, Minnesota, USA, law states that ALL money prepaid by a family to a funeral home must be held in a trust fund to protect the $.  BUT, money prepaid to cemeteries need not be.  The owners of this combo were siphoning off money intended for funerals under the guise of the cemetery.  One day, John was looking at a prepaid funeral and saw that, because of repeated withdrawal of cash, there would not be enough left to pay for the funeral despite a good economy and interest rate.  He started looking at other prepaid accounts and saw a trend.  He alerted the authorities and they had him copy shit tons of info so they could prosecute.  Scared sick of being caught gathering info, John would sneak in after hours (one of the owners lived in the building) to copy reams and reams of documents.  One owner escaped to another country and one owner went to prison.  John ran the firm while it was in receivership.  The \"new\" owner (it's probably been 30 years by now) still occasionally suffers from shortages caused by these dreadfully selfish criminals",

            "My current employer once tried to change the OT rules for hourly employees working over the weekend. Required hours, mind you, not that it matters. I found out because my paycheck was missing the OT pay. I only got paid on those extra hours at regular rate. I tried to fight, but the company said they were in the right.\n\nI called my state's Dept. of Labor to get clarity: my employer was wrong and what they were doing was illegal. I then told my boss -- our then Executive Director, the head honcho -- what I was told. I also told them I had the name and number of who I spoke with, in case he wanted to confirm.\n\nThat was enough for them to do an about face. I know my boss didn't call the DOL. My OT got paid out next paycheck. The policy was officially reverted and all OT was paid out. Well, mine was. I don't know about anyone else's.\n\nThe mere threat of getting the DOL involved was enough for my employers.

            "This is part of why I believe that employer-funded pensions should be banned.\n\n401ks (or similar plans) with or without matching are amazing because the money is not in the company accounts. If the company fails or has a crooked C-level, it doesn't hurt the people as much. It also means the company isn't mired in debt because it isn't literally paying people to not work.",

He was renovating the shop and hemorrhaging money so he couldn't afford it, whilst also going through a lot of personal stuff. \n\nHe did the right thing though when a couple of managers fronted him he apologized and went to the tax office himself because it got too out of hand, and he needed help.

They ship out 3 days before the wedding/cruise.\n\nWe were able to reschedule the wedding.  Caterer, flowers, reception, DJ, they were all cool.

We were fucked.\n\nSo we went to nearby San Francisco, went to the worst area, and found the dirtiest, most malnourished homeless 2people we could find.

        "selftext": "This is my tiny MC story, which happened in my first year at uni, about 8 years ago. The bus I (then 20f) had to take to uni was the most popular route in town, meaning it was always packed. Because I got on at the first stop, I always had a window seat, which meant that someone was usually sitting next to me when I had to get off, and I had to do the awkward thing of lifting my backpack and straightening up in an exaggerated fashion to show them that they had to stand to let me pass. No problem, usually, just a bit awkward for socially awkward me.One morning, a guy in his 40s sat next to me and promptly Manspreaded across my seat, pushing his leg right up to mine. I thought it was weird, but hey, maybe this guy had a painfully swollen scrotum or no self-awareness. Or both. Anyway, I was giving him the benefit of the doubt, and as he was focused on his phone and ignored me I did the same for the rest of the journey.\n\nThen, when we were getting close to my stop, I started the awkward I-have-to-get-off-so-let-me-pass show. No reaction. So I stood up from my seat. Still no reaction.\n\nMe: \"Sir?\"\n\nNo reaction. I tapped his shoulder.\n\n\"Sir, I need to get off. Can you let me pass?\"\n\nThe guy looked up at me and, with the widest, most disgusting grin, said: \"Well, sweetie, looks like you're gonna have to squeeze past me. No problem for such a skinny girl, right?\"\n\nSome of the passengers standing around us noticed and were about to intervene, but I was *pissed* because at that point I had missed my stop and I wasn't sure if he was a pervert or just liked to piss on peoples days, but I didn't want him to win. Also, no one had ever called me skinny. I have what one could call child-bearing hips, thank you very much. So I smiled at him and said: \"Okay, have it your way.\"\n\nMy backpack was filled with half a dozen library books that I was going to return that day, and it was bulky and heavy af. Usually, I would have put it on after leaving the crowded bus, but not that day. I shouldered my backpack so it was hanging at the right height and clumsily, forcefully and (just in case he was indeed a pervert) in no way sexily squeezed past the guy, dragging my huge backpack across his face. If I leant back to make sure to reallyget his nose, well, that surely wasn't intentional. And if he emitted any pain-fuelled protests, well, they must have been muffled by my backpack.\n\nAs I was standing by the door waiting for the next stop, I looked back to see him covering his nose with his hand. It looked like he was checking if was bleeding, but I don't think he did. He might have had a scratch or two from my backpack, but he wasn't injured or anything. His pride was, though. He kept glaring at me for the glorious half-minute it took for the bus to reach the next stop.\n\nI was in such a good mood that I didn't mind walking back to where I was supposed to get off.",

There were four people closer to the aisle. So I say pardon me, that's my seat. Three of them stood up without hesitation, but the guy two seats in loudly says \"I'm not standing up!\" and just sits there. Maybe he was annoyed at having to stand up for multiple people but he didn't look disabled or anything. Who knows. So I was like uhhh. Well, I need to get by. He just stared ahead and ignored me.\n\nIt's not like I was going to sit in the aisle and the show was about to start so I said OK! and proceed to shimmy past him. Butt facing him of course, and as it happened, I stepped on his toes a bit which made him yelp slightly. I got to my seat quite annoyed and just looked at him and said \"Try being NICE sometimes.\" One of the people sitting with him gave me a smile and then the show started.",

Then I picked up the backpack and \"dropped it accidentally\" right back onto his crotch. I loudly exclaimed how \"sorry\" I was for hitting his crotch with my backpack - twice!!! I did comment that if he didn't have his legs spread over most of two seats, it wouldn't happen. People laughed at him because at the time, I weighed about 80 pounds (I am seriously short) and my backpack was really heavy. So it looked like he was picking on some high school kid and being a perv about it. We rode the same bus most mornings but he wouldn't come near me. Even if the only seat available was next to me, he would either stand or get the next bus. The bus driver was awesomely funny and started giving him crap about being afraid of the \"tiny little girl\". That went on for a month or so before he decided to ride a different bus to avoid us.",
            "First off, good for you.  I appreciates you for standing up for yourself.  And shame on him.  Grown men shouldn\u2019t act like that. That reminds me of my story from many years ago.  \n\nI (18m, and many many years ago) was sitting on the bus in an aisle seat in Amsterdam,and there were still plenty of open seats.  A very attractive, well dressed  gal got on, and was standing next to me and putting her card into her purse.  Well, the driver started suddenly, and she staggered back and was surely going to fall.  So I just reacted.  I caught her from behind, BY the behind, and kept her upright.  It happened so fast that neither of us had time to be either embarrassed or offended.  She turn, smiled, and said, \u201cThank you,\u201d and the ride continued as usual.  \n\nTL;DR. grabbed her by the butt, and she thanked me.",
