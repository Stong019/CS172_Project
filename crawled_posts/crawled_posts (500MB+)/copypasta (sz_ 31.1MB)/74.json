            "\nstock market is like a shop where like the limbs of a company is sold. Now, the money you used to buy their limbs will be used by the company to fund other things for their own. U might wonder why some stocks are expensive. Well let's put it this way, let's say that Angelina Jollie announces that she's selling her parts. And we know that Angelina Jollie is very popular, so that's the reason why her parts are more expensive. We can also say that she have done some controversy so her value declines and people will be selling her parts to somebody else. People sometimes will take advantage of this because the value is now cheaper. But we know, Angelina Jollie is can regain people's trust and again will boost value. How do we know this? It's publicly displayed in the media. Media will be our market. We check the TV for news and see what's currently happening. From there, we can see the current status although in real world, their are tickers for this. Ticker names is like Apple is to APPL. Now let's say that Angelina Jollie's stock price was $50 when you bought her back in 2000 and today the price is $150 because you know, Angelina gains so much popularity she was all over the media. You decided to sell the stock and now you just made $100 out of your $50.",

I would use my phone to look up photos of him and try to imagine he was in bed with me. He looks pretty much the same from photos and videos. Sometimes I would masturbate to videos of him just because I would find them really difficult to resist. I would masturbate in the bathroom, in the closet, in my bedroom, in my office. Anything. Even if I knew it would make me so depressed afterwards, I'd have to do it.\n\nI recently lost interest in Ben Shapiro, because he came out as a conservative, which he always seemed to be but he's too smart to act like that on purpose. He was never the kind of guy I would ever date, but now I realize that's how I was treating him.",

            "It  is  surprising  how  often  people  who  seek  analytic  treatment  for  hysteria  or an  obsessional  neurosis  confess  to  having  indulged  in  the  phantasy:  \u2018A  child  is being  beaten.\u2019  Very  probably  there  are  still  more  frequent  instances  of  it  among the  far  greater  number  of  people  who  have  not  been  obliged  to  come  to  analysis by  manifest  illness. The  phantasy  has  feelings  of  pleasure  attached  to  it,  and  on  their  account  the patient  has  reproduced  it  on  innumerable  occasions  in  the  past  or  may  even  still be  doing  so.  At  the  climax  of  the  imaginary  situation  there  is  almost  invariably  a masturbatory  satisfaction\u2014carried  out,  that  is  to  say,  on  the  genitals.  At  first  this takes  place  voluntarily,  but  later  on  it  does  so  in  spite  of  the  patient's  efforts,  and with  the  characteristics  of  an  obsession. It  is  only  with  hesitation  that  this  phantasy  is  confessed  to.  Its  first  appearance is  recollected  with  uncertainty.  The  analytic  treatment  of  the  topic  is  met  by unmistakable  resistance.  Shame  and  a  sense  of  guilt  are  perhaps  more  strongly excited  in  this  connection  than  when  similar  accounts  are  given  of  memories  of the  beginning  of  sexual  life. Eventually  it  becomes  possible  to  establish  that  the  first  phantasies  of  the kind  were  entertained  very  early  in  life:  certainly  before  school  age,  and  not later  than  in  the  fifth  or  sixth  year.  When  the  child  was  at  school  and  saw  other children  being  beaten  by  the  teacher,  then,  if  the  phantasies  had  become  dormant, this  experience  called  them  up  again,  or,  if  they  were  still  present,  it  reinforced them and  noticeably  modified  their  content.  From that  time  forward  it  was  \u2018an indefinite  number\u2019  of  children  that  were  being  beaten.  The  influence  of  the school  was  so  clear  that  the  patients  concerned  were  at  first  tempted  to  trace back  their  beating-phantasies  exclusively  to  these  impressions  of  school  life, which  dated  from later  than  their sixth  year.  But  it  was  never  possible  for  them to  maintain  that  position;  the phantasies  had  already  been  in  existence  before. Though  in  the  higher  forms  at  school  the  children  were  no  longer  beaten,  the influence  of  such  occasions  was  replaced  and  more  than  replaced  by  the  effects of  reading,  of  which  the  importance  was  soon  to  be  felt.  In  my  patients'  milieu  it was  almost  always  the  same  books  whose  contents  gave  a  new  stimulus  to  the beating-phantasies:  those  accessible  to  young  people,  such  as  what  was  known as  the  \u2018Biblioth\u00e8que  rose\u2019 ,  Uncle  Tom's  Cabin,  etc.  The  child  began  to 1 compete  with  these  works  of  fiction  by  producing  his  own  phantasies  and  by constructing  a  wealth  of  situations  and  institutions,  in  which  children  were beaten,  or  were  punished  and  disciplined  in  some  other  way,  because  of  their naughtiness  and  bad  behaviour. This  phantasy\u2014\u2018a  child  is  being  beaten\u2019\u2014was  invariably  cathected  with  a high  degree  of  pleasure  and  had  its  issue  in  an  act  of  pleasurable  auto-erotic satisfaction.  It  might  therefore  be  expected  that  the  sight  of  another  child  being beaten  at  school  would  also  be  a  source  of  similar  enjoyment.  But  as  a  matter  of fact  this  was  never  so.  The  experience  of  real  scenes  of  beating  at  school produced  in  the  child  who  witnessed  them a  peculiarly  excited  feeling  which was  probably  of  a  mixed  character  and  in  which  repugnance  had  a  large  share. In  a  few  cases  the  real  experience  of  the  scenes  of  beating  was  felt  to  be intolerable.  Moreover,  it  was  always  a  condition  of  the  more  sophisticated phantasies  of  later  years  that  the  punishment  should  do  the  children  no  serious injury. The  question  was  bound  to  arise  of  what  relation  there  might  be  between  the importance  of  the  beating-phantasies  and  the  part  that  real  corporal  punishment might  have  played  in  the  child's  bringing  up  at  home.  It  was  impossible,  on account  of  the  one-sidedness  of  the  material,  to  confirm  the  first  suspicion  that the  relation  was  an  inverse  one.  The  individuals  from whom the  data  for  these analyses  were  derived  were  very  seldom beaten  in  their  childhood,  or  were  at all  events  not  brought  up  by  the  help  of  the  rod.  Naturally,  however,  each  of these  children  was  bound  to  have  become  aware  at  one  time  or  another  of  the superior  physical  strength  of  its  parents  or  educators;  the  fact that  in  every  nursery  the  children  themselves  at  times  come  to  blows  requires  no special  emphasis. As  regards  the  early  and  simple  phantasies  which  could  not  be  obviously traced  to  the  influence  of  school  impressions  or  of  scenes  taken  from books, further  information  would  have  been  welcome.  Who  was  the  child  that  was being  beaten?  The  one  who  was  himself  producing  the  phantasy  or  another?  Was it  always  the  same  child  or  as  often  as  not  a  different  one?  Who  was  it  that  was beating  the  child?  A  grown-up  person?  And  if  so,  who?  Or  did  the  child  imagine that  he  himself  was  beating  another  one?  Nothing  could  be  ascertained  that  threw any  light  upon  all  these  questions\u2014only  the  hesitant  reply:  \u2018I  know  nothing  more about  it:  a  child  is  being  beaten.\u2019 Enquiries  as  to  the  sex  of  the  child  that  was  being  beaten  met  with  more success,  but  none  the  less  brought  no  enlightenment.  Sometimes  the  answer  was: \u2018Always  boys\u2019,  or  \u2018Only  girls\u2019  more  often  it  was:  \u2018I  don't  know\u2019,  or  \u2018It  doesn't matter  which\u2019.  But  the  point  to  which  the  questions  were  directed,  the  discovery of  some  constant  relation  between  the  sex  of  the  child  producing  the  phantasy and  that  of  the  child  that  was  being  beaten,  was  never  established.  Now  and again  another  characteristic  detail  of  the  content  of  the  phantasy  came  to  light: \u2018A  small  child  is  being  beaten  on  its  naked  bottom.\u2019 In  these  circumstances  it  was  impossible  at  first  even  to  decide  whether  the pleasure  attaching  to  the  beating-phantasy  was  to  be  described  as  sadistic  or masochistic.",

            "  I beat a child. He was just staring at me with his big, stupid face while I ate my delicious 8oz steak. His snot flapping in his nostrils and his eyes blinking out of sync infuriated me. The final straw was when he had the *audacity* to take a drink of his chocolate milk with his stupid idiot lips. I took my steak knife, which was stained with steak sauce and juices, and I stabbed him in the eyeball 98 times. I then proceeded to dumb an entire bottle of ketchup into his mouth as he screamed in pain. It gurgled with the force of a volcano. Finally, he stopped breathing altogether, and his mother called the police. When the police arrived, I used my half-eaten steak to beat them both to death, then I ran out, stripped off all my clothes, and ran naked through the local daycare, screaming \u201c98 STAB WOUNDS\u201d until I finally was apprehended by the authorities. I am facing 13 life sentences without parole.",

            "[Shot opens on ringing alarm bell; sirens and klaxons play in the background] The Administrator: \"Intruder Alert! A RED Spy is in the base!\" [Signs illuminate on a large security panel: \"Intruder Alert', 'RED Spy' and 'In Base'; pull out to reveal the BLU Soldier watching the board] Soldier: \"A RED Spy is in the base!?\" [Intruder Alert begins to play. The Soldier reaches from off-screen and pulls a Shotgun off a rack of weapons. Cut to the Soldier dashing down the stairs and through the 2Fort sublevel while saying \"Hut, Hut, Hut!\" with every step he takes] The Administrator: \"Protect the briefcase!\" Soldier: \"We need to protect the briefcase!\" [Camera pans to reveal the BLU Scout trying to open the code-locked 'Briefcase Room' door] Scout: \"Yo, a lil' help here!?\" [The Soldier pushes the Scout aside and begins to 'decode' the combination] Soldier: \"All right, all right, I got it. Stand back son. 1, 1, 1, umm... 1!\" Scout: \"Let's go, let's go-\" [BLU Heavy comes around the corner, Sasha in hand, charging towards the Scout and Soldier] Heavy: \"INCOMING!\" [Heavy shoulder-barges the door, destroying it. The three of them are sent tumbling and screaming into the Intelligence Room] Heavy: \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA- [screaming]\" [The Scout reaches the desk to discover the briefcase is perfectly safe] Scout: [while screaming, he notices the briefcase] \"AAAAAHHHH- Hey, it's still here!\" Heavy: \"-AAAAalright then.\" Spy: \"Ahem.\" [Camera zooms in to reveal the BLU Spy, with the BLU Sniper's corpse over one shoulder] Spy: \"Gentlemen.\" [Meet the Spy' Title Card] [Cut back to the Spy, carrying the dead Sniper towards the desk] Spy: \"I see the briefcase is safe.\" Soldier: \"Safe and sound, mm-hmm.\" Scout: \"Yeah, it is!\" Spy: \"Tell me... did anyone happen to kill a RED Spy on the way here?\" [The other three BLUs shake their heads and shrug] Spy: No? Then we still have a problem. [He deposits the Sniper's body on the desk, revealing a bloody Knife in his back] Soldier: \"...and a knife.\" [The Scout approaches and removes the knife] Scout: \"Oooh, big problem. I've killed plenty of Spies; they're dime-a-dozen back-stabbing scumbags - like you!\" [The Scout attempts to manipulate the knife like the Spy, only to cut himself with the blunt end on the finger and drop it] Scout: \"Ow! No offense.\" Spy: \"If you managed to kill them, I assure you, they were not like me.\" [The Spy deftly retrieves the knife and flicks it shut, handing it back to the Scout] \"And nothing... nothing like the man loose inside this building.\" Scout: \"What're you? President of his fan club?\" [The Soldier and Heavy chuckle while the Spy turns to face the Scout] Spy: \"No... that would be your mother!\" [The Spy reveals a folder and slaps it down on the table, revealing several compromising photographs of the RED Spy and the Scout's mother while Right Behind You plays] Scout: \"What the?\" [stammers out of shock and disbelief] Spy: Indeed, and now he's here to f**k us! So listen up boy, or pornography starring your mother will be the second worst thing that happens to you today.\" [The Soldier and Heavy examine the photographs. The Heavy leans over and shows the Soldier one photo in particular] Soldier: Oh! [The Scout frantically retrieves the photos as the Spy lights and smokes a cigarillo in the foreground] Scout: \"Gimme that!\" Spy: \"This Spy has already breached our defenses...\" [Fade to the RED Spy, creeping through the Hydro tunnels. He pauses at a corner, as the camera pulls back to reveal a BLU Level 3 Sentry Gun with its Engineer. He slides a Sapper across the floor, disarming and destroying the Sentry Gun immediately] Engineer: \"Sentry Down!\" [The BLU Engineer throws his Wrench down and frantically reaches for his Pistol, only to have the Spy shoot him in the head with the Revolver. The dead Engineer crashes through a door and the Spy steps over him and fires at a target off-screen] [Cut back to the BLU Intelligence Room. The BLU Spy leans over the dead Sniper, gesturing frantically.] Spy: \"You've seen what he's done to our colleagues!\" [Fade to the BLU Sniper, still alive and sniping from a dusty attic. The RED Spy creeps up on him and steps on a creaking floorboard, alerting the Sniper, who engages the Spy with the Kukri. A struggle ensues. Spy deftly dodges and parries Sniper\u2019s flailing attacks and counters with fatal strikes; the Sniper is cut across his left cheek (1:55), gutted under the right rib cage (1:57), cut across the back of his skull (1:58), and is ultimately backstabbed (1:59).] [Cut back to BLU Intelligence Room] Spy: \"And worst of all, he could be any one of us...\" [Fade to the RED Spy fighting a BLU Medic, armed with a Bonesaw] Medic: \"Raus, raus!\" [The Spy breaks the Medic's arm, disarming him. Close-up on the Spy's face as he disguises as the Medic, sans spectacles] Medic: [gasps] \"Nein...\" [The Spy kills the Medic with a well-placed chop to the throat, knocking off his spectacles, which he catches and wears, completing his disguise] [Cut back to BLU Intel Room. The BLU Spy looks frantic] Spy: \"He could be in this very room! He could be you! He could be me! He could even be-\" [The Spy is cut off as his head explodes violently. The camera switches to the Soldier, Shotgun in hand, with a confused Heavy and a panicked Scout] Scout: \"Whoa, whoa, whoa!\" Heavy: \"Oh!\" Soldier: \"What? It was obvious!\" [The Soldier pumps his Shotgun, discarding the spent shell.] \"He's the RED Spy! Watch, he'll turn red any second now...\" [The Soldier and Heavy approach the dead Spy, with The Soldier prodding the Spy's foot with his Shotgun] Soldier: \"Any second now... See? Red! Oh, wait... that's blood.\" Heavy: \"So, we still got problem...\" Soldier: \"Big problem...\" [The Scout lingers behind, his expression sinister. He approaches the Soldier and Heavy, retrieving the knife he pocketed earlier, and flicking it open easily] Soldier: All right, who's ready to go find this Spy?\" [As the Scout approaches, he flickers and melts, revealing himself to be the RED Spy] Spy: \"Right behind you.\" [Team Fortress 2 ending flourish music plays, with the stabbing of the Soldier and Heavy punctuating the beat of the tune.] [Petite Chou-Fleur plays] [Fade to the scattered photos of the Scout's mother. The RED Spy retrieves one of them and smiles wistfully] Spy: \"Ahh... ma petit chou-fleur.\" [The RED Spy walks off with the BLU team's intel in tow. Fade to black.]",

These include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Being gay\n* Dank copypasta bro, where'd you find it\n* walter\n\n# Am I going to shit and cum too?\n\nNo - not yet. But you should refrain from shitposting and cumposting like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to shit and cum again, which may put your shitting and cumming privileges in jeopardy.\n\n# I don't believe my comment deserved being shit and cum at. Can you un-cum it?\n\nSure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I put shit back into my butt. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a hot load explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to retaliatory ejaculation within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of semen dies before it can fertilize the egg, and yours is likely no exception.\n\n# How can I prevent this from happening in the future?\n\nAccept the goopy brown and white substance and move on.

A human being will arrive shortly to determine your punishment.*\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\nHello! I am the creator of the Cringe detecting BoT (CBT). It looks like our bot detected a cringe comment. Please give us a moment to review your comment and determine the cringe level in case this was an error.\n\n...\n\nYep! Sorry bro, but that\u2019s a real cringe comment! Fortunately, we\u2019ve got a strict punishment system to put cringe normies like you in their place! Here\u2019s what\u2019s gonna happen!\n\n#STAGE ONE\n\nYour comment will be downvoted. Remember: Posting cringe could cause you to lose subscriber!\n\n#STAGE TWO\n\nYou will be reported to the Reddit admins. This will aid us in stopping you from posting any more cringe.\n\n#STAGE THREE\n\nYou will start to feel a sense of uneasiness and/or the feeling of being watched. Ignore this. Everything is perfectly fine!\n\n#STAGE FOUR\n\nYou will start to have rather odd dreams. Here is a common example of what you can expect to see: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WJ2JyY_bIZU\n\n#STAGE FIVE\n\nDo not tell a n y o n e.\n\nThey don\u2019t need to know about you posting cringe! :D\n\n#STAGE SIX\n\nExactly eight days, twelve hours and thirteen minutes after you receive this message, go to your bed and lie down. Close your eyes. Make sure you are alone. (Wearing no clothing is preferred)\n\ne v e r y t h i n g\n\ni s \n\nf i n e\n\n#STAGE SEVEN\n\nTaking a painkiller or two might be helpful for this stage!\n\nYou should hear either your front door open or one of your windows smash.\n\nThis is fine.\n\nYou will hear something/someone come into your room.\n\nThis is fine.\n\nYour clothes will be taken off (If you are wearing any)\n\nThis is fine.\n\nYou will feel a sharp pain in the general area of your genitals. This is completely normal. The entity you saw in your dreams is NOT in the room with you. Make sure you keep your eyes closed!\n\n(Any sudden movements are also not recommended)\n\n#STAGE EIGHT\n\nWait approximately fifteen minutes. Please ignore the excruciating pain your private parts are currently in. Don\u2019t worry about the feeling of warm liquid pooling between your legs.\n\nRemember to keep your eyes closed! Making eye contact with h\u0334\u0358\u032ai\u0337\u030c\u0314\u0328\u0317m\u0335\u0308\u0317\u0321 isn\u2019t a real fun experience! :)\n\n#STAGE NINE\n\nAlright! The process is now complete!\n\nCheck it out! We ripped your foreskin off! Isn\u2019t that something? This is what cringe posters like you get!\n\nDo not tell anyone.\n\nDo not see a doctor.\n\nDo not go to a hospital.\n\n#BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY:\n\nDon\u2019t post cringe!\n\nHave a great day! Thank you for your time. (And foreskin!) \n\n;)",
