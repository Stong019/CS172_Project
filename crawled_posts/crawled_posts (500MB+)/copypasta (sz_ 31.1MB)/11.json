            "You know what FUCK you then You useless piece of shit. You absolute waste of space and air. You uneducated, ignorant, idiotic dumb swine, you\u2019re an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole. The magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as moniker of evil for heretics. Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did. When Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality. After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society. No wonder your father questioned whether or not your were truly his son, for you'd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member. Your birth made it so that mankind is worse of in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover into a state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune. I would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell. You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted sac religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair. You are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. Rhodes Island would have been better off if you'd never joined us. You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being. Even this worlds finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are. Anyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe. In the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now. You are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet you manage to make it so that that is only a small part of the evil that is your being. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an eldrich abomination, but here you are. It\u2019s hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you. Even if time travel some day will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to before this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors if they failed would have to many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it. I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did. The countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant. Right from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring. You are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the infected plague apparently only happened with the goal of teaching humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankind\u2019s greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created. If you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched. You are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again. The sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe. I could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating working as hard and efficiently as possible, yet there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world. You are an irresponsible, idiotic, disgusting, unloved, horrible excuse for a living being who\u2019s soul contains less humanity than every ginger in history combined. The absolute disgust I feel when thinking about anything that has even a slight resemblance to anything that might have to do with you and your unholy actions is so incredibly great that when I am honest about it I think that even I do not posses a consciousness great enough to comprehend my own feelings about it. When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children, they did not give their lives to have you fuck the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject become more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to understand what your failure actually means for the universe. My hate for you and everything you stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take the entire Lungmen population down there and back up around twenty million times before you would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I think that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world combined would not be able to stack up to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that when being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless. There is no one in this world that has ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, no one will ever love you in the future either. There is no hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will ever change for the better, and in fact quite the opposite might be true. By making the mistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will only devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are. The only possible way in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is would exclusively be because there is absolutely no conceivable way that you would even be able to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in. But than again, you are so incredibly abominable that you would probably be able to surpass the worst conceivable failure a living being could possibly make. You are so incredibly pathetic that you are honestly not worthy of any more of my words nor my time. Just know that I will forever detest you for your failure and everything you stand for, and that no matter what happens, I will never ever forgive you for what you have said.

            "The good ending:\n\nHey guys, did you know that in terms of human companionship, Flareon is objectively the most huggable Pokemon? While their maximum temperature is likely too much for most, they are capable of controlling it, so they can set themselves to the perfect temperature for you. Along with that, they have a lot of fluff, making them undeniably incredibly soft to touch. But that's not all, they have a very respectable special defense stat of 110, which means that they are likely very calm and resistant to emotional damage. Because of this, if you have a bad day, you can vent to it while hugging it, and it won't mind. It can make itself even more endearing with moves like Charm and Baby Doll Eyes, ensuring that you never have a prolonged bout of depression ever again.",

            "who the fuck  had this in mind, i wish you a very nice car crash, and why everyone keeps repeating this fucking thing over and over and over again? why?!",
            "Do you also know that in terms of male human and female Pok\u00e9mon breeding, Vaporeon is actually not the most compatible Pok\u00e9mon for humans? This is a common and understandable misconception, however Vaporeon has it's human on Pok\u00e9mon breedability outclassed by it's cousin evolution, Umbreon. Umbreon weights approximately 60 pounds, or around 27 kilograms, and is 3'3\" tall (About a meter), making it not only large enough to appropriately handle human genitalia, but also light enough to easily be lifted, and promptly set back down repeatedly. It's relatively small size would also prove a tight entry, which is always a good thing.Umbreon also boasts an extremely impressive defensive stat spread. With it's combination of very high HP, Defense, and Special Defense stats, it can take a great pounding and come back for more! It's ability, Inner Focus, allows it to keep slamming attentively, without getting fatigued. Umbreon also has access to the ability Synchronize, which allows it to share it's current status with you, meaning you will receive all of the pleasure it feels COMBINED with all the pleasure you're getting from pounding this perfect breedable Pok\u00e9mon. Umbreon also has the capability of seeing perfectly in pitch-black darkness, allowing it to effectively attend a midnight fornication session. Even if you do manage to drain Umbreon's energy with all the furious thrusts, it can recover very quickly with its access to the move Moonlight. Its black fur is also a giant positive attribute, allowing all the excretions you make to be easily seen all over its body. A great fun fact, Umbreon can excrete toxins in its sweat, which would in turn soak into your member and swell it up, making it even more sizable and sensitive. This would not only enhance the experience for you, but for your Umbreon as well (Which with Synchronize, ends up pleasing you exponentially more). Umbreon's wide movepool also supports the hypothesis that Umbreon is the best Pok\u00e9mon to breed with. It can learn Payback, which doubles in power after the Pok\u00e9mon is hit, meaning Umbreon with throw it back twice as hard as normally if you're hitting it good. Umbreon can also learn Guard Swap; it could give YOU its insane durability, and go crazy on you all night with your now massive endurance. Speaking of endurance, Umbreon also has access to Endure, making it practically immune to fatigue, it will always have energy left over. Charm is also within Umbreon's movepool, letting it be extremely seductive towards you, easily getting you in the mood. Umbreon can also use Taunt, in turn making you ONLY able to to attacking moves such as Slam, Pound, etc; none of that foreplay shit, right into the action. It also has access to Sleep Talk, giving it the ability to not only give consent in its sleep, allowing access to any of its ports and any time, but also move in it's sleep, making it an effective 24/7 fuckmate. Umbreon still has even more great moves that good to have while smashing, such as Quick Attack, allowing swift slams and bounces, which can have even greater power if Umbreon uses Curse beforehand. Curse would also raise Umbreon's defense, making it able to take powerful thrusting for almost any duration. Looking back, Umbreon's slightly small size ensures a gorilla grip cavity and easy physical manipulation. Its ungodly bulk allows it to take poundings for hours on end and resume after recovering with moonlight (Which works even better when it's sunny). It's access to the abilities Inner Focus and Synchronize allow it to unwaveringly throw it back and add all of its pleasure onto yours, effectively making it twice as amazing as any other Pok\u00e9mon, or even FOUR TIMES, factoring in the doubled power of payback of course. All of this information in combination with its extremely useful movepool in the world of intercourse makes Umbreon the Pok\u00e9mon most qualified to breed with humans; able to take dick of any shape, any size, in any position easily for extensive periods of time, while having the ability to return for even more mere seconds later.",

            "Well, well, well. It appears that u/jojojojojonesy is a fellow Vappy fuck connoisseur. However, screw the female version. You get those same ol' two holes in literally everything else. The male Vappy is the real star of the show.\r  \n\r  \nThose long slippery dicks. They have full mobility control with like a tentacle are the perfect ass filler for the ultimate in deep reaching experience nothing else could possibly provide. Naturally lubed at all times due to their aquatic hydrodynamic nature, you can pull off anywhere to the side of the road, or go into a public restroom at the beach. Get each other aroused, and have the fuck of a lifetime. The extraordinary squishyness of the Vappy alone rubbing against you would be enough to lose yourself in pleasure as it simply mounts you. Let alone with that perfect tool of pleasure slips into you, it's ability to snake around your bends and its perfect length make it seem that a Vappy dick was made specifically for your booty. Enjoy the feeling of being completely filled while also being able to see it if you have a tight tummy.\r  \n\r  \nAnd hat's only the dick. Due to having internal balls, they're much bigger and pack a lot more cream to load you up with, along with having muscles around them to make sure every drop comes out while also being a lot more powerful than any external balls could ever hope to achieve, giving you a deep, complete filling to rock your world to your literal core, and beyond.\r  \n\r  \nThere's still more though. Due to having a thick, powerful tail connected from their back and front, that means all their fun stuff is on the front and easy to access. Meaning, if you were even comfortable with having your dick point backwards (takes some training), you can be fucked, while also fucking your Vappy at the same time! Me-owth, that's fucking right!\r  \n\r  \nBut, but, but! There's still fucking more! Like, holy shit, male Vaps are the gods of fuck. While you're fucking your male Vappy, possibly while also being fucked by him, their booty is on their tail, at the base, which is the thickest part, because that's where the biggest muscles are. This means that while your dick is in there, it's being fucking massaged, better than even a vag could achieve! Agh! It should be fucking illegal because how amazing male Vaps are for fuck!\r  \n\r  \nWell, guess what? That only covered you being a softy, wholesome fucker like me. That's right. There's. Even. F\\*cking. More! Say you like to be a little restrained. You don't need a Sylveon's feelers for that, or an Umbreon/Espeon's psychic powers, or Leafeon's vines. Vappies got that shit covered too! Did you even see that tail?! It's basically a boa constrictor. In a non sexual sense, it's my favorite part of a Vappy. It's basically their main part about them. But, if you want them to, it can be a super useful tool to enhance your knotty experience with them. Despite the slippyness, you won't be going anywhere if the Vappy wraps you up in that thing.\r  \n\r  \nAre you a super kinkster? Do you like pure fantasy fetishes that aren't possible IRL? Such as, soft vore? Well guess fucking what. It just became possible! They can be solid as they pass your lips (passed where your eyes can see them) and turn into water as they enter you, allowing them to fit perfectly, cuz nothing fits into any spot more perfectly than water, except air, like a ghost type. But, who wants to do knotty shit with air? You can't feel it unless it's moving. You can always feel liquids. Speaking of liquids, even if you're a weirdo who likes digestion, don't worry about killing them with absorption. Eventually, they'll come back out and be able to reform like nothing happened. Speaking of hurting them, if you get too rough, or you're a horrible abusive asshole to them on purpose for your own pleasure (QnQ), they can just turn to water and reform back to their completely unscathed body, making scars or missing pieces a thing of the past!\r  \n\r  \nI would love to say there's even more you can do with them, but the possibilities are damn near endless. Use your imagination. But if you get one, you better show this god of fuck the respect it deserves. Umbreons maybe my favorite. But, damn, Vappies really want to get that top spot from me. It's a really close call.",

            "Hey guys did you know in terms of apocalyptic type Pok\u00e9mon, Vaporeon could end your city if it felt like it? Think about it, it could flood a dam with Hydro Pump or Rain Dance. Make an arid place more unbearable with Sunny Day. Even have snowy areas become a nightmare with Blizzard. It could easily destroy San Fracisco and New York with Surf. Think your safe below? It can dig and possibly sink you in a watery grave as it uses Water Gun to fill a hole. If you think your safe above ground or you could fight it with an armored vehicle, think again. It can use Aurora Beam to blow a hole into whatever you are in or on. I forgot to mention, it will probably have friends so it can use Helping Hand to bring you all down faster. It would also use Acid Armor to resist any attacks you can throw at it. But hey, it hasn't done anything... yet.",

            "Hey guys, did you know that in terms of human companionship, Flareon is actually NOT the most huggable pokemon? This is a common misconception, with the real most huggable pokemon being Sylveon, of course! A Sylveon is not only a great companion to cuddle and spend time with, but is also an expert at emotional support. They can use their ribbon-like feelers to read your emotions and therefore can know whenever you're sad, angry, lonely, etc, resulting in it always knowing exactly what's wrong without even needing to ask, helping it cheer you up accordingly. Since it evolved from its love for you, a Sylveon would probably be more affectionate than any other Eeveelution would be, allowing for prolonged sessions of cuddling or hugging to help cheer you up. Due to evolving from love, you can safely assume that it would have incredibly soft fur for cuddling or hugging. A Sylveon also has an impressive Special Defense stat of 130, meaning they are likely very calm and resistant to emotional damage. As a result of this, whenever you feel stressed out for any reason, or simply want someone to talk to, you can vent to it while hugging or cuddling, and it won't mind. Not only this, but Sylveon can also learn Calm Mind by TR, which can not only raise its special defense, but also get rid of any stress caused by venting to it. They can also learn and use moves such as Charm and Baby-Doll Eyes to make itself even more endearing. Let's not forget that Sylveon can also release a soothing aura from its feelers to calm you down, helping you deal with any anger or frustration you could ever face. Not only did Sylveon evolve because it loves you, it evolved because you love it, so it's safe to say even seeing your beloved Sylveon would cause a dopamine rush. As an added bonus, if you like going on walks, your Sylveon will wrap its feelers around your arm and walk with you. Sylveon are also known to battle against dragon pokemon many times larger than itself, so not only will your Sylveon provide amazing emotional support, your Sylveon will also defend you from any threat, should the time ever come that it would be required to.",

            "Hey guys, did you know that in terms of male human and female Pok\u00e9mon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible Pok\u00e9mon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3''03\u2019 tall and 63.9 pounds, this means they\u2019re large enough to be able handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip, along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it\u2019d be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pok\u00e9mon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick.

Scald, which it can learn, is called Boiling Water in Japanese, so you can bet that water is at least 100\u00b0C or 212\u00b0F. Not a good time.",

            "Firstly, the whole interspecies compatibility concept is a big no-no in biology. Different species have distinct genetic makeups, reproductive systems, and mating behaviors. It's called reproductive isolation, and it's a fundamental principle in speciation. Trying to mate a human with a Pok\u00e9mon (or any other species) would be like trying to breed a dolphin with a cactus - it's just not biologically feasible.\n\nNext, the \"water-based biology\" claim. All known life forms on Earth are carbon-based and require water, but that doesn't mean they're perpetually drenched. In fact, maintaining a certain level of dryness is crucial for many biological processes, including the function of cell membranes and the prevention of harmful bacterial growth. So, no, Vaporeon wouldn't be \"incredibly wet\" just because it's associated with water.\n\nSize and weight? Sure, Vaporeon's stats might be similar to a medium-sized dog, but that doesn't imply compatibility with humans. That's like saying a fridge is a suitable partner for a human because it's roughly the same height lol, it's a non-sequitur argument, meaning the conclusion doesn't logically follow from the premise.\n\nLastly, the color change assertion. In reality, color change in animals is typically a result of pigmentation and is influenced by genetics, not external factors like... arousing or else.. It's not like a chameleon that changes color based on its surroundings, and even that's a complex biological process involving specialized cells called chromatophores.\n\nIn a nutshell, all hopes breaks into reproductive isolation and well, reality how it is.",
            "Saving Power Ending:  \n\n\nHey guys, did you know that in terms of powering houses, Jolteon is the best choice? Since it has enough volts (10,000 Volts to be exact,) to power 45 houses! (46 if you put Jolteon to it's max) But we don't want to torcher the thing now do we? Because of it's lack of HP and Defense, it may not survive if it tries to Power half the amount of houses listed above. But Jolteon has an amazing Speed stat, so it can power 21 houses in no time! sure makes up for the other houses that don't get powered. But I know what you're all asking. \"What about all of it's special moves?\" Well, Jolteon has an amazing SP.Attack stat of 110, and with all of it's electric type moves at it's disposal, it could probably power 1.7 times the amount of the 21 houses I predicted before! so that makes... 35.7 Houses! Of course, it may have some slowdown by a little bit because Jolteon has to use more SP.Attack than Speed. So don't worry if the power goes out and you have a Jolteon on hand. You're Jolteon will be fine!",

Please consult the criteria below: \n\n\u2705You done a racism. \n\n\u2705You done a sexism. \n\n\u2705You done a bi-erasure. \n\n\u2705You heckin disrespected sex work. \n\nUpvoting is my weapon of justice, and the upvote button is my bullet. Pow. \n\nSo what does this mean?\nThe amount of karma (points) on your post and Reddit account has increased by one. \n\nWhy did you do this? \n\nThere are several reasons I may deem a post to be worthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to: \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Rudeness towards Other Redditors, \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Spreading incorrect information, \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s. \n\nAm I banned from the Reddit? \n\nNo - not yet. But you should. \n\nI don't believe my post deserved an upvote. Can you un-upvote it? \n\nSure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances Will I undo an upvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several years. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of upvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception. \n\nHow can I prevent this from happening in the future? \n\nAccept the upvote and move on. I will continue to issue upvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Mods are gay.",

It is one of 22 scheduled languages of India and is spoken by 2.88% of Indians. Malayalam has official language status in Kerala, Lakshadweep and Puducherry (Mah\u00e9),\\[9\\]\\[10\\]\\[11\\] and is spoken by 34 million people worldwide.\\[12\\] Malayalam is also spoken by linguistic minorities in the neighbouring states; with significant number of speakers in the Kodagu and Dakshina Kannada districts of Karnataka, and Nilgiris and Kanyakumari, districts of Tamil Nadu. Due to Malayali expatriates in the Persian Gulf, Malayalam is also widely spoken in the Gulf countries.  \nMalayalam was designated a \"Classical Language of India\" in 2013.\\[13\\]\\[14\\] The mainstream view holds that Malayalam descends from early Middle Tamil and separated from it sometime after the c.\u20099th century CE.\\[15\\] A second view argues for the development of the two languages out of \"Proto-Dravidian\" or \"Proto-Tamil-Malayalam\" in the prehistoric era,\\[16\\] although this is generally rejected by historical linguists.\\[17\\] It is generally agreed that the Quilon Syrian copper plates of 849/850 CE is the available oldest inscription written in Old Malayalam. The oldest literary work in Malayalam, distinct from the Tamil tradition, is dated from between the 9th and 11th centuries.\\[16\\]  \nThe earliest script used to write Malayalam was the Vatteluttu script.\\[8\\] The current Malayalam script is based on the Vatteluttu script, which was extended with Grantha script letters to adopt Indo-Aryan loanwords.\\[8\\]\\[18\\] It bears high similarity with the Tigalari script, a historical script that was used to write the Tulu language in South Canara, and Sanskrit in the adjacent Malabar region.\\[19\\] The modern Malayalam grammar is based on the book Kerala Panineeyam written by A. R. Raja Raja Varma in late 19th century CE.\\[20\\] The first travelogue in any Indian language is the Malayalam Varthamanappusthakam, written by Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar in 1785.\\[21\\]\\[22\\]",

These include, but are not limited to:\n \n* Rudeness towards other Redditors,\n* Spreading incorrect information,\n* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a `/s`.\n \n## Am I banned from the Reddit?\n \nNo - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.\n \n## I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?\n \nSure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.\n \n## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?\n \nAccept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",

            "Meanwhile, this is what an O5 would see:\n\nSCP-58008 is a self-replicating cognitohazard spread via a specific viral video, first discovered on 21-01-2021 by foundation staff conducting a routine inspection of D-class personnel barracks.  The anomalous video showcases a gameplay demo of a self-described horror game which does not match any released titles on any known platforms.  \n\nThe video's anomalous nature became evident when the aforementioned barracks inspection passed by the bunk of D-3819, who rapidly closed and hid a limited-use laptop (note: device was conditionally issued as a reward for exemplary anomalous object testing performance).  D-3819 proceeded to  compulsively and repeatedly state \"It's just a horror game demo Let's Play\", despite a lack of relevant query from inspectors.\n\nThis behavior prompted staff to recover and examine the device, resulting in discovery of the anomalous video.  Staff performed an online meta-search and discovered that, while the video was widespread, the game depicted did not exist.  Junior Researcher Maldonado volunteered to test the effects of the object, offering the following justification to fellow staff members who were present at the time:\n\n\"[D-3819] was already exposed to this thing for who knows how long, and the other D-personnel in the barracks would've at least overheard it.  For an accurate exposure timeline, we should select a fresh test candidate from among us, who have only just seen it for the first time.  I'll do it myself, but I'll need the cameras in the test room disabled, and the windows shuttered, to prevent the spread of any potential memetic hazards.\"\n\nJunior Researcher Maldonado then proceeded to engage in an unsanctioned anomalous object test.  Contrary to his request, the other junior researchers present re-enabled the test chamber's camera after several minutes.\n\nRecorded footage caught the end of the video, during which the pretense of a horror game is eschewed as a pale woman of approximately 2.9 meters in height enters the scene and violently grabs the viewer's \"character\".  At this point, Junior Researcher Maldonado began to engage in distressing compulsive behavior while repeatedly re-watching the final 2 minutes and 50 seconds of the video.\n\nThe other junior researchers who were monitoring the camera feed reacted by disabling the camera, then dispersing to continue their duties.  The test chamber was opened three hours later to prepare for routine scheduled testing, and Junior Researcher Maldonado was found badly dehydrated, and subsequent medical examination also revealed that his genitals were obliterated by repeated and vigorous self-inflicted compulsive behavior.\n\nFurther testing is on hold, pending site director approval.",

            "WARNING! Carry on reading, or your soul will be taken, even if you read the word \"warning\"! There once was a man named Duke Hunapon. He was lazy, and very uncaring. He always wore a jacket, no matter how warm it was outside. He had an older brother named Michael who always bossed him around. One day, Michael was killed, and it affected Duke greatly. He went insane and started murdering people. Soon, he got into a fight with someone and got killed. Now, he roams around as a tall skeleton with a red shirt, and the exact same hoodie that Duke wore. This skeleton was known as \"Swapfell Papyrus\", and he will kill you if you don't post this on 15 comment sections of any website before your bedtime. If you fail, and you wake up when he's in your room, your death will be slow and very painful. A girl named Lily Lilupanin read this, and didn't listen. She was (EEE) and killed in her sleep. If you copy and paste this on 15 comment sections of any website before your bedtime, Swapfell Papyrus will make sure you feel safe.\"",
