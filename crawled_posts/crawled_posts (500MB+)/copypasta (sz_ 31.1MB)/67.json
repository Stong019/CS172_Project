        "selftext": "Rabies. It's exceptionally common, but people just don't run into the animals that carry it often. Skunks especially, and bats.\n\nLet me paint you a picture.\n\nYou go camping, and at midday you decide to take a nap in a nice little hammock. While sleeping, a tiny brown bat, in the \"rage\" stages of infection is fidgeting in broad daylight, uncomfortable, and thirsty (due to the hydrophobia) and you snort, startling him. He goes into attack mode.\n\nExcept you're asleep, and he's a little brown bat, so weighs around 6 grams. You don't even feel him land on your bare knee, and he starts to bite. His teeth are tiny. Hardly enough to even break the skin, but he does manage to give you the equivalent of a tiny scrape that goes completely unnoticed.\n\nRabies does not travel in your blood. In fact, a blood test won't even tell you if you've got it. (Antibody tests may be done, but are useless if you've ever been vaccinated.)\n\nYou wake up, none the wiser. If you notice anything at the bite site at all, you assume you just lightly scraped it on something.\n\nThe bomb has been lit, and your nervous system is the wick. The rabies will multiply along your nervous system, doing virtually no damage, and completely undetectable. You literally have NO symptoms.\n\nIt may be four days, it may be a year, but the camping trip is most likely long forgotten. Then one day your back starts to ache... Or maybe you get a slight headache?\n\nAt this point, you're already dead. There is no cure.\n\n(The sole caveat to this is the Milwaukee Protocol, which leaves most patients dead anyway, and the survivors mentally disabled, and is seldom done).\n\nThere's no treatment. It has a 100% kill rate.\n\nAbsorb that. Not a single other virus on the planet has a 100% kill rate. Only rabies. And once you're symptomatic, it's over. You're dead.\n\nSo what does that look like?\n\nYour headache turns into a fever, and a general feeling of being unwell. You're fidgety. Uncomfortable. And scared. As the virus that has taken its time getting into your brain finds a vast network of nerve endings, it begins to rapidly reproduce, starting at the base of your brain... Where your \"pons\" is located. This is the part of the brain that controls communication between the rest of the brain and body, as well as sleep cycles.\n\nNext you become anxious. You still think you have only a mild fever, but suddenly you find yourself becoming scared, even horrified, and it doesn't occur to you that you don't know why. This is because the rabies is chewing up your amygdala.\n\nAs your cerebellum becomes hot with the virus, you begin to lose muscle coordination, and balance. You think maybe it's a good idea to go to the doctor now, but assuming a doctor is smart enough to even run the tests necessary in the few days you have left on the planet, odds are they'll only be able to tell your loved ones what you died of later.\n\nYou're twitchy, shaking, and scared. You have the normal fear of not knowing what's going on, but with the virus really fucking the amygdala this is amplified a hundred fold. It's around this time the hydrophobia starts.\n\nYou're horribly thirsty, you just want water. But you can't drink. Every time you do, your throat clamps shut and you vomit. This has become a legitimate, active fear of water. You're thirsty, but looking at a glass of water begins to make you gag, and shy back in fear. The contradiction is hard for your hot brain to see at this point. By now, the doctors will have to put you on IVs to keep you hydrated, but even that's futile. You were dead the second you had a headache.\n\nYou begin hearing things, or not hearing at all as your thalamus goes. You taste sounds, you see smells, everything starts feeling like the most horrifying acid trip anyone has ever been on. With your hippocampus long under attack, you're having trouble remembering things, especially family.\n\nYou're alone, hallucinating, thirsty, confused, and absolutely, undeniably terrified. Everything scares the literal shit out of you at this point. These strange people in lab coats. These strange people standing around your bed crying, who keep trying to get you \"drink something\" and crying. And it's only been about a week since that little headache that you've completely forgotten. Time means nothing to you anymore. Funny enough, you now know how the bat felt when he bit you.\n\nEventually, you slip into the \"dumb rabies\" phase. Your brain has started the process of shutting down. Too much of it has been turned to liquid virus. Your face droops. You drool. You're all but unaware of what's around you. A sudden noise or light might startle you, but for the most part, it's all you can do to just stare at the ground. You haven't really slept for about 72 hours.\n\nThen you die. Always, you die.\n\nAnd there's not one... fucking... thing... anyone can do for you.\n\nThen there's the question of what to do with your corpse. I mean, sure, burying it is the right thing to do. But the fucking virus can survive in a corpse for years. You could kill every rabid animal on the planet today, and if two years from now, some moist, preserved, rotten hunk of used-to-be brain gets eaten by an animal, it starts all over.\n\nSo yeah, rabies scares the shit out of me. And it's fucking EVERYWHERE. (Source: Spent a lot of time working with rabies. Would still get my vaccinations if I could afford them.)",

            "In fact, since the \"miracle\" case of 2004 more and more survival cases emerge. Most of them with previous or incomplete vaccination. And most with poor results. But it shows that it's not really 100%. The survival cases just weren't reported. Probably because most of the cases happen in regions where nothing gets reported from.\n\nBut what's even more interesting is that some people were discovered to have had the virus without them knowing it. A screening of some communities in Peru discovered people who had been bitten by bats and exposed to the virus, but naturally fended it off without any previous vaccination.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3414554/",

            "I remember the time my family and I were driving up to my grandparents\u2019 house, which is on a farm, for Thanksgiving. We were driving down a road surrounded by trees when suddenly we stopped because there was a skunk about ten yards ahead of us. It was staggering in circles, dragging its back right leg. I immediately knew it was rabid, as skunks hardly ever come out during the day, and it was showing signs of its nervous system shutting down. I immediately turned to my mother and informed her of this. She decided to call my grandfather and see what he thought, as he did a lot of animal studies in college. He corroborated my statement. \n\nMy dad pulled out his gun and hopped out of the car to kill it. It took a few shots. He hit it in the leg, and all it did was twitch and keep circling. It flicked its tail up a little bit immediately dropped it back down. He shot it a few more times. When it had finally dropped and died, I got out and walked up to it. It was such a surreal moment. Staring at the foamy mouth and blood droplets on the grey dirt, the wind ruffling the corpse\u2019s fur. It was quiet. The gunshots had frightened away any other creatures. I could hear the wind and my heartbeat. I had that strange feeling of being in the presence of an invisible threat. \n\nSomething microscopic that could easily kill me. We later triple-bagged it and buried it about six feet deep. It was a moment that reminded me that rabies truly could be lurking right in my own backyard. It\u2019s the stuff of nightmares.",

            "There is a novel written at the begining of '80s by Serbian writer Borislav Pekic called Rabies. It is being translated in English as well. I highly recomend it. Mutated Rabies outbreak at Heathrow airport. It has 600 pages and i read it in two days. Three times in total. Amazing novel.",
            "Okay so I need someone to tell me how scared I should be right now...\nMy neighbor's friend came over holding a raccoon. It was young but not a baby. It was completely tame! He said he found it in the daylight... he said it was struggling to climb a tree and he just simply went over and picked it up. It's acting almost like a pet. It's not scared of him at all. It's not foaming at the mouth or drooling or anything like that.. the only abnormal behavior is the fact that it is not at all scared of any of us. I opted not to touch it because I didn't want it to freak out and bite me.. then the guy says he thinks it's someone's pet that got away. He says it's hurt and it's limping. We think it might have possibly been hit by a car? But really unsure... anyway he tells me that it doesn't stink and it in fact smells good almost like Dawn dish detergent. He insists I smell it. He holds his head as I bury my nose in its fur and take a deep wiff. He's right!! It didn't stink at all.. it didn't smell good... but it didn't stink. Absolutely did not smell like soap in any way. I would say it smelled kind of like wood shavings..\nI instantly regret it. I remember how scary rabies is. I remember I have a cut in my right nostril. I remember that rabies does not have to be transmitted by a bite it can be transmitted through mucous membranes such as, you guessed it, my freaking nose. \n\nI go inside and immediately wash my hands and face and nose with soap. I even went as far as to put hand sanitizer on my hands and forearms and even some in my nostrils. I'm now freaking out and wondering if I should actually get the vaccine. I hear it's extremely painful so I'd like to avoid it if possible. And it's not like the animal was acting rabid, it was just extremely strange how very not scared it was of us.\n\nHe left taking the raccoon with him and I don't know where he lives. I did ask him if the raccoon is drinking water and he said yes, so that makes me feel better.\n\nHow scared should I be right now? Am I being a hypochondriac? Am I freaking out for nothing?\n\nOr am I not freaking out enough? Should I be at the ER right now getting a rabies shot?",
            "Rabies is scary.\n\nRabies. It's exceptionally common, but people just don't run into the animals that carry it often. Skunks especially, and bats.\n\nLet me paint you a picture.\n\nYou go camping, and at midday you decide to take a nap in a nice little hammock. While sleeping, a tiny brown bat, in the \"rage\" stages of infection is fidgeting in broad daylight, uncomfortable, and thirsty (due to the hydrophobia) and you snort, startling him. He goes into attack mode.\n\nExcept you're asleep, and he's a little brown bat, so weighs around 6 grams. You don't even feel him land on your bare knee, and he starts to bite. His teeth are tiny. Hardly enough to even break the skin, but he does manage to give you the equivalent of a tiny scrape that goes completely unnoticed.\n\nRabies does not travel in your blood. In fact, a blood test won't even tell you if you've got it. (Antibody tests may be done, but are useless if you've ever been vaccinated.)\n\nYou wake up, none the wiser. If you notice anything at the bite site at all, you assume you just lightly scraped it on something.\n\nThe bomb has been lit, and your nervous system is the wick. The rabies will multiply along your nervous system, doing virtually no damage, and completely undetectable. You literally have NO symptoms.\n\nIt may be four days, it may be a year, but the camping trip is most likely long forgotten. Then one day your back starts to ache... Or maybe you get a slight headache?\n\nAt this point, you're already dead. There is no cure.\n\n(The sole caveat to this is the Milwaukee Protocol, which leaves most patients dead anyway, and the survivors mentally disabled, and is seldom done).\n\nThere's no treatment. It has a 100% kill rate.\n\nAbsorb that. Not a single other virus on the planet has a 100% kill rate. Only rabies. And once you're symptomatic, it's over. You're dead.\n\nSo what does that look like?\n\nYour headache turns into a fever, and a general feeling of being unwell. You're fidgety. Uncomfortable. And scared. As the virus that has taken its time getting into your brain finds a vast network of nerve endings, it begins to rapidly reproduce, starting at the base of your brain... Where your \"pons\" is located. This is the part of the brain that controls communication between the rest of the brain and body, as well as sleep cycles.\n\nNext you become anxious. You still think you have only a mild fever, but suddenly you find yourself becoming scared, even horrified, and it doesn't occur to you that you don't know why. This is because the rabies is chewing up your amygdala.\n\nAs your cerebellum becomes hot with the virus, you begin to lose muscle coordination, and balance. You think maybe it's a good idea to go to the doctor now, but assuming a doctor is smart enough to even run the tests necessary in the few days you have left on the planet, odds are they'll only be able to tell your loved ones what you died of later.\n\nYou're twitchy, shaking, and scared. You have the normal fear of not knowing what's going on, but with the virus really fucking the amygdala this is amplified a hundred fold. It's around this time the hydrophobia starts.\n\nYou're horribly thirsty, you just want water. But you can't drink. Every time you do, your throat clamps shut and you vomit. This has become a legitimate, active fear of water. You're thirsty, but looking at a glass of water begins to make you gag, and shy back in fear. The contradiction is hard for your hot brain to see at this point. By now, the doctors will have to put you on IVs to keep you hydrated, but even that's futile. You were dead the second you had a headache.\n\nYou begin hearing things, or not hearing at all as your thalamus goes. You taste sounds, you see smells, everything starts feeling like the most horrifying acid trip anyone has ever been on. With your hippocampus long under attack, you're having trouble remembering things, especially family.\n\nYou're alone, hallucinating, thirsty, confused, and absolutely, undeniably terrified. Everything scares the literal shit out of you at this point. These strange people in lab coats. These strange people standing around your bed crying, who keep trying to get you \"drink something\" and crying. And it's only been about a week since that little headache that you've completely forgotten. Time means nothing to you anymore. Funny enough, you now know how the bat felt when he bit you.\n\nEventually, you slip into the \"dumb rabies\" phase. Your brain has started the process of shutting down. Too much of it has been turned to liquid virus. Your face droops. You drool. You're all but unaware of what's around you. A sudden noise or light might startle you, but for the most part, it's all you can do to just stare at the ground. You haven't really slept for about 72 hours.\n\nThen you die. Always, you die.\n\nAnd there's not one... fucking... thing... anyone can do for you.\n\nThen there's the question of what to do with your corpse. I mean, sure, burying it is the right thing to do. But the fucking virus can survive in a corpse for years. You could kill every rabid animal on the planet today, and if two years from now, some moist, preserved, rotten hunk of used-to-be brain gets eaten by an animal, it starts all over.\n\nSo yeah, rabies scares the shit out of me. And it's fucking EVERYWHERE. (Source: Spent a lot of time working with rabies. Would still get my vaccinations if I could afford them.)",

            "It's not that the game is addicting, it's just that there are no decent alternatives.\n\nWar Thunder is basically the intellectual version of the FPS games that all the stupid children and mongoloid brains play. Instead of just being based purely on twitch \"skills\" which require as much intellectual ability as closing popup spam windows, in War Thunder you have to use at least some tactics and strategy. FPS games are like playing Pong on high speed. War Thunder is like playing chess.\n\nThe art of gaming is simply dead for big brains. 20 years ago there were tons of games that required brainpower because PC gaming back then was by nerds and for nerds, but then the corporate suits took over and were like \"broaden the appeal to we can make more sales\" so everything got dumbed down to the lowest common denominator. \n\nMy GF asked me if I was \"having fun\" playing War Thunder, and I looked at her like she was a fucking retard to even consider that sentence a valid question. I don't have FUN playing War Thunder. This game routinely pisses me off and makes me rage. However, when I stomp the entire enemy team and crush them so utterly I can hear the lamentations of their mothers, I feel satisfaction. \n\nI spent weeks grinding for Operation Winter. The vikings had a word for this. They called it Valhalla. Endless war. Endless combat. Knowing only victory and death. Bathing in the blood of your enemies. You get 15 kills and bask in glory and rewards, and think: what should I do now? Should I get in my Honda Fit and tour the local strip mall for my Triumph? Should I microwave some tendies and throw myself a great Feast? But there is only one option. There is only ever one option.

Rather than accept the harsh reality that you\u2019ve wasted a significant portion of your life on something that doesn\u2019t even make you happy, you retroactively justify it and end up sounding like lunatic.",
            "Damn, this is sad to read... and a lot to unpack here.\n\n> There are no decent alternatives [because all the other FPS games don't actually rquire skill, so they're not for big brains like me]\n\nYeah I'm pretty sure there are other FPS games that require tactical thinking and besides, while I don't play War Thunder, the comments here make it appear as if a big portion of the required skill directly connects to moms credit card.\n\n> It's not that the game is addicting\n\nYou sure about that? You play that game fully knowing that you won't have fun (tbf I play For Honor, but at least I have the illusion I'd have fun before I start the game), you can't stop playing it even though you admit that the game regularly pisses you off and you unironically compare it to both Heaven and Hell of varios religions.

Instead of just being based purely on twitch \"skills\" which require as much intellectual ability as closing popup spam windows, in War Thunder you have to use at least some tactics and strategy. FPS games are like playing Pong on high speed. War Thunder is like playing chess.\n\nThe art of gaming is simply dead for big brains. 20 years ago there were tons of games that required brainpower because PC gaming back then was by nerds and for nerds, but then the corporate suits took over and were like \"broaden the appeal to we can make more sales\" so everything got dumbed down to the lowest common denominator.\n\nMy GF asked me if I was \"having fun\" playing War Thunder, and I looked at her like she was a fucking retard to even consider that sentence a valid question.

Should I microwave some tendies and throw myself a great Feast? But there is only one option. There is only ever one option. **To Battle!**\n\nVarious cultures have alternatively described the gameplay loop of War Thunder as their vision of Heaven or Hell. It is both.",

            "Hello world! Can you talk at me for about 10 minutes? That's it just keep writing to help new users learn the formatting instructions that will save them when reading r/copypasta posts...\n\n1. Use Markdown to italicize parts of your post, put four spaces between each line.\n\n2. Include footnotes and superscript whenever you have data worth referencing.\n\n3. Keep this format for paragraphs too, but I actually recommend wrapping some of these lines and breaking this into multiple \"sentences\" for ease. For instance. *I'm learning* to type with my thumbs. *What does this mean?! You're a robot!!??!!* No man no woman can live without food so it's important to eat breakfast at dawn. Eat everything they sell through the grocery store and don't leave anything. Always take the most expensive ones at restaurants! Never leave reviews on websites. You shouldn't criticize other copiers, otherwise people won't buy you and they definitely won't tell their best friend. Before taking a shower wear rubber boots inside the house, cause the floor can get messy from spills and splatters for quite awhile! Put a rag down right by your computer, use it regularly. A hard clean might work but water works better. Spray like crazy because you know where drops go and spread a slick liquid all over the ground so it's hard to stand on there. Don't drink while wearing any sorta clothes, you don't want the stains. Stick with white pants cause blood pools up dark and is very noticeable. When shaving it helps to wet the top, then just shave once instead of wasting more hair as you grow older for years! I'm sorry your mommy did not look good either on that dress when she died. Get plenty of sleep because if you dont get to bed really quickly how could ya ever wake up? To keep up motivation and excitement in life watch the news at least 1 - 2 times every morning. The channels are for sale on websites too!!\n\nIt took 4 days to train the model using online resources + textbooks, then test for the next several weeks before deciding it should be released on the general public, but i've gotten a thousand sales. please continue sharing the info here. i will contact kj as soon as I find him god bless \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude09",

They all just have to say \u201ciS THat A JOJo ReFErEncE??!!!1\u201d on every fucking post that contains a single word that may have been used in the shitty comics. Oh, a suspicious link? Probably a rickroll. NOPE!!! They\u2019ve ruined that, too! One of the oldest goddamn internet traditions shat on and ruined by JoJo fanboys. Thunder Cross Split Attack! So fucking funny, right? I\u2019m wheezing! NO. SHUT THE FUCK UP. Nobody cares about your shitty comic series. Dio is a stupid character from a stupid comic series. I downvote every post and comment that mentions JoJo, out of pure bloodcurdling rage. I want to detonate a MASSIVE thermonuclear warhead right on top of whatever godforsaken studio publishes that stinking-pile-of-trash comic. Frankly, I don\u2019t even care for the civilian casualties, either. At least they died for a good reason.  Unlike JoJo fans, I actually contribute to the betterment of mankind, instead of spamming shitty references on the internet. Every JoJo fan that dies a slow, painful death is a win in my book. I have claimed over a dozen of them already, too. I annihilated their skulls with my fists. Their stupid ice attack didn\u2019t do shit for them either. They dies like they lived, pathetic excuses for humans. I hope more people hear my message and declare war on JoJo. If nobody helps me, I will do as much damage as I possibly can before I die. Thank you.\n\nI am Dennis Prager. Thank you for listening. To keep these messages free, please consider making  a tax-deductible donation of JoJo fanboys\u2019 heads.",

            "You useless piece of shit. You absolute waste of space and air. You uneducated, ignorant, idiotic dumb swine, you\u2019re an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole. The magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as moniker of evil for heretics. Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did. When Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality. After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society. No wonder your father questioned whether or not your were truly his son, for you'd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member. Your birth made it so that mankind is worse of in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover into a state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune. I would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell. You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted sac religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair. You are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. Rhodes Island would have been better off if you'd never joined us. You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being. Even this worlds finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are. Anyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe. In the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now. You are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet you manage to make it so that that is only a small part of the evil that is your being. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an eldrich abomination, but here you are. It\u2019s hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you. Even if time travel some day will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to before this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors if they failed would have to many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it. I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did. The countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant. Right from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring. You are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the infected plague apparently only happened with the goal of teaching humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankind\u2019s greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created. If you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched. You are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again. The sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe. I could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating working as hard and efficiently as possible, yet there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world. You are an irresponsible, idiotic, disgusting, unloved, horrible excuse for a living being who\u2019s soul contains less humanity than every ginger in history combined. The absolute disgust I feel when thinking about anything that has even a slight resemblance to anything that might have to do with you and your unholy actions is so incredibly great that when I am honest about it I think that even I do not posses a consciousness great enough to comprehend my own feelings about it. When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children, they did not give their lives to have you fuck the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject become more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to understand what your failure actually means for the universe. My hate for you and everything you stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take the entire Lungmen population down there and back up around twenty million times before you would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I think that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world combined would not be able to stack up to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that when being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless. There is no one in this world that has ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, no one will ever love you in the future either. There is no hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will ever change for the better, and in fact quite the opposite might be true. By making the mistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will only devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are. The only possible way in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is would exclusively be because there is absolutely no conceivable way that you would even be able to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in.

They don't care about the manga, they don't even know it's based off a manga. They think there are only 5 parts. They only want to finally understand references that people make, and when they do, they make sure they point out, loud and clear, that they understand it. They want to fit in, but in the end they're annoying little shits who give the show a shitty reputation. These are the people OP is talking about.

You know, I have seen the most bizarre things from some guy in class jerking it to Ronald Reagan tentacle hentai, to people linking Chernobyl to penis-shaped aliens, but your comment is by far the most fucking idiotic thing I have ever had the kind of horrible fucking luck one requires to hear your stupid fucking post. From this point on, when I think of you, I will imagine a diseased turtle taking an enormous dump, with so much unbelievably large amounts of shit that all the protons inside of the methyl sulfide this horrendous crap contains spontaneously fuse into uranium-235 that I can use to shove a nuke up your sub-mental ass. You can write that off as an exaggeration but it is 100% true from the bottom of my already-empty heart. I legitimately think that you lack intelligence. I would say you're mentally unstable but then I couldn't blame the terribly ignorant fucking post on you. I literally cannot comprehend how amazingly dimwitted your dumb ass is. I have trouble understanding the laws of physics, space, and time as if all laws of reality have been devastated and disintegrated due to how dense you are. I could write a damn book on your lack of intelligence that is so long, one could read the entire Series of Unfortunate Events series, watch the entire Godfather trilogy, and invent fucking time travel itself before it could even be published under a first edition. Half-Life 3 would be released centuries before I could finish the first chapter describing your purely pointless state of mind. I honestly cannot tell if you were abused too much or not abused enough, because you clearly did not go to school enough to get a proper fucking education. To quote George Washington, \"Associate with men of good quality if you esteem your own reputation; for it is better to be alone than in bad company.\" In that case, I'm getting as far away from you as possible. Hell, I'm actually unironically considering moving to Macquarie Island just to be isolated from your brain cell-killing words for the rest of my now-miserable life. I would rather go insane from thinking about you to the point where I pull a Cast Away and consider sexual relations with a volleyball than actually spending time anywhere near you. There is honestly no other way of putting it; you're an irritating asshole who contributes absolutely nothing to this already dreadful planet. And that's saying a lot considering the fact that I've heard of carbon dioxide levels reaching 400 parts per million, Donald Trump becoming president, and toxic fucking comment sections that contain your stupid bullshit. And again I go, being confused by whatever quantum physics you are using to defy the laws of physics with your stupidity, to the point where I'm saying you are worse than yourself. I have nothing else that is most definitely as horrible as you to compare to except you yourself. How does that make you feel? Like a turtle taking a nuclear shit? I really don't have a single shit to give anyway, because you are living proof that there is no hope for humanity left. Really went downhill after that whole thing where Rome fell; that made a lot of people pissed off. But not as pissed off as I am after reading your stupid shit. No, buddy, if I should even call you that, I am not pissed off at your comment. I am FURIOUS. I am so furious that I will personally take that radioactive turtle shit myself just so I can rid the world of your baffling levels of unadulterated doltishness. You are more dull than oxygenated magnesium or even a samurai sword that hasn't been sharpened for a thousand years. And you better be glad that the sword is dull, because if it wasn't, it would be shoved up your ass just like the nuclear turtle shit. I am so fucking angry that even watching an Adam Sandler movie will make me happier than I am right now. If the Greeks made a god of stupidity, you would be the closest candidate to that fucking role. It's not a good thing when you're so fucking unintelligent that people like Socrates would get on their toga-wearing-ass knees to worship your dumb fucking ass. That's when you need to reconsider obviously pointless life choices. Read a fucking book for crying out loud, man! What the literal fuck is wrong with you? After this fiasco I will need at least 12 hours of building up sanity with my psychiatrist. After this she will need to prescribe Ritalin that I will have to take 5 times an hour just to prevent me from snapping because of your disgusting act of stupidity. Your post gave me type 5 syphilis, which I didn't even fucking know existed until I felt itchy dick. Thanks a fucking lot. That was sarcasm, by the way, if you're too stupid to understand what that is (you probably are). Is it even legal for someone to be enough of a dumbass to make someone experience these sorts of emotions? Witnessing your stupid shit was like crawling through the depths of Tarturus itself and Cleveland. I have no words to describe this unintelligible shit yet I have so many. Once more, a paradox caused by stupid turtle shit. I have the most uncomfortable urge to strangle you Edgar Allan Poe style, you evil-eyed, black cat piece of fuck. Put that on your fucking tombstone. For Pete's sake man, you have drained almost every last sane brain cell I have developed ever since my unplanned birth and made my life more unenjoyable than it has to be you fucking cholesterol-ridden shit. I already consider jumping in front of a steamroller whenever I look at my uglyass reflection in the mirror, and then you come along and do this stupid fucking shit. Making me think of turtle shit infused with uranium-235. I'll punch you so fucking fast the force of your damn teeth breaking will cause nuclear fusion to happen from all the damn kinetic energy and make you implode into your possibly nonexistent dick. You want to defy logic, I will too motherfucker. You're possibly the most ignorant piece of fuck I have had the unfortunate chance to stumble upon in the butthole of the internet. I hope that shittyass post was worth it because I am going to kick your shitposting ass if I ever cross paths with you. Eat nuclear turtle shit.",

We've witnessed many of our favorite characters' deaths, and it feels almost as bad as loosing someone in real life. \n\nAdditionally, I've made many friends because I watched JoJo. Sharing the same hobbies or ideas can bring people together. If it weren't for anime in general, I would still be lonely and would have no one to share memes to. I'm sure many people have felt the same feeling, the feeling that you have no one to talk to. It's terrible, but because of JoJo, I've made multiple friends.\n\nAgain, I apologize for the trouble we're causing, but what you're doing isn't okay either. You should chill and see how people are from a different angle. Yeah, you can say that I should be burning in hell, but not everyone is the same in the JoJo community.\n\nHave a \\[great day\\], bro.\n\n\\-Nori (@four\\_eyes04)",

I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.",

Upon ejaculation, a male releases 15 to 200 million sperm cells. According to the 2010 Census, there are 151.8 million males in the United States. If 151.8 males produced even the lowest number of 15 million sperm cells, it would result in there being somewhere in the quadrillions of these tiny things, and that\u2019s just a single day. I know you\u2019re probably wondering what this has to do with renewable energy, and we\u2019re getting there now. Because of the sheer amount of these things, they could likely generate insane amounts of heat despite their microscopic stature, if placed close together. My proposal is that every male in the country cums at least once per day in an aptly named, \u201csperm tube\u201d, which is placed in every household and connects to an underground facility, where the cells are being collected in one big dome, which connect to another set of tubes that transfer their heat energy to every home in the country. So what are we waiting for? We are using up all of our natural resources despite a perfectly viable, cheap, and renewable source living under our noses as we speak. You can do your part. Start protesting and make our goal known to the government. Recruit more people to join our cause. Preserve your sperm to make a statement. Climate change is a serious issue, and this would drastically reduce our use of non renewable resources, in simple terms, your cum can save the world. This won\u2019t be an easy fight, but if we all band together, I believe we can do it!",

You check the mail, and see a familiar logo: the symbol for recycling, except the three arrows are three sperm cells. It is a letter from the Department of Cum Extraction, notifying you that another daily load of cum is now expected from your household. Failure to produce said daily load within 3 days of your son\u2019s birthday will result in a cum tax. Your family can\u2019t afford another cum tax. You hesitantly head to your son\u2019s room to explain what his fate will be until he can no longer produce cum. You show him the location of the ol\u2019 household sperm tube and how to use it. He seems embarrassed and confused at first, but you know that one day he will get used to it.",

So I started looking for some girl on girl action, till I realized that is lesbian, and is therefore 100% gay. \n\n\nSo clearly, I had to look into alternative options.  I started to consider hentai: since no one in it is real, it can\u2019t contain guys, so it\u2019s not gay, right? Well, hentai is anime, which not only is gay, but also makes me a weeb. The worst option so far.\n\n\nI considered traps. I\u2019ve long heard debate over whether traps are gay, so I decided to do the math.  The gayness of traps lies in the premise. Let\u2019s consider the 5 base premises: 1) a guy and a trap, where the guy initially thinks he\u2019s with a girl: effectively guy on girl, 50% gay 2) a guy with a trap, and the guy knew it was a trap: Dude looking for some dick, that\u2019s gay 3) a girl with a trap, where the girl doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s a trap: that\u2019s lesbian, and is gay 4) a girl with a trap, where the girl knows it\u2019s a trap: effectively guy on girl, therefore 50% gay Therefore, on average traps are 75% gay, with a minimum gayness of 50%. Not an improvement.  The 5th option, trap on trap, is a singularity of the 4 prior possibilities, and is therefore on average 75% gay again.\n\n\nSo I got into specifics. What if it was girl on girl, and the premise was at least one of the girls was just bi-curious, and not actually fully lesbian? Well, in that case, their curiosity makes them a cat. Cats are furries, and furries are gay\n\n\nSo how about a girl soloing? Well that\u2019s a girl touching girl bits. Lesbian and gay.\n\n\nMy conclusion is that the only way to live a life free of homosexual sin is to liberate oneself of sexual desire at all, and become an asexual.\n\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk.",

Therefore, straight porn would only be around 0.7% gay, however, males and females have certain types of body parts that are the same, such as the liver or ears. This means sex is basically male/female parts touching male/female parts, making it gay. Now, a dildo, however, if used by a woman is only 0.7% gay because there is only 1 specifically male part, it\u2019s basically the same with a fleshlight. Because you don\u2019t have the part that dildo/fleshlight represents, they will not touch, thus making it not gay!",

I started to consider hentai: since no one in it is real, it can\u2019t contain guys, so it\u2019s not gay, right? Well, hentai is anime, which not only is gay, but also makes me a weeb. The worst option so far.\n\nI considered traps. I\u2019ve long heard debate over whether traps are gay, so I decided to do the math.  The gayness of traps lies in the premise. Let\u2019s consider the 5 base premises: 1) a guy and a trap, where the guy initially thinks he\u2019s with a girl: effectively guy on girl, 50% gay 2) a guy with a trap, and the guy knew it was a trap: Dude looking for some dick, that\u2019s gay 3) a girl with a trap, where the girl doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s a trap: that\u2019s lesbian, and is gay 4) a girl with a trap, where the girl knows it\u2019s a trap: effectively guy on girl, therefore 50% gay Therefore, on average traps are 75% gay, with a minimum gayness of 50%. Not an improvement.  The 5th option, trap on trap, is a singularity of the 4 prior possibilities, and is therefore on average 75% gay again.\n\nSo I got into specifics. What if it was girl on girl, and the premise was at least one of the girls was just bi-curious, and not actually fully lesbian? Well, in that case, their curiosity makes them a cat. Cats are furries, and furries are gay\n\nSo how about a girl soloing? Well that\u2019s a girl touching girl bits. Lesbian and gay.\n\nMy conclusion is that the only way to live a life free of homosexual sin is to liberate oneself of sexual desire at all, and become an asexual.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk.",

Rules, of course, being essential to any space that is restrictive in nature. In real life for instance, very few people decide to scream \"penis\" in a movie theatre. The reason is rules. Rules, of course, are socially maintained in regards to appropriate speech, recognizing that the right to say something does not signify the propriety of that speech. Online, these socially maintained rules are dissolved under the pretext of online anonymity, creating an environment where the destruction of online taboos is easy and common. To prevent, then, the online space from deteriorating into anarchy, strict rules are necessary.\n\nWith all of this being said, please unban me from FreeSpeech, I promise I will never post Sandy Cheeks Cock Vore Rule 34 again.",

            "That's the stupidest example ever. You can scream Penis in a movie theater and nothing will happen I know cuz I have done it with my friends when I was a Sophomore. You must be one of those anti free speech asshats. Funny thing is that it shouldn't be a supreme court rulling that screaming fire in a movie theater is bad it wrecks the first. It should be up to the business to decide and set those rules and if you don't like it you can go to another bussiness that allows you to do it.  The first amendment is so misunderstood, it's also why you can't impeach Trump for having a public speech. The electoral College is bullshit and it is a problem that should be eradicated with extreme prejudice. We have not had a fair election since Obama IMO. The country is falling apart because people feel afraid to speak out against the government and it is quickly starting to become a shit show. Our leadership has not maintained ethical Border Control Practices for two decades. On that note I would just like to say every curse word or slur I can think of, Fuck Shit Ass Cunt Motherfucker Tits Nigger Wop Spic Bitch Karen Boomer dick Faggot. If this gets removed the free speech board is not free speech. Once you put a limit on what people say no matter how much of an asshole they are being or even threatening you... You have put a limit on speech therefor it is not free speech. Fuck Your status quo You can shove your gun restrictions up your ass we need to start a naval militia to combat the nuclear capability of the U.S.\nStop overstepping other people's rights to silence their speech cuz you don't like it.
