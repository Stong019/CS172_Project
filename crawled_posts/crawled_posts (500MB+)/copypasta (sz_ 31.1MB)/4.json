            " I remember growing up in Japan when I was 10. I had just stepped out of a book store,  and a pretty girl the same age shyly held out her hand to me and asked me if I wanted to walk around with her. This song was playing on the radio where we stopped to have ramen together. She never gave me her name, but told me a day to always meet her to hold hands and walk or picnic. I finally got her name a few months later - Mitsuki. We became close friends, but my parents took a job to America when we were 13, so I had to leave her, both of us in tears and snot. I would send her letters, and she would send letters back. At 22, she suddenly stopped mailing me. I thought she was gone. 5 months later, she was at my door in America, with her hand out to me when I opened the door. We're married in our 40's now, and we've taken walks through multiple cities together across the world and we always stop someplace that has noodles and play this song on our phone. Thank you Mariya. Your love may be plastic, but mine is beautiful thanks to this song. If you see a middle-aged couple with or without their kids with them, holding hands and acting like teenagers or even young kids in Tokyo browsing the shops, its us.",

            "When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. \u2014 That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, \u2014 That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. \u2014 Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.\nHe has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\nHe has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\nHe has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.\nHe has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\nHe has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\nHe has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\nHe has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.\nHe has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\nHe has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.\nHe has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.\nHe has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:\nFor quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\nFor protecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\nFor cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\nFor imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:\nFor depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury:\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:\nFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies\nFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\nFor suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\nHe has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\nHe is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.\nHe has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\nIn every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\nNor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.\nWe, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these united Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States, that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. \u2014 And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor",

            "Sorry for my bad english. Also I\u2019m typing on mobile, if im make any spelling mistakes im sorry.\n\nSo i was browsing reddit. i did my daily deed by creating my 420th account to downvote EA\u2019s comment about microtransactions (EPIC). and then i saw a hilarious meme about dying in a car crash on r/dankmemes. i decided to try it out. So me, being the typical redditor decided to take my wife and children with me (SPOILER, THIS WAS A MISTAKE). Not with standing, we were in the car and saw a big truck. Now i\u2019m a fan of big trucks, let me tell you, but the driver was clearly an insta normie. We crashed into the truck going 250 mph. My wife was vaporised immediately. The car flipped 69 times (nice). Cum, everywhere. My cock and balls, tortured. My reddit gold, gone. r/wooosh.\u00a0 now you might have noticed the truck driver has uploaded this accident on r/watchpeopledie after committing 4 counts of vehicular manslaughter. This guy is a repeat offender when it comes to reposting. I could name several instances in which he reposted in r/blursedimages and r/aww. Typically he reigns in 20% karma gains as compared to the original posts. This is outrageous. But what is more outrageous is this man, this normie decides to repost on to instagram! Unforgivable! Onto his instagram account, i have noticed several posts causing me to believe he is a boomer! Not just this, but a simp! He supports the orange man and kills children! To relieve my stress after this scarring incident, I decided to donate my life savings to pokemane. Now this bitch, didn't even say my name! I cant believe this! And then, to top it all off, after uploading my cat to r/chonkers HE DIES! It was right after his 12th meal of the day, so at least he died happily. Could it be the cat food? Has anyone else experienced this? After my cat dying i asked my crush out and she said no! My wifes boyfriend called me a cuck and insulted my neckbeard. I was sad. I covered my tears with my fedora. \u201cM\u2019lady\u201d, i whispered, \u201cplease forgive me, i have failed you\u201d. After this i went onto r/pewdiepiesubmissions to defend a woman being bullied by evil men. They called me a simp, but i knew that i was actually a protector of the female gender from the patriarchy!\u00a0\n\nTLDR: Keanu chungus updoot raid reddit gold platinum UWU wholesome what are your greatest cumshots OWO r/whoosh r/pewdiepiesubmissions r/incel r/funny r/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA r/askreddit r/incel r/funny r/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA r/askreddit\n\nEdit 1: Thank you for the gold, kind stranger!\n\nEdit 2: WOW!

So me, being the typical \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udfa4 redditor \ud83c\udf7c decided \ud83d\udcad\ud83e\udd14 to take \ud83d\udc85 my wife \ud83d\udc69 and children \ud83d\udc76 with me (SPOILER \ud83d\udcb8, THIS WAS A MISTAKE \ud83d\ude31).

            "This is scary. The fact that all the comments I see here about it are uniformly cheering it on is even more scary.\n\nFirst, I'm anti-fascist, anti-Trump, anti-racist, and pro-BLM. I voted for Obama three times and volunteered for him.\n\nWith that out of the way, how can anyone who's anti-fascist and pro-democracy cheer this on? It's completely insane.\n\nWe now have a tiny handful of megacorporations run by megabillionaires who are opaquely deciding what speech we're allowed to consume. Why are people not only accepting of this but actually cheering for it?\n\nThe real problem isn't the idea that a business can choose with whom it does business. In general, I think that's a fine idea, provided those business aren't discriminating on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, etc. The real problem here is the fact that we have an oligarchy of megacorporations and megabillionaires. If we had a truly free marketplace, where there were hundreds of cloud providers, and they didn't act in lockstep with each other, there'd be no problem. Cloud A would decide they just don't like Parler, don't want to do business with them, and boot them. They'd just head over to cloud B and everything's fine. \n\nThe problem is that there are two companies who, acting together, can prevent you from having a mobile app. There are six companies who, if they act in lockstep, can prevent you from using cloud infrastructure. There are similarly small numbers of companies who can prevent you from effectively caching content, processing payments, and all of the other stuff necessary to communicate to a non-trivial audience on the Internet.\n\nAnd, we now clearly see that these companies do act in lockstep. These megabillionaires' interests are aligned, and they are not our interests, even if we happen to be on the same page about hating Trump, nazis, and political violence. Why are you confident they won't use this power to silence speech you do like? Say, speech about forming workers' unions, or using alternative services to theirs?\n\nThat's the problem with free speech: when it's infringed on, it'll always be abhorrent speech that infringed on first. Because 99.9% of people hate nazis, so making nazis STFU is something that's very attractive to almost everyone. But if you give someone the power to do that, they'll have that same power to make anyone else STFU for any reason they see fit, too.\n\nHere are the arguments I always see about why this OK and why I think they don't work:\n\n 1. Free speech is about governments, private companies can do whatever they like. \n\n \u2022 No, the 1st amendment is strictly about governments. Free speech is a broader concept. If the government permits any and all speech, but six corporations acting in unison have the power to effectively silence you, and they act in concert to do so in opaque ways, then that's absolutely a free speech issue. We've lost the ability to communicate freely: it just happens that a corporate oligarchy did it, not the government, but the consequences are the same.\n\n 2. Free speech doesn't mean speech without consequences. \n\n \u2022 That's correct, but it's also not the argument. People on Parler or whatever service should be held accountable for breaking the law there. Incitement to violence and conspiracy to commit terrorism are already very illegal. We should not expect (or want) the megacorporations to unilaterally and opaquely enforce these laws, we should expect and want or government to enforce them. This is because when our government enforces them, they have to prove their case in court, and they're accountable to our system of checks and balances; they can't make arbitrary and opaque decisions completely unaccountably like Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos can.\n\n 3. It's incitement to violence. \n\n \u2022 Incitement to violence is illegal. It's a job for our legal system, not Mark Zuckerberg. Also, when you have a platform with user-generated content, in general, we don't consider you legally responsible for what the users write. You can easily find countless incitements to violence on twitter, facebook, and reddit, from both the left and the right. Why isn't the reddit app being removed from the App Store? Why isn't reddit being booted from AWS? Yes, reddit has moderation policies aimed at preventing this content, but they're clearly ineffective. Parler also had moderation policies about it (also clearly ineffective).\n\n \u2022 That's how can you make arbitrary enforcement decisions while pretending to be upholding your policies: if you write a policy that's impossible to adhere to, and then selectively enforce it against only those you don't like. This is what we saw in the Jim Crow south (and continuing to the present day): make a shitload of impossible-to-follow laws, and then only enforce them against black people. That's bad. Fight against this, even when it starts out being used against people you don't like.\n\n 4. But Masterpiece bakery (the gay wedding cake case). \n\n \u2022 Did you like the outcome of that case? Did you think it correct and good? If not, then why do you think it's correct and good here? That aside, there's not a ton of parallels. I'm extremely against the idea that any business can turn customers away on the basis of their sexual orientation, which was part of the question in that case. But regardless of that, Masterpiece bakery isn't part of an effectively monopoly, as Amazon, Google, and Apple are.\n\n 5. It just means they'll have to communicate another way instead, they're not being prevented from communicating at all. \n\n \u2022 The past few days have proven this to be the lie it always clearly was. Twitter bans Trump, and people said, \"well, he can just use Parler if we wants.\" Trump says something about using Parler, and then the next day, Parler is completely wiped off the Internet.",

            "When someone is depressed, eventually their interest or love in pretty much everything fades away, this includes their love, care and affection towards their partner.\n\nLet me remind you that depression is an illness and when someone commits suicide while depressed, it's the illness that kills them, not they themselves. Think of it as cancer and other illnesses, diseases, etc. No happy and healthy person would commit suicide.\n\nSomeone who is depressed isn't just feeling very sad, there's a whole lot more to it. Telling someone who is depressed to get over it or just go do X or Y is being ignorant and insincere. If you want someone to not commit suicide, you cannot convince them with words, **YOU** must **SHOW** them what it means to be alive. Show them these 110 reasons.\n\nAnyone who wants to know more about depression from a depressed person's perceptive who tried committing suicide, I suggest you read these two blogposts:  \n\n\n[https://incrementumgrowwithme.wordpress.com/2020/09/09/this-is-what-depression-felt-like/](https://incrementumgrowwithme.wordpress.com/2020/09/09/this-is-what-depression-felt-like/) \\[Part 1\\]\n\n[https://incrementumgrowwithme.wordpress.com/2020/09/17/what-depression-feels-like-p2/](https://incrementumgrowwithme.wordpress.com/2020/09/17/what-depression-feels-like-p2/) \\[Part 2\\]",

            "I'm sure glitter, butterflies, and bubblegum will have an immense effect on people who are suffering day to day due to mental or physical illness, family issues, or life issues to the point where they feel the need to completely end their existence. Posts like this make suicidal thoughts and attempted suicide seem like a light subject that is super easy to overcome, but that's just not how it is.",
            "Y\u2019know most people who wanna kill themselves *want* to kill themselves *because* they can\u2019t find pleasure in those things anymore, whatever those things may be. \n\nSo to someone who\u2019s suicidal this probably would just be a reminder of all the reasons they no longer wanna *live*... Because all you did was explain things you could think of that\u2019s recreational in *life.*\n\n[someone no longer wants anything to do with life] Aww what? But what about all of the FUN stuff in life?? Surely if you\u2019re sad about **life** as a WHOLE and wanna end it, remembering ALL of the pleasurable things would give you something new to think about right?\n\nNO. If someone doesn\u2019t wanna live anymore: \nThey don\u2019t enjoy any of the things you listed enough to have a will to live. So all of that stuff is INHERENTLY unhelpful.\n\nEdit: I appreciate all the recognition guys, it feels awesome to have people connect with something I say.",
            "yeah, I\u2019ll tell my fucking dopamine receptors to open up for goddamn glitter. I don\u2019t usual say this, but actually fuck off with all this. That\u2019s not how depression works. \n\nWhen I was suicidal, nothing mattered. Nothing made me happy. Even the things on this list I did enjoy. I was lonely and unable to find a job. My life felt completely fucking meaningless. I legitimately didn\u2019t see a way out beyond death. I thought I\u2019d never make anything of myself.\n\nYou know what helped? It wasn\u2019t fairy glittery tumblr girl bullshit like this. It was talking out my problems and sealing help. I was damn lucky to be able to find support in my friends and family. Not everyone has that.\n\nI still suffer from depressive episodes every now and then, but I\u2019m not suicidal any more. And it\u2019s thanks to therapy and medication.\n\nDepressed people have a mental goddamn illness that can\u2019t be cured by wishful thinking. When you spread this kind of shit, it makes vulnerable, suicidal individuals even more upset at themselves, because they literally cannot feel joy from anything on this list. \n\nYou\u2019re part of the problem.",

            "I won't care about any of that after I'm dead",
            "1. I will never meet my soulmate, nor will any girl ever love me.\n\n2. I will be the only one of my friends to never get married so tbh I would want to die even more.\n\n3. I don\u2019t care much for that tbh and that alone isn\u2019t worth it. Plus the skies will soon have so much shit in it that we\u2019ll never be able to see the stars ever again.\n\n4. I\u2019ll just eat all the food I love before I die then.\n\n5. I\u2019m not fucking rich. There is a small percentage of people who will ever get to see every country and if I\u2019m being honest certain ones are either too dangerous (Syria) or too corrupt (North Korea) to even bother with.\n\n6. Again that alone isn\u2019t worth it.\n\n7. I\u2019ll just listen to all the music I love before I die then.\n\n8. Never been to one and I\u2019ll never get the chance.\n\n9. Like who exactly?\n\n10. We barely ever get snow here so why even mention that?\n\n11. The beach is overrated.\n\n12. Again soon one day we\u2019ll never get to see the sun because people are destroying the fucking world right now.\n\n13. ^\n\n14. I\u2019ll never get to experience something that cool and even if I do I\u2019ll get scared away by all the bees and whatnot.\n\n15. You forgot 15.\n\n16. While admittedly I really will miss that I\u2019m not gonna miss my aunts dog who I currently live with because she is almost dangerously aggressive.\n\n17. We will never see movies in theaters again so why bring that up?\n\n18. I\u2019ll just watch all the old movies I love before I die then.\n\n19. Pretty sure my local drive in is screwed so why bring that up?\n\n20. Wont get to experience that so...\n\n21. I\u2019ve heard a satisfactory amount from my favorite artist.\n\n22. I suck at drawing.\n\n23. I\u2019m not into that.\n\n24. People never have time for me on my birthday.\n\n25. Yeah it\u2019s fun at first until your friends start replacing you with someone else.\n\n26. That special person will never end up with me so no real reason to miss that as it only brings pain.\n\n27. For all we know the afterlife could be just as warm and could be a cozy refuge from the aftermath of death. Even if it\u2019s hell. \n\n28. Those are ok but not necessarily all that great with certain people.\n\n29. Something that will never happen to me.\n\n30. Until I see a bee on one. Then it becomes terrifying.\n\n31. Those are also ok but I\u2019m not much for those either.\n\n32. That\u2019s only as great as it is when you\u2019re not dead on the inside.\n\n33. I\u2019m not into embarrassing myself more than I do daily.\n\n34. Something I will never experience again.\n\n35. I\u2019ll just play it one last time before I die then.\n\n36. I\u2019ve already done that and I suck at it.\n\n37. Again not into the beach.\n\n38. Again I\u2019m not fucking rich.\n\n38. There aren\u2019t 2 38s and also I doubt I\u2019ll ever experience this.\n\n39. I\u2019m not a girl dude.\n\n40. It\u2019s good until your mom gets on your case for wasting water.\n\n41. Not into coffee but I\u2019ll just drink my favorite latte and tea before I die then. \n\n42. Life is too bleak to experience the whimsical illusion of rainbows for me.\n\n43. I\u2019m not a good or courageous enough person to do something like this.\n\n44. Not really into those either.\n\n45. Again not a good enough person to do this. Besides people are too scummy and selfish to let something like this happen.\n\n46. Again this is something I will never fucking experience.\n\n47. Not into those.\n\n48. Ok I will miss that but that\u2019s not enough to make me want to keep living.\n\n49. Depends on who\u2019s in the car with you and where you\u2019re going and what\u2019s on the way.\n\n50. Doubt I\u2019ll ever experience this either. Even then it\u2019s also not enough.\n\n51. Seriously? Memes are the reason my country became what it did now. A hate filled cesspool of shit and apathy. Then again maybe it was always like that.\n\n52. Not a huge fan of zoos.\n\n53. The occasional laugh isn\u2019t worth more hell just to see it every now and then.\n\n54. I\u2019ll just smell an old book before I die then.\n\n55. Eh. They are pretty but I don\u2019t see many of them anymore. Hell I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen one at all in a few years.\n\n56. Not my thing.\n\n57. Colors aren\u2019t as vibrant or lively to me anymore.\n\n58. No one does that anymore.\n\n59. I will never experience something like this ever again.\n\n60. I\u2019ll die in a blanket then idk. Just so I can pretend I\u2019m being hugged one last time.\n\n61. I don\u2019t read many books much these days.\n\n62. I don\u2019t have the opportunity to do this and honestly neither do a lot of people.\n\n63. I will never experience this. \n\n64. My sleep schedule is too messed up for me to ever experience this. \n\n65. Sometimes those just make me sad that I used to be happy and now I\u2019m not.\n\n66. Museums aren\u2019t my thing. At least not most museums.\n\n67. Sure those are good but for the millionth time not worth living for for that alone.\n\n68. Again not a girl and not interested in that.\n\n69. I mean sure that is cool but can still be boring 55% of the time. \n\n70. I\u2019m not valuable enough as a person to get those regularly.\n\n71. (Please refer to #10.)\n\n72. Holidays suck with my family.\n\n73. Fair enough but again I\u2019ll just have that before I die.\n\n74. Ok fine those are worth living for. But after I\u2019m done with those I think about how I\u2019ll never get to take that special someone to someplace like that and I\u2019ll always be alone at those places.\n\n75. I\u2019m not important enough for parties.\n\n76. That\u2019s only fun sometimes.\n\n77. Not much of a dancer.\n\n78. Not much of a singer.\n\n79. Already seen wolves before I think. \n\n80. That never goes the way people think it will.\n\n81. That\u2019s just another example of temporary dopamine.\n\n82. Not my preferred method of cooling off.\n\n83. I have nothing to say on that subject.\n\n84. Yet no one to laugh at them with.\n\n85. Something I will never experience again thanks to everything happening.\n\n86. Fuck Vegas and it\u2019s Skyline.\n\n87. All I wear is black.\n\n88. Some of it may look beautiful but that same wildlife may try to kill you. \n\n89. I don\u2019t do that.\n\n90. I have never done that and it\u2019ll never happen.\n\n91. My laughter feels forced somewhat these days.\n\n92. My blanket is too big to dry at home.\n\n93. I don\u2019t sew.\n\n94. What?\n\n95. There\u2019s rarely ever anyone to talk to at night.\n\n96. Rewatched it enough.\n\n97. I have never been able to do that.\n\n98. I hardly ever have anyone to play those games with.\n\n99. Sure.\n\n100. Sure.\n\n101. I suck at cooking it never turns out right.\n\n102. The shitty world had to take him from us, all while horrible people still live on. It\u2019s why I don\u2019t think life is worth it. \n\n103. Yet no one to have them with. \n\n104. Haven\u2019t seen a tire swing in a long time.\n\n105. Sure.\n\n106. (Refer to #61)\n\n107. Knowing me I would mess this up.\n\n108. We will never have clear skies again why bring this up? Just because you\u2019re not in an area where the fires are near doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t happening.\n\n109. Sure ok that is pretty good.\n\n110. Haven\u2019t ever done that and idk where to look. \n\nEven if I choose not to die in the next couple months, the world will end and make my choice for me. There is no point to living anymore, especially since everyone else around me is continuing to do great, while I will never excel, or get better.",

Just because things don't get better at the speed you would hope, doesn't mean those days aren't coming. Your diagnosis day is coming. Your day where you or someone else has the answers that will fix your life, will be able to solve your problems. Don't give up. Cling to those things that make today worth living.

        "selftext": "Answer: For those who don't want to visit the links:\n\nReddit recently hired a new admin, Aimee Challenor, a transgender woman who had previously been a politician in the UK. Aimee is publicly tied to two different instances of supporting pedophiles.\n\nThe first, her father raped and abused a child, in the house Aimee was living in. After being arrested and charged for the crime, but before being tried and sentenced, Aimee hired her father to be her campaign manager for elections with the Green party, and gave a false name to the party on the paperwork. When this was found out, she claimed ignorance of the extent of his crimes, and was removed from the party for safeguarding failures.\n\nThe second, her husband is an open pedophile, who posts erotic fiction about children. Aimee had joined the Lib Dem party, and was removed when her husband tweeted that he \"Fantasized about children having sex...sometimes with adults, sometimes kidnapped and forced in to bad situations\". Both Aimee and her husband claim that the twitter account was hacked at that time.\n\nAimee accused both political parties of being transphobic when she was removed.\n\nThe fact that she is trans has meant that she is a prime target for harassment or as a demonstration by TERF/hard right groups of how \"terrible\" trans people can be. This lead to Reddit (per their claims) secretly enabling protections, that all posts on Reddit would be automatically scanned, and if it was detected to be doxxing Aimee, it would result in an automatic ban. After however long of running undetected by the userbase, the automatic doxxing protection proceeded to ban a moderator of r/UKPolitics who posted a news article, as Aimee Challenor was mentioned by name in the article. r/UKPolitics went private and shut down to figure out what was happening, and the admins reinstated the mod's account. r/UKPolitics then re-opened and posted a statement, that the shutdown was due to a ban, the ban was caused by an article including a line that referenced a specific person who now worked for Reddit, and that they were specifically requesting people not post the person's name or try to find out who the person was, as site admins would issue bans for that.\n\nWord of getting banned for saying \"Aimee Challenor\" spread quickly, and other OOTL posts show some of the results of that - many people repeating her name and associations and support for pedophiles, and a few (notably significantly less) removed comments. The admins put out a statement on r/ModSupport, stating that the post had \"included personal information\", that the ban was automated, not manual, and that the moderation rule had been too broad and was being fixed. People who can post on r/ModSupport (you must be a moderator, or your comments are automatically removed) immediately took issue with every part of the statement, as:\n\n-There had been a number of manual removals and direct edits of comments by reddit staff as the incident escalated (The second being something u/Spez was previously guilty of, and said he would lock down to prevent abuse of during the T_D issues)  \n-The ban and post deletion on r/UKPolitics had been hours after the post, not immediate (which would be expected of an automated process)  \n-~~Nobody believed that Reddit was automatically scanning the contents of every link to check for blacklisted words~~ (*Edit, striking this part out, looks like the text of the article was copied in to a comment which is what was scanned.*)  \n-The definition of \"personal information\" had just changed so much that posting the name \"Joe Biden\" could be considered doxxing  \n-Reddit had not commented at all on the \"open support for pedophiles\" part  \n\nMany moderators also raised complaints in the post about their personal issues with being doxxed, and that they had been reaching out to Reddit staff about consistent harassment and doxxing of their mod teams with no help given by Reddit, or wondering why these protections weren't enabled for them. One notable post states that inaction from Reddit staff with regards to doxxing resulted in a situation so bad that they were forced to contact the FBI in the USA and the RCMP in Canada to resolve the situation.\n\nThis continued to rapidly escalate, and a group of mods started pushing for a blackout of their subreddits, something that has forced Reddit's hand with regards to responding to issues before. The list has been changing through the night, as different subreddits join in or leave the blackout, either protesting the censorship, protesting Reddit's perceived proxy-support for pedophiles, or (in many cases) both.",

            "fuck it, ban speed run.\n\nPaywall:\n\nA young politician and transgender activist who is running for deputy leadership of the Green Party was fighting for her political life last night after it emerged that she had used her father as her election agent even though he faced charges of raping and torturing a 10-year-old girl.\n\nAimee Challenor, the party\u2019s equality spokeswoman and a former parliamentary candidate, insisted last night she would not withdraw from the leadership contest after her father, David, was sentenced to 22 years for the \u201cdepraved\u201d crimes. Aimee lived with him in a small two-up, two-down house.\n\nA jury at Warwick crown court last week convicted David Challenor of holding the child captive in the attic of the terraced house, where he tied her to a beam, whipped her and attached clips to her body to give her electric shocks.\n\nDressed in a nappy and an adult-sized baby costume, the 50-year-old raped the girl and forced her to perform sex acts on him. As well as the rape he was found guilty of false imprisonment, gross indecency, assault by penetration, indecent assault, assault causing actual bodily harm, making indecent images of children by downloading them and possessing prohibited images.\n\nThis weekend Aimee Challenor offered no comment but a party spokeswoman said the candidate had been unaware of the crimes and would not step aside. \u201cWe are offering her our support at this challenging time,\u201d she said.\n\nChallenor, a high-profile transgender campaigner, stood as a Green candidate in St Michael\u2019s ward, Coventry, at May\u2019s local elections and as the party\u2019s parliamentary candidate for Coventry South at the general election last year.\n\nOn both occasions she appointed her father as her election agent, legally responsible for running her campaign, even though he had been accused of or charged with the crimes, which were reported to police in late 2015. By the time of May\u2019s elections he had a trial date. Candidates\u2019 election campaign leaflets are legally required to include the name of their agent or promoter. Challenor\u2019s leaflets for both campaigns, seen by The Sunday Times, did not show her father\u2019s correct name, instead giving it as \u201cBaloo Challenor\u201d.\n\nBaloo, a character from Rudyard Kipling\u2019s The Jungle Book, was a nickname used by Challenor\u2019s father in his work as an assistant Scout leader and volunteer with children\u2019s gymnastics. He used his proper first name on the election nomination forms as Challenor\u2019s agent.\n\nChallenor\u2019s father, who used the Twitter name An Old Arch Devil, also carried out design work for the Green Party\u2019s national lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender campaign.\n\nChallenor, 20, who was born a boy, transitioned at 16, around the time the rape took place, after a turbulent childhood that included being taken into care in about 2013 with two of her siblings after social services expressed concern about her parents. They set up a successful public Facebook campaign to win the children back.\n\nChallenor became involved in politics towards the end of the 2010 to 2015 coalition government. \u201cThat threw out the Conservatives and the Lib Dems for me because of tuition fees, austerity and a lack of action on climate change,\u201d she said in an interview in June.\n\nThe Green Party was also \u201cmiles ahead of the competition\u201d on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues at the time, she said. She has become a mainstay of the transgender activist community, criticising feminists who have concerns about potential reforms to gender recognition laws as \u201ctransphobic\u201d and demanding that the organisers of last month\u2019s Pride in London event resign for allowing one such group to lead the parade.\n\nThe Green Party said it was \u201cshocked and horrified\u201d by the offences but was \u201cnot aware of any of these allegations until the case concluded and Mr Challenor had been sentenced\u201d.",
