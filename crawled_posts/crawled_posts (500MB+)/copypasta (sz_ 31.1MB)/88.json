My wife LAUGHED (yes directly at me, no fucking respect from this woman) replying I\u2019ve made her watch it for 17 times. I looked at her straight in the eye, it all became clear to me, my wife is a dumb feminist, she just hates men, she doesn\u2019t respect them whatsoever. \n\nSo I slapped that dumb bitch in the face and screamed  \u201cI WILL NOT TOLERATE SJWS AND FEMINISTS IN THIS HOUSEHOLD, YOU JUST HATE IT BECAUSE YOU CAN ONLY ACCEPT WOMEN AS THE LEAD\u201d she (thankfully) started to cry with a confused look on her face and asked what came over me and why would I do that. I looked at her directly in the eyes again furiously, and asked her \u201cwhat did you say about the perfect prequel trilogy again?!?\u201d She started yelling, blood and tears rolling down her face, with her voice cracking \u201cyou hit me over that?!!? Because I didn\u2019t want to watch a movie?!????\u201d That was the last straw, I then said \u201cI want a divorce\u201d she replied \u201cyou just broke my nose and now want to divorce me over a pair of fucking movies!?!?!? After everything I\u2019ve done for you?!?!? After saving your life!?!?!\u201d I proceeded to walk out of the door, I looked back at her and said \u201cI will not be married to someone who only likes women\u201d Spat at her, then said \u201cdie mad about it\u201d and left.\n\nThank you George and r/SaltierThanCrait, if it wasn\u2019t for you, I\u2019d still be married to that man hating bitch. *insert prequel line*\n\n\n\n\nTo clarify, I have nothing against the prequels.

I had to sit down with him and talk to him about racism after I caught his racist ass watching Paw Patrol. (its a show that glorifies p*lice)\n\nWhen I asked him why he would watch such a horrendous show, he simply responded with \u201cGa ga goo\u201d\n\nI was fuming. Was he mocking me? I certainly never anticipated that I would raise such a cold blooded r*cist. I am starting to think that his response was fueled by s*xism caused by his dad, who is a wh*te m*le.\n\nI showed him a video of hypersexual gay antifa militants to try to normalize his behavior. About halfway through the video one of the antifa militants gets tackled by a p*lice after flashing his genitals to an old woman. My r*cist son thought this was funny and went \u201cha ha\u201d\n\nWhat should I do? I dont want him to grow up to be a Tr*mp supporter or a homoph*bic.",
