            " Gomenasai, my name is Ken-Sama.\n\nI'm a 27 year old American Otaku (Anime fan for you gaijins). I draw Anime and Manga on my tablet, and spend my days perfecting my art and playing superior Japanese games. (Disgaea, Final Fantasy, Persona series)\n\nI train with my Katana every day, this superior weapon can cut clean through steel because it is folded over a thousand times, and is vastly superior to any other weapon on earth. I earned my sword license two years ago, and I have been getting better every day.\n\nI speak Japanese fluently, both Kanji and the Osaka dialect, and I write fluently as well. I know everything about Japanese history and their bushido code, which I follow 100%\n\nWhen I get my Japanese visa, I am moving to Tokyo to attend a prestigious High School to learn more about their magnificent culture. I hope I can become an animator for Studio Ghibli or a game designer!\n\nI own several kimonos, which I wear around town. I want to get used to wearing them before I move to Japan, so I can fit in easier. I bow to my elders and seniors and speak Japanese as often as I can, but rarely does anyone manage to respond.\n\nWish me luck in Japan!",

On Friday, I had burned my hand with flaming oil and stayed eight straight hours in a neglectful \"healthcare\" facility that took eight hours to bandage my recently singed flesh. This left me with very limited use of my left hand, thus rendering me unable to play most games as they tend to require two hands. This hero of a developer kept his clientele in mind, and made it so this game could easily be played with one hand. I can tell just by that design choice that this is an upstanding Christian man who had developed a wholesome Christian game. Obviously this game was designed for people with limited mobility such as myself, as I cannot think of any other reason why this game should be played with one hand.

Obviously \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude31 this game \ud83c\udfae was designed \ud83d\udd27 for people \ud83d\udc37\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2708\ufe0f with limited \ud83d\udd12 mobility \ud83d\udcf1 such as myself, as I \ud83d\udc41 cannot \ud83d\ude45\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udeab think \ud83e\udd14 of any other reason \ud83c\udf1f why \ud83e\udd14 this game \ud83c\udfae should be played \ud83c\udfb2 with one \ud83d\ude31\u261d hand \u270b. These design \ud83c\udfa8 choices \ud83d\udd1e lead \ud83d\udc51 me to believe \ud83c\udf08 that there is still \ud83e\udd1e\ud83d\ude4c hope \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udd51 left \ud83d\udc48 for humanity \ud83d\udc64, 10/10 \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udcaf.",

On Friday, I had burned my hand with flaming oil and stayed eight straight hours in a neglectful \"healthcare\" facility that took eight hours to bandage my recently singed flesh. This left me with very limited use of my left hand, thus rendering me unable to play most games as they tend to require two hands. This hero of a developer kept his clientele in mind, and made it so this game could easily be played with one hand. I can tell just by that design choice that this is an upstanding Christian man who had developed a wholesome Christian game. Obviously this game was designed for people with limited mobility such as myself, as I cannot think of any other reason why this game should be played with one hand. These design choices lead me to believe that there is still hope left for humanity, 10/10.",

By acting as if he's in a hurry and talking quickly, he eliminates the opportunity for Franklin to counterattack, meaning that he can continue delivering his verbal abuse. \n\nThe use of the phrase \"yee-yee\" is especially clever as it has very loose meanings and is utilised to further demean Franklin while not being necessarily rude, as well as fitting nicely into the rhythm of Lamar's \"smack-talk\" as they call it. Since a person's hair is usually one of their most stand-out and noticeable features, by ridiculing his, Lamar makes Franklin's identity feel attacked and being shorter means that he's opened to the perspective of one taller than himself having to look down at it, making him especially self-conscious. \n\nFurthermore, by berating Franklin's female partner, Lamar starts to get very personal with him which makes the insults even harsher, while also making Franklin feel inadequate in romantic relationships. As well as this, feigning uncertainty of her secret partner's occupation and referring to contemporarily intelligent and respectable vocations such as \"lawyer\" and \"brain surgeon\" Lamar attacks Franklin's lack of a formal education and business smarts.   \n\n\nFinally, the strange and belittling way he says \"nneEegaahh\" further aims to make Franklin seems foolish and by slightly squatting to make eye contact, Lamar subtly roasts Franklin's stature again, as well as his status, making him feel like an insignificant child. \n\nTruly, a genius in the art of \"roasting\" as those kids with their exaggerated swagger call it.",

Since \ud83d\udc68 a person's \ud83d\udc68 hair \ud83d\udc88 is usually \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0a one \u261d of their most stand-out and noticeable \ud83d\udc40 features \ud83e\uddec, by ridiculing his \ud83d\udca6, Lamar \ud83d\uddd1 makes \ud83d\udd95 Franklin's \ud83c\udfb5\ud83c\udfb6 identity \ud83d\udc59\ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udc4c feel \ud83d\ude01 attacked \ud83e\udd2f\u2620\u2604 and being shorter \u2b07 means \ud83e\udd14\u2757 that he's \ud83d\udc68 opened \ud83c\udd99 to the perspective \ud83d\udc40 of one \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude2c taller \ud83d\ude1a than himself \ud83e\udd16\ud83d\ude45 having to look \ud83d\udc41\ud83c\udf06 down \u2b07 at it, making \ud83d\udd95 him \ud83d\udc74 especially \ud83d\udcaf self-conscious \ud83d\ude44.   \n  \nFurthermore \ud83d\udeae\ud83c\udfc4\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udc7c\ud83c\udffd, by berating Franklin's \ud83e\udd32 female \ud83d\udeba partner \ud83d\udc6d\ud83d\udc6c\ud83d\udc6b, Lamar \ud83d\uddd1 starts \ud83c\udd95 to get \ud83c\ude50 very \ud83d\udc4c personal \u27a1\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffb with him \ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffe which makes \ud83d\udd95 the insults \ud83e\udd2c even \ud83c\udf03 harsher \ud83d\udca6, while also \u2795 making \ud83d\udc98 Franklin \ud83d\udcb0\ud83c\udf51\ud83d\udca6 feel \ud83d\udc5c\ud83d\ude1c inadequate in romantic \ud83d\udc95\u2764\ud83d\ude0d relationships \ud83d\udc6b.

Trump is secretly a scaly and one day while he was wearing his snake suit he tricked Eve and told her to eat the apple. He also killed Abel. He also lead the Mongol invasions of everywhere. And the Hun invasions. And the Mughal invasions of India. And the Viking invasions.Trump was the guy who started colonialism(only the invading part not the part where they provided technology and medicine to the natives). After Trump tested positive for Covid19, he spit on Native Americans, nearly driving them extinct. Trump also killed all the dinosaurs. He was also behind the Bronze age collapse. Trump single-handedly did the Triangular Slave Trade; hell he was the guy Trump bought the slaves from. Trump also beheaded a French teacher for disrespecting Mohammad, and blamed it on wholesome Muslimerinos. All the blood diamonds are produced by Trump. He was the guy who cut Congolese workers hands off because they did not meet his supply. Trump chased Kyyle Rittenhouse in Kenosha with a skateboard and beat him up and snatched his rifle, and used it to kill Jacob Blake. During the BLM protests Trump was the one who looted and burned all the stores. Even during the Charolletsville incident, they were all shadow-clones of Trump. Trump did Pearl Harbor and bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Trump was the mastermind of the Holodomor, the Great Leap Forward, East Germany and every time a tankie screams \"It was not real communism\", Trump was involved. Trump grilled the last dodo. Trump shoots Palestinian kids for fun and shoots missiles at Israeli civilians. He was the guy who killed all those Rohingyas, and Uyghurs.

Trump commits human rights violations on North Korean citizens everyday. Al Qaeda, Mujaheddin, Boko-Haram, Taliban; TRUMP. He also killed the prophet of the wholesome 100 Muslimerinos, Sulemani; in a missile strike. He also did the Rape of Nanjing and it was Trump who ordered and supplied all the Korean comfort women. Trump personally snitched on Anne Frank to Trump. The Jim Crow laws were passed by Trump, as well as the war on drugs. The partition of India was Trump's fault, as well as the resulting Kashmir issue. He also starred in the Cuban missile crisis and started the cold war. During the Russian Revolution, the peasants understood that Nikolai II's family was innocent, and would offer them a chance to leave, but Trump massacred them. Trump tried his best but failed in preventing the American and French Revolutions, but he got back at them by causing the Reign of Terror. Trump tortured Louis XVI's son and forced him into saying that he had sex with his mother and aunt, and promptly guillotined them. Trump invented pineapple-pizza and Tofu-Chicken. He was the guy who snitched on Alan Turing, revealing that he was gay. The judge felt that such a respected professor could be sent away with a slap on the wrist, but Trump rigged the jury and sentenced him to hormonal therapy. Trump rigged the New York Stock Exchange and caused the great depression. In the town of Waco, he raped a woman, blamed it on a black man and lynched him by burning him alive. He was the leader of the Khmer Rouge and wrote the plot for Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

He started coronavirus and ebola and the Black Death and the Spanish flu and the Bubonic plague and the syphillis outbreak and the Trojan war and tthe Bush war and the fall of Rome and the Dark Ages. After taking a dump, Trump leaves his toilet paper like [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=toilet+paper+wrong+way&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi6vJPR4OPsAhUtyDgGHZMbDYQQ_AUoAXoECBIQAw&biw=1504&bih=860&dpr=1.5#imgrc=9eslJNVaV-hTfM). Trump burned down the Notre Dame, and knelled  on George Floyds neck. He also was the guy who sold drugs to George Floyd.
