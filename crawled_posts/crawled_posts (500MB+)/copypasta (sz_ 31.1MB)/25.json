The camera can be found in the body. Her boyfriend in the kitchen suddenly come to their case. So, when he came out, he was hit in the head office to change the camera angle we can see all parts of the body when you drop it, I can see. Naked under a Turkish sandwich, using language such as the subway last week under the glass. Her boyfriend with her, play with her, I forgot to leave as soon as possible by calling or feeling. Do not muted, think about a finger or scream. \"My God, my class.\" He returned two minutes. Then I lost my eyes. So, I think it's clear.

It was about 3/4ths gone by then, and I\u2019d bought 2 bottles so I began using a different bottle and keeping that in my bathroom drawer so no one touched it.\n\nAs time went on, the shampoo bottle in the shower literally was slowly filling up almost halfway full, when i decided to mark it and watch how it filled. Within a week or so it was filled past the mark. I checked, it definitely wasn\u2019t water, and it fucking stank. I think he\u2019s been shaking the bottle up too, to mix it together. Nobody touches the soaps in our shared bathroom but me and him, and he has his own shampoo so there\u2019s no reason for him to touch mine. My only logical conclusion is that he\u2019s been masturbating into my coconut shampoo.\n\nQuite honestly this disgusts me and freaks me out and I don\u2019t know at all how to tell my parents or how to talk to him about it. I\u2019ve developed a fear of using the soaps in our bathroom and I\u2019ve been showering at my boyfriend\u2019s house every day. The shampoo bottle is still there it\u2019s almost full by now, does he think this is some sort of game? I\u2019d like to understand why this is happening but I don\u2019t want to look like a fool if I don\u2019t have any proof.\n\nSorry this is such a weird and gross situation but I really need help here.

            "So this is a bit of a long story, but a couple months ago, I (18F) noticed a couple streaks of white in the purple shampoo i was using, I didn\u2019t think much of it at the time but I didn\u2019t use it as I thought maybe my brother (16M) was using that bottle for something else, it was almost empty anyways.\n\nI got more shampoo, this time it was a white coconut shampoo, and was using it in my hair regularly until i noticed it had moved from the shelf in the shower to a different spot. It was about 3/4ths gone by then, and I\u2019d bought 2 bottles so I began using a different bottle and keeping that in my bathroom drawer so no one touched it.\n\nAs time went on, the shampoo bottle in the shower literally was slowly filling up almost halfway full, when i decided to mark it and watch how it filled. Within a week or so it was filled past the mark. I checked, it definitely wasn\u2019t water, and it fucking stank. I think he\u2019s been shaking the bottle up too, to mix it together. Nobody touches the soaps in our shared bathroom but me and him, and he has his own shampoo so there\u2019s no reason for him to touch mine. My only logical conclusion is that he\u2019s been masturbating into my coconut shampoo.\n\nQuite honestly this disgusts me and freaks me out and I don\u2019t know at all how to tell my parents or how to talk to him about it. I\u2019ve developed a fear of using the soaps in our bathroom and I\u2019ve been showering at my boyfriend\u2019s house every day. The shampoo bottle is still there it\u2019s almost full by now, does he think this is some sort of game? I\u2019d like to understand why this is happening but I don\u2019t want to look like a fool if I don\u2019t have any proof.\n\nSorry this is such a weird and gross situation but I really need help here. Any advice on how to work through this?",
            "You can get semen detection kits pretty cheap off amazon. You could have one delivered to an amazon dropbox and pay for it with a giftcard if you want extreme privacy. \n\nIf you get one it may not be reliable so you should run a control;\n\n1: actual shampoo, no semen to make sure you dont get a false positive from the shampoo\n\n2: You probably dont have access to actual semen, that would be a good positive control haha. \n\n3: the sample of your questionable shampoo.",
            "Lmao that post is so fake, it would literally take weeks for the amount of semen be noticeable in a shampoo bottle",
            "Had to scroll down way to far to find this. You would never notice the change in volume if someone was doing it. Dude would have to be OG Mudbone on super saiyan. I also don't believe you would see \"white streaks\" in the shampoo either. Semen is mostly translucent and also dries up quickly, so you'd almost certainly never see it when mixed in with a bottle of shampoo.  Either OP is just making up a story like most posts on Reddit, or she's just jumping to conclusions.\n\nEdit 3: Chart with extended range: https://imgur.com/1jxMjy8\n\nEdit 2: Chart (fixed, had the legend wrong way around): https://imgur.com/kZQLhZh\n\nEdit with some napkin math:\n\nI call shenanigans, or OP is at least mistaken about why her shampoo is filling up. For a shampoo bottle to fill up a noticeable amount over weeks before marking it, as she said, it would have to fill up by INCHES, and also offset the amount she used.\n\nLet's say that over a week, her shampoo bottle filled up by 1 inch in height, a barely noticeable amount. My shampoo bottle is a cylinder about 4 inches in diameter, which is pretty average for a bottle of shampoo.\n\nV = A x h = \u03c0 x r2 x h\n\n\u03c0 x (4/2)2 x 1 = 12.6 in3\n\n1 in3 = 16.4 mL\n\nThe average adult male ejaculatory volume is 2.5 mL, or 0.153 in3 : https://www.dontcookyourballs.com/normal-semen-volume/\n\n12.6 \u00f7 0.153 = 82\n\nThat's how many times her brother would have to ejaculate full sized loads in one week to see a noticeable change in volume, assuming she wasn't using any shampoo. 82 \u00f7 7 = 11.7.\n\nSo her little brother would have to be dumping almost 12 FULL SIZED MEGA LOADS a DAY into her shampoo bottle to get a marginal difference.\n\nNow, if she were using the shampoo, I'm assuming she'd be using about a tablespoon daily.\n\n1 tbsp = 0.9 in3\n\n0.9 in3 * 7 days = 6.3 in3\n\nTo offset the weekly reduction of 6.3 in3 OP's brother would actually need to accrual 12.6 + 6.3 cubic inches, in other words be dumping 18.9 cubic inches of cum into the shampoo bottle per week.\n\nThat's 123.5 full sized loads, or 17.6 loads a day.\n\nNot to mention that men can only ejaculate a full sized load 1-3 times a day and semen also dries up within hours.\n\nIn conclusion, to notice a change in volume in a normal shampoo bottle over a long time period due to ejaculatory fluids would require a humanely IMPOSSIBLE amount of cum.\n\nNow, if she were using a small, 2\" diameter travel sized bottle (which would only last a few days), he'd still have to cum full loads 3 times a day into into the bottle to raise the level an inch over a week.",

            "So many subs seem like they're unable to figure out how many rules are needed. It's like there are two extremes. The first has few rules and low enforcement. These subs have shitty content, vague and loosely defined topic like `thing = good` that makes it easier for uncaring karmawhores to post, and the sub usually forgets what it was originally about if it ever had a more specific purpose. The second has several rules with high and strict enforcement. Traits for this one tend to be okay content, posters hate trying to post to the subreddit, and the only people willing to mod these are pissed off and power-hungry.\n\nI've got seven examples of the first. Anything that is slightly cool can be posted in these communities.\n\n/r/Damnthatsinteresting\n\n/r/nextfuckinglevel\n\n/r/blackmagicfuckery\n\n/r/woahdude\n\n/r/interestingasfuck\n\n/r/ThatsInsane\n\n/r/toptalent\n\nThen there are subs like /r/awfuleverything that actually had a more strongly defined purpose in the beginning (it was a sister sub to /r/awfuleyebrows where people had fucked up beyond their eyebrows), but now it's just in line with subs that fit `person/thing = bad` like /r/iamatotalpieceofshit and /r/noahgettheboat.",

Thankfully, OwOifier was there to give an emergency blood transfusion, saving Cummy's life. OwOifier is now in critical condition, because after I found out that OwOifier was recovering from a blood transfusion I rushed to the hospital to finish the fucking job. I popped OwOfier 6 times with a .38 right in the fucking gut but this little ho ass bitch won't fucking die god damnit. I am now wanted in 3 states for felony weapon possession crimes and violent assault. Please wish Cummy a quick recovery as he returns to work, pray that OwOifier dies slowly and painfully, and consider donating to my GoFundme to have my bail paid. Thank you.\n\nCummy is back by the way.",

            "Well, I was shopping in Walmart the other day, (with the intent of buying all of their guns, bacon and American flags) when I spotted a Mooslem running frantically up and down through the aisles, and his name was Abdul-Mohammed-Jamal-Jabar-Steve-Jabar-Omar-Abdul. I was certain at any moment he would yell 'Allah Akbar'. Thankfully, my shopping cart was full of bacon (which as you all know, is Mooslem kryptonite). So I straightened my MAGA hat and pulled up my Confederate flag britches and grabbed a pack of bacon from my cart. I took that Mooslem over my knee and spanked his ass with the bacon while screaming 'Liberalism is a mental disorder!' over and over. Then, by the power of the bacon,  Abdul-Mohammed-Jamal-Jabar-Steve-Jabar-Omar-Abdul instantly converted to Christianity and registered as a Republican. Trump showed up and awarded me the Medal of Honor because I probably stopped the next 9/11.",
