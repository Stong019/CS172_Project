All is kosher so long as you don't close your eyes and think of Obama and his Nobel Peace Prize ceremony where his suit stretched over his michelangelo-marble-statue-esque crepuscular musculature. \n\nI've actually seen Tinder bios that say \"and no I will not peg you, don't ask. Get a guy for that.\" Because ya know, lesbians who want to be strapon fucked really would prefer a guy opposed to a strapping strapped neon green plastic cocked vagina bearer.  Along with the obese one's saying \"oh fine i'll peg you\" in desperation to net the fetishists who will be wildly out of her league. Seriously, you can be a 2/10 gal and all you have to say is I need someone to lick my stinky feet and you'll net 8/10. Evidently, there are enough people asking for it to be a phenomenon.  Sadomasochism is a helluva drug.  120 days in Sodom should be required reading along with critical race theory and Quran studies. Freud said masochism stems from the Death Instinct. Probably right. The brains coping mechanism for pain is often finding ways to find pleasure out of it. The cliche about someone being spanked as a kid growing up to demand it in the bedroom. I think that is included in the Daddy Issues package. All I can think of is the scene in Louie where a girl asked him to spank her and he uncomfortable complies, she demanding harder and harder yelling until he whapps her and she starts crying, sobbing out \"I'm sorry daddy.\" I'd link it but I can't find it. \n\nAlso seems like OP went from zero to sixty in 3.5 by not asking his charming af gf to play the rusty trombone first. Wiser words have never been spoken than when Archer went into a fever dream finding himself what looked like to be heaven. He quickly reasoned it couldn't be since \"Jennifer Aniston isn't giving me a rim-job.\" \n\nWhole subject reminds me when Kim Kardashian was a whistleblower to the fact Kanye liked a finger up his butt. Kinda not what you whistleblow about the father of your kids but what do I know about blowing compared to her.  Also implicates herself and her stinky fingers. Caught brown handed. I'd rather not shake her hand but the logic is faulty since eating her ass seems totally appropriate to me yet I'm sure more than Kanye have made deposits. Isn't she now with Pete Davidson? I don't know why. Maybe it's cuz he is 100% straight and doesn't even allow the Dr. to check his prostate.",

            "I used to hate every minute I was there. Every time I was greeted by the overly sappy paraplegic at the entrance triggered my gag reflex. I despised the obnoxious patrons whose only use for me was to swipe their precious Bagel Bites or Great Value brand milk across the register, then each one of them would throw me out of their life like yesterday\u2019s receipts. Every time I looked at the clock and realized I still had seven hours of this hell to endure, death seemed a delicious alternative.\n\nBut now... what is this? Why is this happening to me? I still remember the endless lines of screaming customers, and yet... by some unseen and unknowable force, I feel myself being drawn... drawn back to Wal-Mart. Is this a work of a god? Sam Walton? Is that you?\n\nMaybe this makes perfect sense. Take another look at this chaotic superstore. No, not there; look harder. This cold, unfeeling, beautiful superstore. Think about it. Every Wal-Mart is a gift. And the best part: they\u2019re all the same. Every store is a holy window to our past. Like a portal to some spiritual Nirvana, we enter a Wal-Mart and every memory comes flooding back in: during our life\u2019s dawning years, being pushed around in the cart while Ma buys the groceries; picking out the perfect faux Christmas tree, the joy of seeing summer goodies crop up in the seasonal section... Wal-Mart is our home. Truly, it is the one place in which we have all grown up, and it is the place where we will all check out of this life.\n\nAnd so I feel myself being drawn back to this beautiful retail Eden. An intense yearning, a craving, a lust like I\u2019ve never felt before. I need you. I want you. Thank you, Sam Walton. From now on, seven times a day I kneel on my floor facing Bentonville, Arkansas. I pray for the legion of workers who don\u2019t know how blessed they are by this glorious company. I pray for the millions of customers the store graciously feeds and nurtures like a loving mother owl. I pray harder, screaming and sobbing at Sam Walton for forgiveness. Wal-Mart loved and protected me when I did not want it. I was a fool. Truly, Wal-Mart is the loving father and I his prodigal son. I pray that the great cashiers of the past will lovingly guide my path back to Wal-Mart. I love you, Wal-Mart. I love you.",

            "Here's how you can get the truth out of him. \n\nFind a way to make him uncomfortable in a controlled situation. Ideally with the presence of a parent. It's probably a bad idea to do this in the presence of anyone else who might be able to talk about it. If you're lucky you'll find that this situation isn't the first time he has been around kids. (If it is, maybe he should be a bit more careful.) You might be able to do this when he comes for visitation. You might do this when he comes for holiday visits or something like that. If you can't do this with him there, this may need to be a private exchange. \nTake a note that's not in the notes you already have. It will need to be something more than a question, because you're going to use the information from that note to lead him to something else that he might not even be aware of. \nHave him get a drink of something. Water will work well here. Then ask him questions that will be leading him to the information you want. \nOnce he's out of your reach, follow up with him to remind him of what you saw, and then tell him that if he didn't, someone else will notice. That should make him curious about what's going on, and he'll remember what he saw. Once you've told him you have witnesses, he'll have to do something about it if he doesn't want people to know. \n\n(Now, as far as how to actually deal with the information, that's a different question.)",

I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.",

Do you just wake up in the morning and think \"wow, I really feel like I must hate on a rock emoji\"? It's useless. I mean I love it. It just provokes a deep rooted compassion within me whenever I see it. I want to drive on over to the emoji headquarters and kiss it. If this was the emoji movie I'd push it on a swing set. People just comment \ud83d\uddff as if it's funny. It is. \ud83d\uddff deserves to live on forever. He deserves to have his cute little stone face cherished by all. Oh wow, it's a stone head, I should automatically downvote this because im a faggot, I'll downvote it in every comment I see it, NO. STOP IT. It doesn't deserve to burn in hell. Why is it so goddamn bad to you people. You're not just a fucking stone, you have so many life goals, you will always accomplish anything in life apart from pissing a few people off.

I don't know what exactly it was, but that whole scene was like nothing I have ever seen in an movie before. It was far fetched but in a good way. The powerful voice of the Fairy Godmother, whenever she roars \"Hit It!\", the start of one of the best scenes ever to grace movies. The transitions between Shrek and the huge gingerbread making their way to the castle and the Fairy Godmother singing was perfectly paced. A massive party inside the castle meanwhile the guards are doing their jobs to take down a huge piece of dough, Mongo screaming like a fucking dinosaur when he gets hit and starts kicking the gumdrop button back to them.

I don't know what exactly it was, but that whole scene was like nothing I have ever seen in an movie before. It was far fetched and ridiculously stupid, but in a good way. The powerful voice of the Fairy Godmother, whenever she roars \"Hit It!\", the start of one of the best scenes ever to grace movies. The mother of all baked creations terrorizing Starbucks. The fucking villain singing the song. Donkey as a white horse calling out to the baked monster to \"Follow the pretty pony!\". The transitions between Shrek and the huge gingerbread making their way to the castle and the Fairy Godmother singing was perfectly paced. Donkey as a majestic stallion leading the way. Donkey leading an army of fairytale comrades to battle and tear shit up. A massive party inside the castle meanwhile the guards are doing their jobs to take down a huge piece of dough, Mongo screaming like a fucking dinosaur from Jurassic Park when he gets hit and starts kicking the gumdrop button back to them. The fucking Godzilla roar. Mongo getting drenched in hot milk and looking back at the guards looking like a fucking granny with old hair. Fiona dancing with a gay Jaime Lannister. Gay Jaime Lannister and his stupid hair with a fucking rose in his mouth. He should have taken it out of his mouth and put it where the sun does not shine. The whole scene was well paced. It was fast, but balanced everything well. Amazing every single time. I should have appreciated it more as a child. From a perspective the scene was silly but that's why it reached such perfection. They pulled out all the stops. So fucking stupidly fantastic.\n\nIn case you need to refresh your memory -  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A\\_HjMIjzyMU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HjMIjzyMU)",

So I have a little routine of jacking off everyday around 11 pm at night. It was around 9:45 pm when I was feeling a little Horny. I was on Nikocado Avocado\u2019s OnlyFans and I must say, it got the better of me. So I just started tugging my meat sword before my usual routine. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, a premature coom session, it\u2019s all good. So I was jelking my prize hog when all of a we sudden I noticed that my door was still open. I knew that since I started masturbaiting earlier then usual that my family would still be awake. So I get up from my bed and walk to my door still jerking off and I get to my door. I\u2019m just about to close the door when all of a sudden my prankster of a step sister slams my bedroom door shut. And that\u2019s when a sudden sharp pain hits me and I look down and see that my foreskin has gotten caught in the door as it slammed. Holy shit it fucking hurt, my fucking dick felt like it was gonna fall off. Then when I think shit can\u2019t get worse. My step sister started banging on my door demanding that she come inside my room. The banging was making it worse. I shouted \u201cGET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!\u201d but she didn\u2019t listen. She kept banging on the door and that\u2019s when my pain grew into pleasure. It was basically like my foreskin was being rubbed by the doors banging. \u201cOh shit, that feels really good\u201d I thought. It was like I was fucking my door, it was the best feeling of my life. I wanted to scream and moan In pleasure, but my sister was on the other end of the door. Then right when I was about to bust my sister said \u201c Fine, I\u2019m just gonna come in anyway\u201d. She opened the door, but It was too late. I busted a fat nut all over her face. She started screaming and she ran away to the bathroom. God, I felt so embarrassed. Despite that, fucking that door was amazing. 10/10 would recommend.",

So I \ud83d\udc41 get \ud83c\ude50 up \u2b06 from my bed \ud83d\udecf\ud83d\udecc and walk \ud83d\udeb6\ud83d\ude0f to my door \ud83d\udd11 still \ud83e\udd1e\ud83d\ude4c jerking \ud83e\udd13 off \ud83d\udcf4 and I \ud83d\udc41 get \ud83c\ude50 to my door \ud83d\udeaa. I\u2019m just about \ud83d\udca6 to close \ud83d\ude1a the door \ud83d\udeaa when \ud83c\udf51 all \ud83d\udcaf of a sudden \ud83d\ude32 my prankster \ud83d\ude02 of a step \ud83d\udc5e sister \ud83d\udc71\u200d\u2640\ufe0f slams \ud83d\udca2 my bedroom \ud83d\udecf door \ud83d\udeaa shut \ud83d\udeaa. And that\u2019s when \ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udd59\u23f0 a sudden \ud83d\ude31 sharp \ud83d\ude40 pain \ud83e\udd15 hits \ud83d\udc4a me and I \ud83d\udc41 look \ud83d\udc40 down \u2b07 and see \ud83d\udc40 that my foreskin \ud83c\udf46\ud83d\udca6 has gotten \ud83d\udc98 caught \ud83c\udfa3 in the door \ud83d\udeaa as it slammed \ud83c\ude39. Holy \u271d shit \ud83d\udca9 it fucking \ud83d\udd95 hurt \u2753\ud83e\udd15, my fucking \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udf46 dick \ud83c\udf46 felt \ud83d\ude0e like \ud83d\udc96 it was gonna \ud83d\udc49 fall \ud83c\udf42 off \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\ude1d\ud83d\ude02. Then when \ud83c\udf51 I \ud83d\udc41 think \ud83e\udd14 shit \ud83d\udc4c can\u2019t get \ud83d\udd1f worse \ud83d\udcc9\ud83c\udd70. My step \ud83d\udeb6 sister \ud83d\udc81\ud83d\udcf1 started \ud83d\udca2 banging \ud83d\udca5 on \ud83d\udd1b my door \ud83d\udd11 demanding \ud83d\ude21 that she \ud83d\udc69 come \ud83d\udca6 inside \ud83d\udca0\ud83d\udc4c my room \ud83d\udcaf. The banging \ud83d\udca5 was making \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc98\ud83d\udc9c it worse \ud83d\udcc9\ud83c\udd70. I \ud83d\udc41 shouted \ud83d\ude32 \u201cGET THE FUCK \ud83d\udd95 OUT OF HERE!\u201d but \ud83c\udf51\ud83e\udd13 she \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffd didn\u2019t listen \ud83d\udc42\ud83c\udffb\ud83c\udd99. She \ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc68 kept \ud83d\ude23 banging \ud83d\udca5 on \ud83d\udd1b the door \ud83d\udd11 and that\u2019s when \ud83d\ude43\ud83c\udf51 my pain \ud83e\udd15 grew \ud83c\udf31 into pleasure \ud83d\ude02. It was basically \ud83d\udc68 like \ud83d\ude04 my foreskin \ud83c\udf46 was being rubbed \ud83d\ude4c by the doors \ud83d\udeaa banging \ud83d\udca5. \u201cOh shit \ud83d\udca9, that feels \ud83d\ude01 really \ud83d\udcaf good\u201d I \ud83d\udc65 thought \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udcad. It was like \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc I \ud83d\udc41 was fucking \ud83c\udf46\ud83d\udca6 my door \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\udeaa, it was the best \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udfc6 feeling \ud83d\ude01 of my life \ud83d\udc64. I \ud83d\udc41 wanted \u26a0 to scream \ud83d\ude31 and moan \ud83d\ude2b In pleasure \ud83d\ude4f, but \ud83c\udf51 my sister \ud83d\udc71\u200d\u2640\ufe0f was on \ud83d\udd1b the other end \ud83d\udd1a of the door \ud83d\udeaa. Then right \u2714 when \u23f0 I \ud83d\udc65 was about \ud83d\udca6 to bust \ud83d\ude8c my sister \ud83d\udc81\ud83d\udcf1 said \ud83d\udcac \u201c Fine \ud83d\udc4c, I\u2019m just gonna \ud83d\udd25 come \ud83d\udca6 in anyway\u201d. She \ud83d\udc69 opened \ud83d\ude05 the door \ud83d\udeaa\ud83d\ude05, but \ud83c\udf51 It was too late \ud83d\udca4. I \ud83d\udc41 busted \ud83c\udf46\ud83d\udca6 a fat \ud83d\udc0b nut \ud83e\udd5c all \ud83d\udcaf\u2642 over \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude4a\ud83d\udca6 her \ud83d\udc69 face \ud83d\udc67. She \ud83d\udc69 started \ud83d\udca2 screaming \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc and she \ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc68 ran \ud83c\udfc3 away \ud83d\ude02 to the bathroom \ud83d\udebd. God \ud83d\ude4f, I \ud83d\udc41 felt \ud83d\ude01 so embarrassed \ud83d\ude33. Despite \ud83d\udeab that, fucking \ud83c\udf46\ud83d\udd95 that door \ud83d\udeaa was amazing \u2764\ud83e\udde1\ud83d\udc9b. 10/10 \ud83d\udcaf would recommend \ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude24.",
