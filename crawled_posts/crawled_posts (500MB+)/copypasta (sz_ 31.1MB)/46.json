I put a quarter in the radio to activate it. It was the chief.\n\n\u201cBad news, detective. We got a situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Is the mayor trying to ban trans fats again?\u201d\n\n\u201cWorse. Somebody just stole four hundred and forty-seven million dollars\u2019 worth of bitcoins.\u201d\n\nThe heroin needle practically fell out of my arm. \u201cWhat kind of monster would do something like that? Bitcoins are the ultimate currency: virtual, anonymous, stateless. They represent true economic freedom, not subject to arbitrary manipulation by any government. Do we have any leads?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot yet. But mark my words: we\u2019re going to figure out who did this and we\u2019re going to take them down \u2026 provided someone pays us a fair market rate to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cEasy, chief,\u201d I said. \u201cAny rate the market offers is, by definition, fair.\u201d\n\nHe laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re the best I got, Lisowski. Now you get out there and find those bitcoins.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m on it.\u201d\n\nI put a quarter in the siren. Ten minutes later, I was on the scene. It was a normal office building, strangled on all sides by public sidewalks. I hopped over them and went inside.\n\n\u201cHome Depot\u2122 Presents the Police!\u00ae\u201d I said, flashing my badge and my gun and a small picture of Ron Paul. \u201cNobody move unless you want to!\u201d They didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cNow, which one of you punks is going to pay me to investigate this crime?\u201d No one spoke up.\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t you all understand that the protection of private property is the foundation of all personal liberty?\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t seem like they did.\n\n\u201cSeriously, guys. Without a strong economic motivator, I\u2019m just going to stand here and not solve this case. Cash is fine, but I prefer being paid in gold bullion or autographed Penn Jillette posters.\u201d\n\nNothing. These people were stonewalling me. It almost seemed like they didn\u2019t care that a fortune in computer money invented to buy drugs was missing.\n\nI figured I could wait them out. I lit several cigarettes indoors. A pregnant lady coughed, and I told her that secondhand smoke is a myth. Just then, a man in glasses made a break for it.\n\n\u201cSubway\u2122 Eat Fresh and Freeze, Scumbag!\u00ae\u201d I yelled.\n\nToo late. He was already out the front door. I went after him.\n\n\u201cStop right there!\u201d I yelled as I ran. He was faster than me because I always try to avoid stepping on public sidewalks. Our country needs a private-sidewalk voucher system, but, thanks to the incestuous interplay between our corrupt federal government and the public-sidewalk lobby, it will never happen.\n\nI was losing him. \u201cListen, I\u2019ll pay you to stop!\u201d I yelled. \u201cWhat would you consider an appropriate price point for stopping? I\u2019ll offer you a thirteenth of an ounce of gold and a gently worn \u2018Bob Barr \u201808\u2019 extra-large long-sleeved men\u2019s T-shirt!\u201d\n\nHe turned. In his hand was a revolver that the Constitution said he had every right to own. He fired at me and missed. I pulled my own gun, put a quarter in it, and fired back. The bullet lodged in a U.S.P.S. mailbox less than a foot from his head. I shot the mailbox again, on purpose.\n\n\u201cAll right, all right!\u201d the man yelled, throwing down his weapon. \u201cI give up, cop! I confess: I took the bitcoins.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy\u2019d you do it?\u201d I asked, as I slapped a pair of Oikos\u2122 Greek Yogurt Presents Handcuffs\u00ae on the guy.\n\n\u201cBecause I was afraid.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfraid?\u201d\n\n\u201cAfraid of an economic future free from the pernicious meddling of central bankers,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a central banker.\u201d\n\nI wanted to coldcock the guy. Years ago, a central banker killed my partner. Instead, I shook my head.\n\n\u201cLet this be a message to all your central-banker friends out on the street,\u201d I said. \u201cNo matter how many bitcoins you steal, you\u2019ll never take away the dream of an open society based on the principles of personal and economic freedom.\u201d\n\nHe nodded, because he knew I was right. Then he swiped his credit card to pay me.",

A grocery store clerk wants a man to leave the premises.\u201d\n\nI yawn as I hear the call. Sitting back in my seat, I ready myself for a nap.

No chance in hell anybody\u2019s taking that call.\n\n\u201c...and is black.\u201d\n\nI shoot up in my seat, twisting the key to start the ignition. I blare my sirens as I speed out of the Dunkin\u2019 Donuts parking lot, not even bothering with my seatbelt. Sweat drips down my face as I imagine the possibilities. All of the things this horrible criminal could be doing to that poor clerk.\n\nAs I pull up to the grocery store, my heart beats faster and faster. I steel myself and exit the car. I turn off my body cam as I approach the building. I\u2019ll just say it malfunctioned. I enter the store, gun drawn, and spot the perp.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t move! Hands up!

This bastard thought he could get away with it. As he struggles to decide what to do, I see my opportunity. I fire seven shots into his chest and duck into cover.\n\n\u201cShots fired! Need backup\u201d I yell into my radio.\n\nAs I stand back up, I fire five more warning shots into his back. I place my knee on his neck and fire four more shots into his head, just to make sure my safety isn\u2019t compromised. As backup arrives, they too point their guns at the dangerous criminal. Several more shots are fired off as they all pin him to the ground. 27 minutes later, the ambulance arrives to ship him off to the hospital. The media is outraged.

            "Alright here me out. For this thought experiment we are going to assume no outside forces are present.\n\nConservation of momentum states m1v1=m2v2.\nWikipedia states that the average ejaculation is 45km/hour or 12.5m/s.\n\u201cDon\u2019tcookyourballs.com\u201d states that 2.5 mL of jizz is released per load. Density of semen is 0.9982 g/mL so there is 2.495g or 0.002495kg of ejaculate per ejaculation.\n\nTherefore each ejaculation has a impulse value of 0.03119 kg*m/s. This is our m1v1\n\nThe average male weighs 76.4kg in America. This is our m2\n\nSolving for v2, each ejaculation increases our speed by 0.0004821 m/s. Because we are in space, we have assumed no outside forces so our velocity will stay constant by Newton\u2019s 2nd law\n\nThe speed of light is 299792 km/s.\nTo be a significant fraction of this speed, let\u2019s assume we need to reach 10% the speed of light. Therefore we must reach 29979.2 km/s or 29,979,245.8 m/s\n\nTherefore 29,979,245.8=0.000481*x where x is the necessary amount of ejaculations to reach 1/10 the speed of light. Solving for x results in 62,326,914,350 ejaculations.\n\nNow my fastest nut was in 20 seconds but I\u2019ve heard legends of 10 seconds so we\u2019ll use that as a constant rate. Therefore it would take 1975 years and 27 days and 7 hours and 45 minutes and 46 seconds of constant nutting every 10 seconds to achieve this speed\n\nNotes: this model does not factor in the time needed to consume the 155,505,651 kg of fuel that needs to be convert directly into jizz. \n\nThank you for listening to my TEDx Talk",

If he swung his dick in a circular manner, it would have centripetal acceleration of 72.57 meters per second. This means that gru can fuck slap with the immense energy 11,421 pounds per square inch at a top speed greater than 584415.58336974 MPH. In conclusion, Gru\u2019s dickslap has enough energy to smash through 6\u201d reinforced concrete and will cause a thunderclap as his dick breaks the sound barrier.",
