            " This happened awhile back (19 yrs) when I (m46) was working at my office (Cantor Fitzgerald) one morning (8:46). I (m46) was sitting on my computer (Gateway Performance 1500) scratching my balls (left testicle) and pretending to do my job (accounting), when all of a sudden a plane (Boeing 767- American Airlines Flight 11) crashed (440 mph) below us (2-6 floors). Out of fear I (m46) dropped my donut (glazed) and wet my pants (khakis). The office is normally kept at a very comfortable temperature (72 F), but now it was beginning to get hot (110 F). My coworkers (658m/f) and I (m46) began to rush toward the stairwell (stairs) and try to walk down (101-105 floors). Most of the stairwells (stairs) were destroyed (plane) or on fire (jet fuel) but one was still ok (safe). Now I (m46) am a little on the heavier side (345 lbs), but I had been working out really hard (biweekly) so I felt confident climbing down the stairs (stairwell). I barged ahead of everyone (658 m/f) and began to walk down to escape the tower (WTC 1). However the smoke was getting thick and I was having trouble breathing (asthma). I began to slow down (3 mph) after 10 flights of stairs but my coworkers (658m/f) began to get angry. Then a little while later (9:03 am) we heard a crash (590 mph) and knew the South Tower was hit (77-85th floors) with a plane (Boeing 767- United Airlines Flight 175). At that point we new it wasn\u2019t an accident (terrorism) and someone attacked America (Al Qaeda). I kept going but sweat was pouring down my face (bald-mustache) and my glasses began to fog up (bifocals) Still due to my less than ideal physical shape (fat) I couldn\u2019t keep going and collapsed in the stair well. My coworkers (658m/f) couldn\u2019t get around my enormous girth (345 lbs) and pleaded with me to get up. I tried to eat the emergency trail mix (snack) my pocket (khakis) to gain more energy but I couldn\u2019t pull it out. My coworkers began to body shame me and say \u201cWe\u2019re all gonna die because you\u2019re so fucking fat and lazy\u201d. I began to cry and refused to get up until they apologized. Suddenly (9:59 am) there was an enormous roar and the South Tower collasped. I tried to get back up but my rolls (love handles) prevented me from moving my arms enough. Three coworkers (m34-42) tried to help me get up but I was too heavy (345 lbs). Then (10:28 am) there was a loud groan and the North Tower Collapsed killing me and 68% of the employees at Cantor Fitzgerald. I did my best to get down the stairs but my coworkers fat shamed me and made me feel insecure about my body. They never thought about how their words would affect my self esteem. \n\nAITA for taking too long to walk down the stairs?",

            "This is actually very well-written, in terms of storytelling and word choice. I enjoyed it. It wasn't necessarily the most hilarious thing ever from this sub, but the quality is there. It told a story, described it well, and had a good climax and solution. It also used references very well and made me really realize how funny stories can be.

            "I\u2019ve thought about this for a very long time. SpongeBob\u2019s father has a darker skin tone than his son and wife, which leads me to believe he is a full-blooded sponge of color. Spongebob\u2019s mother has only a semi darker skin tone than her son, so I infer she is mixed race, which would explain the next member of SpongeBob\u2019s family. SpongeBob\u2019s grandmother has a darker skin tone than her possible daughter, which would explain her as biracial. But SpongeBob\u2019s grandmother is never told to be his maternal or paternal grandparent which is compromising to my theory but only on a small scale. Now, SpongeBob\u2019s cousin Blackjack has a tan skin tone reminiscent of SpongeBob\u2019s mother\u2019s, which means there are more sponges of color in the SquarePants family. Now, time for some math, SpongeBob\u2019s father is full-blooded and his mother is mixed race, so let\u2019s assume she is half sponge of color, now this would mean SpongeBob is 3/4ths sponge of color. In conclusion, with SpongeBob being 3/4ths sponge of color, I believe he has free reign to say the N-word.",

            "HELP! \n\nI (26M) was goin' to the bathroom at taco bell, as I normally do. as i reached into my big sweaty obese gaping asshole to grab my big fat squishy shits in order to shove them into the urinal, i noticed a cute lil' drawing on the stall. waddling my 300lb body over to get a better look, i realized what was drawn on the stall, a smiley face. i was immediately reminded of my lord and savior, daddy dream. \n\ni let out a roaring moan, shattering all the glass in the area, instantly letting everyone in that taco bell know of my presence. i ripped my clothes off, tugged on my dick, and started letting all of my body fluids drain out on the floor. sweat, pee, cum, shit, blood, organs, you name it, all flowing from my teeny weeny peenie hole. however, amidst my raging passion for dream, i hadn't realized what i had done! alas, everyone in that unisex bathroom stared at me in fear. men, women, children, all traumatized by the unholy sight ive forced apon their eyes.\n\ncrying, i leaped out of a broken window, letting the glass scrape my unclothed flabs of stomach. i bolted into my car, but not before the police found me. with no time to think, i ran over 5 officers, an orphan, and a pregnant woman with my sexy prius. i managed to escape, but at what cost? \n\nI am currently living in the middle of nowhere. i will never talk to my family or my friends again. yesterday i ate a grilled rat for breakfast. i'm in constant fear of the police finding me, and i can only pray to dream that i'll be alright.\n\nanyone else having this problem?",
