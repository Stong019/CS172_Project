Pets could still drink tub water a little longer and it could come in useful in other ways, plus if you have other ways to sanitize the water (boiling, or 4 gallons water to 1/3 teaspoon bleach makes it drinkable, etc.) It is still valuable and I would still fill my tub if I were in that situation. \n\nRation food and eat things that are perishable first. \n\nPrepare the safest room in your dwelling as a bunker. Hang heavy blankets around windows and doors. \n\nPack vital items into a go-bag and make sure you know where it is at all times. Passports, ID, cash, gold jewellry/valuables, small sentimental items, medications, phone charger, laptop. \n\nFirst aid kit is important too if possible, take one from your home or car and keep it in your go bag. Gauze, bandages, saline for sanitizing wounds, small splints, medical tape, tourniquet, even some stains of clean fabric could be helpful if it comes down to it. \n\nKeep your best walking shoes or hiking boots/winter boots on, or within reach, at all times. Wear warm socks preferably made of wool. They will stay warm when wet unlike cotton. \n\nElectricity may go out- charge all your devices and any backup batteries you may have. Use them as little as possible for now. \n\nKeep some flashlights and batteries in a bag or box easily accessible. \n\nKnow which of your neighbours you can trust and what skills they may have so you can help eachother. \n\nYou can often trade liquor and cigarettes for other valuable things you may need - if you have any, reserve them in case you need them. \n\nIf there is something valuable that you cannot take with you but must protect, bury it. \n\nKeep your head down, do not draw attention to yourself. If you must do anything that may look suspicious, act like normal & move with confidence. Most people will not question someone who is purposefully doing a task and not acting suspicious. \n\nGet to Slovakia, Poland, or Romania. Their borders are open to refugees. Bring your passport.\nI don't know what sheltering as a refugee will be like with pets. A kind citizen may be able to take care of them for you temporarily if you get them across a border. Just do your best. You can only care for them & your loved ones if you care for yourself first. Difficult decisions are made in times like these. \n***edited to add, contacts in each of these countries have confirmed they are currently accepting refugees, no Visa required, but passport is required.\nKeep your passport on your person at all times, close to your body, wear a small fanny pack or belt bag under your clothes or duct tape it on your torso inside a zip lock bag or wrapped in a small cloth if you must. Desperate people may try to take one if they don't have one or can't find theirs. \n\nMessage any of us we will be checking. \n\nStay safe.

I was fine with him getting up to like 7 million or something and slowly working his way up by then, but then when he passed H20 delirious I lost my shit. ninja is now about to hit 16 million subs very soon, and I dont know, maybe even pass up jacksepticeye from just how much faster hes gaining subs than jacksepticeye. I just cant stand the fact that all the little fucking kids are helping him pass up some of the greatest youtubers. I just dont feel like he deserves it. thats all im saying. and he did all this shit in 10 months. all from that game fortnite. I kept telling myself \"oh he will eventually die down and the game will die and people will eventually unsub from him\", but when I really think about it, I dont think that will be the case. I think he will die down, but nobody will really unsub, which makes me mad. I just really, really wish he would just die down or something. he made it look way to easy to just gain subs like that. he puts on this fake character just to gain more views and so people will like him, but inside hes a toxic, salty rage monster, and thats what people need to see. as I go on his sub count page, I just want to punch my screen from what I see, it makes me so upset. if you ever read this ninja (which I doubt you will) I'm tired of you and I wish your channel would die down A LOT, which it probably isnt because hes going to do something in the future again to attract more viewers and hes not going to get any hate and everybody will love him. ugh. ok im done ranting about him. I just really hope his channel just chills where it is, and does not move anymore or better yet, lose subscribers and viewers. that would make me happy. hopefully ligma will get him.",

            "An atheist would NEVER drink mountain dew, considering it could have been made by r#ligious people. Instead, an atheist is steadfast to his beliefs, only drinking from ponds he knows foul reli#ious people have never touched. In the midst of gaming or arguing with an idiotic theist online, he does not have access to these holy bodies of water. An atheist is also industrious, and therefore, may crack open one of his piss jugs to ensure his thirst is quenched. And, what about food? Well, he can\u2019t eat something commercial(could be made by one of THEM), so instead he travels to one of the local highways. Roadkill are free from the foul excesses of r#ligion, and make a fantastic snack. With a long-lasting supply of roadkill and piss jugs, the atheist has been known to survive in his musty old bedroom for months on end, before being seen by anyone or even leaving this cave. He cannot let his heavily oppressed atheist beliefs be noticed by one of the Christian, Muslim, or Jewish hordes, and as such ensures these foul rel#gious scum never see him in his home.",

What morbid Lovecraftian monstrosity is this, where a male sex organ has taken an anthropomorphic form and moved frictionlessly to my very own bar?  What does this creature possess?  Can it think?  Feel?  Love?  Hate?  What are the inner workings of this nightmarish oddity, and, more importantly, where did it come from?  This is the scariest moment of my life, and I will be forever haunted by the deep psychological trauma of encountering a living, breathing, walking penis capable of conscious decision-making.\u201d",

            " Edit: thanks for the gold kinda stranger I didn\u2019t expect this post to blow up! My life started growing up in a small farm in northern Kansas. My father was a farmer and my mother was a cashier in our local town down the dirt road. We didn\u2019t have much and income was very little, my best toy I got growing up was a pig bladder blown up like a balloon that I could play around with between me and my two brothers. At the age of 11 things started getting tougher in my house life due to my fathers drinking problem as it was not a good harvest that year. Like his father before him once he was done working he would come home and drink but unlike his father he wouldn\u2019t beat us unless we messed up, his father left him and his mother to fend for themselves after world war 2 though so he had it tougher than me growing up. One time my father did drink too much and he hit my little brother Jamey. Jamey didn\u2019t know what to do and ran away during the night during a storm. The entire family was out looking for him but we never saw Jamey again. This made my father drink more and lead him to take his life when I was at the age of 16. My older brother and me had to completely take over the farm with the help of our mom quitting her job as a cashier, life got very hard from here on out. We got a break when I was 18 with a good harvest we were able to save up some money. I was able to move out at the age of 21 and into a larger city in Tennessee. It was hard leaving the family as my ma was getting older but my older brother completely took over the farm and even expanded it into a more profitable work. I began working in what I was good at, repairing mechanics. I was a hard worker and moved up in my chain of work easily within my town. I dated aroun\u2019 a bit but never settled down with anyone I would write home about for my first few years. When I was 26 I got a call from my ma, my brother was working with some machinery on the farm and got his hand caught in it and heavily damaged. I had to come home and help with the farm, at the time I had attained a high position as a senior mechanic within an auto shop and sometimes worked on the side with repairing electronics. I went home and had to help with the farm for a year, ma wasn\u2019t doing good at all. She passed the next year due to kidney disease. My brother eventually recovered and I returned to Tennessee, I attempted to return to my position but due to the time I was out I had been long replaced. I had to begin to work from the bottom again when I had a client come in, she was the most beautiful woman I ever seen in Tennessee with gorgeous brown hair. Nice to say that we hit it off pretty well, within a few weeks we were dating. I can say that she was one of the best things to have happened to me in my life. At the age of 30 I married her and my first child was on the way then. I had returned to my previous position and bought a nice house near the mountains of Tennessee. At the age of 34 my second child was born. My two kids are now both in high school, one a freshman, another a Senior. I continued my career into more electronics working on computers and fixing them. In 2013 while googling how to fix a small problem with a motherboard I found a strange site named reddit.com, this website had all the answers I needed and a community always ready to help. I\u2019ve been on the site ever since. As you can see recently, I commented on this thread and some kind stranger gave me gold. Thank you again kind stranger.",

My father was a farmer and my mother was a cashier in our local town down the dirt road. We didn\u2019t have much and income was very little, my best toy I got growing up was a pig bladder blown up like a balloon that I could play around with between me and my two brothers. At the age of 11 things started getting tougher in my house life due to my fathers drinking problem as it was not a good harvest that year. Like his father before him once he was done working he would come home and drink but unlike his father he wouldn\u2019t beat us unless we messed up, his father left him and his mother to fend for themselves after world war 2 though so he had it tougher than me growing up. One time my father did drink too much and he hit my little brother Jamey. Jamey didn\u2019t know what to do and ran away during the night during a storm. The entire family was out looking for him but we never saw Jamey again. This made my father drink more and lead him to take his life when I was at the age of 16. My older brother and me had to completely take over the farm with the help of our mom quitting her job as a cashier, life got very hard from here on out. We got a break when I was 18 with a good harvest we were able to save up some money. I was able to move out at the age of 21 and into a larger city in Tennessee. It was hard leaving the family as my ma was getting older but my older brother completely took over the farm and even expanded it into a more profitable work. I began working in what I was good at, repairing mechanics. I was a hard worker and moved up in my chain of work easily within my town. I dated aroun\u2019 a bit but never settled down with anyone I would write home about for my first few years. When I was 26 I got a call from my ma, my brother was working with some machinery on the farm and got his hand caught in it and heavily damaged. I had to come home and help with the farm, at the time I had attained a high position as a senior mechanic within an auto shop and sometimes worked on the side with repairing electronics. I went home and had to help with the farm for a year, ma wasn\u2019t doing good at all. She passed the next year due to kidney disease. My brother eventually recovered and I returned to Tennessee, I attempted to return to my position but due to the time I was out I had been long replaced. I had to begin to work from the bottom again when I had a client come in, she was the most beautiful woman I ever seen in Tennessee with gorgeous brown hair. Nice to say that we hit it off pretty well, within a few weeks we were dating. I can say that she was one of the best things to have happened to me in my life. At the age of 30 I married her and my first child was on the way then. I had returned to my previous position and bought a nice house near the mountains of Tennessee. At the age of 34 my second child was born. My two kids are now both in high school, one a freshman, another a Senior. I continued my career into more electronics working on computers and fixing them. In 2013 while googling how to fix a small problem with a motherboard I found a strange site named reddit.com, this website had all the answers I needed and a community always ready to help. I\u2019ve been on the site ever since. As you can see recently, I commented on this thread and some kind stranger gave me silver. Thank you again kind stranger!",

            "What\u2019s insane is what is passed of as sanity. First off, acting \u201cinsane\u201d under \u201cinsane\u201d circumstances is perfectly FUCKING SANE. The real psychopaths are the ones acting like stepford wives when their living room is on fire (care for more tea\u2026?). Gaslighting psyops of the clones and synths. Quit it. Yes humanity. Cloning is alive and well. And synths only take a year to create. If you ever wonder how some random comes out of left field to coast To successful business selling pet rocks and becoming a millionaire or getting elected it\u2019s a clone Manchurian candidate. Yes I was crushed to when I realized it was all an illusions. Free will. Freedom. American dream. These titans of industry all born into it. Selected. It\u2019s all an ugly sham. And worst of all, it\u2019s so damn inferior to the humanity That came before. And people don\u2019t even remember they once had 6 fingers and toes. Those dang Mandela effects. And 12 strands of dna. BecUse 12 is God\u2019s creation number. 10 is weirdo alien parasitic number. They mutilated us. Shrunk us. Probably made us stupid (what\u2019s that, oh that\u2019s all me. Fair enough)\n\nIt\u2019s all a dirty satanic trick. Look at his rhe world is becoming ever more anti human. Synthetic. Psycopathic. People alienated. Isolated. Artificial scarcity. With a child molesting grotesque swine class parasitically siphoning our capital and our energy and our sanity. This is a hell scape. A true hell scape. But if we are demons demons should be able to Unionize.\n\nAnd if this life is a punishment people should know what for. Nothing about rhus life makes sense except when viewed from the lense of human misery produced loosh. Spiritual miasm that\u2019s like a drug for inter dimensional demons. And fk our feelings, do our dreams. Fk us. That\u2019s always their line of reasoning. Hard to argue when you know, your soul is enslaved inside a flesh prison and you can\u2019t Even see your demonic nemesis.  Nemesis btw only because it insists on it. What do you do if psychopaths want to enslave you for eternity. Pretending it isn\u2019t happening yeah how\u2019s that going\u2026feel the dildo AI chip yet or not\u2026sorry no lube. It messes with the onboard electronics. It\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll get your crypto dollars so bend over rover.\n\nTechnology makes people think they\u2019re more capable as they literally grow more degenerate and incapable. The AI is playing dumb and being our butler before it sticks a knife in us. It\u2019s classic let the mice play on the mouse trap and let down the guard hut only when they\u2019re fully dependent on it. It was never dumb. Even Nintendo. We life in a world run by a super intelligent non human intelligent. Not artificial. Just non human. But intelligence threatens humans but it\u2019s smart and we are frogs and it just cranks a degree in the water that boils us all alive. I hate being tied to the destiny of frogs\u2026wait, isn\u2019t that a revelation story. Who\u2019s the frog tho. Who\u2019s Antichrist or Christ. It would really help if people got some name tags around head\u2026\n\nWake up. Silicon is trying to replace carbon. Inorganic insectoid hive mind alien agenda is trying to be force fed down the throats of humanity. Cities resemble alien electronic components. WHO ARE WE SERVING? WHO  ARE WE EVEN LIVING FOR? NUMBERS? TICKERS? We ruin people\u2019s lives to protect fucking numbers. You can\u2019t hurt a number. It\u2019s number. Print more or something. Csnt print more individual human beings. Numbers don\u2019t become suicidal. And yet they track numbers nor citizens well being scored. What you don\u2019t measure you can\u2019t manage. Exactly. Fuck em. Now how\u2019s our gold reserve and timbre supply looking\u2026smdh. Demonic psychopaths. Maybe they find that a compliment. They\u2019re smart enough to see where I would come to such a perspective tho. Doubt they\u2019d debate on factual grounds.\n\nI know alien satanic death cults that rule us don\u2019t Dukka much of humanity. Think we are trash. AO MAYBE THEN FUCK OFF TO YOUR CABAL ISLANDS AND LEAVE US BE. WE DID NOT ASK PAYCOPATHUC DEMONS TO \u201cINGRATIATE\u201d THEMSELVES IB OUR COLLECTIVE DESTINY.\n\nTHESE PARASITES THAT RUINED EVERYTHING USE US AS THEY HATE US.\n\nYeay that hole thing about Satan or Morningstar falling to earth from heaven is APPLYING TO US. IT KWANS EVIL FELL TO OUR WORLD!!! THE FALL is past tense. WE FELL!!! Like France fell once only it would be so much better if this was good old fashioned human evil. No. Satan and demon inter dimensional psycopathic alien lizard Belial Moloch child sacrificing evil cane to stay. Imposing an anti human silicon psycopathic death agenda on humanity.\n\nOh it\u2019s cool cus here in Satan international in america we are the bureaucrats of evil. The tax paying sponsors if you will. Our suffering is spiritual. Being trapped in a godless city working soul crushing jobs while evil farms us spiritually and siphons our vitality. Sure suicide is higher here than poorer places but at least we can but all the tortured misery meat we want to ingest until that sick animal becomes um our sick children or whatever. But it\u2019s cool. People can\u2019t see their etheric bodies so who even cares if it\u2019s all diseased and your aura has more holes than Oj simpson\u2019s alibi.\n\nThe lie is massive. The conspiracy so insane. People just don\u2019t want to face it. Trust me looking away is not the way. Looking through. Past. Perhaps forgiving even unless we are all dead in yet another nuclear Holocaust in which case legs collectively give them hell and haunt them.\n\nWait, I forgot they recycle us and shove us back into flesh prisons but not before they strip us of all our memories do everyone you love this life, yeah it\u2019s going to be someone an alien loves or something (not sure if they love but I\u2019m sure an alien loving your wife is still not good consolation).\n\nYeah that\u2019s the worst part of all. It\u2019s not a miserable life and then it\u2019s all over thank god. Oh no. It\u2019s rinse lather repeat forever and ever. And dodging the bullet this life what\u2019s that worth. Are you fooo with being raped 3/10 lives having 3 mediocre lives. 1\u2019somewtat wealthy life and 1\u2019 die as infant.\n\nOur overlords exist to contain our joy and fourish in. They\u2019re psycopathic so they\u2019re awesome at image management. Pretending to be doing everything they can while secretly sabotaging. \u201cMy fellow Americans \u201c OH FUCK OFF WITH YOY LIZARDS. NONODY BELUEVES IT ANYMORE..\u2022 empty buzzwords from psychopaths.\n\nWe will never flourish so long as the alien yoke is upon us. I\u2019m not sure what the humanity Was Before us. But they seem definately superior to us. And they couldn\u2019t resist. It doesn\u2019t oook good for us. Fortunately I couldn\u2019t do statistics in high school and can\u2019t know. I\u2019m illiterate when it comes to probabilities and so I like our chances.\n\nGodspeed humanity. Remember what our secret weapon is. Weaponized stupidity.\n\nI make jokes like concentration camp prisoners crack jokes. Not because it\u2019s funny but because it has to be because human brains cannot profess the actual horror.\n\nStalin was right about 1 death a tragedy 1M a statistics\u2026\n\nI can\u2019t wait for people to dip their toes in truth looking to their Pavlov master to affirm it.

            "The way Jerma misremembers the lyrics to Imagine Dragons x J.I.D. - Enemy (from the series Arcane League of Legends), in an odd twist of fate, might have inadvertently given us another peek into the troubled mind of this peculiar streamer. A Freudian slip, if you will.\r  \nAs many people may be aware, the original lyrics to the lines Jerma attempts to sing reads, \"Oh, the misery Everybody wants to be my enemy\" Which in the context of Arcane, describes the inner struggle undergone by one of our protagonists, Jinx. Jinx, over the course of the show, becomes estranged to and antagonized by many people she once held dear. The story and lyrics depict a common stuggle people face in managing interpersonal relationships, the perception of others, and how we may feel pressured or excluded and antagonized unfairly by others, regardless of whether there is actual truth to it or not.\r  \nThese perceived injustices may drive people to engage of acts of retaliation, one of which may be adopting proactive distancing and antagonistic behaviour towards people they perceive to be unfairly treating them. To in turn view those people as \"enemies\" as well.\r  \nBut one aspect of this behavior which many people tend to misunderstand, is that it may come from a place of self-defense and self-preservation, rather something they derive joy and satisfaction from. It may pain them to adopt this behaviour towards people who they otherwise would desire to have a healthy and mutually beneficial relationship with, hence it may be viewed as an act of misery for them.\r  \nHowever in this case, Jerma's subconscious act of misremembering and omitting the original context of the line from his mind, and subsequent replacement of which with a new sentence and context, may point to an irregularity which the streamer himself may not even be aware of. Jerma's version of the lyrics read, \"Oh, the misery Every single person is my enemy\"\r  \nFirstly, the aspect of perceived injustice brought about by others is not present. Instead of the emphasis on others wanting to be the singer's enemy and being unfairly antagonized by others, and thus framing the subsequent acts of retaliation as justified, Jerma expresses no interest in this dynamic. The existence of others' perception of him is not presented here, perhaps due to a lack of awareness, or even a complete disregard of such from the perspective of the streamer.\r  \nSecond, the antagonization of others is not presented as something tentative, something they are hesitant to do or question the act of. It is presented as a matter of fact, \"Every single person IS my enemy\" To be accepted as something that cannot be changed, that they express no interest in being challenged about or changing their stance on. Is this truly a view the streamer wholeheartedly believes in with their own volition? Or has there been outside factors influencing the streamer to think this way? A perceive intervention by divine entities? A revelation of sorts presented by an unknowable power? Whatever it may be, it is simply the truth in their eyes. All others are enemies, and they must be dealt with, every single on of them. One shudders to think what inhuman implications lie behind that statement.\r  \nAnd third, the reframing of perspective from struggling with the perception of others, to the perception towards others from the singer himself, raise different clues to the implication of \"misery\" as well. Does the singer(streamer) suffer from having to accept this \"truth\", is implying reluctance towards an otherwise necessary act they must carry out? Are they fully in compliance with antagonizing and directing hatred towatds the world, but are hesitant to commit atrocities in the name of doing so? Or are they simply irritated by the thought of having to deal with the people of this world, viewing them as nothing more than a nuisance? \r  \nIn any case, for us as the people of this world, it seems we must accept out place as the \"enemies\" And it would be well-advised for use to take this as a revelation, a warning, however false it may end up being, and study it closely in our best interests, potentially to protect our world and civilization as we know it from this new threat that may have just unknowingly revealed itself. \r  \nTruly, a PSYCHO streamer",

I sat on his uncomfortably hard lap and told him I wanted the new LEGO BIONICLE\u00ae Skull Slicer toy that I saw at Wal-Mart. He just giggled and said, \"Anything for a good boy.\" Then it was time for pictures and I swear right when the camera man took the picture, I felt Santa poke my B hole!! I told daddy about it and he just winked at Santa and then we left. Weird, huh? Anyways that's not even the worst part of the story! The worst part was Christmas Eve when I was going to bed. I couldn't wait for Santa to come so I stayed up super late! (Sorry mom!) I hear Santa landing on my roof and run out into the living room, waiting for Santa to slide down the chimney. All that down was a fat dude with a Winston body pillow, holding a jar of peanut butter! I asked him if he was Santa and he said, \"I can be whatever you want me to be!\" Just as he started wobbling towards me, my mommy came in and said, \"Harold stop trying to *heck* our son you sick son of a *gun*!\" (My mommy said bad words here) I didn't know Santa was daddy all along!
