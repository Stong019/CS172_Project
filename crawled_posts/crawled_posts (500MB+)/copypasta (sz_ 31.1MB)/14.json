She (6F) wanted to play fortnite (released 2017 by Epic Games) on my (237,624 M) Xbox One X (released 2017) even though she (6 F) has a PS4 (released 2013), which I (237,624 M) destroyed.

He's so much fun to be around, handsome, charming, and our sex life is great. Except for one small problem.\n\nEvery year now starting in December he starts referring to his cum as \"Greggnog.\" When I first heard him say this, it was in the context of a joke, so I laughed, and then I forgot about it. A few days after this, we're exchanging some spicy texts before he gets home from work he says to me, in all seriousness, \"I can't wait to pour Greggnog all over your face.\" I could not believe he just said that to me, but I didn't know what else to do at the time but go along with it. \n\nFast forward to this December. This phrase re-enters his vocabulary at the same time every year. It makes me cringe beyond belief, but until this year he used it sparingly enough for me to just be able to laugh and say \"shut the fuck up.\" \n\nI'm sure that 2020 has done at least some irreparable psychic damage to all people, but unfortunately, for my boyfriend, this has manifested in the form of him referring to his cum as \"Greggnog\" non-stop. This month he has been using the term almost exclusively, in all contexts, and it is driving me batshit insane. I sat him down to talk last week, and I asked him very clearly and directly to stop. At the time, he said he would, and it did slow down for a few days, but it is now four days after Christmas and he's back at it again with no end in sight.\n\nHe absolutely means the world to me, and I saw myself spending the rest of my life with him, but I have serious doubts now whether or not I can if every Christmas is going to be like this. So please, reddit, what do I do to make this stop for good?",

            "First of all: I'm not kidding. I wish it was a joke.\n\nI've been with my best friend Greg for over four years, but this is the third time I'm seeing him at Christmas. She was very happy together, beautiful and attractive, and our sex life was amazing. Except for one small problem.\n\nEvery December he begins to call his money \"Garganog.\" I've heard him say it before, but it was just a joke, he laughed and forgot. A few days before we got back to work we had to give and receive heartbreaking comments. He said honestly. \"I want to pour water on Greg Nave's face,\" - I do not believe what he told me, but I do not know what to do at that time.\n\nThe fast pace continued in December this year. This phrase is repeated every year at the same time. I'm very upset, but until this year he said \"stop\" using only my innocent pictures.\n\nI'm sure 2020 will be a bad year for everyone, but unfortunately for my friend it does not affect his conversation about Garganog. The content presented this month drives me crazy at almost every event. Last week I sat down and talked to him and asked him to go clear and honest. At the time he said he was a little late, but would make a very unsuccessful comeback 4 days after Christmas.\n\nHe tells me a lot about the fact that I saw him and spent the rest of my life, but I'm really afraid that every Christmas will be like my question. So Reddit, how are you going to do that forever?",

            " \n\nFirst off: I am not joking. I wish I was joking.\n\nI've  been with my wonderful boyfriend Greg for over 4 years now, and this  Christmas was our third spent together. He's so much fun to be around,  handsome, charming, and our sex life is great. Except for one small  problem.\n\nEvery year now starting  in December he starts referring to his cum as \"Greggnog.\" When I first  heard him say this, it was in the context of a joke, so I laughed, and  then I forgot about it. A few days after this, we're exchanging some  spicy texts before he gets home from work he says to me, in all  seriousness, \"I can't wait to pour Greggnog all over your face.\" I could  not believe he just said that to me, but I didn't know what else to do  at the time but go along with it.\n\nFast  forward to this December. This phrase re-enters his vocabulary at the  same time every year. It makes me cringe beyond belief, but until this  year he used it sparingly enough for me to just be able to laugh and say  \"shut the fuck up.\"\n\nI'm sure that  2020 has done at least some irreparable psychic damage to all people,  but unfortunately, for my boyfriend, this has manifested in the form of  him referring to his cum as \"Greggnog\" non-stop. This month he has been  using the term almost exclusively, in all contexts, and it is driving me  batshit insane. I sat him down to talk last week, and I asked him very  clearly and directly to stop. At the time, he said he would, and it did  slow down for a few days, but it is now four days after Christmas and  he's back at it again with no end in sight.\n\nHe  absolutely means the world to me, and I saw myself spending the rest of  my life with him, but I have serious doubts now whether or not I can if  every Christmas is going to be like this. So please, reddit, what do I  do to make this stop for good?",

            "My (24F) Boyfriend (27M) will not stop calling his cum \"Greggnog\" During Christmas time\n\nFirst off: I am not joking. I wish I was joking.\n\nI've been with my wonderful boyfriend Greg for over 4 years now, and this Christmas was our third spent together. He's so much fun to be around, handsome, charming, and our sex life is great. Except for one small problem.\n\nEvery year now starting in December he starts referring to his cum as \"Greggnog.\" When I first heard him say this, it was in the context of a joke, so I laughed, and then I forgot about it. A few days after this, we're exchanging some spicy texts before he gets home from work he says to me, in all seriousness, \"I can't wait to pour Greggnog all over your face.\" I could not believe he just said that to me, but I didn't know what else to do at the time but go along with it. \n\nFast forward to this December. This phrase re-enters his vocabulary at the same time every year. It makes me cringe beyond belief, but until this year he used it sparingly enough for me to just be able to laugh and say \"shut the fuck up.\" \n\nI'm sure that 2020 has done at least some irreparable psychic damage to all people, but unfortunately, for my boyfriend, this has manifested in the form of him referring to his cum as \"Greggnog\" non-stop. This month he has been using the term almost exclusively, in all contexts, and it is driving me batshit insane. I sat him down to talk last week, and I asked him very clearly and directly to stop. At the time, he said he would, and it did slow down for a few days, but it is now four days after Christmas and he's back at it again with no end in sight.\n\nHe absolutely means the world to me, and I saw myself spending the rest of my life with him, but I have serious doubts now whether or not I can if every Christmas is going to be like this. So please, reddit, what do I do to make this stop for good?",

Now here\u2019s mine:\n\nIf we look at the date of the post it says may 2nd which was yesterday but because America is America I\u2019ll check February 2nd as well. On may 2nd. The only tweets visable is telling people about the major lazer event that was happening in the game. There was another one about the major lazer set coming to the item store and staying on the item store there was a new emote brought into the game called the strut (pretty snazzy music). There was also a tweet about some the music being copyrighted and they claimed that for the event content creators won\u2019t have their money taken from them. Huh doesn\u2019t sound like any racism to me. Let\u2019s check February 2nd. Huh, I just realised they\u2019re also donating a high amount of money to people in need because of COVID-19. You should too but would you look at that... you\u2019re a selfish bitch. Ok now where was I? Oh yeah. February 5th. There seems to be only 2 tweets that day. One of them being about a downtime for the game to update since they\u2019re launching their colab with DC comics with Harley Quinn. There\u2019s also a tweet about a new set of skins (outfits) coming to the item store. So that shows it. There\u2019s no rude tweet by fortnite saying such things. oH BuT tHeY cOuLd HavE DelEtEd tHe twEET. Huh, you\u2019re right. So let\u2019s go to google and search to see if there was such tweet done... huh no fortnite racist tweet popping up here. (Also if you want photo proof I can give you it just do me). I\u2019m going to check google images and see if there is one there. Wow first one. It\u2019s of a fortnite content creator. It\u2019s about them saying that white girls and black guys is a turn off to him. Yes that\u2019s controversial but still isn\u2019t fortnite\u2019s tweet (plus that tweet isn\u2019t even racist by its meaning) oh. Here\u2019s some controversial tweets but ninja but wai-. He was hacked. Damn. Welp I guess there\u2019s no racist tweet since obviously if they tweeted such thing the internet would of reacted in such a horrible way. Also if you want to find rude content search up Trisha paytas. Ok then. Time to search up pewdiepie since who knows he could have magically made that comment. (Also if you find any evidence of pewdiepie being a nazi please tell me). Now let\u2019s do the same thing with Felix. Wait... why can\u2019t I find his twitter... oh wait yeah! He deleted it ages ago. If you want evidence of him saying he deleted his Twitter her you go: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1n_cPIhag28. Welp that\u2019s that.but wait! There\u2019s more! I just remembered. Donald trump thinks that video games cause violence. And I\u2019m guessing you agree with that huh? Well does that mean you like separating Mexican families from their kids and deporting them \u201cback to where thy came from\u201d lol. Also (we\u2019re going by your logic here mate) he also blames China for started corona virus which is true since it originated there but you can\u2019t blame them for that but guess what. Donald trump blames them for that lmao. So I\u2019m guess you do to huh? Donald trump has also stated that he doesn\u2019t like people who are captured. Wow that would include prople that have been abducted and raped for hours on end. Also tourtured and maybe alive. That includes all the prisoners of war that probably went through the same hardship as the people I said before. There\u2019s plenty more I could list off about Donald trump but let\u2019s change subjects. So... I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re Christian huh. Let\u2019s go back on the history of Christianity.  Already to start off. God said that he loves everyone. Aw that\u2019s nice but I think he forgot about: Jews, muslims, asians, Africans, females, gays, lesbians, basically anyone who isn\u2019t straight and indigenous people. God that\u2019s a lot of people you left out wink. Remember the Black Plague. God a horrible time. 1/3 of Europe died. I guess god hated you for being such idiots. Must explain why COVID is happening right now. Oh yeah and those Jews you thought poisoned your wells. Well that just made things worse since if you didn\u2019t know. Jesus is a Jew. You remember those times when women were accused of being a witch just for doing a magic trick? Yeah you killed so many innocent women because of that. Oh yeah and lastly, remember when you enslaved a whole freaking continent just for some wheat. Damn. If you didn\u2019t also know that\u2019s the reason you see a lot of black people committing crimes since that\u2019s all they know what to do since you showed the back in Nigeria. I know you didn\u2019t read a single bit of this and though of this as fake news and I know you\u2019re not going to be convinced but even more anti games. Because that\u2019s how the human body works. When presented with a well constructed argument Against Someone with a strong opinion about something else they just go ballistic. So atm is your hormones going over the place looking at this message. And yes you still have hormones in you even as an adult. Well cya in hell",

            "Ok here me out tho right. The fact that this shit exists in the internet unironically makes me angry. It's just so fuckig unrealistic. Greta has aspergers. She herself has said a gazillion times one of the ways it manifests is not speaking when there's nothing pertinent to say. I dont know because I dont know her obviously, but I'm pretty sure she doesn't fucking flirt like some high society chick. Let alone I'm pretty sure shes never said or done anything sexual in her life.\n\nAs an environmentalist, something I respect about her is that she appears to be completely viceless.  Which I'd like to say I am. But I like to make drinks and drink beer and wine and such. And obviously.im an 18 year old boy who lives with his gf and has access to the internet, so I'll let you fill in the blanks. Point is, she doesn't have regular weaknesses, that makes her powerful.",

I say I loved her on CNN She laughs. I  get my drink.  \n\"Well, see ya,\" I say and walk away. I've got her  attention now. How many guys voluntarily leave a conversation with Greta  Thunberg? She touches her neck as she watches me leave.  \nLater, as  the night's dragged on and the coterie of gorgeous narcissists grows  increasingly loose, she finds me on the balcony, my bowtie undone,  smoking a cigarette.  \n\"Got a spare?\" she asks.  \n\"What's in it for me?\" I say as I hand her one of my little white ladies. She smiles.  \n\"Conversation with me, duh.\"  \nI laugh.  \n\"What's so funny?\" she protests.  \n\"Nothing, nothing... It's just... don't you grow tired of the egos?\"  \n\"You get used to it,\" she says, lighting her cigarette and handing me back the lighter.  \n\"What would you do if you weren't a climate change activist?\" I ask.  \n\"Teaching, I think.\"  \n\"And if I was your student, what would I be learning?\"  \n\"Discipline,\" she says quickly, looking up into my eyes, before changing the subject. \"Where are you from?\"  \n\"Mexico\" I say.  \n\"Oh wow. That's lovely.\"  \n\"It's OK,\" I admit. \"Not everything is to my liking.\"  \n\"What could possibly be not to your liking in Mexico?\" she inquires.  \n\"I don't like sand,\" I tell her. \"It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.\""
