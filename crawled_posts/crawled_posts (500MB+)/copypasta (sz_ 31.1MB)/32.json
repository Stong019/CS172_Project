            "For the longest time my mother hid the fact from me that I was born with her umbilical cord wrapped around my throat and had to be hospitalized for several days after I was born. All I knew for the longest time was that I was \u201cborn sick.\u201d I only found out the truth after my dad randomly told me one day when I was 16.\n\nI honestly wasn\u2019t even bothered by the fact that my parents withheld that information from me for so long. But what truly bothers me to this day is that my mom still continues to hold onto her faith in God. She still insists that everything happens for a reason. Really? So does she really believe that god tried to kill me as a baby so many years ago, and that it was somehow justified!? Was the intervention of the doctors that saved my life that day somehow acting against God\u2019s will? Was I supposed to die that day? There are times I think about this, but in the end I am thankful to be alive.\n\nHowever, posts like this make me wish that god pulled a little harder on that umbilical cord.",

            "I just downvoted your post.\n \n# FAQ\n \n## What does this mean?\n \nThe amount of karma (points) on your post and Reddit account has decreased by one.\n \n## Why did you do this?\n \nThere are several reasons I may deem a post to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:\n \n* Rudeness towards other Redditors,\n* Spreading incorrect information,\n* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a `/s`.\n \n## Am I banned from the Reddit?\n \nNo - not yet. But you should refrain from making posts like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.\n \n## I don't believe my post deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?\n \nSure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.\n \n## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?\n \nAccept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",

            "#I just downvoted your comment.\n\n#FAQ\n\n#What does this mean?\n\nThe amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.\n\n#Why did you do this?\n\nThere are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:\n\n\u2022\t\u2060Rudeness towards other Redditors, \u2022\t\u2060Spreading incorrect information, \u2022\t\u2060Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.\n\n#Am I banned from the Reddit?\n\nNo - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.\n\n#I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?\n\nSure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.\n\n#How can I prevent this from happening in the future?\n\nAccept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",
            "\nWhy",
            "I sit down at my desk and open my porn folder. I scroll through all the weak nonsense such as hentai and loli until I get to my futa furry toddler nugget porn. I start jerking it and within two minutes I was covered in my own seed.\n\nThe speed at which I wanked made me incredibly tired so I laid down and went to sleep, hoping to dream of My Little Pony and their tight pussies.\n\nI suddenly wake up and am very itchy. I look down in horror to see hundreds of little ants crawling over me, eating the sweet, sweet semen. The feeling of their little feet walking all over me was enough to make me bust again. This time, however, they noticed the source of the sweet nectar. They began forming lines and burrowing themselves into my foreskin. I arched my back and moaned loudly as they nibbled the head of my penis.\n\nThey began to go into my urethra and make little ant nests in the residue. I was thrashing on my bed because I wanted to nut again but I couldn't. My mom walks in to see this and she screams in horror. As soon as I turn my head to look, I busted the hottest, fattest nut I ever have. An explosion of ants rocket out of my penis and all over the floor.\n\nMy mom runs out in terror and I begin to finally clean up. Just the thought of what happened sent chills down my spine. I picked the few ants that were still alive and kept them in a jar. I couldn't wait to do it again.",

            "The first time I received a blowjob from a cat I was about 13 years old, and I am not going to lie, it was one of the best blowjobes I have ever gotten. \nNow I might add that this was purey accidental, you see my parents decided I was finally old enough to be left home alone, so i did what any normal teenager would do, I striped naked, jumped on the couch and started beating my meat. So after about 2 minutes of masturbation my orange cat, Jonesy walks in, and honestly I didn't think much of it, but then I noticed that he was getting kinda curious, he was slowly moving closer and closer to me and then he proceeded to jump on the couch with me and then he just kinda sat down and quietly observed me. Now at first i was kind creeped out by this, but you know i haven't finished yet, so i decided to just ignore him and to continue masturbating and I have to say that this was the best decision of my life. You see after about a few more minutes of watching me Jonesy decided to help me out, he slowly moved closer and proceed to put his front paws on my naked thigh, putting his face maybe 3-4 inches from my penis, now at this point i was kinda close to cumming, so I just tilted my had back and closed my eyes. And this is when it finally happened, this is when I felt his tiny little tongue on my rock hard dick and it was the weirdest, but also the best feeling ever. His tongue was a bit rugged, yet gentle and he was moving it so rapidly that I stood no chance, I orgasmed and exploded my seed all over Jonesys cute face, some of the cum even went deep into his troath and he swallowed it with no hesitation. Unfortunately some of the cum also found its way into his tiny nostrils causing him to sneeze, which launched the cum in to the air, some of it landing on my face and some of it landing on the couch. After the feeling of euphoria settled I slowly returned to reality. I almost couldn't comprehend what had just hapend, but I knew I was dead if my parents ever found out, so I proceeded to take a shower with Jonesy and than I thoroughly cleaned the living room, removing every last ounce of cum. \nMy parents never found out.\n\nAfter this me and Jonesy, repeated this experience on the daily. As most people do, I masturbated every night before sleep, so when all the lights in the house went dark, I cracked the door open and Jonesy would slip in and we would do the deed. Over the years our little ritual was also becoming more sophisticated, I would proceed to rub my penis with bacon so Jonesy wouldn't just lick the tip of my penis, but he would rather pleasure me from the balls all the way up to the top of the shaft. Atfer a year of blowjobs only we decided to also try penetration. Now Johensy's asshole is pretty small and tight, so I had to use butter as lubricant and I have to say that it went pretty well, his virgin asshole felt amazing, but than about a minute in Jonesy started to get kinda rowdy, I guess he just couldn't take it anymore and he quickly turned around and actually chomped at my penis, so yeah that was the first and also the last time we did that.\n\nUnfortunately our story ends abruptly, at the age of 8 years old Jonesy was driven over by my neighbor. The weeks following the accident were the darkest times of my life, but I eventually got over it and I still occasionally wank my dick in honor of Jonesy. \n\nR.I.P. little buddy.",

            "I was in a science classroom and the teacher said \u201cgonads\u201d. So I pulled out my hiragana chart and whipped my 13-inch schlong out. I said \u201cI\u2019ll demonstrate the human testicles\u201d, taped my chart to the wall, and went to town on my teacher and students. \n\n\u200c \u200c \u200c \u200c I started jacking off. The sweeping curves and twisty loops made me horny and I felt like I was in heaven. I blew my load, and the intense sensation of seeing \u306d and \u307f dripping with my manseed made me orgasm again. \n\n\u200c \u200c \u200c \u200c But then, my batch teacher started dialing security, and I hurried up and covered each sexy script square with cum. It is illegal if she\u2019s a 119-year-old loli? I imagined the curvy squiggle-like turns of \u3090 and \u3059, which made my libido soar, and the shape of \u306a drove me up the wall and into orgasm. \n\n\u200c \u200c \u200c \u200c I wanted to shove my dick in the hiragana syllables, feel their tight grip around my throbbing cock as I pleasured myself, when security burst in through the door. I came in their shirt and drew \u304a in my sticky baby batter.\n\n\u200c \u200c \u200c She was thrown off, and I wanted to feel the pleasure one last time before being hauled off to jail. So I took my chart off the wall, balled it up in my hand, and fisted myself with it. Sex is overrated anyway.\n\n\u200c \u200c \u200c \u200c I\u2019ve tried fapping to katakana and Kanji, but they just don\u2019t give that deep sensation only hiragana can give me. I\u2019ve created r/JizzyHiragana for those of us who love the goj\u016bon a little bit too much. I\u2019ve also 3D-printed a dildo and fleshlight with the 51 kana extruded on the penetration surface. \n\n\u200c \u200c \u200c \u200c Bye now.

I volunteered for John Kerry's presidential campaign back in 2004 which is where first registered on my map. I watched his speech at the DNC was was instantly enamoured.\n\nWhen he announced his candidacy for president in 2007, immediately threw my weight behind him. I knocked on doors, educated people about his policies and did the best I could to get people to vote for him. When he was elected, I was ecstatic. In the past, when I had supported candidates, it was out of cold reason; because I thought their policies and acumen would result in the best net result for this country. But this was a person I could get excited about, someone I could believe in.\n\nWhen it came time for his campaign for a second term it was largely the same. I had slightly soured on him. Granted, he was not the president I had hoped he would be but that was not his fault. I had built him up to be so huge in my head it was impossible for him to live up to expectations. Republican gridlock in Congress also prevented him from getting through the policies he wanted. Nevertheless, I still supported him, still volunteered and was still happy when he won his second term.\n\nThe problem started about three weeks ago. I had a dream involving Barack, which is not uncommon for me, I was working with him and Michelle on their upcoming Netflix show. We were looking over demographics and how they related to various geographical locations. Without even realising it, I said \"Yeah, N\\*\\*\\*er, we should do pretty well in (area near me)\" He just looked at me and stormed out with Michelle behind him. I woke up and went into the bathroom to splash cold water in my face. I dismissed it. I don't have a racist bone in my body. This was just one of those dreams, right?\n\nA week and a half ago, I had a similar experience. This time I dreamt we were going wine-tasting together. I don't remember the lead-up but I ended up saying something to the effect of \"The sommelier said we should be detecting earthy tones in this wine, but it's just not registering with me, N\\*\\*\\*er\" This time, instead of storming out he replied, very sternly \"Why did you feel that was an appropriate thing to say?\" I began to stutter and explain it was an accident but I had once again woken up.\n\nThe most recent incident was last night. I dreamt I was at a family barbecue with the Obamas, just his family and mine. He was manning the grill and i was speaking to Michelle while the children played with each other (I know Sasha and Malia are adults now but I still think of them as children) I said to Michelle very politely \"excuse me for one moment\" and marched right up to Barack and tapped him on the shoulder.

            "Had a conversation with a social activist the other day.  Our views are aligned but I realized something that reminded me of this:  this person believes that using words like bitch, nigga, etc. actually help to perpetuate \u201cthe problem\u201d directly and indirectly; also that they accept but will never understand why black people use the word \u201cniggA.\u201d\n\nSo my reply was, if you think people using these words sre part of the problem, and you know that black people use these words almost exclusively, well then you are indirectly treating these people as if they are being uncooperative....the idea of a black person being \u201cuncooperative\u201d when someone is \u201cjust trying to help them\u201d is a pretty old idea.  It stems from the white savior complex.  In the end wht we have here are people expressing themselves, you ate for or against that.\n\n\nWhat i find relevant here is do you think Obama would give two shits if you called him that?  Its a dream so its hard to tell but there seems to be an indication of misplaced superiority for you to feel like your words could condescend or insult someone with a much higher status than you.  The racial and hate-speech aspect of this dream doesnt have to be a literal translation to your reality\u2014but it indicates to me that you may be unsure about your place on a totem poll in your life.\nOr....that you maybe unsure or strugggling with the real reason you want to help a black candidate?  Like are you a democrat because of the racial and social issues?  Or are the racial social issues just a superfluous part of your political platform?  There are racists liberals who struggle to see this because they have a warped definition of racism to begin with.\n\nNot accusing you or calling you out OP, your confession inspired these thoughts.",

The N word does not offend black ppl btw if u want some sort of power through language invent a new word. Just my take."

I am not a homo, (I have 2 girl friends) but seeing Eren transform into a titan with a 12 foot long cock as the people of Marley watch in horror would easily made this anime my favourite of all time.

When I want to finish and climax with all my love, I would do it on her stomach, face, tits, and roll her over on her ass to blow the last of my load on those supple cheeks. I want to cuddle with her when I am done busting, and ask her how her day was, feeling each other's warmth on our naked, vulnerable bodies. She'd tell me how good it was and she'd confide her truest feelings for me, telling me how much she loves me. I would tell her I love her back, and she would give me a loving peck on my cheeks. Then we would get dressed and spend the day watching Willy Tyburs speech, still cuddling and even eating our favourite foods. I want Pieck to be my girlfriend, my lover, my wife, and my life. I love her and I want her to be mine. Is this a copy-pasta? No. I typed out every word to proclaim how I feel. Every time you ask who she is, look back on this: SHE IS MY WIFE. I love Pieck Finger, and these are MY original thoughts and feelings.",

A glowing substance can be seen sitting still inside.\n\nMonitors flicker to life at the end of the hall, each one showing the point of view of an innocent civilian.

Lord Microsoft pierces his flesh with the needle. A flourescent orange liquid can be seen coursing through his veins. He falls to the floor, his muscles tightening and constricting in unnatural fashion. His eyes bulge from his skull and he shouts in pain.\n\nHe slumps over, and in only a moment he comes back to his feet. His pupils dilated and his skin, pale.\n\n\"How may I serve you, my lord.\"",

            "I just finished watching THE TRAVELERS on Netflix and I was tripping a little when I saw an episode that was filmed in 2018 about a \"Flu Like virus\" that was supposed to eliminate millions of people, here is the twist.. The Travelers that were sent back in time to prevent the virus from spreading had an antidote and were given a list of 5 people who lived in 5 different continents, they succeeded injecting the targets and thought they saved the day only to find out they actually injected the virus that would wipe out millions. BTW I am fully vaccinated and I personally think anti-vaxers are stupid.",

You quadruple mask and put on your plastic smock. You gaze longingly at the sky. A man riding his bicycle points his flashlight at you \"Why aren't you doing your stretches and cardio?\" He asks, you recognize him as your neighbor (maybe, it's been some time since you last saw anyone). \"It's because of people like you not obeying that the lockdowns have been extended another 4 years.\" He mumbles through his layers of masks. He reports you to AlphabetGoogle and your social credit score drops 5 points, good luck buying bread this week.",
