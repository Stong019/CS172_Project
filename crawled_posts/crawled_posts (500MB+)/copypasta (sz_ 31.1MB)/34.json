This is a pretty unoriginal take on it, to be honest.\n\nEdit: To be precise, the original copypasta stemmed from a viral greentext. I also think that the end part, after the grandfather voices his utter disappointment, might be new, but I can't quite be certain.\n\nEdit 2: Here's a [copy](https://www.reddit.com/r/greentext/comments/77u9ku/anon_shows_his_grandpa_anime/) of the original greentext. Thanks to u/DoubleSlamJam for linking it in a reply to this comment. Personally I think the original is much more amusing than this particular copypasta.",
            "How much is it for the whole fucking stock?",
            "The reviews on this game are gold. Here's another one:\n\nThis game saved my life.\n\nI am 27.\n\nMy ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you",

            "This is one of those once-in-a-lifetime experiences. The time I spent with this video game will stay with me until the day I die. Which as of those moment, mere seconds after completing the game, I wish was this day.\n\nBefore I begin, I would also like to say that I am also a proud owner of the 18+ Nude DLC for this game. After I installed the DLC and restarted the game, I was greeted by the new option on the main menu \"Begin Game with 18+ DLC\", or something along those lines, I don't have it in me to reopen the game and check the exact verbage. Anyway, after what one might describe as furious clicking, the game would not start when I tried to select this option. As such, I cannot fully review this DLC. I hope for a future patch to address this issue.\n\nHentai Nazi only took me 49 minutes to complete, after multiple failed attempts and having to have a friend consult a guide to help me. The controls and general feeling of movement and gunplay are among the worst I've ever experienced in a video game, but surprisingly they were at the very least serviceable. The objective of the game is to collect 14 \"memes\", which are scattered around the map attached to buildings and such, similar to Slender: The Eight Pages. All the while you are accompanied by the soundtrack which is a very loud German anthem on an endless loop with the volume so high that it will not only burst your eardrums but also nuke your braincells.\n\nAnyway, the first time I collected all of the 14 memes and made it to the Hitler fight, I was killed by trying to duck behind cover and being blocked by an invisible wall. The next time I collected all 14 memes and was killed on the way to the boss fight. The third time I made it and used the inside of the church as cover and finally defeated Adolf Hitler himself.\n\nAfter I had spent an adequate amount of time tea bagging his oversized corpse, I made my way painfully up the stairs inside the church to the belltower at the top. It was at this moment I realised there was no reward for completing Hentai Nazi, nor was there any meaning behind my 49 minutes, my 2940 seconds. I attempted to have my character kill themselves, by jumping from the top of the tower. There was no fall damage. As I considered calling a taxi, at what is currently 4AM, into the centre of my town to find a building tall enough to jump off and cause fatal injuries, possibly even a belltower to fully experience the irony, I gave myself the chance to fully reflect upon the game. I have come to the definitive conclusion:\n\nAt least the pantie shots were hot.\n10/10 would recommend.",

            "Isn't this an adaptation fron a 4chan copypasta about Girls und Panzer and a British tanker grandpa?",
            "Take note bethesuda  \nThis game has it all, a playable game, graphics that scream TIDDIES, ya got guns, Nazis to shoot, and even a very inexpensive nudity DLC, Todd Howard if you're reading this, Hentai Nazi is how you make a AAA title, Hentai Nazi has less bugs then Fallout 76 which is amazing considering its very high budget of 10$, the gameplay is very fluid the gun sounds are so realistic it actually makes you feel like you're a hentai girl murdering Hitler, the realism in Hentai Nazi is stunning.

So ofc i slamed that bitch of the fucking road (and her car did a few flips it was actualy pretty cool). And then this motherfucker gets out the car all screaming like oh god my kids! (and this is the moment i realy got pissed) wait what she was trying to blame her kids for that crash? So i went up to her and then she said: Call a ambulance my kids are not moving! And I said: Bitch wtf your kids are just sleeping, you are trying to get away with this by making me think that your kids got hurt dont you? (by this point that was pretty obvious). So i knocked that bitch out and got in my car and drove over her(i think i broke her spine XD). Never heard of them again not even a sorry letter? Smh.",

        "selftext": "Recently I discovered my parents play LoL together in secrecy.\n\nMy younger brother and I were both gifted new gaming laptops last Christmas. My parents set some ground rules however. After 8pm they are to be left in the lounge room as to ensure we don\u2019t take them to bed with us and spend the entire evening gaming.\n\nA few evenings ago I woke up in the middle of the night and was fairly restless, I tossed and turned in bed and for the love of god could just not get back to sleep. I laid awake staring at the ceiling finally on the verge of dozing back off until I started hearing some faint noises. The noises were fairly quiet at first and seemed to be coming from my parents room. As the seconds past the noises became more clear and more frequent. It was my father and mother, and they were playing LoL!\n\nI couldn\u2019t make out most of what they were saying but they must of been caught in an intense team fight. I heard a lot of back a forth sighing and panting and what I assume was the banging of the mouse against bed side table.\n\nI laid there and listened in as best I could and the noises kept ramping up and I assume the game got more intense and more intense.\n\nIt must of been slightly past the 25 minute mark at this point when all I can assume a massive team fight broke out. I suppose my father is a support main like my self as I could hear my mother encouraging him and coaching him on his Alistar play.\n\n\u201cPulverise that pussy! Pulverise it\u201d\n\nThere must have been a Yummi on the other team. I could picture the team fight in my head playing out and I started to get more frantic wondering what the outcome of the team fight would be.\n\n\u201cYes baby, keep going keep going\u201d My mother exclaimed.\n\nThey must of aced them and are now running down mid to close the game out! I can only assume my mother has just respawned and is about to TP in the enemy base to join father in killing the nexus!\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming baby I\u2019m coming\u201d She keeps repeating to my father \u201cYes keep hitting it just like that\u201d My dad must be carrying this game from the way my mother is yelling at him in joy\n\n\u201cOHHHH FUCK YES DAVID\u201d she screams!\n\nHe\u2019s done it. My dad has killed the nexus and my parents have gained some hard earned LP.\n\nThe room goes silent and I catch my breath also after listening in on one of the most intense games of my life. I assume they didn\u2019t que up again because in the next hour or so I didn\u2019t hear a noise. Eventually I fall back asleep myself.\n\nThe next morning I got up out of bed and went to the kitchen to make some breakfast. My parents are sitting at the table.\n\nWe make some small talk before I have to quickly head out the door and go meet my friends. As I\u2019m about the leave I turn to both of them and let them know I heard them last night.\n\nI quickly pat my dad on the back and congratulate him and start heading out the door. My father has gone bright red and my mother\u2019s mouth is wide open in shock.\n\nI assume they are both embarrassed and completely gob smacked because they haven\u2019t said a word and I now know they are gamers.\n\nJust before I pull the door closed behind me I turn to my mother and exclaim \u201cDon\u2019t worry mum, I fucking hate Yummi too\u201d and give her a cheeky little wink",

            "Google translated for your pleasure:\n\n>I found out recently that my parents were secretly playing in the league.  \n>  \n>My brother and I started a new video game last December. The rules were set by my parents. After 8:00 a.m., leave him in the room so we can\u2019t sleep and play at night.  \n>  \n>A few days ago I woke up in the middle of the night and I felt anxious, I lay down on the bed and prayed to God that we would not be able to sleep. I woke up and looked at the sky and at some point I would come back until I felt something disgusting. The first sound is displayed in the parents \u2019room. A few seconds ago, the volume was rising and falling. They\u2019re parents, they\u2019re playing LoL!  \n>  \n>They can\u2019t do much to say, but they want the best. I feel a lot of complaints and pain, I just need to click with the mouse on the table next to the bed.  \n>  \n>I stood there and listened to the best of myself as the noise continued to play as the game screamed.It should take more than 25 minutes to reach this point; all I thought was a good team game. I think my father supports me as much as I do and I heard my mother encourage and scold him for working with Alistair.  \n>  \n>\"Be smart! Click\"It must be Yummi and the other side. I watched the team shake during the match and began to wonder more and what the outcome of the team game would be.  \n>  \n>\"Yes, dear, stop,\" Mom shouted.  \n>  \n>Maybe they got married and stopped fighting. I think my mom even took a vacation and went with my dad to end the relationship.  \n>  \n>\u201cI told my son,\u201d he told my father. \"That.\"  \n>  \n>\"Ohhhhh, I love David,\" he shouted!  \n>  \n>Yan My father died and his parents paid for his care.  \n>  \n>The room was quiet, peaceful and he listened to the ugliest games of my life. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll come back sometime, I can\u2019t hear the sound. Then I fell asleep again.  \n>  \n>The next day I got up and went to the kitchen for breakfast. My parents were sitting at the table.  \n>  \n>We started talking before we immediately went to talk to friends. When I left, he talked to me and told me I heard from him last night.  \n>  \n>I immediately called my father, thanked him and went to the door. My parents had gray hair and had fun.I think they were confused and disappointed that they didn\u2019t speak, and now I know they were actors.  \n>  \n>Before I closed the door, I went to my mom and exclaimed, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I love you,\u201d and I laughed.",

            "Great Google translate: \n\nRecently, I noticed that I secretly bought with LoL as well.\n           My sister and I received a new Christmas gift and a laptop.  But they made my rules.  He had to stay in his room after eight o\u2019clock at night to make sure he couldn\u2019t talk to her or sleep with her.\n           I awoke in the middle of the night quietly, jumping on the bed in the presence of God's sleepless night.  I woke up and saw the roof of the house, which was part of the economy, and I began to hear noises.  The first silence begins to fade, as if coming out of an old room.  In a matter of seconds, his voice was clear and unchanging.  Mom and Dad will play LoL!\n           I could not hear what he was saying, but he had to fight hard.  I heard a loud bang that I thought was a rat on a table by the bed.\n           I was sleeping there, feeling better than anyone, and my voice was louder than before, I thought my game was noisy.\n           It should be over 25 minutes now for me to think of a major attack on that team.

What I think the mother will wake up to is that she will join the great TPU enemy to destroy her relationship with her father.\n           \"I'm gone, my son, I'm here,\" he kept saying to my father.  \"Well, you're typing like that.\"\n           \"David!\"  Cry.\n           OK.

When I got to the trip, I turned around and told him I had spent the night listening.\n           I immediately turned to my father, greeted him, and left.  My father was red and my mother was scared.\n           I\u2019m embarrassed, I\u2019m angry, I don\u2019t say anything, so now I know I\u2019m a player.\n           Before closing the door, I looked up and shouted, \"Don't be afraid, Mom, I hate candy too,\" and looked at her without hesitation.",

It all \ud83d\udcaf started \ud83d\udca2 a week \ud83d\udcc5 ago \ud83d\ude05.

No \u26d4\ud83d\udeab blood \ud83d\udc89, but \ud83c\udf51 the turd \ud83d\udca9 is fucking \ud83d\udd95\ud83d\udc66\ud83d\ude1c massive \ud83c\udf10.
