            "Hentai is much more ethical than \"normal\", live-action porn. No human trafficking, no drug addictions, no STDs.\nLive-action porn is imperfect by definition; it stars humans, and one of the defining traits of humanity is imperfectness. Hentai, on the other hand, is much closer to perfection; it does not include any unwanted elements that are always present in people. Still the majority of people view hentai as sick or weird, even though it is much closer to perfection than live-action porn.\nThe usual arguments against hentai are ones about the weirdness of being attracted and aroused at drawings. This is of no argumental value as it plays on the majority-ruled and zeitgeist dependent notion of \"weirdness\". What's weird is not universal; people of different cultural backgrounds may view things that other cultures do as sick or weird. In fact, it is much more abnormal to not be aroused by hentai, as hentai is the crystallization, the minimalistic arrangement of arousing qualities stripped of everything unnecessary. It is much more abnormal to not be aroused at these qualities that chosen specifically to arouse, than it is to be aroused at a random arrangement of genes transformed by random events through life.\nThe same points also apply to virtual idols and singers such as Hatsune Miku and others like her. The inevitable impossibility of ever having physical contact with Hatsune Miku is no different from real singers; you as a normal person will most likely never touch her, the star.",

            "Sounds like the shit was particularly big/hard. While a constipated shitfest always applies pressure to the prostate, a turd being particularly large and coming out at an angle could have applied massive pressure the a think flesh wall covering the prostate, \n\nWhen we harvest semen from horses, cows, donkeys etc, we don't have some guy giving a touching it pp at all. In fact that would be slower. The farmer (hopefully) inserts on electric probe into the rectum of the vessel of the desired seminal fluid. \n\nIt quite an immediate harvest, instantaneous nut busting because of the direct stimulation of the prostate and the level of such with the electricity. Would by like a sybian for a non vatuna haver.  Point is, I could easily buy this story. \n\nI was in Japan and because a myriad of reasons I had not finished which I wasn't worried about but the Japanese girl had a very frowny face. She took it personally and thought it had something to do with her. She just got off and took a sip of water, throwing a few tramadol tablets on my palette before so. This is a particularly atypical opioid as over long use it double as an SSRI, only 30% of people don't get side effects from the drug class. It was still a necessity though since I still had a 5 inch splinter, quite wide, that broke off in the side of my thigh ever since a small boy stabbed me with a sharpened stick like 2 weeks ago when I had just touched down in Japan and was walking through a forest. Anyway I thought it was over but this 90pd Japtress sumo wrestled me back into a recline and with one hand on my member and another's middle finger up my rectum, I shit you not, I hit the ceiling. \n\nUnfortunately the spot of the ceiling I had hit was the ceiling fanw jizz hitting like the propeller on a boat or plan which scattershot in and out to rain down everywhere in the room. She was clapping gigly as we both got group bukkake  in a way i did not know was feasible. She than proceeded to the bathroom only feet away and began shitting without even shutting the door, all the gurgles and plobs, the vociferous shorts n sharts which she seemed to have no shame about. And than, I shit you not, the same thing happened to her as did OP. Turns out she had a prostate, the japanese penis looks incredibly similar to the american vagina's clit. It looked pretty legit the whole hole she carved in under it. And then in a twist of events she anally prolapsed herself completely inside out and I did not know what to do. But ut was lil difference, the boy wiith the stick got a new one and brought his friends.",

There's a lot of things I should have done differently, but I didn't, and for that from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry.
