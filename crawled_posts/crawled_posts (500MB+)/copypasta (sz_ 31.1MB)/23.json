I volunteered for John Kerry's presidential campaign back in 2004 which is where first registered on my map. I watched his speech at the DNC was was instantly enamoured. \n\nWhen he announced his candidacy for president in 2007, immediately threw my weight behind him. I knocked on doors, educated people about his policies and did the best I could to get people to vote for him. When he was elected, I was ecstatic. In the past, when I had supported candidates, it was out of cold reason; because I thought their policies and acumen would result in the best net result for this country. But this was a person I could get excited about, someone I could *believe* in.\n\nWhen it came time for his campaign for a second term it was largely the same. I had slightly soured on him. Granted, he was not the president I had hoped he would be but that was not his fault. I had built him up to be so huge in my head it was impossible for him to live up to expectations. Republican gridlock in Congress also prevented him from getting through the policies he wanted. Nevertheless, I still supported him, still volunteered and was still happy when he won his second term.\n\nThe problem started about three weeks ago. I had a dream involving Barack, which is not uncommon for me, I was working with him and Michelle on their upcoming Netflix show. We were looking over demographics and how they related to various geographical locations. Without even realising it, I said \"Yeah, N***er, we should do pretty well in (area near me)\" He just looked at me and stormed out with Michelle behind him. I woke up and went into the bathroom to splash cold water in my face. I dismissed it. I don't have a racist bone in my body. This was just one of those dreams, right?\n\nA week and a half ago, I had a similar experience. This time I dreamt we were going wine-tasting together. I don't remember the lead-up but I ended up saying something to the effect of \"The sommelier said we should be detecting earthy tones in this wine, but it's just not registering with me, N***er\" This time, instead of storming out he replied, very sternly \"Why did you feel that was an appropriate thing to say?\" I began to stutter and explain it was an accident but I had once again woken up.\n\nThe most recent incident was last night. I dreamt I was at a family barbecue with the Obamas, just his family and mine. He was manning the grill and i was speaking to Michelle while the children played with each other (I know Sasha and Malia are adults now but I still think of them as children) I said to Michelle very politely \"excuse me for one moment\" and marched right up to Barack and tapped him on the shoulder. He turned around to look and me and I just said the word and nothing else. I can write off this happening once or twice in my dreams but three separate events is too much.\n\nI don't know what to do. I don't want to do this. Every time it happens my work suffers the next day. I've started lying to my wife saying I've been having nightmares but I'm not sure she fully believes it. Lately, I've been worrying I might start saying it in my sleep and she could hear. I'm at my wits end and I want it to stop.",

            " For obvious reasons, this is a handy excuse. Some background Politically, I remember this being an exhibit all my life and I was a supporter of Obama. I used it to select President John Kerry, who was the first to score on the map in 2004. I immediately saw a speech in the DNC that caught the attention of the public. When he announced his running for president in 2007, he immediately lost weight. I give the public the door of basic education.

I worked hard on my idea and did not achieve my goals. The position of Republicans in Congress prevents them from winning the policies they want.

            "  \nThis is a throwaway \ud83c\udd97\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udfda for obvious \ud83d\ude44 reasons \ud83c\udf1f.   \n  \nSome background \ud83d\ude12. Politically \ud83c\udfdb, I've \ud83d\udc41 been a Democrat \ud83d\udc34\ud83d\udd35 my entire \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 life \ud83d\udc64 and an Obama \ud83c\udf46\ud83d\udc66\ud83c\udffe supporter \u2764 for as long \ud83d\udd5a as I \ud83d\udc41 can remember \ud83e\udd14. I \ud83d\udc41 volunteered for John \u2714 Kerry's presidential \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 campaign \ud83d\udd07 back \ud83d\udd19 in 2004 \ud83d\udd19\ud83d\udcc5 which is where first \ud83e\udd47 registered \u2611 on \ud83d\udd1b my map \ud83d\uddfe. I \ud83d\udc65 watched \ud83d\udc40 his \ud83d\udca6 speech \ud83d\udde3 at the DNC was was instantly \u23f1 enamoured.   \n  \nWhen \u23f0 he \ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2695\ufe0f announced \ud83d\udde3\ud83d\udce3 his \ud83d\udca6 candidacy for president \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 in 2007 \ud83d\ude18, immediately \ud83d\udc47 threw \u26f9 my weight \ud83d\ude14 behind \u21a9\ud83c\udd70\u2620 him \ud83d\udc74. I \ud83d\udc41 knocked \ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\udd1b on \ud83d\udd1b doors \ud83d\udeaa\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udcaf, educated \ud83d\udcda people \ud83d\udc68 about \ud83d\udca6 his \ud83d\udca6 policies \ud83d\udca1\ud83d\udd0c\ud83d\ude0f and did the best \ud83d\udc4c I \ud83d\udc41 could to get \ud83c\ude50 people \ud83d\udc6b to vote \ud83d\udd1d for him \ud83d\udc68. When \u23f0 he \ud83d\udc65 was elected \u2714, I \ud83d\udc41 was ecstatic \ud83d\udc8a. In the past \ud83d\udca6, when \ud83c\udf51 I \ud83d\udc41 had supported \ud83d\udc4d candidates \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83d\udc54, it was out of cold \ud83e\udd76\u2744 reason \ud83c\udf1f; because I \ud83d\udc41 thought \ud83d\udcad their policies \ud83d\udca1\ud83d\udd0c\ud83d\ude0f and acumen would result \ud83d\udcb9 in the best \ud83c\udfc6 net \ud83c\udfc0 result \ud83d\udcb9 for this country \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8. But \ud83c\udf51 this was a person \ud83d\udc6b I \ud83d\udc48\ud83d\udc41 could get \ud83d\udd1f excited \ud83d\udc96 about \ud83d\udca6, someone \ud83d\udc64 I \ud83d\udc41 could *believe \ud83d\ude4f* in.   \n  \nWhen \u23f0 it came \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udeb6 time \ud83d\udd50\ud83d\udc4b for his \ud83d\udca6 campaign \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbc\ud83c\udfa4\ud83d\udde3 for a second \u23f1\ud83d\ude1e term \ud83d\udcc4 it was largely \ud83d\udd1d the same. I \ud83d\udc41 had slightly \u270b soured on \ud83d\udd1b him \ud83d\udc68. Granted \ud83d\udc29\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe, he \ud83d\udc68 was not the president \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 I \ud83d\udc41 had hoped \ud83d\ude4f he \ud83d\udc68 would be but \ud83c\udf51\ud83d\udca6\ud83c\udf46 that was not his \ud83d\udca6 fault \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udfff. I \ud83d\udc41 had built \ud83d\udc77\u200d\u2640\ufe0f him \ud83d\udc74 up \u261d to be so huge \ud83d\ude24 in my head \ud83d\udc86\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f it was impossible \u274c for him \ud83d\udc74 to live \ud83d\udc19 up \u2755\u2b06\u203c to expectations \ud83e\udd17. Republican \ud83d\udc18 gridlock in Congress \ud83d\udca9 also \ud83d\udc68 prevented him \ud83d\udc68 from getting \ud83c\ude50 through the policies \ud83d\udca1 he \ud83d\udc68 wanted \ud83d\ude0d. Nevertheless \ud83d\udc4c, I \ud83d\udc41 still \ud83d\ude44 supported \ud83d\udc4d him \ud83d\udc74, still \ud83e\udd1e\ud83d\ude4c volunteered and was still \ud83d\ude44 happy \ud83d\ude0a when \ud83c\udf51 he \ud83d\udc68 won his \ud83d\udca6 second \u23f1 term \ud83d\udcc4.   \n  \nThe problem \u26a0 started \ud83d\udca2 about \ud83d\udca6 three \ud83c\udf57 weeks \ud83d\uddd3\u2049 ago \ud83d\ude05. I \ud83d\udc41 had a dream \ud83d\ude34\ud83d\udcad\ud83d\ude0e involving \ud83d\udc50\ud83d\udd1f Barack \ud83d\udc79\ud83d\udc73, which is not uncommon \ud83d\udc2b for me, I \ud83d\udc65 was working \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\udcaa with him \ud83d\udc74 and Michelle \ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb on \ud83d\udd1b their upcoming \ud83d\udd1c Netflix \ud83d\udcfa show \ud83d\udc40. We were looking \ud83d\udc40 over \ud83d\udd01 demographics \ud83c\udf0d and how they related \ud83e\udd2f\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udc67\u200d\ud83d\udc66 to various \ud83e\udd13\ud83e\uddd0 geographical locations \ud83c\udf46. Without \ud83d\udeab even \ud83c\udf03 realising \ud83d\ude3a it, I \ud83d\udc41 said \ud83d\udcac \"Yeah \ud83d\ude4c, N***er, we should do pretty \ud83d\udc70 well \ud83d\ude24 in (area \u26a0\ud83d\udc80 near \ud83d\ude2f me)\" He \ud83d\udc68 just looked \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc45 at me and stormed \ud83c\udf29 out with Michelle \ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb behind \u21a9 him \ud83d\udc74. I \ud83d\udc41 woke \ud83d\udca4 up \u2b06 and went \ud83c\udfc3\u2642 into the bathroom \ud83d\udebd\ud83d\udec1\ud83d\udebf to splash \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc45 cold \u2744 water \ud83d\udca6 in my face \ud83d\ude00. I \ud83d\udc41 dismissed \ud83e\udd12 it. I \ud83e\udd1e\ud83d\udc41 don't \u274c have a racist \ud83d\udc73\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd14 bone \ud83c\udf56 in my body \ud83d\udc83. This was just one \ud83d\ude24 of those dreams \ud83d\udcad, right \ud83d\udc4c?   \n  \nA week \ud83d\udd50\ud83d\udcc6\ud83d\udcc5 and a half \ud83d\udc80 ago \ud83d\udd19, I \ud83d\udc41 had a similar \ud83d\udc71 experience \ud83c\udf46. This time \ud83d\udd50 I \ud83d\udc65 dreamt \ud83d\udca4 we were going \ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udffd wine-tasting together \ud83d\udc6b\ud83d\udc77\ud83c\udfff. I \ud83d\udc41 don't \u274c remember \ud83d\udcad the lead-up but \ud83c\udf51 I \ud83d\udc65 ended \ud83d\udd1a up \u2b06 saying \ud83d\udde3 something \ud83d\ude05 to the effect \ud83d\udc80 of \"The sommelier said \ud83d\udcac we should be detecting \ud83d\udea8 earthy \ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0e\u26a1 tones \ud83c\udf7a in this wine \ud83c\udf77\ud83e\udd43, but \ud83c\udf51 it's just not registering \ud83d\udcdd with me, N***er\" This time \ud83d\udd50, instead \ud83d\ude94 of storming out he \ud83d\udc65 replied \ud83d\udd01, very \ud83d\udc4c sternly \ud83e\udd24 \"Why \u2049\ud83e\udd14 did you \ud83d\udc48 feel \ud83d\ude01 that was an appropriate \ud83d\udd1e thing \ud83d\udcf4 to say \ud83d\udcac\ud83d\udc71\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udca6?\" I \ud83d\udc41 began \ud83d\udd18 to stutter and explain \ud83d\udce2\ud83d\ude26 it was an accident \ud83d\ude48 but \ud83c\udf51 I \ud83d\udc41 had once again \u274c\ud83d\ude2c woken \ud83d\ude24 up \u261d.   \n  \nThe most recent \ud83d\udd5b incident \ud83e\udd24\ud83c\udf66\ud83d\ude05 was last \u267f night \ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf11. I \ud83d\udc41 dreamt \ud83d\udca4 I \ud83d\udc41 was at a family \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udc67\u200d\ud83d\udc66 barbecue \ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude0e with the Obamas \ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udfff, just his \ud83d\udca6 family \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udc67\u200d\ud83d\udc66 and mine \u26cf.

One issue I find as someone who is not to keen on french people is how often times I feel there is no escape from being around them. Went to my friends and his twins birthday recently (it was outside and we're all full vaccinated) we're a bunch of 20 somethings so it was of course drinking, smoking weed, music, the whole shebang until his twins friend brought in a French Friend... yes a Frenchie... had to turn the music into french, stop speaking english until it had to leave a couple hours later.\n\nI wanted to start swimming as an exercise with my gf because she loves swimming and exercising with her helps motivate me because I'm lazy af when it comes to it. OOPS SORRY! Every single pool is brimming with french people :) guess you're just gonna have to come in at 6am or 9pm if you want some peace and quiet. Uhm, no thanks.\n\nI wanted to try going to a nudist camp group thing with my gf because I thought it might be an interesting experience for us. OOPS SORRY! Their all french friendly! No thanks.\n\nWanna go to burning man? French. Wanna go shopping? Frenchies. Wanna go to the park? French people. Wanna go to a shooting range? People from france. Library? French person. Circus? frenchies. Gym? french humans. Waterpark? a person from the country known as \"france\".\n\nDEAR GOD CAN I JUST PLEASE BE **ANYWHERE** WITH JUST FRANCOPHOBES PLEASE. PLEEEEAAASE. I want to be able to swear, talk about inappropriate shit with my friends, and do things in peace... The ONLY place you can be without frenchies is a bad restaurent ... that's mainly it...\n\nI'm not saying I think French people should be banned from everywhere, but dear lord I wish there was more non french only places and activities. Even for francophiles to have a break and exist without French people around them for 5 minutes.\n\nAnyway long rant, going to bed.",

One issue I find as someone who is not to keen on french people is how often times I feel there is no escape from being around them. Went to my friends and his twins birthday recently (it was outside and we're all full vaccinated) we're a bunch of 20 somethings so it was of course drinking, smoking weed, music, the whole shebang until his twins friend brought in a French Friend... yes a Frenchie... had to turn the music into french, stop speaking english until it had to leave a couple hours later.\n\nI wanted to start swimming as an exercise with my gf because she loves swimming and exercising with her helps motivate me because I'm lazy af when it comes to it. OOPS SORRY! Every single pool is brimming with french people :) guess you're just gonna have to come in at 6am or 9pm if you want some peace and quiet. Uhm, no thanks.\n\nI wanted to try going to a nudist camp group thing with my gf because I thought it might be an interesting experience for us. OOPS SORRY! Their all french friendly! No thanks.\n\nWanna go to burning man? French. Wanna go shopping? Frenchies. Wanna go to the park? French people. Wanna go to a shooting range? People from france. Library? French person. Circus? frenchies. Gym? french humans. Waterpark? a person from the country known as \"france\".\n\nDEAR GOD CAN I JUST PLEASE BE **ANYWHERE** WITH JUST FRANCOPHOBES PLEASE. PLEEEEAAASE. I want to be able to swear, talk about inappropriate shit with my friends, and do things in peace... The ONLY place you can be without frenchies is a bad restaurent ... that's mainly it...\n\nI'm not saying I think French people should be banned from everywhere, but dear lord I wish there was more non french only places and activities.

That is the power of my father, a culmination of flawless, supreme logic and a perfect knowledge of the law. You will lose this case, your money, and your life.

            "\nI hate, hate, hate coffee culture.  I can't stand people saying, \"Oh, I can't do anything until I get a warm cup of coffee in me.\"  Shut up.  Being a former smoker, I recognize the addiction and subsequent irritability of coffee drinkers and it bugs me to no end that caffeine gets glossed over as an addictive substance, or even fucking celebrated to some extent.  Those people who brag about needing 5 expresso shots (sorry, esssspresso) a day need an intervention, not a nod of approval.  Seriously, all you coffee drinkers are the biggest group of fucking enablers I've ever seen.\n\nWhen doing group activities, like camping, I loathe waiting for others to start their day after a morning ritual that hogs counter space, or propane, or dirties good clean water.  I hate the sleepy look in peoples' eyes as they grasp their cup of stimulant that they wouldn't need had they never started drinking it in the first place.\n\nThere's an entire fucking cupboard in my kitchen dedicated to stupid coffee mugs and their dumb sayings staring back at me despite living in a household where only one person drinks coffee.  Why?  And the dishes.  Since nearly every person drinks coffee, inevitably us non-coffee drinkers are going to have to clean up after your morning fix.  Seriously, I've done so many goddamned cleanings of coffee mugs if I had a dime for every one, I'd probably have enough for a Starbucks franchise.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on Starbucks.  Godamned devil business slanging legal crack for decades, hogging good real estate so addicts have a place to slurp up and get their morning shit in before work.\n\nLastly, I despise the amalgam of ways people cook up their black powder and then talk up the flavor as though it tastes like something other than a dirty sock.  That's your addiction speaking.  You want to know why you need to dump half an udder of cream in your cup?  It's because cream is fucking delicious and when combined with your filthy water, makes it somewhat bearable.\n\nAnd your stupid machines that creak and groan through the quietude of my morning can go fuck themselves.  Talk about a waste of counter-space.  And the spent black stimulant granules that spill over onto the counter, staining the grout drives me nuts.\n\nAnd lastly, the goddamned keurig cups or whatever they're called are one of humanity's worst inventions, sandwiched between Glyphosate and Joe Rogan.  At least the meth addicts don't deposit a plastic remnant that will persist in landfills for hundreds of years spreading micro-plastics into our environment every time they need to get high.",

            "Oh my bad, am I to get your permission before I give my opinion? Really, what made you think this isolated comment displaying my own opinion and criticism of a media you had no part in creating was at all directed to you? And even if it was, why would I have to ask you? You gain or lose absolutely nothing by reading my comment, except for a bit of time. However you cannot even use that argument because you took the time to reply to my comment. Tell me, filthy.memes_v1, how did this comment effect you? How does it concern you? Is it that the senseless hollow comedy you have grown to love and adore until you mature and realise it\u2019s fucking retarded is under attack by some random person on the internet? Or is it that you believe every opinion posted on the internet is required to have your permission? I don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s permission to post my opinion. I mean this very sediment of people saying \u201cdidn\u2019t ask\u201d to things that don\u2019t require permission to say is not only stupid but also incredibly easy to counter. You realise I could just say \u201cdidn\u2019t ask\u201d back to your comment and it would actually carry way more weight because your comment was directed towards me, while mine was not directed towards you? Do you think the universe revolves around you? Is your urge to reply \u201cdidn\u2019t ask\u201d to things that never concerned you an egotistical thing? I mean it would make sense with a name like \u201cfilthy.memes_v1\u201d. Is it because you are constantly made fun of and entirely alone in real life, and you need to go onto the internet to grasp at ways to make yourself feel in control and superior? Inflate your ego to overcompensate for it being so fragile? And I know what you\u2019re going to reply with, or at least what your first instinct is. \u201cDidn\u2019t ask.\u201d And I\u2019m here to tell you now it ain\u2019t funny, it\u2019s just predictable.Don't care didn't ask. Literally nobody mentioned a word not even a mumble of anyone who asked. Perhaps delete the message or stop at this attempt. I can see your suggestion was benign but I literally searched the entire galaxy to find out who ask. You may say \"its a way of being social\", but that is false. Perhaps get to know me a little better buster, otherwise I do not care. I bet everyone who heard that didn't even get a glimpse of your message. Perhaps establish a discord community on what you asked and research into it, bringing your very uncalled suggestion in here is idiotic.After finishing his edit, he begins laughing heartily as he saves the changes to his previously tolerable comment. His chuckling comes to a steady end as he fully relaxes on his chair, closing his eyes. Suddenly, his eyes shoot open and his face violently straightens. He stands up, and fully extends his arms straight and outwards to his sides. His body begins slowly levitating upwards, seemingly breaking the very fundamental rules of reality itself. As he goes against all logic and reason with his vehement hovering, his eyelids drop and rise up again to reveal godly lights beaming from his eye sockets. A disembodied heavenly choir resonates from the abruptly omniscient man. A deific shock wave is fiercely expelled from his body, leveling his house and the surrounding neighborly architecture unworthy of his divine presence. Screams are heard from all directions, from both his family, neighbors, and bystanders walking by. Before continuing his ascent, his lips part to deliver one final message to the mere mortals surrounding him.\n\n\"I HAVE ACHIEVED, MAXIMUM, COMEDIC, PERFORMANCE.\"\n\nHe looks up, and with one swift movement, launches to the heavens, to properly acquire his ownership of the universe itself.You don't know me, but I highly advise you read this thoroughly and in its entirety.

You are not to answer their calls, texts, etc. Is that understood?\n\nIt is not in your best interest to ignore me. I have a very bad temper and you do not want to see it get away from me. You will send me some sort of confirmation that you are receiving my messages and that you will comply fully.\n\nI have a Tor browser, plenty of disposable income, and all the free time in the world, kiddo.

We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Kanye. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then they'll go inside, pen a brief missive to their departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without their one true platonic love.",

            "\nSo I just upvoted your post. Wondering why? Please consult the criteria below:\n\n\u2705You done a racism.\n\n\u2705You done a sexism.\n\n\u2705You done a bi-erasure.\n\n\u2705You heckin disrespected sex work.\n\nUpvoting is my weapon of justice, and the upvote button is my bullet. Pow.\n\nSo what does this mean? The amount of karma (points) on your post and Reddit account has increased by one.\n\nWhy did you do this?\n\nThere are several reasons I may deem a post to be worthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Rudeness towards Other Redditors,\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Spreading incorrect information,\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.\n\nAm I banned from the Reddit?\n\nNo - not yet. But you should.\n\nI don't believe my post deserved an upvote. Can you un-upvote it?\n\nSure,  mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances Will I undo  an upvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private  message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs  within several years. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of upvote  appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.\n\nHow can I prevent this from happening in the future?\n\nAccept the upvote and move on. I will continue to issue upvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Mods are gay.",

Any opinion I hold is objectively correct and as a result, any other opinions are wrong. Guess what? You happen to hold the wrong one! I hope you know that your opinion is now illegal. I have contacted the FBI, CIA, the NSA, the navy seals, secret service, and your mom! You'll be sorry you ever shared your opinions, by the time you're reading this, you'll be done for. Nature will punish you, humanity will punish you, space will punish you. We decided just to make sure we'll nuke your house from orbit.

            "This is scary. The fact that all the comments I see here about it are uniformly cheering it on is even more scary.\n\nFirst, I'm anti-fascist, anti-Trump, anti-racist, and pro-BLM. I voted for Obama three times and volunteered for him.\n\nWith that out of the way, how can anyone who's anti-fascist and pro-democracy cheer this on? It's completely insane.\n\nWe now have a tiny handful of megacorporations run by megabillionaires who are opaquely deciding what speech we're allowed to consume. Why are people not only accepting of this but actually cheering for it?\n\nThe real problem isn't the idea that a business can choose with whom it does business. In general, I think that's a fine idea, provided those business aren't discriminating on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, etc. The real problem here is the fact that we have an oligarchy of megacorporations and megabillionaires. If we had a truly free marketplace, where there were hundreds of cloud providers, and they didn't act in lockstep with each other, there'd be no problem. Cloud A would decide they just don't like Parler, don't want to do business with them, and boot them. They'd just head over to cloud B and everything's fine. \n\nThe problem is that there are two companies who, acting together, can prevent you from having a mobile app. There are six companies who, if they act in lockstep, can prevent you from using cloud infrastructure. There are similarly small numbers of companies who can prevent you from effectively caching content, processing payments, and all of the other stuff necessary to communicate to a non-trivial audience on the Internet.\n\nAnd, we now clearly see that these companies do act in lockstep. These megabillionaires' interests are aligned, and they are not our interests, even if we happen to be on the same page about hating Trump, nazis, and political violence. Why are you confident they won't use this power to silence speech you do like? Say, speech about forming workers' unions, or using alternative services to theirs?\n\nThat's the problem with free speech: when it's infringed on, it'll always be abhorrent speech that infringed on first. Because 99.9% of people hate nazis, so making nazis STFU is something that's very attractive to almost everyone. But if you give someone the power to do that, they'll have that same power to make anyone else STFU for any reason they see fit, too.\n\nHere are the arguments I always see about why this OK and why I think they don't work:\n\n 1. Free speech is about governments, private companies can do whatever they like. \n\n \u2022 No, the 1st amendment is strictly about governments. Free speech is a broader concept. If the government permits any and all speech, but six corporations acting in unison have the power to effectively silence you, and they act in concert to do so in opaque ways, then that's absolutely a free speech issue. We've lost the ability to communicate freely: it just happens that a corporate oligarchy did it, not the government, but the consequences are the same.\n\n 2. Free speech doesn't mean speech without consequences. \n\n \u2022 That's correct, but it's also not the argument. People on Parler or whatever service should be held accountable for breaking the law there. Incitement to violence and conspiracy to commit terrorism are already very illegal. We should not expect (or want) the megacorporations to unilaterally and opaquely enforce these laws, we should expect and want or government to enforce them. This is because when our government enforces them, they have to prove their case in court, and they're accountable to our system of checks and balances; they can't make arbitrary and opaque decisions completely unaccountably like Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos can.\n\n 3. It's incitement to violence. \n\n \u2022 Incitement to violence is illegal. It's a job for our legal system, not Mark Zuckerberg. Also, when you have a platform with user-generated content, in general, we don't consider you legally responsible for what the users write. You can easily find countless incitements to violence on twitter, facebook, and reddit, from both the left and the right. Why isn't the reddit app being removed from the App Store? Why isn't reddit being booted from AWS? Yes, reddit has moderation policies aimed at preventing this content, but they're clearly ineffective. Parler also had moderation policies about it (also clearly ineffective).\n\n \u2022 That's how can you make arbitrary enforcement decisions while pretending to be upholding your policies: if you write a policy that's impossible to adhere to, and then selectively enforce it against only those you don't like. This is what we saw in the Jim Crow south (and continuing to the present day): make a shitload of impossible-to-follow laws, and then only enforce them against black people. That's bad. Fight against this, even when it starts out being used against people you don't like.\n\n 4. But Masterpiece bakery (the gay wedding cake case). \n\n \u2022 Did you like the outcome of that case? Did you think it correct and good? If not, then why do you think it's correct and good here? That aside, there's not a ton of parallels. I'm extremely against the idea that any business can turn customers away on the basis of their sexual orientation, which was part of the question in that case. But regardless of that, Masterpiece bakery isn't part of an effectively monopoly, as Amazon, Google, and Apple are.\n\n 5. It just means they'll have to communicate another way instead, they're not being prevented from communicating at all. \n\n \u2022 The past few days have proven this to be the lie it always clearly was. Twitter bans Trump, and people said, \"well, he can just use Parler if we wants.\" Trump says something about using Parler, and then the next day, Parler is completely wiped off the Internet.",

            "My awesome story\n\nI keep having dreams where I call Obama the N-word and I want it to stop\n\nThis is a throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\nSome background. Politically, I've been a Democrat my entire life and an Obama supporter for as long as I can remember. I volunteered for John Kerry's presidential campaign back in 2004 which is where first registered on my map. I watched his speech at the DNC was was instantly enamoured.\n\nWhen he announced his candidacy for president in 2007, immediately threw my weight behind him. I knocked on doors, educated people about his policies and did the best I could to get people to vote for him. When he was elected, I was ecstatic. In the past, when I had supported candidates, it was out of cold reason; because I thought their policies and acumen would result in the best net result for this country. But this was a person I could get excited about, someone I could believe in.\n\nWhen it came time for his campaign for a second term it was largely the same. I had slightly soured on him. Granted, he was not the president I had hoped he would be but that was not his fault. I had built him up to be so huge in my head it was impossible for him to live up to expectations. Republican gridlock in Congress also prevented him from getting through the policies he wanted. Nevertheless, I still supported him, still volunteered and was still happy when he won his second term.\n\nThe problem started about three weeks ago. I had a dream involving Barack, which is not uncommon for me, I was working with him and Michelle on their upcoming Netflix show. We were looking over demographics and how they related to various geographical locations. Without even realising it, I said \"Yeah, N***er, we should do pretty well in (area near me)\" He just looked at me and stormed out with Michelle behind him. I woke up and went into the bathroom to splash cold water in my face. I dismissed it. I don't have a racist bone in my body. This was just one of those dreams, right?\n\nA week and a half ago, I had a similar experience. This time I dreamt we were going wine-tasting together. I don't remember the lead-up but I ended up saying something to the effect of \"The sommelier said we should be detecting earthy tones in this wine, but it's just not registering with me, N***er\" This time, instead of storming out he replied, very sternly \"Why did you feel that was an appropriate thing to say?\" I began to stutter and explain it was an accident but I had once again woken up.\n\nThe most recent incident was last night. I dreamt I was at a family barbecue with the Obamas, just his family and mine. He was manning the grill and i was speaking to Michelle while the children played with each other (I know Sasha and Malia are adults now but I still think of them as children) I said to Michelle very politely \"excuse me for one moment\" and marched right up to Barack and tapped him on the shoulder. He turned around to look and me and I just said the word and nothing else. I can write off this happening once or twice in my dreams but three separate events is too much.\n\nI don't know what to do. I don't want to do this. Every time it happens my work suffers the next day. I've started lying to my wife saying I've been having nightmares but I'm not sure she fully believes it. Lately, I've been worrying I might start saying it in my sleep and she could hear. I'm at my wits end and I want it to stop.",

This is due to the fact that you\u2019ll never know if you don\u2019t go, nor you will shine if you don\u2019t glow.\n\nFor you see, you are, at this moment, an All-Star, so get  your game on, and proceed to go play, indeed, you\u2019re an All-Star, get the show on, which would entitled you to get paid. That would mean that all that glitters, is indeed gold, and that only shooting stars, can participate in the process of breaking the mold.",

The next day proffy comes walking in to class with the pile of tests, a brown paper bag, and a baking dish. Walks to the lectern sets the test down and the bag next to them in the dish. Then proceeds to light the little brown bag on fire. The class of course goes silent. The professor then exclaims 'I have on this desk, two flaming piles of dog shit! One I collected from my dog this morning, WHAT THE HELL is your excuse for the other one? Silence....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbsolute legend.
