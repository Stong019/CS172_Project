A lot \ud83c\udf51 of people \ud83d\udc68 come \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\ude29 up \u261d to me and they ask \ud83d\ude4f me.

We've \ud83d\udc6b\ud83d\udc6c\ud83d\udc6d had almost \ud83d\udca6 eight 8\ufe0f\u20e3 years \ud83d\uddd3 of the worst \ud83d\udc79 kind \ud83d\ude41 of math \ud83d\udcc8 you \ud83d\udc48 can imagine \ud83e\udd14. Oh \ud83d\ude40 my god \ud83d\ude07\ud83e\uddd6\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\uded0, I \ud83d\udc41 can't \ud83d\udeab believe \ud83c\udf08 it. Addition \u2795 and subtraction \u2796 of the 1s \u2757 the 2s \u270c and the 3s \u2b55\u2139\ud83d\udd58. Its terrible \u2714. Its just terrible \u2714. Look \ud83d\udc40, if you \ud83d\udc49 want \ud83d\ude0b to know \ud83d\udcad what 2+2 \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\ude34\ud83d\udc80 is, do you \ud83d\udc48 want \ud83d\ude0b to know \ud83e\udd14 what 2+2 \ud83d\udc4c is? I'll \ud83d\udcdd tell \ud83d\udcac you \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb. First \ud83e\udd47 of all \ud83d\udcaf the number \ud83d\udd22\u261d 2 \ud83d\udd5d, by the way \u2195 I \ud83d\udc41 love \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc8f\ud83d\udc6b the number \ud83d\udd22\u261d 2 \u270c\ud83c\udffb. It's probably \ud83d\ude3b my favorite \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udcaf number \ud83d\udd22, no \ud83d\ude45 it is my favorite \ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udd16 number \ud83d\udd22\u261d. You \ud83d\udc49 know \u274c\ud83e\udd14 what, it's probably \ud83d\ude3b more like \ud83d\ude04 the number \ud83d\udd22 two \u270c\ud83c\udffc but \ud83c\udf51 with a lot \ud83c\udf51 of zeros \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f behind \u21a9\ud83d\udd26\ud83d\udca1 it. A lot \ud83c\udf51. If I'm \ud83d\udc4c being honest \ud83d\ude07, I \ud83d\udc65 mean \ud83d\ude0f, if I'm \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\ude02 being honest \ud83d\ude07. I \ud83d\udc41 like \ud83d\ude04 a lot \ud83d\udcaf of zeros \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Except \u274c for Marco Rubio, now he's \ud83d\udc68 a zero \ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffb that I \ud83d\udc41 don't \ud83d\ude45\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udeab\ud83c\udf46 like \ud83d\udc96. Though \ud83e\udd14, I \ud83d\udc41 probably \ud83d\ude3b shouldn't say \ud83d\udde3 that. He's \ud83d\udc68 a nice \ud83d\udd25 guy \ud83d\udc68 but \ud83c\udf51 he's \ud83d\udc65 like \ud83d\udc96, '10101000101', on \ud83d\udd1b and on \ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udca6, like \ud83d\udc96 that. He's \ud83d\udc65 like \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude44 a computer \ud83d\udcbb! You \ud83d\udc49 know \ud83e\udd14 what I \ud83d\udc41 mean \ud83d\ude0f?

So, we have all \ud83d\udcaf these numbers \ud83d\udd22\u261d and we can add \u2795 them and subtract \u2796\ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\udc6b them and add \u2795 them. TIMES \ud83d\udd50 them even \ud83c\udf03. Did you \ud83d\udc48 know \ud83d\udcad that? We can times \ud83d\udd50\ud83d\udd5b\ud83c\udf46 them OR divide \u2797 them, they don't \ud83d\udeab tell \ud83d\udde3 you \ud83d\udc48 that, and I'll \ud83e\udd2b tell \ud83d\udde3 you \ud83d\udc48, no \ud83d\udeab one \ud83d\ude24 is better \ud83c\udfb0 at the order \ud83d\udcf2\ud83d\udcf1 of operations \ud83d\udd2a\u2694 than me. You \ud83d\udc48 wouldn't \u2702\u274c believe \ud83d\ude4f it. That I \ud83d\udc41 can tell \ud83d\udde3 you \ud83d\udc48.

Christians chose not to (for what ever reason). \nCircumcision is seen as an identity to represent who we are as a 'nation of believers' - comes down to the covenant Abraham makes with God. Just as people are born into a culture, language, ethnicity. For Muslims and Jews it is seen as just that, and is a part of us. It clearly doesnt impact the penis in expelling byproducts or reproduction. As the insider joke goes, we breed like rabbits...\n\n(I wish to clarify - You can be uncircumcised and still be a believer, circumcision does not define you as a believer.)\n\nAlthough the game has the freedom to do what it does, i do feel indirectly it also shows real insecurities and anxieties about men, men's sexual health and how men feel their genitals define them as a person. I suppose it didnt help when the USA encouraged circumcision as a means to stop masturbation which among some Christian folk sex or anything related was seen as a 'sin'. Perhaps the largest first world nation with circumcision rates.\n\n(I mean no offense to any person reading and request you accept my sincere apology as it was not my intention)\n\nThanks for reading. Please feel free to comment, i love learning and listening to peoples views and opinions.",

You want to scare me? OOH, big bad navy seal. 300 kills. Your such a bad ass! OH, I am SO sorry to have provoked your wrath! You should ask yourself, did I DIRECTLY challenge you? Did I TELL YOU SPECIFICALLY that I WANTED to beat your ass? No I did NOT! I said I was a pacifist. I even said I DON\"T want to fight you. You should read the posts more carefully before you decide to lash out hatefully and threaten me. This was simply about how I don't (lift? No, I do not lift things, if your talking about weights or something) or exercise, I don't care to, and I don't like bacon. You took this to a WHOLE other level. I was just defending myself from YOUR spiteful comment where you made fun of me for simply not liking bacon and that I don't lift weights. You, and that other buddy of yours, should calm down. And you do not scare me. I've come close to death a few times, and I'm not scared of it. I accept it. I've been robbed before, and have felt the blade against my neck. And I've been fucked with and threatened my WHOLE life from ALOT of other people, even from my own dad! He is tough and unforgiving. I grew up in a military family. My dad graduated from West Point (Lt. Col) and fought in Vietnam, for your freedoms and mine, like that of freedom of speech (be it threatening, hateful, and mocking like yours) and mine (where I was simply standing up for myself when you made fun of me). And I am not a kiddo, I'm 30. And it's funny how you click \"like\" on your own comments. How egotistical. I'm done now.\n\n****\n\n**Along with:**\n\n****\n\nuhm, who gives a shit about how many kills you have or what type of training you have? i'm pretty sure chris kylde was the best sniper in the navy seals (with not even 300, no seal has 300 btw). fyi it isn't fucking spelled gorilla warfare you stupid piece of shit. anyways let's get on to the next point, you have a secret network of spies? yeah congrats, but i'm using a vpn right now so your entire network is fucking useless. you can't even ddos me, let alone \"wipe me off the face of this earth.\" btw name those 700 ways you can kill me with your bare hands so i can report it to the fucking fbi and get your ass dishonorably discharged. and no, you dont have access to the entire arsenal of the usmc. those weapons are only used for combat as well as the vehicles etc etc. i never made a \"clever\" comment in order to invoke this type of fucking response. are you being serious right now? i'm really not afraid of you and honestly if you were serious i would fight you (knowing that you wouldn't bring a gun o something). all in all, go fuck yourself. you are a lying sack of shit and if you are in the navy seals. you are a disgrace because there is a reason they call seals \"silent assassins.\"",
            "Did you just think that you could fucking fool me with that comment of yours? I've searched your name up in the Navy SEAL database and you have never even graduated BUD/S, hell, even served in the Armed Forces. If you were actually a Navy SEAL, then you actually know how to spell guerrilla, you fucking moron. And you say you are the top sniper in the entire US Armed Forces and have over 300 confirmed kills. If that were true, then why the fuck is Chris Kyle a household name and you aren't? And plus he only had 160 kills. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. Plus why the fuck would you say you have a secret network of spies yet you just revealed that you had your secret network of spies? Are you a fucking idiot? If you can kill someone seven-hundred different ways, then list them all, I bet you can't even come up with seven. And if you had access to the entire US Marine Corps arsenal, then why the fuck did you just say you were in the Navy SEALs earlier? If only you could have done your research prior to posting your little \u201cclever\u201d comment, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn\u2019t, you goddamn idiot.",

I\u2019ll have you know I graduated top of my class at Springfield Bible College, and I\u2019ve been involved in numerous secret mission trips in Capital City, and I have over 300 confirmed baptisms. I am trained in the Old Testament and I\u2019m the top converter in the entire church mission group. You are nothing to me but just another heathen. I will cast your sins out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before in Heaven, mark my diddily-iddilly words. You think you can get away with saying that blasphemy to me over the Internet? Think again, friendarino. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of evangelists across Springfield and your IP is being traced by God right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggorino. The storm that wipes out the diddily little thing you call your life of sin. You\u2019re going to Church, kiddily-widdily. Jesus can be anywhere, anytime, and he can turn you to the Gospel in over infinity ways, and that\u2019s just with his bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in preaching to nonbelievers, but I have access to the entire dang- diddily Bible collection of the Springfield Bible College and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your sins away off the face of the continent, you diddily-doo satan-worshipper. If only you could have known what holy retribution your little \u201cclever\u201d comment was about to bring down upon you from the Heavens, maybe you would have held your darn-diddily-fundgearoo tongue. But you couldn\u2019t, you didn\u2019t, and now you\u2019re clean of all your sins, you widdillo-skiddily neighborino. I will sing hymns of praise all over you and you will drown in the love of Christ. You\u2019re farn-foodily- flank-fiddily reborn, kiddo-diddily.",

            "I fucking remember this! This guy had a whole mental breakdown after! People kept telling him to cool down, it was a copypasta, they even explained in detail what that is, but he kept ranting about his PTSD and posting his address and at some point *begging* the OP to just kill him because it should have been him and not his friend who died in 'Nam. In the end he just kept saying \"I'm done, you guys win, I'm nothing\" and stuff like that. Kind of a wild ride.\n\nEDIT: Also remembered that he went on racist rants about how he loved killing Muslim kids over seas. It was Iran or Afghanistan, not 'Nam, my mistake. So yeah, not exactly a nice guy since he went on huge tangent about \"greasy-lipped spics\" and \"nasty terrorists\" in his country.",

That\u2019s an insane number must of taken decades but for a guy who took that many life\u2019s over such a long period of time it very odd you can\u2019t spell Al-Qaeda? What WTF is \u2018Al-Quaeda\u2019? I mean it\u2019s just a spelling mistake right? Sure.. But if I was that person for months or YEARS at a time Im pretty sure that name would be burnt into my mind and would know the spelling but you over did it at 300\u2026 Some of the top in the world have 50 ish etc no where near 300 lol\n\n    I am trained in gorilla warfare and I\u2019m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces\n\nRight so keeping count \u2018top of class in navy seals\u2019 before and now us armed forces?

            "Greek life is totally different from school to school, fraternity to fraternity, and even year to year. At my smallish engineering school, we had stereotypical fraternities, service fraternities, and gamer fraternities. I've been out of college for some time, but I'll never forget the lasting friendships and memories I made. I found my fraternity was a nice balance with a focus on making members better people. I'm sorry to hear so many people have bad experiences with Greek life, and I promise not all greek life is stereotypical. Greek life kept me motivated and focused on powering through college. 10/10 experience as long as you find a genuine group of guys to make the bad times good and the good times better.",

Allen school of computer science at engineering at UW need to understand is that rubbing our major into everyone\u2019s face isn\u2019t just something we do. It\u2019s ingrained into our lives.

After joining the University of Washington, worshipping the tech CEO\u2019s and making my internship my whole personality became a new norm that was ingrained into my life. We do not have any wellbeing. It has removed us from society. There have even been studies that show how stacking up on the tech merch to flex my DE Shaw sweatpants, my Microsoft socks, my Amazon headband and my GoldmanSachs gloves that I hoarded from the career fair to seek validity in the CSE undergrad lounge is for our wellbeing.

He showed us his taser marks on his chest proudly, where the two metal prods penetrated. We cringed but tried to hide it, we said but why? Isn't that far for hazing, like I get the brotherhood thing and hazing is a tradition for a reason. But why let someone do that to you. He was mad we were poo pooing on his frat, we really were not trying to. We backtracked. But then I asked jokingly did they spank you? He answered yes, with a paddle and all. Maybe it's me but that's such a sexual thing, I'd not do that shit for anything. Its the principle as well, its making you someones little bitch, I'm not a particularly prideful person but nah, the payoff is being deemed cool. But if you need to be cool you prob aren't cool. Why do frats have all this homoerotic shit. I mean if you're gay have a party, that's cool no problem. But if you aren't wtf, you definitely know some of those elder brothers be closeted with all the gay shit injected. Like there are worse examples, far worse that im not gonna curse you with. My point is frats are gay. But not in the regular ok way, in the \"gay\" gay way. I mean having to stuff heroin in your rectum, like yeah the high feels good but like you could just snort it.

It was my life too.\n\nBut since March, I\u2019ve left my house four times. Once was just a drive, and twice was picking up takeout.

            "Edit: thanks for the gold kinda stranger I didn\u2019t expect this post to blow up! My life started growing up in a small farm in northern Kansas. My father was a farmer and my mother was a cashier in our local town down the dirt road. We didn\u2019t have much and income was very little, my best toy I got growing up was a pig bladder blown up like a balloon that I could play around with between me and my two brothers. At the age of 11 things started getting tougher in my house life due to my fathers drinking problem as it was not a good harvest that year. Like his father before him once he was done working he would come home and drink but unlike his father he wouldn\u2019t beat us unless we messed up, his father left him and his mother to fend for themselves after world war 2 though so he had it tougher than me growing up. One time my father did drink too much and he hit my little brother Jamey. Jamey didn\u2019t know what to do and ran away during the night during a storm. The entire family was out looking for him but we never saw Jamey again. This made my father drink more and lead him to take his life when I was at the age of 16. My older brother and me had to completely take over the farm with the help of our mom quitting her job as a cashier, life got very hard from here on out. We got a break when I was 18 with a good harvest we were able to save up some money. I was able to move out at the age of 21 and into a larger city in Tennessee. It was hard leaving the family as my ma was getting older but my older brother completely took over the farm and even expanded it into a more profitable work. I began working in what I was good at, repairing mechanics. I was a hard worker and moved up in my chain of work easily within my town. I dated aroun\u2019 a bit but never settled down with anyone I would write home about for my first few years. When I was 26 I got a call from my ma, my brother was working with some machinery on the farm and got his hand caught in it and heavily damaged. I had to come home and help with the farm, at the time I had attained a high position as a senior mechanic within an auto shop and sometimes worked on the side with repairing electronics. I went home and had to help with the farm for a year, ma wasn\u2019t doing good at all. She passed the next year due to kidney disease. My brother eventually recovered and I returned to Tennessee, I attempted to return to my position but due to the time I was out I had been long replaced. I had to begin to work from the bottom again when I had a client come in, she was the most beautiful woman I ever seen in Tennessee with gorgeous brown hair. Nice to say that we hit it off pretty well, within a few weeks we were dating. I can say that she was one of the best things to have happened to me in my life. At the age of 30 I married her and my first child was on the way then. I had returned to my previous position and bought a nice house near the mountains of Tennessee. At the age of 34 my second child was born. My two kids are now both in high school, one a freshman, another a Senior. I continued my career into more electronics working on computers and fixing them. In 2013 while googling how to fix a small problem with a motherboard I found a strange site named reddit.com, this website had all the answers I needed and a community always ready to help. I\u2019ve been on the site ever since. As you can see recently, I commented on this thread and some kind stranger gave me gold. Thank you again kind stranger!",
