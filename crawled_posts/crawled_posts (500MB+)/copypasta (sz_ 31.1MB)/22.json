            "\"Oh Cummy!\" The r/copypasta user shouted. The entire world, knowing what was about to commence, all went into hiding. All world leaders were evacuated. Military and police forces from all over the world showed up to his house. Televisions stopped programming to let people know that the world was meeting it's inevitable fate. They were told to pray. He was about to cum. Military and police forces weren't enough. As a last resort, countries were sending nuclear missiles to his house. But it was too late. As people send their last prayers to everyone they know and love, he came. He came so much, that it vaporized everything and everyone on the planet. It made Nagasaki look like a birthday party in comparison. No bunker or shelter was able to withstand anything of this magnitude. Everything was destroyed. No human, animal, or living creature was left. Buildings were destroyed left and right. Natural disasters were scattered. Volcanoes erupted, tsunamis and hurricanes were formed, and earthquakes and wildfires happened everywhere. The planet slowly but surely turned into a ball of lavadue to the insane increase of global warming and natural disasters. Nothing remained but lava and magma. All of mankind's history and creations were gone. All thanks to CummyBot2000.",

But she left the lobby. I was crying and covered in my own cum, but I remembered that I could find recent teammates in the ubiplay friends tab. I frantically closed down siege and opened the tab, to find out she had TTV IN HER NAME!!! She was streaming, and only had 100 viewers!!! The competition was low, so I made the first move and donated my months rent to her. I was already about to pre. She read my donation in the chat. God this is the happiest I\u2019ve been in a long time. I did a little research, and found out where she goes to school, but I am a little nervous to talk to her in person, and need support. Any advice before my Uber gets to her middle school?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "Okay all, here\u2019s the sequel. Full transparency, I have added suggestions from the community to this one so it\u2019s probably about 85% my own original work and 15% fan submissions. \n\nI want to thank everyone for their feedback and I want to thank the audience for their support, without you, art has no point.\n\n-\n\nEDIT TO ANSWER SOME COMMON QUESTIONS\n\n\u201cBen\u201d was one of the community suggested ones. Had lots of downvotes but something about it just caught me off guard so I found it funny. It\u2019s inclusion is a meta joke. Thanks to u/freeagent10 for the suggestion, it\u2019s one of the most popular ones on this list. \n\n\u201cBaby Batter\u201d is not there. That\u2019s because it was in the first list. And then people were saying what about \u201cBaby Gravy\u201d but it\u2019s like I had Baby Batter and I\u2019m not putting both in because they\u2019re too similar. So this time it\u2019s \u201cBaby Bullets\u201d and I\u2019m still not putting \u201cBaby Gravy\u201d in.\n\nHere\u2019s the first one: https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/is3736/101_words_for_cum/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf",

            "Ex-Muslim here: An interesting fact, call it a dissection if cultural history, is that the burka, niq\u0101b, and hijab *(from most concealing to least)* predates Islam by about 500 years. Its roots can be traced back to as far back as the Byzantine empire. Its use was born of utility rather than religious reasons, as it was an effective way to cool down from the sweltering heat the more arid regions in the Mediterranean are infamous for.\n\n  Disclaimer: most Islamic scholars agree that none of the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s teachings call for an obligatory adoption of the veil. This is seen in the passage that records his dialogue with a woman on the significance of the veil, where he is emphasizing its benefits, it clearly reads as an endorsement rather than an divinely authoritative commandment.\n\n  Unsurprisingly, there are *still* some Muslims that aren\u2019t aware of this fact, and so in certain Islamic majority countries, the social zeitgeist is that failure to adhere to the \u2018proper\u2019 adorning of the veil is at best a social mores, and at worst a religious offence worthy of being chastised.\n\n  I swear there was some folktale I read as a kid that gave an origin story for the veil but I can\u2019t recall it\u2019s name; it was apart of anthology I believe.\n\nWow this was longer than what I intended when I first started typing, autism is one hell of a drug.",

All carry on items should now be stored tight. Either in an overhead bin or up your ass. All aisles, exits, and bulkhead areas should now be clear. All electronic devices, including your fucking switch, (kaden thats you) should now be turned off and stowed, as they may interfere with the aircraft's navigational and communication systems. Once airborne, we'll let you know when you may use approved electronic devices, but note that some items may not be used at anytime during the flight such as Large Electronics, Metal detectors, sex toys, and fuckin\u2019 guns. You'll find a list of approved devices in the in-flight information section of big nigga magazine. At this time if you're Lesbian, Gay, Transgender or Black, please let us know, and we'll be happy to drag you off the aircraft. As we leave the gate, make sure your seatbelt is fastened. If you don\u2019t know how to fasten the fucking seatbelt, then you can kindly go to seat 34B where John will kindly let you use his noose to hang yourself. Remain seated with your seatbelt securely fastened anytime the seatbelt sign is on. Even if the sign is off, we ask that you keep your seatbelt fastened while seated in case we experience some ISIS niggas tryna pop our shit with they bootleg fireworks. For everyone's safety, federal regulations require all passengers to comply with the posted placards and lighted signs located throughout the cabin, as well as any crew-member instructions. Smoking is not allowed on any Bitch Nigga flight, unless you share the blunt with the pilot and federal law prohibits tampering with, disabling, or destroying a restroom smoke detector unless you have to. There are 2 exits on our Assbus A420-666. 1 door, on the left side of the main deck, and a window that is breakable if you have the will. All exits are clearly marked with a Supreme logo, however, if we experience a loss of power resulting in cabin visibility being reduced, you\u2019re fucked. Please take a moment to find the exits closest to you, keeping in mind that your closest exit may be behind you\u2026 Syke nigga aint no exit behind you, broke ass economy class lookin hoe. If there is a drop in cabin pressure, panels above your seat will open, revealing an open pannel. If this happens, breathe normally and note that no oxygen is flowing. A water evacuation is likely during this flight, as our pilot is suicidal and plans on not landing the aircraft, however, life vests are located under your seats in the First class and Business cabin. If you're seated in the economy class cabins, you\u2019re on your own buddy. To use, pull the tab to remove the vest from it's container. Open the pouch, slip the vest over your head, and tighten the two straps till you start to asphyxiate and die. Most seat cushions can be used for flotation as well. Before we take off, be sure your seat backs are in the upright and locked position, your tray table is put away, and all carry on items are securely stowed. As we come through the cabin for our final safety checks, please let us know if you have any questions. We ask that you all review the PornHub terms and conditions located in the seat pocket in front of you. Once again, welcome aboard Bitch Nigga Airlines flight 6969 to Palestine n shit, and thank you for flying Bitch Nigga.",
            "Ok, first of all, I still have a 3ds, yes. I'm fucking old school. Get with it, faggos. Anyway, me and my nigg family were going on vacay, and I brought my 3ds for the ride. It was loaded with gay porn, and windypanda1 rule 34 hentai. I get on the plane, and I can't grab one stewardess's ass without getting punched in the face, so that sucks. I turned on my 3ds to sext with SMUT\\_ADDICT, when all of a sudden, I shit and cum all over the plane. The entire plane is fucking covered in my sticky seed and anime shit. Anyway, the plane crashed and the only pussy I could save was MrSoftServe's tight pink, and the stylus hole in the 3ds, so while my family, and the passengers were dead,  I fucked that hole with my noodle weewee all fucking night.
