            "Yeah there's a gold mine of unpopularopinion comments waiting to be turned into copypastas.  \n\n\n I was born in the wrong fucking generation. I can\u2019t even express how  much I wish I could bash some fucking rocks together around a crude fire  in a cave. Nothing but me, the wind, and my fellow tribesmen being  impaled and eviscerated by mammoths outside. I bet anyone from my  generation is too dumb to appreciate the simple pleasure of being ripped  apart by a ravenous fucking cheetah on the open African plains. Not to  mention music. No modern garbage can compare to classics like EEE EEE  EEEEEE SCHSEEREEEE YYAAA from 1976 BC, or the acclaimed AAA AAA  SSSHSHSHHHEEEYYY IIIIIEE, which came out in -1982. God it was so  romantic.Romance is dead today. Remember when you found a mate by  dancing and beating the shit out of her ex? Those were the days. ",

            "This is actually an uninformed opinion. In the official canon, Scooby is literally a descendant of actual gods called the Anunnaki which grants him supernatural abilities such as being able to communicate with humans. Go watch Scooby Doo Mystery Incorporated season 2 because it clearly explains why he\u2019s able to talk.",
            "\n\u201cUGh yeah, Scoobs. I need some help from you now!!!!\u201d Shaggy moaned into the pillow.

He couldn\u2019t believe what he was seeing! His most lewd fantasies were being played out right in front of him. MMMmMMnnnn,,,,, His penis immediately came out to play, ripping through the zipper of his pants with massive enormity and strength. \u201cMy gigantic horse dong is ready to penetrate your anus, Shaggy!!\u201d He SCREAMED>\n\n\u201cRu Roh\u2026\u201d Scooby said.\n\nFred lunged at Shaggy at a speed of 200 mph. His 20 inch horse cock throbbed as it plunged into Shaggys ass.\n\n\u201cZoinks!\u201d Shaggy exclaimed. Fred lets out a massive screech as he releases his seed inside Shaggy\u2019s winking bumhole.\n\nHearing this commotion, Daphne walks into the room.\n\n\u201cHey has anyone seen my purple dilOH MY GOODNESS!!!!!\u201d\n\nFred pulls out. \u201cIt\u2019s not what it looks like, Daphne\u2026..Babe\u2026.Babe I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ll treat ya right. Don\u2019t take this the wrong way or anything\u2026\u201d\n\nDaphne\u2019s eyes widened in rage. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to do it in the Mystery Machine, but in my parent\u2019s house? Fred, you need help.\u201d\n\nFred flexes and his pants rip off. He stretches his asshole to an unbelieveable circumference and his discarded jeans swooce into his anus and beyond. With a gust of wind, Daphne is also engulfed into his anal cavity.\n\n\u201cRinkies, rut a ranus!!!\u201d Scooby BArKS.\n\n\u201cWanna clean it up for me??\u201d Fred says with a wink.\n\n\u201cRoh boy!!\u201d He rushes over to Fred\u2019s asshole and begins lapping up those tender muscles.\n\u201cI\u2019ve just got one more question to ask.\u201d Shaggy said. \u201cWhy are your anal muscles so flexible?\u201d\n\nFred grinned and looked off into the distance. \u201cI eat a lot of greens.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoy am I glad we solved that mystery!\u201d Velma said, popping out of Fred\u2019s asshole. \u201cYou meddling kids\u2026\u201d\n\nFred pushed her ugly, spectacled, mug back inside. \u201cAh yes, us meddling kids\u2026\u201d.

I have remained silent because I was afraid to speak up, but my brave fellow survivors of the #MeToo movement have inspired me to comw forward. I was working as a chef de partie at a Taco Bell in the jefferson valley mall the night of july 4 when I was first approached by AOC. She appeared inebriated, and made multiple unwanted comments, including \"ay pendejo you got a fine ass, fucker\". I smiled and allowed it to go on because i was intimidated. She groped my rear and my penis/ balls over my pants several times. I asked her to stop, and she called me joto or something. She then ordered me into the handicapped bathroom stall. I wanted to say no but her future power and status as a congresswoman intimidated me. She made me lie on the diaper changing station, where she proceeded to violate me with a cheesy gordita crunch. She partially insterted the food item into my anus and ate from it. She then jacked me off using the gordita. I wanted her to stop but was too scared. Shamefully I ejaculated and went back to my shift. Having survived the assault, i soon quit my job and moved out of state. It is not easy for me to share this story. One upvote=1 prayer.

        "selftext": "True story\n\nSo when I was 15, I was working part time at a daycare and was just looking after some little 3-5 year olds. It was a fun little gig, plus some of the moms that came by were hot as fuck. Had to take little booty picks once in a while. So one day, there was this new kid, about 4 years old, and he seemed like a good kid. So the next day when he came, I asked him if he wanted to do some coloring? He said sure so I left him for an hour and came back to check on him. I couldn\u2019t make out his drawing at first but it looked like a tombstone. Then I saw my name on it with a satanic sign on the bottom. I turn to look at him and he raised his hands to form crips sign. I knew then that this kid was fucked up. So fast forward to dismissal and during the whole time I was looking at the kid. He was just sitting there with no emotion on his face, still like a fucking statue. I wanted him to do something, anything but nope. A woman came in abruptly ruining my train of thought and I was like goddam. Boi was that ass fat. They were like two entities acting without gravity. I was examining her body slowly and licked my lips. By far the hottest chick I\u2019ve ever seen. Anyways, turns out she was that little shits mother. I looked down and he was staring at me dead in the face. I was like shit, did he see me checking her out? He raised his hands and did a slashing gesture on his throat. Now fast forward to a couple weeks and all the kids were out on the playground. I was watching them and soon that little sht called me over. He said he wanted to square up and whips out a glock. I put my hands up but that little bitch shot me in the knees. I was yelling out for help but all the kids ran inside. He walked over and was humming the cops theme song. Now I\u2019m not gonna lie, I was boppin to that sht but anyways, I told him he was one crazy son of a bitch. He was now threatening me with all these slurs and at this point I was pissed. I told me oh yeah, well I fucked your mom.  He stopped and looked at me with the craziest eyes. He then yelled out ain\u2019t nobody gonna fuck my mother but me!!! I thought I was gonna die, but my adrenaline kicked in and tanked a couple shots to run over and grab the gun. He was still just a kid so it was easy. I shot him in the head once and collapsed. I woke up to the mom crying over her dead son. The police came and arrested me. As we were walking to the cop car, the parents outside were cheering me on. I was looking at them with confusion. before I was being put in the back seat, another cop ran over and whispered something to the other cop. His eyes lit up and he quickly uncuffed me. The mother of the dead kid ran to me and hugged me. Her tits were fucking d cups and were pressing against me so I got a boner. Anyways, turns out she was shedding tears of joy. She whispers in my ears, let me show you how grateful I really am, and caresses her hand over my crotch. I was a virgin at this point so I pushed her away and said I\u2019m saving myself for marriage. As I was checking her out one last time, I gave in to the temptation. I pulled her back and kissed her. We went back to her place and fucked all day. A few months later, i decided to visit the kid\u2019s tombstone. I was silent for a good 20 mins just staring at his name. I read the engraving and I quote \u2018Caillou the biggest shit stain in history\u2019 Before I left, I told him I fucked your mom, and split on his grave. \n\n\nTLTR, met crazy kid who tried to kill me, so I killed him and fucked his mom.",

A simp is anyone who puts themselves in a financially submissive position in effort to further a social engagement with another online. In other words, a man that tries to get laid by being \"nice\" to their favorite e-girl.\n\n## What does this mean?\n\n\u2022 I have caught you being a simp and therefore, have downvoted your post and/or will make fun of you.\n\n## Why did you do this?\n\n\u2022 There are several reasons I may deem you worthy of being called a simp and unworthy of respect. These include, but are not limited to:\n\n1. Donating your life savings to a female streamer,\n2. \u2060Buying a female streamer's onlyfans,\n3. \u2060Complimenting a female (streamer),\n4. Supporting a female (streamer),\n5. \u2060Siding with anyone just because they're a female\n6. Being nice to a female\n\n## Am I the best reddit user?\n\n\u2022 No. In fact, you're the worst. However, if you stop being a simp, you might be a bit better\n\n## I believe my post/comment causes me to deserve to be called a simp.\n\n\u2022 No problem\n\n## How can I stop this from happening in the future?\n\n\u2022 Don't be nice to females",

            "I know I don't usually review anime books but this one seemed important enough that I probably should cover it sooner than later. I would prefer to review the anime instead but thus far they have not adapted the entire thing yet, only a few chapters. And from what I have seen the anime adaptions have been pretty shitty. (Dramatic whipping scene with creepy ass baby plays). WHAT IN THE FUCK. I DO NOT REMEMBER THAT BEING IN THE BOOK. Oh, wait yeah it was right here. Revelations chapter 6 verse 14 \"And then Jesus turned around and saw a creepy ass mother fuckin' baby, and he thought to himself \"WHAT IN THE FUCK IS THAT FUCKING SHIT?!\"\". The Bible has got to be the longest anime book ever written. I read this whole thing cover to cover and it is pretty fucking boring. I'll admit there are a few interesting things that pop up from time to time but for the most part, it's extremely dull. But that's not even my biggest problem with this anime book. The biggest issue I have has gotta be the FANBASE. If you thought bronies were bad, if you thought those Sonic the Hedgehog fans were bad, then you haven't seen anything yet. Die-hard fans of the bible refer to themselves as \"Christians\" named after the book's main protagonist \"Jesus Christ\". These \"Christians\" take anime book fandom to a whole new level (clip of \"Christians\" being lifted into heaven plays). They try to get laws and legislations and shit changed because of what the Bible says. That's fucking insane isn't it would be like if some guy said: \"Hey everyone should be legally required to wear headbands signifying where they are from because that's what they do in the Naruto anime book\". If someone said that shit then everybody would look at them like they were fucking insane. But when fans of the Bible anime book do the same exact shit nobody seems to give a damn. Its fucking double standard bullshit is what it is. These \"Christians\" think that gay people shouldn't be allowed to get married and don't even get me started on abortions. You know what? Fuck it I'm pretty pissed I'm gonna solve this abortion debate once and for all. If any of you congressmen are watching Mumky's anime review then ya better grab a pen and paper because I'm about to give you the answer to the abortion debacle. You always hear the same two sides of this debate. There is the \"Christian\" pro-life people who think that abortions shouldn't happen and there's the pro-choice people who say women should get a pick if they want an abortion or not. Let me be the first to say that both of these ideas are equally stupid. I'm not pro-life and I'm not pro-choice. I'm pro-abortion, I think that every single woman should get an abortion every single time. Even if you don't think you're pregnant you should go get an abortion anyway just in case. It should be a fucking routine like going to the dentist or something, like every six months women go in for their biannual abortion. Because here's the thing it has been scientifically proven that 99% of human being are fucking assholes. So the way I see it we don't need any more people being born. So let's take the fucking vacuum and suck those fuckers out before they have a chance to grow and be a dick all the time. Honestly, we don't need any more people being born, there's already like billion and that's way too fucking many as it is. Ladies I don't care if you are in your third trimester abort that little fucker before it's too late.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlright so I only typed about 5:20 into Mumkey's anime review of the bible but I have had enough as it is 627 words and that is more effort than I have done for any of my fucking essays in school.\n\nFuck you I'm right you're wrong.",

            "This is probably the worst thing I've ever seen. 100 years from now when I'm dying on a hospital bed and I'm asked what my biggest regret was it will be that I turned on my internet and scrolled through the internet on *that fateful day*... I will never be able to recover from this. No amount of therapy will save me. No amount of prescription pills will let me recover. I am a shell. This memory is so bad my brain is physically rejecting it and now I have a headache every time I think about it. Why did you post this, thinking it was a good idea? You've permanently ruined my life because of this, I hope you're happy. I hope that one day this gets branded as a war crime and you get hauled off to prison, never to see the light of day again. The fact that you're already not in a psych ward for insanity is so baffling I have lost all faith in every kind of justice system. If you subscribe to any religion, you'd best spend the rest of your time atoning for this ultimate sin. Have a terrible day, I hope this creation of yours haunts you in your dreams.",
