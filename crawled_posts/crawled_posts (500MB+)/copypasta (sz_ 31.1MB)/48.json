And be careful not to get careless and barrel into the meat of your essay without outlining its core structure first. Too many times people will start writing, confident that their position is so strong they can just wing their reasoning behind it as they go, only to later learn that their opinion is either more subjective than they originally thought, or that arguments that *sounded* distinct and mutually exclusive in their heads actually tend to vaguely bleed into one another.\n\nIt's got bones, but now it needs muscle.",

            "I did not do a racism You useless piece of shit. You absolute waste of space and air. You uneducated, ignorant, idiotic dumb swine, you\u2019re an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole. The magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as moniker of evil for heretics. Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did. When Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality. After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society. No wonder your father questioned whether or not your were truly his son, for you'd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member. Your birth made it so that mankind is worse of in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover into a state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune. I would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell. You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted sac religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair. You are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. Rhodes Island would have been better off if you'd never joined us. You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being. Even this worlds finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are. Anyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe. In the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now. You are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet you manage to make it so that that is only a small part of the evil that is your being. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an eldrich abomination, but here you are. It\u2019s hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you. Even if time travel some day will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to before this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors if they failed would have to many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it. I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did. The countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant. Right from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring. You are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the infected plague apparently only happened with the goal of teaching humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankind\u2019s greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created. If you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched. You are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again. The sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe. I could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating working as hard and efficiently as possible, yet there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world. You are an irresponsible, idiotic, disgusting, unloved, horrible excuse for a living being who\u2019s soul contains less humanity than every ginger in history combined. The absolute disgust I feel when thinking about anything that has even a slight resemblance to anything that might have to do with you and your unholy actions is so incredibly great that when I am honest about it I think that even I do not posses a consciousness great enough to comprehend my own feelings about it. When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children, they did not give their lives to have you fuck the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject become more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to understand what your failure actually means for the universe. My hate for you and everything you stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take the entire Lungmen population down there and back up around twenty million times before you would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I think that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world combined would not be able to stack up to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that when being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless. There is no one in this world that has ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, no one will ever love you in the future either. There is no hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will ever change for the better, and in fact quite the opposite might be true. By making the mistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will only devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are. The only possible way in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is would exclusively be because there is absolutely no conceivable way that you would even be able to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in. But than again, you are so incredibly abominable that you would probably be able to surpass the worst conceivable failure a living being could possibly make. You are so incredibly pathetic that you are honestly not worthy of any more of my words nor my time. Just know that I will forever detest you for your failure and everything you stand for, and that no matter what happens, I will never ever forgive you",

            "Hello, is this Pizza Hut?\n\nExcellent. My name is Ben Shapiro. Conservative thought leader. Prominent white YouTuber. The Muggsy Bogues of the intellectual dark Web. And\u2014look, it\u2019s just a fact\u2014I would like to order some pizza pie. If you are triggered by that request, I do not care. I truly do not.\n\nNow let\u2019s discuss conditions. First, thank you for agreeing to debate me. Typically, in fora such as this, I am met with ad-hominem mudslinging, anything from \u201cYou racist creep\u201d or \u201cIs that your real voice?\u201d to raucous schoolyard laughter and threats of the dreaded \u201ctoilet swirly.\u201d However, your willingness to engage with me over the phone on the subject of pizza shows an intellectual fortitude and openness to dangerous ideas which reflects highly on your character. Huzzah, good sir. Huzzah.\n\nSecond, any pizza I order will be male. None of this \u201cOur pizza identifies as trans-fluid-pan-poly\u201d\u2014no. Pizza is a boy. With a penis. It\u2019s that simple. It\u2019s been true for all of human history, from Plato to Socrates to Mr. Mistoffelees, and any attempt to rewrite the pillars of Western thought will be met with a hearty \u201cFuh!\u201d by yours truly. And, trust me, that is not a fate you wish to meet.\n\nNow. With regard to my topping preference. I have eaten from your pizzeria in times past, and it must be said: your pepperoni is embarrassingly spicy. Frankly, it boggles the mind. I mean, what kind of drugs are you inhaling over there? Pot?! One bite of that stuff and I had to take a shower. So tread lightly when it comes to spice, my good man. You do not want to see me at my most epic. Like the great white hero of Zack Snyder\u2019s classic film \u201c300,\u201d I will kick you.\n\nOnions, peppers\u2014no, thank you. If I wanted veggies, I\u2019d go to a salad bar. I\u2019m not some sort of vegan, Cory Booker weirdo. And your efforts to Michelle Obama-ize the great American pizza pie are, frankly, hilarious. Though not as funny as the impressively named P\u2019Zone\u2014when I finally figured out that genuinely creative pun, I laughed until I cried and peed. A true Spartan admits defeat, and I must admit that, in this instance, your Hut humor slayed me, Dennis Miller style.\n\nAnd, with that, you have earned my order. Congratulations. Ahem. Without further ado, I would like your smallest child pizza, no sauce, extra cheese. Hello? Aha. A hang-up. Another triggered lib, bested by logic. Damn it. I\u2019m fucking starving.",

            " \n\nCompletely agree. This is a hot take and a very unpopular opinion, despite the fact that the majority of people in the comments are agreeing. If the mods remove it for being unpopular, i\u2019ll just say that since there are a lot of replies that automatically means it\u2019s unpopular, despite the fact that the opinion is literally just common fucking sense that most NORMAL people would agree on. I shall now upvote your post because I agree, completely defeating the purpose of this subreddit and making all the popular opinions go to the top of the subreddit while all the unpopular opinions get downvoted. It doesn\u2019t matter if literally every motherfucking goddamm person in the comments is agreeing, there were like 4 people in real life that disagreed with op(I think), so that makes it unpopular, no need to hear anyone else\u2019s opinion. So yeah basically I upvote posts I agree with. No need to thank me, i\u2019m just a 27 year old millennial who hates kids, karens, boomers, and Trump. I\u2019m obsessed with politics, porn, and I love the education system(btw my kid comes home everyday from school exhausted and stressed out but idgaf play stupid games win stupid prizes if you know what i\u2019m sayin). Stupid fucking teenagers saying they have depression need to stfu only adults are allowed to have depression we work so much harder than those little brats. I don\u2019t care if they actually have depression, fucking crotch goblins deserve it tbh. I love the education system cuz it gives me an excuse to not take care of my stupid fucking retarded child. I can\u2019t handle it when someone disagrees with me. I shall also send death threats to people who post actual unpopular opinions.\n\nPS: fuck america, even though I live in america.

            "Incest porn is not about incest, it is about close platonic long term bonds. It is essentially \"platonic best friends all of a sudden becoming sexual\" porn with a clickbait title.\n\nThe incest dynamic is really effective because it is one of the few plot hooks which can overcome porn logic. In most any porn you see, if there is a guy and a girl in the same room, they are going to have sex. There is never a situation where they aren't going to have sex. Furthermore, there is never a situation in a porn where two individuals are not going to want to have sex with each other....\n\nExcept what if that other person in the room was your sister?\n\nFor whatever reason, that is an exception to porn logic. It creates a situation in which there can be two individuals in a room who don't exactly want to have sex with each other which is believable. If it is a brother/sister sort of thing and the sister is trying to seduce the brother, it is believable that the brother might try resisting the sister. It can create a lot of sexual tension because there is a believe resistance. If the sister accidentally walks in on her brother and sees him in the shower, and she doesn't quite look but then can't help but taking some peeks, well that is believable because the taboo aspect of it makes sense. In almost any other non-incest porno the only possible way to handle that would be the girl seeing the guy and then walking in and giving him a blowjob.\n\nWhat is interesting about this is that there is almost never a blood line, it is always step-sister, and that is because being actually related isn't what is important to this. It isn't about that person being a biological sister, but more about them being \"like\" a sister.\n\nWhy is that effective? Well, it opens up the avenue for people to project their own real life situations onto the porn. In everyday life, especially men, have friends who we are attracted to and want to have sex with, but the relationship is really only platonic. I've had attractive female friends who I have been very close with, so much so that they were \"like\" my sister. The way incest porn plays out, it is very similar to how the sex would play out if one of my attractive female friends who was like my sister started to come on to me.\n\nThere are many different avenues that these porns can go and they kind of borrow from different relationship dynamics. Father daughter can be for girls who want to be with an older man, maybe there is an older man they want to experience but feel like it would be too wrong because they are \"like\" a father to them, but it can also be effective for older men who know young attractive women who they are \"like\" a father to. You can go into all the different dynamics.\n\nWhen you really start to see it from this perspective, it is put in a similar category to where two female best friends end up having sex. It is believable in porn logic for there to be two girls in a room and for one of them to not exactly want to have sex with another girl and to show some resistance, or for both of them to show some resistance and for them to just fall into having sex. This can work for a lot of girls viewers because they may have sexual feelings towards some of their female friends, and recreates some of the dynamics. It can work for male viewers because they can imagine that dynamic being at play with some of the people in their life.\n\nThere are other porn categories which play off this as well, like teacher/student porn. It creates some sort of strong enough reason as to why a man would resist sex, but also for anyone to resist sex. It plays on certain real life roles and boundaries which people find relate-able.\n\nThere is so much more to this answer and avenues I could go down, but that is the rough idea of it.",

            "Is that an unpopular opinion? I get that A LOT of people are into (fake) step-family porn (which isn\u2019t actually incest, just taboo, and anything taboo turns people on), but I don\u2019t think many people are genuinely pro-incest or think it\u2019s ok to have sex with family members. Maybe that\u2019s why it was removed? Because the idea that incest is bad is not an unpopular opinion. \n\nUnfortunately, incest is a pernicious and widespread form of sexual abuse. If anyone doesn\u2019t think that incest is a SERIOUS problem in our society, take a look at this short academic paper on the prevalence of incest in different parts of the world (https://family.jrank.org/pages/846/Incest-Prevalence-Incest.html) Spoiler alert: it\u2019s disturbingly common. Of the close female friends I\u2019ve had in my life, two confided in me about abuse perpetrated against them as children by close family members. Seeing the terrible toll this abuse took on these amazing women, I cannot watch any kind of quasi-incest porn, even if it\u2019s all staged and everyone is a performer. Once you see the damage incest does to its victims, it really makes it impossible to become turned on by any kind of depiction of it, however fake it is.\n\nEdit: changed a word, removed a couple sentences",

It plays on certain real life roles and boundaries which people find relate-able.\n\nThere is so much more to this answer and avenues I could go down, but that is the rough idea of it.",

Thank you for reading, and don't hesitate to journey onward into the next! I hope you have a wonderful adventure, and may you come back alive. Mr. Adventurer out. \n\nYou close the letter and sigh. What exactly is Mr. Adventurer getting at? You have a hunch you'll find out soon. In the meantime, you continue your bread winning activities such as pan handling.

Hi.\" You say. \"Hello, new guy, do you need some candy?\" Mr. Candy asks. \"I need to know what you think of me.\" You say bluntly. Mr. Candy blanches. \"What? Did my mother send you?\" He asks. \"No!\" You reply. \"Then what do you know? Is she forcing me to hire bums, cut people's fingers off and put out fires?\" \"No to all three.\" \"Damn.

So, I had the genius idea of using coke to stimulate my ass. WCGW? I mean that the carbonation feels... good in my mouth, so It should work in my ass.\nAs an engineer, there are many logistical challenges to bypass when trying to insert coke into one\u2019s asshole.\n\n\n*Q: How do I put cola in my anus in the first place?*\n\n*A: You use the rim of the bottle and stick it directly in the anus.*\n\n\n*Q: How do I make sure that the coke stays there?*\n\n*A: You don\u2019t. That\u2019s where I fucked up*\n\n\nNow, with a half-assed plan, I went to the store. As I was checking out, I saw a pack mentos.\nTime to bring this to level two. I put back the original coke and bought diet coke instead. All 2 liters of glory.\n\n\n#The disaster\n\n20 mins later...\n\nWith three mentos in my ass, I gingerly lowered the rim to my rim and poured. The reaction was nearly instant. With the tidal force of a tsunami, the bottle was violently ejected from my ass. A pressure was building up, and the gates of hell opened. I felt Satan\u2019s sugary fire burst from my asshole onto the bed. Holy shit, you would not realize the panic I had. There was a pain, both emotional and physical. The sugary wet fart, the sound of a thousand ass-trumpets creating a heavenly cacophony. I saw the light, I saw the dark. I felt The intense sting of carbonation,  I experienced nothing and everything. I had found God, and he was punishing me. There was the maddening sensation of your asshole bending over itself, inside out, shrinking, expanding. It was worse than any experience ever. My brain still cannot comprehend the sensations, but they were torturous. I have contemplated what hell might feel like, and I know that I could find peace there. My bed was soaked with shit-coke. Lord, how am I to clean up.\n\nDon't ever try what I did.\n\n\n#The aftermath\n\nI learned a very valuable lesson that day. Don\u2019t try anything insane. Avoid the asshole. \n\nAlso, TIL that the human asshole can stretch 8 centimeters without damage.\n\nTL;DR: Stick to beating your meat, folks.",

My soul, you don't understand my fear. There is emotional and physical pain. The sweet sounds of thousands of beans will get the sound of paradise. I saw the light and saw the darkness. I felt a strong tingling sensation of carbon dioxide and there was nothing left. I have found that the Lord will judge me. The devil bends and shrinks and expands which is crazy. It's worse than ever. My temper still doesn't understand these feelings, but they hurt. I've been thinking of hell and know that I can get some rest out of it. My bed was a wet cook.
