Look at your fellow woman/man and understand they could be going through something you could never understand. You can choose to perceive this as a movie about glorifying white rage or you can see this as human tragedy. I left looking at the people exiting the theater in a way I never have before. I felt I was really seeing them as just people, struggling to get by and I sympathized with them. This film resensitized violence in film for me and helped me understand how lost a human being must be to resort to it when they feel like there is nothing else. The Joker is not a hero, he is the villain in us that wins out when we lose our will to survive. I hope he never wins in me.",

            "I think the film did an amazing job at turning the spotlight on mental health. I grew up in a family where I was constantly surrounded by schizophrenia, manic depression, extreme narcissism, mental and physical abuse, you name it. I think they nailed it on the head when it comes to how it all really does just combine into a terrible situation and no one really bats an eye. His comment in the notebook that says, \"the worst part about having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don't\" is an incredibly strong statement. I hate to say, but for the majority of the film, I connected with him a lot. But does that mean it makes me want to go out and mimic his actions? Not at all. I think instead of the media attacking video games and movies for violence, they should turn around and use this as a statement as to why its important to help those like my family and many others who need serious help.

As the director mentioned, it was a Joker in his own vision leaving himself in a safe spot cornering the fanatics to a limited space to whine about Joker.\u00a0\n\nAfter all, when we see it as just another remembrance of new American culture we tempt to get paralyzed about the new Joker.\n\n[https://delicacyondelicacy.blogspot.com/2020/03/joker-director-todd-phillips-language.html](https://delicacyondelicacy.blogspot.com/2020/03/joker-director-todd-phillips-language.html)\n\nIt is indeed a pleasure to see the comic book characters dwelling with real life. However, even as a two dimensional villain who lacks the super human fight skills or the extremely rich attires of his alter ego he holds more grittier side of reality than the movie version\n\nJoker in the movie does hold a revolting mind within him but despite of that we can never see the man who wants to watch the whole world burn. He might have faced mental illness in his past, maybe he was a lousy comedian but that doesn't mean his origin can be an adaptation from one of the greatest story of a master director pulling him out from the actual character he beholds.\n\nThe movie revolves around Arthur Fletcher and his delusions sticking himself into the void of pale yellow Gotham. While Bruce still a rich toddler, Thomas Wayne hold the potential of being a villain of this Joker adaptation which most of us might not accept even in the real world scenarios.\n\n[https://delicacyondelicacy.blogspot.com/2020/03/joker-director-todd-phillips-language.html](https://delicacyondelicacy.blogspot.com/2020/03/joker-director-todd-phillips-language.html)\n\nStory mostly seems vaguely running along the hardships of Fletcher in desperately achieving something he thinks he wants while he never puts an actual effort in being what he wants to be. The character is mostly never concerned about the political and revolting atmosphere around him while just pitching himself in his own narcissistic self loathing and it hits an extreme when the story finally progress in a snail phase.\n\nAfter all it's a movie up-gradation of \"King of comedy\" dipped in the pale sauce of DC universe which just falls apart in a matter of time.\n\n[https://delicacyondelicacy.blogspot.com/2020/03/joker-director-todd-phillips-language.html](https://delicacyondelicacy.blogspot.com/2020/03/joker-director-todd-phillips-language.html)",

I think men are much more better than females and that we should handle things. We're prettier and more talented and stronger and a lot smarter than them and we don't let emotions take over us. I was talking about this one day with my friend (15F) who thinks exactly like me and he agreed with me that men are the best and then he took off my pants and told me my penis is praiseworthy for a man. I did the same thing to him and then he asked me if I want to feel in my mouth how manly he is so I did it and we switched the roles. It was amazing to see how strong men are together and how much better we are than females. It should be noted that I am a homophobe and what we did wasn't homosexual but was men's empowerment.

These include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Being gay\n* Dank copypasta bro, where'd you find it\n* walter\n\n# Am I going to shit and cum too?\n\nNo - not yet. But you should refrain from shitposting and cumposting like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to shit and cum again, which may put your shitting and cumming privileges in jeopardy.\n\n# I don't believe my comment deserved being shit and cum at. Can you un-cum it?\n\nSure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I put shit back into my butt. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a hot load explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to retaliatory ejaculation within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of semen dies before it can fertilize the egg, and yours is likely no exception.\n\n# How can I prevent this from happening in the future?\n\nAccept the goopy brown and white substance and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated in my mom's basement. I will continue to shit and cum until you improve your conduct. Remember: ejaculation is privilege, not a right.",

            " \n\nEverything in my life was going well. I had a loving family, had no financial woes, and enjoyed a quiet and fulfilling middle-class American life. But everything changed after I saw the Endgame spoilers. They popped up on my facebook feed out of nowhere. Immediately I knew that this was the end. I could no longer enjoy this film I had been working on enjoying for 11 years the way the Russos intended. All this hard work from going to the theater in 2008 and seeing Robert Downey Jr. put up his suit as Iron Man to crying while his apprentice died in his arms was now dusted away like my favorite heroes.\n\nI knew I couldn't leave such injustice unpunished. I doxxed my facebook friend from 8th grade that posted the spoilery footage, went to his house, took all of his pokemon cards and burned them in my attic. It should teach him and all the other monsters who ruin precious cinematic experiences a lesson.\n\nYou don't mess with my Marvel movies. You don't spoil one-liners for me. Or I will come after you - and I will avenge my moviegoing experience.\n\nI'm not sure how I will move on after this. Knowing I will never have seen Avengers: Endgame the way the Russos, Kevin Feige and all the thousands of good men and women who worked on the film wanted me too. I thought about therapy, but then realized I couldn't afford it. I thought about bashing my head against a wall to forget the spoilers I saw, but then I realized that my insurance doesn't cover that neither.\n\nI am now doomed to live a life of never seeing Avengers: Endgame the way it was meant to be seen. I am writing this so that you may take measures to protect yourself against those spoilers and so that you may never live the life I now have to live.",
