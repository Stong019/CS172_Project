Even steamy hot water from a shower is likely to heat it up to the point that it begins to cook into a runny scrambled egg like texture. This is likely an announcement from a boarding school or university (i received a similar, albeit less crudely worded, email when I was living in the dorms). If people are masturbating in the showers it is very possible for enough semen to cook into a globby mess and clog the pipes.  Also this is why you shouldn't cum in someone's hair as they basically have to take a cold shower to clean it or it will get 10 times worse.",

            "The Tiananmen Square protests, known as the June Fourth Incident (Chinese: \u516d\u56db\u4e8b\u4ef6; pinyin: li\u00f9s\u00ec sh\u00ecji\u00e0n) in China, were student-led demonstrations held in Tiananmen Square, Beijing during 1989. In what is known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre (Chinese: \u5929\u5b89\u95e8\u5927\u5c60\u6740; pinyin: Ti\u0101n'\u0101nm\u00e9n d\u00e0 t\u00fash\u0101), troops armed with assault rifles and accompanied by tanks fired at the demonstrators and those trying to block the military's advance into Tiananmen Square. The protests started on April 15 and were forcibly suppressed on June 4 when the government declared martial law and sent the People's Liberation Army to occupy parts of central Beijing. Estimates of the death toll vary from several hundred to several thousand, with thousands more wounded.\\[2\\]\\[3\\]\\[4\\]\\[5\\]\\[6\\]\\[7\\] The popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests is sometimes called the '89 Democracy Movement (Chinese: \u516b\u4e5d\u6c11\u8fd0; pinyin: B\u0101ji\u01d4 m\u00edny\u00f9n) or the Tiananmen Square Incident (Chinese: \u5929\u5b89\u95e8\u4e8b\u4ef6; pinyin: Ti\u0101n'\u0101nm\u00e9n sh\u00ecji\u00e0n).\r  \n\r  \nThe protests were precipitated by the death of pro-reform Chinese Communist Party (CCP) general secretary Hu Yaobang in April 1989 amid the backdrop of rapid economic development and social change in post-Mao China, reflecting anxieties among the people and political elite about the country's future. The reforms of the 1980s had led to a nascent market economy that benefited some people but seriously disadvantaged others, and the one-party political system also faced a challenge to its legitimacy. Common grievances at the time included inflation, corruption, limited preparedness of graduates for the new economy,\\[8\\] and restrictions on political participation. Although they were highly disorganized and their goals varied, the students called for greater accountability, constitutional due process, democracy, freedom of the press, and freedom of speech.\\[9\\]\\[10\\] At the height of the protests, about one million people assembled in the Square.\\[11\\]\r  \n\r  \nAs the protests developed, the authorities responded with both conciliatory and hardline tactics, exposing deep divisions within the party leadership.\\[12\\] By May, a student-led hunger strike galvanized support around the country for the demonstrators, and the protests spread to some 400 cities.\\[13\\] Among the CCP top leadership, Premier Li Peng and Party Elders Li Xiannian and Wang Zhen called for decisive action through violent suppression of the protesters, and ultimately managed to win over Paramount Leader Deng Xiaoping and President Yang Shangkun to their side.\\[14\\]\\[15\\]\\[16\\] On May 20, the State Council declared martial law. They mobilized as many as \\~300,000 troops to Beijing.\\[13\\] The troops advanced into central parts of Beijing on the city's major thoroughfares in the early morning hours of June 4, killing both demonstrators and bystanders in the process. The military operations were under the overall command of General Yang Baibing, half-brother of President Yang Shangkun.\\[17\\]\r  \n\r  \nThe international community, human rights organizations, and political analysts condemned the Chinese government for the massacre. Western countries imposed arms embargoes on China.\\[18\\] The Chinese government made widespread arrests of protesters and their supporters, suppressed other protests around China, expelled foreign journalists, strictly controlled coverage of the events in the domestic press, strengthened the police and internal security forces, and demoted or purged officials it deemed sympathetic to the protests.\\[19\\] More broadly, the suppression ended the political reforms begun in 1986 and halted the policies of liberalization of the 1980s, which were only partly resumed after Deng Xiaoping's Southern Tour in 1992.\\[20\\]\\[21\\]\\[22\\] Considered a watershed event, reaction to the protests set limits on political expression in China, limits that have lasted up to the present day.\\[23\\] Remembering the protests is widely associated with questioning the legitimacy of Communist Party rule and remains one of the most sensitive and most widely censored topics in China.\\[24\\]\\[25",

            "[FUCKING SNUBBED](https://youtu.be/EaV2SftKNX4)",
            "This is a throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\nSome background. Politically, I've been a Democrat my entire life and an Obama supporter for as long as I can remember. I volunteered for John Kerry's presidential campaign back in 2004 which is where first registered on my map. I watched his speech at the DNC was was instantly enamoured.\n\nWhen he announced his candidacy for president in 2007, immediately threw my weight behind him. I knocked on doors, educated people about his policies and did the best I could to get people to vote for him. When he was elected, I was ecstatic. In the past, when I had supported candidates, it was out of cold reason; because I thought their policies and acumen would result in the best net result for this country. But this was a person I could get excited about, someone I could *believe* in.\n\nWhen it came time for his campaign for a second term it was largely the same. I had slightly soured on him. Granted, he was not the president I had hoped he would be but that was not his fault. I had built him up to be so huge in my head it was impossible for him to live up to expectations. Republican gridlock in Congress also prevented him from getting through the policies he wanted. Nevertheless, I still supported him, still volunteered and was still happy when he won his second term.\n\nThe problem started about three weeks ago. I had a dream involving Barack, which is not uncommon for me, I was working with him and Michelle on their upcoming Netflix show. We were looking over demographics and how they related to various geographical locations. Without even realising it, I said \"Yeah, N\\*\\*\\*er, we should do pretty well in (area near me)\" He just looked at me and stormed out with Michelle behind him. I woke up and went into the bathroom to splash cold water in my face. I dismissed it. I don't have a racist bone in my body. This was just one of those dreams, right?\n\nA week and a half ago, I had a similar experience. This time I dreamt we were going wine-tasting together. I don't remember the lead-up but I ended up saying something to the effect of \"The sommelier said we should be detecting earthy tones in this wine, but it's just not registering with me, N\\*\\*\\*er\" This time, instead of storming out he replied, very sternly \"Why did you feel that was an appropriate thing to say?\" I began to stutter and explain it was an accident but I had once again woken up.\n\nThe most recent incident was last night. I dreamt I was at a family barbecue with the Obamas, just his family and mine. He was manning the grill and i was speaking to Michelle while the children played with each other (I know Sasha and Malia are adults now but I still think of them as children) I said to Michelle very politely \"excuse me for one moment\" and marched right up to Barack and tapped him on the shoulder. He turned around to look and me and I just said the word and nothing else. I can write off this happening once or twice in my dreams but three separate events is too much.\n\nI don't know what to do. I don't want to do this. Every time it happens my work suffers the next day. I've started lying to my wife saying I've been having nightmares but I'm not sure she fully believes it. Lately, I've been worrying I might start saying it in my sleep and she could hear. I'm at my wits end and I want it to stop.",

        "selftext": "Last night I was looking for some porn of the not gay variety.\u00a0 Obviously gay porn is gay, so instead I went looking for guy on girl porn. But I realized that features a guy, with a penis, and is therefore 50% gay.\u00a0 So I started looking for some girl on girl action, till I realized that is lesbian, and is therefore 100% gay.\u00a0 \n\nSo clearly, I had to look into alternative options.\u00a0 I started to consider hentai: since no one in it is real, it can\u2019t contain guys, so it\u2019s not gay, right? Well, hentai is anime, which not only is gay, but also makes me a weeb. The worst option so far.\n\nI considered traps. I\u2019ve long heard debate over whether traps are gay, so I decided to do the math.\u00a0 The gayness of traps lies in the premise. Let\u2019s consider the 5 base premises:\n1) a guy and a trap, where the guy initially thinks he\u2019s with a girl: effectively guy on girl, 50% gay\n2) a guy with a trap, and the guy knew it was a trap:\nDude looking for some dick, that\u2019s gay\n3) a girl with a trap, where the girl doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s a trap: that\u2019s lesbian, and is gay\n4) a girl with a trap, where the girl knows it\u2019s a trap: effectively guy on girl, therefore 50% gay\nTherefore, on average traps are 75% gay, with a minimum gayness of 50%. Not an improvement.\u00a0 The 5th option, trap on trap, is a singularity of the 4 prior possibilities, and is therefore on average 75% gay again.\n\nSo I got into specifics. What if it was girl on girl, and the premise was at least one of the girls was just bi-curious, and not actually fully lesbian? Well, in that case, their curiosity makes them a cat. Cats are furries, and furries are gay\n\nSo how about a girl soloing? Well that\u2019s a girl touching girl bits. Lesbian and gay.\n\nMy conclusion is that the only way to live a life free of homosexual sin is to liberate oneself of sexual desire at all, and become an asexual.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk.\n\nEdit: thank for award glad my post could help so many",

Obviously \ud83d\ude44 gay \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 porn \ud83d\ude1c is gay \ud83c\udf08, so instead \ud83d\udc4d\u2642 I \ud83d\udc41 went \ud83d\udca8 looking \ud83d\udc40 for guy \ud83d\udc68 on \ud83d\udd1b girl \ud83d\udc67 porn \ud83d\ude1c. But \ud83c\udf51 I \ud83d\udc41 realized \ud83d\udca1 that features \ud83e\uddec a guy \ud83d\udc66, with a penis \ud83c\udf46, and is therefore \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude21 50 \ud83d\udcb5% gay \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc6c. So I \ud83d\udc41 started \ud83d\udca2 looking \ud83d\udc40\u2b07 for some girl \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffd on \ud83d\udd1b girl \ud83d\udc69 action \ud83c\udfad, till \ud83d\ude05 I \ud83d\udc41\u270b\ud83c\udffb realized \ud83d\udc40 that is lesbian \ud83d\udc69, and is therefore \ud83c\udf89 100 \ud83d\udcaf% gay \ud83c\udf08. \n\nSo clearly \ud83d\udcdd, I \ud83d\udc65 had to look \ud83d\udc41 into alternative \ud83e\udd16 options \ud83d\udc78\ud83e\udd3d\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. I \ud83d\udc41 started \ud83d\udca2 to consider \ud83e\udd14 hentai \ud83d\udc6f: since \ud83d\udca6 no \ud83d\ude45 one \u261d\ud83c\udffb in it is real \ud83d\ude0d, it can\u2019t contain \ud83c\udf0e guys \ud83d\udc68, so it\u2019s not gay \ud83c\udf08, right \ud83d\udc4c? Well \ud83d\ude26, hentai \ud83d\udc6f is anime \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udcaf, which not only is gay \ud83c\udf08, but \ud83c\udf51\ud83c\udf46 also \ud83d\udc68 makes \ud83d\udd95 me a weeb \ud83e\udd14\u2623. The worst \ud83d\udc79 option \ud83c\udf42 so far \ud83c\udf0c. \n\nI \ud83d\udc65 considered \ud83e\udd14 traps \u26d3. I\u2019ve long \ud83d\udd5a heard \ud83d\udc42 debate \ud83d\udd2b over \ud83d\udd01 whether \ud83c\udf29\ud83c\udf27 traps \u26d3 are gay \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08, so I \ud83d\udc41 decided \ud83d\udc6f to do the math \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcd0\ud83d\udccf. The gayness \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 of traps \u26d3 lies \ud83d\ude21\ud83e\udd25\ud83d\ude30 in the premise \ud83d\udea7\ud83d\udea8. Let\u2019s consider \ud83d\udc48 the 5 \ud83d\udd33 base \u274c\ud83d\udc68\u200d\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udc68 premises \ud83d\udea7\ud83d\udea8: \n1 \u2757) a guy \u2754\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffe\u2753 and a trap \ud83c\udf51\ud83d\udc45, where the guy \ud83d\udc66 initially \ud83d\udcb5 thinks \ud83e\udd14\u2753 he\u2019s with a girl \ud83d\udc67: effectively \ud83d\udc80 guy \ud83d\udc68 on \ud83d\udd1b girl \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffb, 50 \ud83d\udcb0% gay \ud83c\udf08 \n2 \ud83d\udd5d) a guy \ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc69 with a trap \u26d3, and the guy \ud83d\udc66 knew \ud83d\udc53 it was a trap \u26d3: \nDude \ud83d\ude0e looking \ud83d\udc41\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\ude0f for some dick \ud83c\udf46, that\u2019s gay \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 \n3 \u2b55\u2139\ud83d\udd58) a girl \ud83d\udc67 with a trap \u26d3, where the girl \ud83d\udc69 doesn\u2019t know \ud83d\udcad it\u2019s a trap \u26d3: that\u2019s lesbian \ud83d\udc6d\ud83d\udc69, and is gay \ud83c\udf08 \n4 \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udd2b\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8) a girl \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffc with a trap \u26d3, where the girl \ud83d\udc67\ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc81 knows \ud83d\udcad it\u2019s a trap \u26d3: effectively \ud83d\udc80 guy \ud83d\udc68 on \ud83d\udd1b girl \ud83d\udc67\ud83d\ude0d, therefore \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude21 50 \ud83d\udc4c% gay \ud83c\udf08 \nTherefore \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude21, on \ud83d\udd1b average \ud83d\udcb0 traps \u26d3 are 75 \ud83d\udc5d\ud83d\udceb\ud83d\udcec% gay \ud83c\udf08, with a minimum \ud83d\uded2 gayness \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 of 50 \ud83d\udcb0%. Not an improvement \u2b06. The 5th \ud83d\udca6 option \ud83d\udc78\ud83e\udd3d\u200d\u2640\ufe0f, trap \u26d3 on \ud83d\udd1b trap \ud83c\udf51\ud83d\udc45, is a singularity \ud83c\ude51 of the 4 \ud83d\udca6 prior \ud83d\udd19 possibilities \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udcaf, and is therefore \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude21 on \ud83c\udf46\ud83d\udca6\ud83d\ude18 average \ud83c\udd97 75 \ud83d\udd1b% gay \ud83c\udf08 again \ud83d\ude2c. \n\nSo I \ud83d\udc41\u2139 got \ud83c\ude50\ud83c\udf7a into specifics \ud83d\udccd. What if it was girl \ud83d\udc67 on \ud83d\udd1b girl \ud83d\udc69, and the premise \ud83d\udea7\ud83d\udea8 was at least \ud83d\udcaf one \ud83d\ude24 of the girls \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffb was just bi-curious, and not actually \ud83d\ude33 fully \ud83c\ude35 lesbian \ud83d\udc6d\ud83d\udc69? Well \ud83d\ude26, in that case \ud83d\udccb, their curiosity \ud83d\ude47 makes \ud83d\udee0 them a cat \ud83d\udc08.

            "Last night I was looking for some porn of the not gay variety.\u00a0 Obviously gay porn is gay, so instead I went looking for guy on girl porn. But I realized that features a guy, with a penis, and is therefore 50% gay.\u00a0 So I started looking for some girl on girl action, till I realized that is lesbian, and is therefore 100% gay.\u00a0 \n\nSo clearly, I had to look into alternative options.\u00a0 I started to consider hentai: since no one in it is real, it can\u2019t contain guys, so it\u2019s not gay, right? Well, hentai is anime, which not only is gay, but also makes me a weeb. The worst option so far.\n\nI considered traps. I\u2019ve long heard debate over whether traps are gay, so I decided to do the math.\u00a0 The gayness of traps lies in the premise. Let\u2019s consider the 5 base premises:\n1) a guy and a trap, where the guy initially thinks he\u2019s with a girl: effectively guy on girl, 50% gay\n2) a guy with a trap, and the guy knew it was a trap:\nDude looking for some dick, that\u2019s gay\n3) a girl with a trap, where the girl doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s a trap: that\u2019s lesbian, and is gay\n4) a girl with a trap, where the girl knows it\u2019s a trap: effectively guy on girl, therefore 50% gay\nTherefore, on average traps are 75% gay, with a minimum gayness of 50%. Not an improvement.\u00a0 The 5th option, trap on trap, is a singularity of the 4 prior possibilities, and is therefore on average 75% gay again.\n\nSo I got into specifics. What if it was girl on girl, and the premise was at least one of the girls was just bi-curious, and not actually fully lesbian? Well, in that case, their curiosity makes them a cat. Cats are furries, and furries are gay\n\nSo how about a girl soloing? Well that\u2019s a girl touching girl bits. Lesbian and gay.\n\nMy conclusion is that the only way to live a life free of homosexual sin is to liberate oneself of sexual desire at all, and become an asexual.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk.",

Why can't it be the same cute as a dog or a baby, a kind of cute where it makes you feel good without making your dick hard. But I guess that distinction just doesn't exist for some people, considering that there are people, and it seems that there are a lot of them in the anime community, that DO look at dogs and children and think to themselves, \"damn that really make my dick pop up. Wow, I enjoy looking at this thing so that means I wanna get my cock involved in that business.\" WHAT!? Are people unable to appreciate things without their monkey brain taking over and then wanting to bust some cream in it? Are these people animals that know nothing other than eat, sleep, and fuck? Where do they draw the line? There are so many people, women who are my friends, that I think are attractive. Do I want to have sex with them? No! Why? Because I can be around something that looks nice without being fucking horny! Where do they draw the line? Actual people? Certainly not. Fake people, drawings, anime girls? Can they look at an anime girl that is designed to look nice without wanting to empty their sack? Absolutely not! Dogs and children? Cute things that we want to protect? Protect? No, I'm sure they're rather rub their meat stick because ooh ooh ah ah it make me feel good. I wouldn't doubt it if anything pleasing looking, no matter what it, is makes them horny. Wow, a beautiful sunset! Doesn't that make my cock go off! Wtf am I even talking about? These people's brains have been fried by overstimulation to the point where they cant just enjoy something without them wanting it on their disgusting, cheesey dickhead. Fuck!

You play the video as you slowly thrust back and forth letting every little bit of sensation from your bed flow through your dick. You start to thrust faster and harder as you enjoy this 0% gay porn. 5 minutes pass and you can start to feel your body weaken,  your balls grow and you know you're actually doing this,  you're  not just fucking your bed but you're about to fill it with your warm cummies. As the cum starts to flow out your balls and down your shaft your dog comes out of underneath the bed and starts licking your balls, you gasp with shock yet it feels great as your release a big load of cum into your bed, you moan and groan and as you finish your family walk in through the door and witness this abomination of the dog liking your swollen balls, dick fully wedged in the bed and cum oozing out.

No one controls the robot, it just automatically pleasures her.

            "Being asexual will not free you from this homosexual hellscape my friend. You see, while not having any sexual desire, you will obviously have no affections towards boys. This isn't gay. Good so far. However, it seems you have forgotten the other half of being asexual. Having no sexual desires also means you do not have any affections towards females either. This makes you homo; 50%, to be precise (50% of you does not like boys ((not gay)), but 50% of you does not like girls ((gay))). We need to consider a better option.\n\nDeath is obviously the same as asexual, you're not getting out that easily. Not being born could be considered 0% gay (You don't have the chance to ever not like girls, meaning you cut off the extra 50% gay), but that is not an option for you anymore. There is only one option that can be utilized that will give you the lowest possible percentage of gay achievable.\n\nWhile dangerous, this method is sure to guarantee you remain a good Christian lad. You see, what you need to do is surgically remove all of your reproductive organs. You can still have a dick, but you can only be able to use it for urinating. All sexual features from it are stripped. After this, you can have sex with a girl, and nearly all gay  parts are completely absent.\n\nUnfortunately, we have to discuss the downsides to this method. Despite being the least gay method of sex you can plausibly employ known to date, it is not 100% free of sin. You're side of the relationship is eliminated of all homosexuality (Other person is a girl, no dick involved). But, precisely because there is no dick involved in this transaction, it remains at 25% gay. Even if you do not contribute any gay yourself, your partner will not be gay or straight (You don't have a vagina, so she's not gay, but you don't have a dick, so she's not straight). This means she is 50% gay, overall making the exchange 25% gay. This is know as the homoreversal paradox, and what makes it impossible to achieve 0% gayness realistically.\n\nAnd, don't try to subvert this by not having intercourse with a girl, as that is still 50% gay (As discussed earlier). Removing the sexual organs of both partners will not avoid this paradox either, as now both of you will suffer it, and it remains 50% gay.\n\nDue to this, the lowest amount of gay any man can have is 25%, and the only known way to reach that is by having all reproductive organs removed from your body.",

            "Men wearing thigh high socks may be a taboo subject to some people, but why not talk about it? I mean, why is it so bad? First let me explain. I am a guy who likes to wear thigh high socks. First of all for comfort and the look, and secondly for warmth. I like the way they look especially with shorts and I have wanted to be more open about it for a long time, yet I believe society has been suppressing my openness.\n\nMost people in public would automatically believe that a man wearing thigh high socks is gay, immature, or stupid. The thing that gets me is that it seems like society believes that if everyone does not act the same, wear the same things, or believe in the same imaginary people then the other person is out of line. Wearing thigh high socks is definitely breaking a \u201csocial norm\u201d and most people would call out the person who was wearing them. Some posts I have read state that thigh high socks are a woman\u2019s garment like tights or dresses. The question I have is why do people automatically label a man wearing thigh high socks gay. I am NOT gay. Now while I understand the stigma that goes along with gay men wearing different things, if I like it then why do I have to worry about wearing them out in public? Well the answer to that is because of our society. Society today believes that there is one right and one wrong and you are one or the other. However I, like many others, believe that even though I do not agree with you I can still accept you and love you like the Bible says I should.\n\nWhat makes me take a step back is the fact that someone can automatically be labeled gay. While it is offensive and I also used to do the exact same thing, over the last year I have been able to become more open minded to the way homosexuality is present in our society. My girlfriend, yes my real girlfriend that I\u2019m dating, used to be a lesbian.\n\nWhen I ask any group of people what they think about a male wearing thigh high socks, the first answer is usually \"Why would anyone care? Do and wear what you want.\" The second answer is usually \"gay\". The third answer is usually, \"Well, that's weird.\" The first and last answers do not bother me, however the middle answer does. Like most other men, I do not want to be labeled as \"gay\".\n\nBut what will it take for me to get the confidence to wear thigh high socks in public? Well the answer to that is, I don\u2019t know. I hope that one day soon I will be able to wear them and not feel like I\u2019m being stared at. A normal, straight, guy with a weird fetish. Men and women alike have their favorite things. Why mine happens to be thigh high socks I don\u2019t know but I hope one day that I can find some of the answers I am looking for.",
