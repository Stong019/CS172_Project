            "Actually, futa can be made less gay than straight porn. You see, straight porn has one guy and one girl. Because you\u2019re fapping to something with one guy in it, that\u2019s 50% gay. If you watch futa fuck a girl, that\u2019s one girl and a half girl, thus only 25% gay. You could make it 0% gay with two girls but the problem is, that makes them lesbian, which wraps back to being 100% gay ",

I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Prussian War College, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Entente trenches, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire German armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the Western Front and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Kaiserliche Marine and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little \"clever\" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.",

            "I just downvoted your thread.\n\nFAQ:\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nThe amount of karma (points) on your thread and Reddit account has decreased by one.\n\nWhy did you do this?\n\nThere are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to: Rudeness towards other Redditors, Spreading incorrect information, Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s. Trump.\n\nAm I banned from the Reddit?\n\nNo - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.\n\nI don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?\n\nSure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.\n\nHow can I prevent this from happening in the future?\n\nAccept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct.\n\nRemember: Reddit is a privilege, not a right.",

            "My name is Bella Thorne, and this is the story of the time I found out I had dyslexia. I remember when I started first grade. Right away, it was awful because I couldn't read as well as the other kids. My brain mixed up letters like b and d and m and w. Dyslexia is different for EVERYONE who has it. For me, it just made it harder to read or write. I started working really hard on how to read better. My family helped me by making me read everything from menus, to cereal boxes, to road signs. Today, I read a year above my grade level. And I learned to face my problems, not run away from them. Dyslexia makes things hard for me but, not impossible.

Open the door!\" I go to the door, butt naked, my 2-inch pounder throbbing. They see my dick and immediately vomit. Years earlier I had stuck my penis into an open fire, and forever maimed it. Fast forward, there was a cop vomiting, one staring intently at my desktop, which was filled by pokimanes cock. He yells \"What the fuck!?!?!?\"  I answered something along the lines of, \"Her dick is hot isn't it?\" He looked at me with disgust. My animal urges wanted me to finish, so I did. I started jerking the ween faster than ever before. The friction burned the already burned skin off of my penis. All of the sudden a shower of blood and semen poured out of my dick like water out of a squirt gun. The cop was crying. The pain was unbearable. I was bleeding out, and decided to make my final moments memorable. I grabbed the cop and shoved his foot inside of my dick-hole. He was trembling. But my dick sensed the foot, and all of the blood rushed to the penis ASAP, creating a blood clot which stopped the bleeding, saving my life. The cop shot himself, and the cop vomiting ran away, never to be seen again. Turns out my neighboor smelled what she thought was weed and called the cops. It was actually my Pokimane youtooz saturating in my cum jar.",

Many people don\u2019t know that. But the moment I heard about this Chinese flu, I ordered a test. And it\u2019s an amazing test. We do better testing than anywhere in the world. Some say the Germans have the best tests, but they don\u2019t. Our tests are even better.\n\nSo you\u2019re positive for Corona.

Some say \u201cpositive\u201d is always good, but I\u2019ve never agreed with that.\n\nSo you\u2019re positive for the Corona. But you\u2019ll be fine. Totally fine.

There are no ventilators\u2014but you won\u2019t need one. \n\nHow old are you, 55? You won\u2019t need one. Some people need a ventilator, and they\u2019re amazing machines. Did you know the first ventilator was made by Henry Ford? It\u2019s an incredible piece of equipment. But you\u2019ll be fine.\n\nThe virus gets into your lungs, which is where you breathe. But you have two of them. Some say you have a spare. Some people only have one lung. It\u2019s true. But I don\u2019t talk about spares. I always want both. Given a choice, I want two lungs.\n\nSo I\u2019ve asked nurse\u2014what\u2019s your name, Nancy?\u2014I\u2019ve asked nurse Nancy to keep you comfortable. And Nancy is one of our finest nurses. I mean, just look at her. Incredible, right? Nancy, you\u2019re really incredible. You\u2019re not afraid of Corona, are you, the Chinese Plague? I didn\u2019t think so.

Given a choice, I want two lungs.\n\nSo I\u2019ve asked nurse\u2014what\u2019s your name, Nancy?\u2014I\u2019ve asked nurse Nancy to keep you comfortable. And Nancy is one of our finest nurses. I mean, just look at her. Incredible, right? Nancy, you\u2019re really incredible. You\u2019re not afraid of Corona, are you, the Chinese Plague? I didn\u2019t think so. Nancy will bring you whatever you need. And if you start coughing, do that into your elbow, so you don\u2019t make a mess. Okay, you\u2019re doing great. I\u2019ll see you later.",

He was built up as a slightly ditzy but still menacing bad guy, until he got counterattacked by fucking Greece and I nearly stopped watching. Italy didn't even get an interesting role in the North Africa sub-plot, it was all Rommel and his tanks.\n\nAlso, anyone else feel Japan's storyline was too edgy? We already had the Nazis as the evil genocidal bad guys, we didn't need all those graphic scenes in Nanking. The villains responsible for that didn't even get a proper retribution they just went into hiding or something.\n\nThere were amazing subplots that didn't go anywhere like the Spanish civil war followed by Francisco Franco being neutral. Turkey got an incredible backstory then it seems like the directors just forgot about it (I think they killed Kemal way too early).\n\n\n\nHonestly this is nearly worse than the first season's bullshit ending where Germany just gives up and throws it's king out. Then the foreshadowing with the Versailles treaty scene was so fucking obvious. The Ottoman subplot was the most interesting thing about that series (Lawrence of Arabia, Gallipoli, the genocides, Mustafa Kemal being introduced).\n\nThe weird 'Cold war' third season had interesting concepts, great characters, flawed protagonists, lots at stake and tense moments but ends in the same anticlimactic fashion as all the previous seasons.\n\nThere are rumors that we'll get a new season soon.

            "Here's how it should have ended. With me fucking Hitler's brains out.\n\nThis is how I envision it: I\u2019m a dirty little american soldier that ends up being captured by the Nazis. To avoid execution, I volunteer myself to be Hitler\u2019s obedient fuck-toy.\n\nFor days, I allow Hitler to chain me up and obliterate all of my orifices like they\u2019re little Polands, constantly filling them with his aryan seed until his cock is stroked raw.\n\nHell, he even gives me the pleasure to lick his puckered german booty clean after he takes insane nuclear shits. Due to me not getting bathroom access, I constantly shit and piss myself, but Hitler is generous enough to be my personal cleanup, licking it all up and staining his beautiful mustache.\n\nAfter building up trust and showing my obedience, he unchains me and allows me to fuck his brains out, cursing in pleasure as he yells out, \u201cYA SHOVE IT REICH UP MY ASS!\u201d. I\u2019m generous enough to give him a reach around, cranking his throbbing war machine.\n\nI feel him tighten up as he reaches climax, but I let go of his thick ramrod as he begins to spew his nuclear ejaculate all over the floor. Hitler repeatedly yells out \u201cNEIN! NEIN! NEIN! NEIN!\u201d through his moans while he suffers through his ruined orgasm. At this point the tables have turned.\n\nHe tries to fight me off, but I pin him down and powerfully thrust my all-american cock harder into his poop chute as blood begins to build up and gush out of his torn asshole. I can\u2019t contain myself any longer, so I quickly pull out my 1911 and put a bullet through the back of Hitler\u2019s head. Brain matter and skull fragments paint the wall, which makes me break through to my climax.\n\nI raise my right arm up to the ceiling. I yell out \u201cSEIG HEIL!\u201d as my cock begins to rapidly pulsate. I quickly thrust my cock to the hilt deep inside of him. I throw my head back with a loud \u201cFUUUUCK!\u201d as I spew what feels like a gallon of american semen deep inside his german asshole.\n\nI pull my bloody cock out of his booty tube and watch in excitement as my thick load begins to leak out of his ass. Heavily breathing, I fall back and begin to fade out, as I watch a group of american soldiers burst into the room, guns drawn.\n\nI wake up in the hospital, in which I\u2019m told that I\u2019m praised as an american hero for stopping World War 2.",

The show didn't really show the background very well, and what they did show they mostly tried to cram into the last season so it all felt very rushed. If you read all the background in the novel, it's not always so black and white, at first a lot of the surrounding nations were more afraid of the communists than the nazis. If the show had taken more time to develop the descent of Russia into the enemy of the other protagonists, it could have made more sense.\n\nAlso, I was never a fan of the two big bombs they used there at the end, I thought that they could have achieved the same effect having big air battles like they did in Germany and slowly taking out cities with firebombing instead of all at once, but they didn't exactly come out of nowhere. A lot of people miss the subtle signs, but even from the first few books/seasons, there are hints that Germany might have been working on the project at first, and so were the Russians, but the US did the best job of finishing it, partially by obtaining the info through spies.",
            "One of my favorites: https://web.archive.org/web/20171231001957/http://squid314.livejournal.com/275614.html. Excerpt:\n\n> So they invent a completely implausible superweapon that they've never mentioned until now. Apparently the Americans got some scientists together to invent it, only we never heard anything about it because it was \"classified\". In two years, the scientists manage to invent a weapon a thousand times more powerful than anything anyone's ever seen before - drawing from, of course, ancient mystical texts. Then they use the superweapon, blow up several Japanese cities easily, and the Japanese surrender. Convenient, isn't it?\n\n> ...and then, in the entire rest of the show, over five or six different big wars, they never use the superweapon again. Seriously. They have this whole thing about a war in Vietnam that lasts decades and kills tens of thousands of people, and they never wonder if maybe they should consider using the frickin' unstoppable mystical superweapon that they won the last war with. At this point, you're starting to wonder if any of the show's writers have even watched the episodes the other writers made.",

So don't fret we will get on the whole Hitler vs FDR cage match in Paris soon enough. Just occupy your self with more Ancient Aliens episodes as well as the classic Jesus was a Democrat who told Pilot to give the people fish and wine or he would drop a house on him.",

And the bullshit plotline with the mustardgas makes no sense either. WWI was fucking trash 2/10",
            "So am I the only one upset about how WWII ended? I mean they built Hitler up to be the big bad and just when he is about to face justice, he goes and kills himself. WTF was the point of him if FDR and Churchill were not going to fight him in an epic duel to save the world? And don't get me started on FDR! They just kill him half way through the war. Truman totally did not deserve to win the war, his character arc was not about war winning. And it certainly wasn't about destroying two cities with bullshit deus ex super weapons that came out of no where.\n\nAnd another thing that pissed me off is that in the last episode of the war we find out that Stalin was a bad guy the entire time! Where was this foreshadowed to us? WTF, absolute character assassination. He was all about freeing the oppressed and bringing about a new system that wasn't shackling the poor and they made him a dictator? That is bullshit!\n\nAnyways, WWII was cool but its end was absolutely trash and I would like you guys to sign a petition to have it rewritten.",

Then, you support children who have been so promiscuous that they all have HIV by dressing up as an anime character. So, not only are they all monkey rapists, you're preventing their mental recovery by pretending that anime is real. Lastly, your \"friend\" says that you saved his dad. That probably means that he is a straight man, which means that you should have let him die to remove another rapist from this world.
