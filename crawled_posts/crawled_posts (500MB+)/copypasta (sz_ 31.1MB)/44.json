            "Okay. So, I\u2019ve been seeing this copypasta floating around about wanting to \u201cbang the Animal Crossing dog\u201d, and frankly- I think this is disgusting. First of all, her name isn\u2019t \u201cthe Animal Crossing dog\u201d, it\u2019s Isabelle. It\u2019s a beautiful name for a beautiful person, and you would all do well to refer to her as such. If you don\u2019t even know her name, than you have no right wanted to have sex with her! Secondly, wanting to bang her is just gross. Saying that you want to bang Isabelle is objectifying her, and it is not okay. If you\u2019ve ever wanted to bang Isabelle, you should be disgusted with yourself. Unlike you cretins, I however- respect her. Sure, it\u2019s possible I may consider her to be rather bangable, but I wouldn\u2019t dare do such a thing. Isabelle is a fucking queen, and deserves to be treated as such. I DO NOT want to bang \u201cThe Animal Crossing dog\u201d. I want to hug her. I want to be in a healthy and loving relationship with Isabelle. I want to wake up every morning in bed, with her lying peacefully next to me as the morning sun shines in through the window. I want to make her breakfast every morning, and tend to her every need. I want her to feel like she is truly loved, (because she is). I want her to be by my side for my whole life, because I know that she is the perfect woman for me, and I am perfect for her. I want to be to be with her every day, just so I can tell her how much I fucking love her. I want her to know how much I adore everything amazing personality, her incredible fashion sense, her extremely impressive caretaking abilities, and her absolutely beautiful head to body ratio, and her beautiful, beautiful eyes. However, if I were to ever have sex with Isabelle, I wouldn\u2019t simply be \u201cbanging\u201d her. If Isabelle were to ever consent to me having sexual intercourse with her, it would be tender and loving and passionate. As we make love, I\u2019d slowly and gently caress her soft, golden fur as I slowly but deliberately thrusted into her tight dog pussy. I would make her pleasure my utmost priority, with my own being secondary. But if she was willing, than oh god. What I wouldn\u2019t give to feel her adorable little paws running up and down the length of my shaft. I just wanna pet every inch of her body, and give her scritches on her tummy so she does that thing that dogs do where their legs spaz out. That\u2019d just be so fucking hot. I\u2019d probably end up cumming all over her, so it gets in her fur. But goddamn. I love that fur so much, that I\u2019d personally lick off every last drop of cum, just to I have another opportunity to get as close to her gorgeous fur as possible. But if you just want to bang her, than you are a disgusting degenerate, and I hope you burn in the deepest pits of tartarus. But Digby on the other hand.

Only a few hours pass before those camera news copter's are now relaying the live footage to the whole world: this has become a matter of international investment.

We don\u2019t need to macroscopic concepts for us to study and understand it\u2019s function. \n\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation states that we cannot know exactly where an electron with a certain energy level is, only the probability of us observing it somewhere in space relative to another coordinate. So a similar model must be constructed for the blowjob scenario, we cannot know who might be performing the action, but merely the probability of who it may be. \n\nPerhaps the probability is extremely low, but the most preferred observance of who is performing the blowjob would most definitely be Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger himself.",

Now the staff greets me with \"hey it's 3-for-free!\" and ALWAYS give me three ballots. It's such a fun and cool atmosphere at my local polling station, I go there at least 3 times a week for voting and a nice papermate pen with blue ink instead of black, 1-2 times for voting on the weekend, and maybe once around dinner when I'm in a rush but want a great ballot that is affordable, fast, and can meet Biden's daily electorate needs.

A bit of a stretch, but it could be plausible.\n\nThe nerf Bastion part could just be them wanting to be good sports? Really, though, Bastion isn\u2019t even overpowered, and might even be a bit weak.\n\nWhat REALLY doesn\u2019t make sense is how, if all 5 players stuck with their classes, they would have 4 damage classes and 1 tank, which is a horrible team set-up. To make things worse, the player trying to choose a character would probably also make an awful choice, seeing as he tried to play as McCree while the team already had 3 damage classes. Generally, 3 damage classes is the absolute maximum that you would want, and even then, having 2 is usually better.\n\nTLDR: the song makes a tiny bit more sense than somebody would think at first glance, but to play with any of these people would be horrible!",
