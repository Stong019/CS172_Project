            "Therefore, I am sorry to the end of the World War. I mean, they created Hitler a bad guy, when he should deal with justice, he went and committed to Suiz. WTF is his point of view. If FDR and Churchill are not fighting him in a great battle. save the world? Don't let me start from FDR! They just killed him through the war. Dulun is not worth winning the arc. His character is not about victory war. This is not about breaking two cities breaking interesting weapons. DEUS EX SUPER.\n\nThere is another thing that makes me angry, in the last concentration of the war, we found that Stalin is a bad face! This is our forecast. The exact killing of the role is about the release of the oppressor, and bringing a new system that does not have a bad handcuffs, who makes it a dictator?

            "I think you missed the extra episodes. They can be easy to since only some sites really show them. Early into the first season, Stalin killed a few weaker characters off in one of these but for some reason, it was cut from the main show. Maybe it was because it wasn't long enough to sit as its own but it was still pretty important. Another one in the last season also talked about Stalin's plans after the war. Talking about the extra episodes, most of them are actually about the super weapon but those tend to be a lot of science stuff so most streaming services like Netflix and Crunchyroll skip over those. \n\nBut I totally agree with the Truman and Hitler stuff.

because we had cold beans every day - she would smack us all five times with a shoe and say \"tough its all we can afford. i'm trying to feed a family of 93 with just half a silver buckington\", a silver buckington was about the same as half a penny back in the day. then we would head to school. we met up with the johnson kids from down the road, and walked the 1674 miles to school. on the way to school, we had to walk up a mountain so tall it extended to outer space. when we got to the top of the mountain, we would see the peterson boys on their fancy bikes - which they dont make like they used to, and we would race them down the mountain. then, when we got to school at 4 in the morning, the headmaster would come up to us and say \"you bloody kids are late\", then he would smack us all with the cane 10 times and tell us we had 7 years of detention. then, we went to class, and mr stevenson would say \"ok line up kids\", then he would spank us each 60 times, then hit us each with the cane 40 times each. then it was 7 at night and we had to walk home. then, when we got home, we'd ask \"whats for dinner mum?\", and she'd smack us each 50 times with a pan and say \"rotten cabage\". and if we complained, she would smack us each 100 times with a broom and say \"im trying to feed a family of 154 on just one islet sliver, just you wait until your dad gets home\" - now an islet silver was worth about as much as a grain of sand. then, when our dad got home from his job at the soot factory, he would hit us all 180 times with his belt. if we had been naughty, we would hit us all another 600 times. then, at 1:58, mum would say \"ok time for bed\". then, we got into our potato sacks, and she would hit us each with a shoe 8 times before we went to sleep. on saturdays, we went down to uncle bob's farm to work. we would have to walk 345 miles to the bus stop, then catch the route 4 bus for 56 stops. we would get on the bus and pay our fare of 3 teddy roses - now a teddy rose is worth about the same as a flake of skin. then, if the ticket inspector came to us, he would hit us all 4 times with his baton. if any of us had lost our ticket, we would hit us all 10 times again and throw us off the bus and we had to walk the rest of the way. when we got to the farm, uncle bob would drive to the gate in his tractor, hit us all 780 times with his crowbar, and tell us to get in his trailer so he could drive us to the farm house. then, we had to plow the fields with a toothbrush in the blazing summer heat - now, they dont make summers like they used to, so it was about 1345.4 degrees spencer, or 67 degrees centigrade using your new-fangled metric system. then, we would have to milk the cows - now, they dont make cows like they used to, so each cow weighed about 459 hog's heads, or 3.2 tonnes in your new-fangled metric system. if you touched a cows udder, it would kick you and you would die, so you had to be really careful when you milked the cows. then, when we were done, uncle bob would say \"ok kids time for your pocket money\". he would give us each 9 copper jemimahs - which are worth about one political promise each - and beat us each 6 times with his tractor before we left. on sundays, we would meet the johnson boys and go down to the river - now, they don't make rivers like they used to, so this river was about as wide as the whole of america, and as deep as the marianas trench, and it was filled with liquid tungsten. we would play by the old oak tree near the river, climbing on it and building tree houses and such. now - they don't make trees like they used to, so this tree had a trunk as thick as a city, and was tall enough that the branches on the top could scrape the moon. one day, little jimmy fell from the top of the tree. when he hit the ground, the only bit of his body we could recognise was his left eyeball. we picked up all his bits and rushed him to the doctors surgery. dr james said \"oh its just a scratch little jimmy dont worry pop a plaster on it and you'll be right\" and he gave little jimmy a plaster and a lollipop and he was ok. after we finished playing by the river, we would go into town and get some candy. now, back in the day, you could give the shopkeeper one bronze winglet - which is worth about as much as a ciggarette butt - and he would give you the entire stock of the store. so we would go and get our candy, and we'd go into the town square and eat it. now, we didn't have any of your fancy food laws back in the day, so there was all kinds of stuff in our candy. bleach, rust, bones--you name it. so we would always get a little hyper after our candy. one day, when we were hyper, we went up the mr boris's car, the only car in the town, and touched it. as we touched it, we saw dad storming down the street holding his belt. \"you kids, having fun while i work all day in the soot factory just so you can have grilled water for tea every night, i oughta smack you all\". we were sure he was going to smack us, but then he said \"no, i got a better idea, ill take you to see mr henderson, he'll set ya right\". now, dad had told us about mr henderson. mr henderson was a veteran from the great war, where he got a really bad injury, but we never knew what it was. dad walked us all down to the pub, and we saw a left testicle propped up on a pegleg. \"mr henderson,\" said dad, \"i have some kids here who need a good whooping\". then, mr henderson picked up the entire pub, and hit us each 4006 times with it. then, dad said \"right, i gotta go back to the soot factory, you kids run on home now\". now, by now it was 1pm, which meant it was curfew. while we were walking out of the town square, we heard a man shout \"oi you bloody kids, its curfew\". we turned around and saw the constable holding his baton. he hit us each 160265 times with his baton, then put us in gaol for 60123865 years. now - they don't make gaols like they used to - this one had 5 mile thick steel walls, and a single hole in the top let in some light. we were in there for about 13526 years, until mum baked the constable some cardboard pie so he would let us out. then, she hit us all 1292 times with a washboard, and grounded us for the rest of our lives. so don't you come complaining to me about nonsense like not having tv while hiking 25 miles to school.\n\nIntellectual property of\u00a0[u/OctagonalButthole](https://www.reddit.com/user/OctagonalButthole) with due royalties payed, if i see this copypasta without due credit, my team of 4 mods can promise you atleast 4 negative karma, ok?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: 6.9k ubdootle?

            "Can somebody do the math on how much this kid would be smacked in a year?",
            "Tell you kids, back in my day, we had it so rough... or so much better, i can't tell anymore. anyway, every day, we would wake up at 2 in the morning and go to the table for breakfast. we all lived in a closet, you see, so it was one room. and we would ask, me and my 64 brothers and 27 sisters, \"what's for breakfast mum?\". she would smack us all with a shoe and say \"cold beans\". and if we complained and said \"but we had cold beans yesterday\" - because we had cold beans every day - she would smack us all five times with a shoe and say \"tough its all we can afford. i'm trying to feed a family of 93 with just half a silver buckington\", a silver buckington was about the same as half a penny back in the day. then we would head to school. we met up with the johnson kids from down the road, and walked the 1674 miles to school. on the way to school, we had to walk up a mountain so tall it extended to outer space. when we got to the top of the mountain, we would see the peterson boys on their fancy bikes - which they dont make like they used to, and we would race them down the mountain. then, when we got to school at 4 in the morning, the headmaster would come up to us and say \"you bloody kids are late\", then he would smack us all with the cane 10 times and tell us we had 7 years of detention. then, we went to class, and mr stevenson would say \"ok line up kids\", then he would spank us each 60 times, then hit us each with the cane 40 times each. then it was 7 at night and we had to walk home. then, when we got home, we'd ask \"whats for dinner mum?\", and she'd smack us each 50 times with a pan and say \"rotten cabage\". and if we complained, she would smack us each 100 times with a broom and say \"im trying to feed a family of 154 on just one islet sliver, just you wait until your dad gets home\" - now an islet silver was worth about as much as a grain of sand. then, when our dad got home from his job at the soot factory, he would hit us all 180 times with his belt. if we had been naughty, we would hit us all another 600 times. then, at 1:58, mum would say \"ok time for bed\". then, we got into our potato sacks, and she would hit us each with a shoe 8 times before we went to sleep. on saturdays, we went down to uncle bob's farm to work. we would have to walk 345 miles to the bus stop, then catch the route 4 bus for 56 stops. we would get on the bus and pay our fare of 3 teddy roses - now a teddy rose is worth about the same as a flake of skin. then, if the ticket inspector came to us, he would hit us all 4 times with his baton. if any of us had lost our ticket, we would hit us all 10 times again and throw us off the bus and we had to walk the rest of the way. when we got to the farm, uncle bob would drive to the gate in his tractor, hit us all 780 times with his crowbar, and tell us to get in his trailer so he could drive us to the farm house. then, we had to plow the fields with a toothbrush in the blazing summer heat - now, they dont make summers like they used to, so it was about 1345.4 degrees spencer, or 67 degrees centigrade using your new-fangled metric system. then, we would have to milk the cows - now, they dont make cows like they used to, so each cow weighed about 459 hog's heads, or 3.2 tonnes in your new-fangled metric system. if you touched a cows udder, it would kick you and you would die, so you had to be really careful when you milked the cows. then, when we were done, uncle bob would say \"ok kids time for your pocket money\". he would give us each 9 copper jemimahs - which are worth about one political promise each - and beat us each 6 times with his tractor before we left. on sundays, we would meet the johnson boys and go down to the river - now, they don't make rivers like they used to, so this river was about as wide as the whole of america, and as deep as the marianas trench, and it was filled with liquid tungsten. we would play by the old oak tree near the river, climbing on it and building tree houses and such. now -

because we had cowd beans evewy day - she wouwd smack us aww five times with a shoe and say \"tough its aww we can affowd. i'm twying to feed a famiwy of 93 with just hawf a siwvew buckington\", a siwvew buckington was about the same as hawf a penny back in the day. then we wouwd head to schoow. we met up with the johnson kids fwom down the woad, and wawked the 1674 miwes to schoow. on the way to schoow, we had to wawk up a mountain so taww it extended to outew space. when we got to the top of the mountain, we wouwd see the petewson boys on theiw fancy bikes - which they dont make wike they used to, and we wouwd wace them down the mountain. then, when we got to schoow at 4 in the mowning, the headmastew wouwd come up to us and say \"you bwoody kids awe wate\", then he wouwd smack us aww with the cane 10 times and teww us we had 7 yeaws of detention. then, we went to cwass, and mw stevenson wouwd say \"ok wine up kids\", then he wouwd spank us each 60 times, then hit us each with the cane 40 times each. then it was 7 at night and we had to wawk home. then, when we got home, we'd ask \"whats fow dinnew mum?\", and she'd smack us each 50 times with a pan and say \"wotten cabage\". and if we compwained, she wouwd smack us each 100 times with a bwoom and say \"im twying to feed a famiwy of 154 on just one iswet swivew, just you wait untiw youw dad gets home\" - now an iswet siwvew was wowth about as much as a gwain of sand. then, when ouw dad got home fwom his job at the soot factowy, he wouwd hit us aww 180 times with his bewt. if we had been naughty, we wouwd hit us aww anothew 600 times. then, at 1:58, mum wouwd say \"ok time fow bed\". then, we got into ouw potato sacks, and she wouwd hit us each with a shoe 8 times befowe we went to sweep. on satuwdays, we went down to uncwe bob's fawm to wowk. we wouwd have to wawk 345 miwes to the bus stop, then catch the woute 4 bus fow 56 stops. we wouwd get on the bus and pay ouw fawe of 3 teddy woses - now a teddy wose is wowth about the same as a fwake of skin. then, if the ticket inspectow came to us, he wouwd hit us aww 4 times with his baton. if any of us had wost ouw ticket, we wouwd hit us aww 10 times again and thwow us off the bus and we had to wawk the west of the way. when we got to the fawm, uncwe bob wouwd dwive to the gate in his twactow, hit us aww 780 times with his cwowbaw, and teww us to get in his twaiwew so he couwd dwive us to the fawm house. then, we had to pwow the fiewds with a toothbwush in the bwazing summew heat - now, they dont make summews wike they used to, so it was about 1345.4 degwees spencew, ow 67 degwees centigwade using youw new-fangwed metwic system. then, we wouwd have to miwk the cows - now, they dont make cows wike they used to, so each cow weighed about 459 hog's heads, ow 3.2 tonnes in youw new-fangwed metwic system. if you touched a cows uddew, it wouwd kick you and you wouwd die, so you had to be weawwy cawefuw when you miwked the cows. then, when we wewe done, uncwe bob wouwd say \"ok kids time fow youw pocket money\". he wouwd give us each 9 coppew jemimahs -

            "Ah, it seems that you have met your end. Ah, what a pity. You know I, I don\u2019t feel too bad about it though, after all if it weren\u2019t me, it would\u2019ve just been one of the others I guess\u2026 I\u2019m honestly just glad to be out of those air ducts. You know it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s not easy for a hippopotamus to fit up there\u2026 and\u2026 not easy to get down either. I\u2019m not as young as I used to be as you can see, I used to be able to do all sorts of things, you\u2019re young, you\u2019re vibrant, you have that sort of pep in your step. Ah, it reminds me of a conversation I was having with one of my good friends Orville. We were having a nice picnic one day. I believe it was summer? Oh, perhaps it was\u2026 was it the fall? Yes, yes, it was the fall because the leaves had turned already. But I said to Orville, I- I says, \u201cOrville, I have a story to tell you.\u201d And Orville looked at me, you know, kind of odd and- and said, \u201cWell what\u2019s it about?\u201d I- I said to him, \u201cNot every story has to be about something Orville. Sometimes a person just wants to talk, why does it have to be a story?\u201d I said to him. He just looked at me and he said, \u201cWell y-y-you said you had a story.\u201d You know, he was quite right, I did in fact. I told him I had a story. I suppose if a person just wants to talk, it\u2019s best to not announce that you\u2019re tellin\u2019 a story. Tellin\u2019 a story does come with its own pressures and expectations I- I suppose. After all, if you\u2019re just talking to a friend then, there\u2019s no more expectations then if you were talking into the wind. Words\u2026 by themselves are not expected to carry\u2026 aren\u2019t expected to stick. But if, you know if you announce that you\u2019re tellin\u2019 a story well then\u2026 there better be a point to it all. No one wants to sit and listen to someone ramble on and on and on with absolutely no end in sight. So, you know, it\u2019s- it\u2019s good to be mindful that when you tell someone that you\u2019re about to tell a story, that you have something to say. Tellin\u2019 someone that you\u2019re gonna tell a story is tantamount to asking them to stop what they\u2019re doing, and pay attention. You\u2019re basically saying \u201chey, hey, hey buddy, stop everything, stop what you\u2019re thinking, I have a solution to everything.\u201d And well, I didn\u2019t really have any story to tell. In- in hindsight I probably just misspoke when I said that I had a story. I think it would\u2019ve just been better to tell Orville that I had something to tell him rather than tell him that I had a story, but you know e- even then it might\u2019ve put too much importance on the whole thing. Either way it was quite a nice day. I remember, I remember that we were drinking tea.",

            "Tell you kids, back in my day, we had it so rough... or so much better, i can't tell anymore. anyway, every day, we would wake up at 2 in the morning and go to the table for breakfast. we all lived in a closet, you see, so it was one room. and we would ask, me and my 64 brothers and 27 sisters, \"what's for breakfast mum?\". she would smack us all with a shoe and say \"cold beans\". and if we complained and said \"but we had cold beans yesterday\" - because we had cold beans every day - she would smack us all five times with a shoe and say \"tough its all we can afford. i'm trying to feed a family of 93 with just half a silver buckington\", a silver buckington was about the same as half a penny back in the day. then we would head to school. we met up with the johnson kids from down the road, and walked the 1674 miles to school. on the way to school, we had to walk up a mountain so tall it extended to outer space. when we got to the top of the mountain, we would see the peterson boys on their fancy bikes - which they dont make like they used to, and we would race them down the mountain. then, when we got to school at 4 in the morning, the headmaster would come up to us and say \"you bloody kids are late\", then he would smack us all with the cane 10 times and tell us we had 7 years of detention. then, we went to class, and mr stevenson would say \"ok line up kids\", then he would spank us each 60 times, then hit us each with the cane 40 times each. then it was 7 at night and we had to walk home. then, when we got home, we'd ask \"whats for dinner mum?\", and she'd smack us each 50 times with a pan and say \"rotten cabage\". and if we complained, she would smack us each 100 times with a broom and say \"im trying to feed a family of 154 on just one islet sliver, just you wait until your dad gets home\" - now an islet silver was worth about as much as a grain of sand. then, when our dad got home from his job at the soot factory, he would hit us all 180 times with his belt. if we had been naughty, we would hit us all another 600 times. then, at 1:58, mum would say \"ok time for bed\". then, we got into our potato sacks, and she would hit us each with a shoe 8 times before we went to sleep. on saturdays, we went down to uncle bob's farm to work. we would have to walk 345 miles to the bus stop, then catch the route 4 bus for 56 stops. we would get on the bus and pay our fare of 3 teddy roses - now a teddy rose is worth about the same as a flake of skin. then, if the ticket inspector came to us, he would hit us all 4 times with his baton. if any of us had lost our ticket, we would hit us all 10 times again and throw us off the bus and we had to walk the rest of the way. when we got to the farm, uncle bob would drive to the gate in his tractor, hit us all 780 times with his crowbar, and tell us to get in his trailer so he could drive us to the farm house. then, we had to plow the fields with a toothbrush in the blazing summer heat - now, they dont make summers like they used to, so it was about 1345.4 degrees spencer, or 67 degrees centigrade using your new-fangled metric system. then, we would have to milk the cows - now, they dont make cows like they used to, so each cow weighed about 459 hog's heads, or 3.2 tonnes in your new-fangled metric system. if you touched a cows udder, it would kick you and you would die, so you had to be really careful when you milked the cows. then, when we were done, uncle bob would say \"ok kids time for your pocket money\". he would give us each 9 copper jemimahs - which are worth about one political promise each - and beat us each 6 times with his tractor before we left. on sundays, we would meet the johnson boys and go down to the river - now, they don't make rivers like they used to, so this river was about as wide as the whole of america, and as deep as the marianas trench, and it was filled with liquid tungsten. we would play by the old oak tree near the river, climbing on it and building tree houses and such. now - they don't make trees like they used to, so this tree had a trunk as thick as a city, and was tall enough that the branches on the top could scrape the moon. one day, little jimmy fell from the top of the tree. when he hit the ground, the only bit of his body we could recognise was his left eyeball. we picked up all his bits and rushed him to the doctors surgery. dr james said \"oh its just a scratch little jimmy dont worry pop a plaster on it and you'll be right\" and he gave little jimmy a plaster and a lollipop and he was ok. after we finished playing by the river, we would go into town and get some candy. now, back in the day, you could give the shopkeeper one bronze winglet - which is worth about as much as a ciggarette butt - and he would give you the entire stock of the store. so we would go and get our candy, and we'd go into the town square and eat it. now, we didn't have any of your fancy food laws back in the day, so there was all kinds of stuff in our candy. bleach, rust, bones--you name it. so we would always get a little hyper after our candy. one day, when we were hyper, we went up the mr boris's car, the only car in the town, and touched it. as we touched it, we saw dad storming down the street holding his belt. \"you kids, having fun while i work all day in the soot factory just so you can have grilled water for tea every night, i oughta smack you all\". we were sure he was going to smack us, but then he said \"no, i got a better idea, ill take you to see mr henderson, he'll set ya right\". now, dad had told us about mr henderson. mr henderson was a veteran from the great war, where he got a really bad injury, but we never knew what it was. dad walked us all down to the pub, and we saw a left testicle propped up on a pegleg. \"mr henderson,\" said dad, \"i have some kids here who need a good whooping\". then, mr henderson picked up the entire pub, and hit us each 4006 times with it. then, dad said \"right, i gotta go back to the soot factory, you kids run on home now\". now, by now it was 1pm, which meant it was curfew. while we were walking out of the town square, we heard a man shout \"oi you bloody kids, its curfew\". we turned around and saw the constable holding his baton. he hit us each 160265 times with his baton, then put us in gaol for 60123865 years. now - they don't make gaols like they used to - this one had 5 mile thick steel walls, and a single hole in the top let in some light. we were in there for about 13526 years, until mum baked the constable some cardboard pie so he would let us out. then, she hit us all 1292 times with a washboard, and grounded us for the rest of our lives. so don't you come complaining to me about nonsense like not having tv while hiking 25 miles to school.",

which are worth about one political promise each - and beat us each 6 times with his tractor before we left. on sundays, we would meet the johnson boys and go down to the river - now, they don't make rivers like they used to, so this river was about as wide as the whole of america, and as deep as the marianas trench, and it was filled with liquid tungsten. we would play by the old oak tree near the river, climbing on it and building tree houses and such. now - they don't make trees like they used to, so this tree had a trunk as thick as a city, and was tall enough that the branches on the top could scrape the moon. one day, little jimmy fell from the top of the tree. when he hit the ground, the only bit of his body we could recognise was his left eyeball. we picked up all his bits and rushed him to the doctors surgery. dr james said \"oh its just a scratch little jimmy dont worry pop a plaster on it and you'll be right\" and he gave little jimmy a plaster and a lollipop and he was ok. after we finished playing by the river, we would go into town and get some candy. now, back in the day, you could give the shopkeeper one bronze winglet - which is worth about as much as a ciggarette butt - and he would give you the entire stock of the store. so we would go and get our candy, and we'd go into the town square and eat it. now, we didn't have any of your fancy food laws back in the day, so there was all kinds of stuff in our candy. bleach, rust, bones--you name it. so we would always get a little hyper after our candy. one day, when we were hyper, we went up the mr boris's car, the only car in the town, and touched it. as we touched it, we saw dad storming down the street holding his belt. \"you kids, having fun while i work all day in the soot factory just so you can have grilled water for tea every night, i oughta smack you all\". we were sure he was going to smack us, but then he said \"no, i got a better idea, ill take you to see mr henderson, he'll set ya right\". now, dad had told us about mr henderson. mr henderson was a veteran from the great war, where he got a really bad injury, but we never knew what it was. dad walked us all down to the pub, and we saw a left testicle propped up on a pegleg. \"mr henderson,\" said dad, \"i have some kids here who need a good whooping\". then, mr henderson picked up the entire pub, and hit us each 4006 times with it. then, dad said \"right, i gotta go back to the soot factory, you kids run on home now\". now, by now it was 1pm, which meant it was curfew. while we were walking out of the town square, we heard a man shout \"oi you bloody kids, its curfew\". we turned around and saw the constable holding his baton. he hit us each 160265 times with his baton, then put us in gaol for 60123865 years. now - they don't make gaols like they used to - this one had 5 mile thick steel walls, and a single hole in the top let in some light. we were in there for about 13526 years, until mum baked the constable some cardboard pie so he would let us out. then, she hit us all 1292 times with a washboard, and grounded us for the rest of our lives. so don't you come complaining to me about nonsense like not having tv while hiking 25 miles to school. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n Intellectual property of\u00a0[u/OctagonalButthole](https://www.reddit.com/user/OctagonalButthole) with due royalties payed, if i see this copypasta without due credit, my team of 4 mods can promise you atleast 4 negative karma, ok?",

because we had cold beans every day - she would smack us all five times with a shoe and say \"tough its all we can afford. i'm trying to feed a family of 93 with just half a silver buckington\", a silver buckington was about the same as half a penny back in the day. then we would head to school. we met up with the johnson kids from down the road, and walked the 1674 miles to school. on the way to school, we had to walk up a mountain so tall it extended to outer space. when we got to the top of the mountain, we would see the peterson boys on their fancy bikes -

            "Ah, but my dear karma-farmer, you are even a bigger fool than I. The slang word whoosh is spelled with two o's. And yes, I know what you are thinking inside whatever is the placeholder that substitutes your below 120 IQ brain. \"But the extra circular letters allow for emphasis, thus ridiculing you even more.\"\n\nWrong. Real smart innovators speak fast, like in that Social Network movie (based on true events). That spelling of woosh makes you seem you are taking your time to pronounce them, thus proving one of these two options. \n\n1. You are living in a plane where euphoria causes you to slow down your perception of time.\n\n2. You are a dumb wanker who needs to use extra o's just to insult higher-level beings\n\n(hint: the answer may upset you) ",

You tell how there's not change surface a stage in look it because it's virtuous deadening? The uncastrated earthly concern is like that for me.

When I went to the supermarket last week, my son pointed to the red trash can and started jumping and yelling, \"It's in us!\" This junk is SUS! Red is a con artist! As soon as he did, the manager told us to leave. I told him that my son was excited about something and I apologized. But the principal told us to leave anyway, so I picked up the red trash can my son was angry about and threw it over the principal's head. Then my son shouted \"DEAD BODY DECLARED\". Can anyone tell me what is wrong with him?",

            "It\u2019s a catch a killer game.  A group of strangers, some friends, are on a space station.\n\nAt the start, you are labeled a crew mate or an imposter (imposter = killer).  \n\nThe crewmen have jobs to do to make sure the station is intact and they don\u2019t run out of oxygen.\n\nThe imposters job is to kill the crew without anyone knowing it\u2019s them.\n\nPeriodically, everyone can vote someone out and that person is shot into space.\n\nIt sounds weird but it is fun for socializing.  It can teach you to read into what others say and catch them in lies.  My job involves positive manipulation so I love it!  But some kids do not totally understand these kinds of communication so it can be just a funny social game to them.  Or, if they try to pay attention... they are learning a valuable tool that can be used for good and evil haha.\n\nIt\u2019s a funny social game.  Sus means suspicious and a player who is called sus is likely to be shot into space by the vote.\n\nThe garbage can part... well, he could really point at anything and call it sus.  The avatars/characters you can choose to play as range from trash cans to Obama, bananas to a rum ham man riding a tiger.\n\nWhile I am new to VR, it can be a little too immersive.  I dreamt about it last night and woke up checking for my VR walls.  I am interested in the effect this could have on developing brains but at the same time, VR is undoubtably the future!  The possibilities for work are endless.  So growing up with vr will be a good thing.  Just make sure they are connecting with reality and nature.  Running and getting some sunlight.  I\u2019m 31.  I grew up escaping with Xbox and I am ashamed of time wasted but I have also had some incredibly fun times, stretched my imagination, and met great people from around the world!  However, I am aware that I want to wear my headset more than deal with reality.  The escape is both a passion and an addiction.  Positive and negative.  I need to force myself to workout this week because I\u2019m so infatuated with this unbelievably immersive escape.  It\u2019s amazing.\n\nYour kid is 13 and making shopping with mom fun.  He\u2019s using his imagination.  You could join in the fun!  If you see something [that looks like it has a face](https://www.boredpanda.com/objects-with-faces/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=organic) you could point it out and say it\u2019s suspicious haha.  Or draw faces on things around the house for him to find on his own!  \n\nAlso, you can play on the computer and pair up with those in VR.  So you could play the game with him too!  \n\nIf he\u2019s currently playing on the computer, a Quest 2 would be a great gift in the future!  It really is the future and will allow for greater productivity as well as making it easier to remotely work with a team from anywhere!\n\nFeel free to hit me up and send a message!  I understand your confusion.  Hold on to that story too.  It\u2019s pretty funny!",

To avoid execution, I volunteer myself to be Hitler\u2019s obedient fuck-toy.\n\nFor days, I allow Hitler to chain me up and obliterate all of my orifices like they\u2019re little Polands, constantly filling them with his aryan seed until his cock is stroked raw.\n\nHell, he even gives me the pleasure to lick his puckered german booty clean after he takes insane nuclear shits. Due to me not getting bathroom access, I constantly shit and piss myself, but Hitler is generous enough to be my personal cleanup, licking it all up and staining his beautiful mustache.\n\nAfter building up trust and showing my obedience, he unchains me and allows me to fuck his brains out, cursing in pleasure as he yells out, \u201cYA SHOVE IT REICH UP MY ASS!\u201d. I\u2019m generous enough to give him a reach around, cranking his throbbing war machine.\n\nI feel him tighten up as he reaches climax, but I let go of his thick ramrod as he begins to spew his nuclear ejaculate all over the floor. Hitler repeatedly yells out \u201cNEIN! NEIN! NEIN! NEIN!\u201d through his moans while he suffers through his ruined orgasm. At this point the tables have turned.\n\nHe tries to fight me off, but I pin him down and powerfully thrust my all-american cock harder into his poop chute as blood begins to build up and gush out of his torn asshole. I can\u2019t contain myself any longer, so I quickly pull out my 1911 and put a bullet through the back of Hitler\u2019s head. Brain matter and skull fragments paint the wall, which makes me break through to my climax.\n\nI raise my right arm up to the ceiling. I yell out \u201cSEIG HEIL!\u201d as my cock begins to rapidly pulsate. I quickly thrust my cock to the hilt deep inside of him. I throw my head back with a loud \u201cFUUUUCK!\u201d as I spew what feels like a gallon of american semen deep inside his german asshole.\n\nI pull my bloody cock out of his booty tube and watch in excitement as my thick load begins to leak out of his ass. Heavily breathing, I fall back and begin to fade out, as I watch a group of american soldiers burst into the room, guns drawn.\n\nI wake up in the hospital, in which I\u2019m told that I\u2019m praised as an american hero for stopping World War 2.",

            "Nobody:\nLiterally nobody:\nThis guy:\nFor context, this story takes place recently on September 28th 1918. So, I\u2019m a normal soldier in the British army, (M27) and I\u2019m fighting in the French village of Marcoing against the German army. I serve in the 5th Duke of Wellington\u2019s Regiment by the way.\n\nAnyways, in my line of fire is a man with a very weird kinda small mustache, and he seems wounded. He didn\u2019t even bother to shoot me. He seemed like he was gonna die in a matter of minutes anyway so I was like you know what? Why not let him go. Anyways, he nodded thanks and walked off.\n\nHowever about 21 years later I\u2019m watching my television as I just repaired it, and I see some army of people with a weird wavy symbol they wear on their arms or something. And then I realize their leader has the same mustache and face as the guy I spared! That\u2019s so WACKY!\n\nAnyways there\u2019s some kind of second Great War coming up because the mustache man I spared is invading something I don\u2019t know it\u2019s probably nothing.\n\nJust came on this subreddit to ask AITA?",

            "\nMy complaint about admins\n\nAs much as I enjoy writing letter after letter about admins, the fact remains that admins\u2019s snow jobs resonate with addlepated, contumacious ear bangers because of their emphasis on offering hatred with an intellectual gloss. Let me start by stressing that I am not attempting to suppress anyone\u2019s opinions, nor do I intend to demean admins personally for its beliefs or worldviews. But I, speaking as someone who is not a scrofulous fussbudget, do aver that I must curb admins\u2019s self-deluded and sanctimonious behavior. For the sake of clarity, let me quickly note that admins repeatedly expresses the view that everyone who doesn\u2019t share its beliefs is a cheeky crybully deserving of death and damnation. If the average Joe actually paused for a moment to analyze this dreck in a clear-eyed way, he\u2019d realize that admins\u2019s criticisms of my letters have never successfully disproved a single fact I ever presented. Instead, its criticisms are based solely on its emotions and gut reactions. Well, I refuse to get caught up in admins\u2019s \"I think\u2026 I believe\u2026 I feel\" game. You may be asking yourself, what in perdition does admins think it\u2019s doing? Well, if I knew that, I\u2019d be in Stockholm picking up my prize and a sizable check.\n\nFor the record, our national media is controlled by perverted, virulent paranoiacs. That\u2019s why you probably haven\u2019t heard that those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it. Of course, if admins had learned anything from history, it\u2019d know that the contemporaneity of metempirical and empirical evidence unravels the truism that I am confident that fair-minded readers of this letter will see that recidivism is, at its core, an unreasonable system that seeks to pit race against race, religion against religion, and country against country. (Yes, the Mad Hatter and the March Hare from \"Alice in Wonderland\" behave more rationally than admins and its condescending, two-faced hangers-on, but that\u2019s an entirely different story.)\n\nMaybe it\u2019s not fair to call admins\u2019s adherents \"demented\" just because they promote mentally deficient ideologies such as sciolism, but remember that today, we might have let admins replace our natural soul with an artificial one. Tomorrow, we won\u2019t. Instead, we will teach people that admins\u2019s support of philistinism reduces to privilege anxiety. It\u2019s afraid of losing its privileged status so it tries to thwart the rise of marginalized people by suppressing people\u2019s instinct and intellect. Such tyrannous, repressive behavior does little to change my view that it would be charitable of me not to mention that it is sympathetic to appalling causes of all stripes. Fortunately, I am not beset by a spirit of false charity so I will instead maintain that sometime in the future it will have more impact on Earth\u2019s biological, geological, and chemical systems during our lifetime and our children\u2019s than all preceding human generations had together. Fortunately, that hasn\u2019t happened\u2026yet. But it will clearly happen if we don\u2019t state unequivocally that admins coins polysyllabic neologisms to make its hastily mounted campaigns sound like they\u2019re actually important. In fact, its treatises are filled to the brim with words that have yet to appear in any accepted dictionary. As a parting thought, remember that admins can\u2019t be trusted.",

            "\n\nDear u/DennyDud, you're currently sat atop a mound of 189,532 karma. It feels great doesn't it? You must feel very strong inside your karma castle. But who sits inside that karma castle? It ain't a man or a woman. It's a little bitch. A little bitch who got so much karma they forgot what it means to be humble. I hope you're proud of your 189,532 karma points, while people like me sit here all day working out how to get just a fraction of that. I seriously hope you re-evaluate what you just said to me before further action needs to be taken.",
