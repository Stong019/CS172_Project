Their headbutt mechanic in such steep new mountains can easily make you fall 50 blocks if you're not careful. The Iceologer just adds even more danger to the mountains, which they don't need.

Did you think you were funny, giggling through that shit eating grin of yours, or were you really just that fucking stupid. Let me tell you tell you something, the glow squids don\u2019t even goddamn glow. They are lit up like enderman eyes so you can see them in the dark. That\u2019s it.

You have royalty butt-fucked the entire 1.17 update ruing the lives of countless peoples around the globe in the process. Are you happy? I hope when the glow squid is finally released you realize your mistake and sink into a deep depression. But it isn\u2019t me you should apologize to. It\u2019s your own family that had to raise a brain numb ingrate like yourself. And it\u2019s your own self that has to suffer under every increasingly stupid action you commit.

Before showing you this glitch I'd just like to take a minute and talk about what I want to do with the channel in the future. I know you guys have been liking my latest videos a lot but I'd love to see some comments on how to improve my videos in the future. And guys, last video had the amazing amount of likes of 1.000, so let's see if we can get more than that, maybe 2.000!! So be sure to smash that like button and if you haven't already, be sure to subscribe. If we make it to 2.000 likes, I might do a sharkcard giveaway next week, so you don't wanna miss it! So don't forget to both subscribe and hit that bell next to the subscribe button, and then apply for getting all my notifications, so you can be sure to see my next videos. I make a lot of daily GTA content that I'm sure will fit most of you guys out there. They range from glitches, to highlights and all kind of neat stuff. But if you're not only into GTA, that's ok, as I have a cool G2A coupon code: \"G1TGUD\", which gives you a whooping 3% off your purchases. And I'm not only giving you that coupon code so I can build up reward money from a shady company, but also give something back to you guys for helping  me out a ton on this channel.

I am thus stealing her humanity and reducing her to a sexual object.\n\nScenario 2: I jerk off to a porn actress\n\nIs this a sin: It might be\n\nI am committing lust unto the actress, however she did imply consent by uploading the video to a porn website specifically meant for masturbation.\n\nScenario 3: I jerk off to my own imagination\n\nIs this a sin: No\n\nSince I am using my own imagination, I am become a creator and a dreamer, just like God himself.

But, they did imply consent to me jerking off by uploading it to a porn website. But is it a sin to masturbate to sin? Perhaps God appreciates me only jerking off instead of asking out a boy in real life.
