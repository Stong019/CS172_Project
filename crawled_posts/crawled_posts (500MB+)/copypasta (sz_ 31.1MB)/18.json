            "I'm so sorry for your loss. Remember that there's no right way to grieve. Anger is normal, sadness is normal, apathy is normal. I hope that you have some kind of support around you. I felt insane after my mom died and I don't know what I would have done without my friends and fiance.\n\nMy mom was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer last February and was dead on her birthday, July 19th, less than 5 months later. It was brutal, both sudden and very much not. I felt so much grief, but also an intense feeling of relief. That emotion made me feel guilty; how can I feel relieved that my mother is dead! But it is normal and it took me several months to realize that. r/ChildrenofDeadParents was amazing source of comfort for me last year.\n\nHold onto those beautiful memories of your dad. Write them down in a journal so you can stay connected to him. Write out every detail you remember. Also, if the grief feels overwhelming, don't be ashamed to find a grief counselor or therapist. Just talking through the complicated emotions with someone neutral (and trained!) really helped me.\n\nAnd if the karma helps you feel a little better, I say fuck the haters. If there's one time you can be a karma-whore, I'd say death of a close loved one is it. Do whatever makes you feel a tiny ounce of happiness. I cried for basically 2 weeks straight afterward and I admit that the FB notifications from my mom's friends made me feel better.\n\nIf you'd like, I'd love to hear about your dad. Favorite band, favorite color? Hobbies? Did he like his job? What's your favorite story he told you?",

He's attempting direct eye contact but keeps looking away when he realizes I'm looking at him as well.\n\nHe rolls up next to me, breath stinking of sour cream and onion, and begins talking with me. Now, my mom didn't raise an impolite girl, so i conversate back and try my hardest not to be bothered by his foul body odor. \n\nEventually, he pulls out his phone and asks if I'd be interested in seeing his vegetable garden. At this point I'm just confused, surely someone who could roll down a hill faster than a car wouldn't be the biggest vegetable enthusiast, but no, he genuinely had a pretty nice little backyard garden, primarily he showed me pictures of his basil and tomatoes.\n\nSuddenly though, he puts his phone in his pocket, shuffles on his feet, putting his fingers together and asks if I'd be interested in dating him. I hardly knew the guy, and he's not my type at all, so i said \"uh, sorry, no\"\n\nHe then starts whining, describing in scary detail how he's \"tired of girls like me\", and rolls off.\n\nHas anyone else had similar interactions with boys and their vegetable gardens?",

            "In recent years, Reddit\u2019s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit\u2019s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry\u2019s next big thing.\n\nNow Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network\u2019s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.\n\n\u201cThe Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,\u201d Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. \u201cBut we don\u2019t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.\u201d\n\nThe move is one of the first significant examples of a social network\u2019s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI\u2019s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren\u2019t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors \u2014 automated duplicates to Reddit\u2019s conversations.\n\nReddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.\n\nReddit\u2019s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.\n\nL.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.\n\nThe underlying algorithm that helped to build Bard, Google\u2019s conversational A.I. service, is partly trained on Reddit data. OpenAI\u2019s Chat GPT cites Reddit data as one of the sources of information it has been trained on.\n\nOther companies are also beginning to see value in the conversations and images they host. Shutterstock, the image hosting service, also sold image data to OpenAI to help create DALL-E, the A.I. program that creates vivid graphical imagery with only a text-based prompt required.\n\nLast month, Elon Musk, the owner of Twitter, said he was cracking down on the use of Twitter\u2019s A.P.I., which thousands of companies and independent developers use to track the millions of conversations across the network. Though he did not cite L.L.M.s as a reason for the change, the new fees could go well into the tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nTo keep improving their models, artificial intelligence makers need two significant things: an enormous amount of computing power and an enormous amount of data. Some of the biggest A.I. developers have plenty of computing power but still look outside their own networks for the data needed to improve their algorithms. That has included sources like Wikipedia, millions of digitized books, academic articles and Reddit.\n\nRepresentatives from Google, Open AI and Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nReddit has long had a symbiotic relationship with the search engines of companies like Google and Microsoft. The search engines \u201ccrawl\u201d Reddit\u2019s web pages in order to index information and make it available for search results. That crawling, or \u201cscraping,\u201d isn\u2019t always welcome by every site on the internet. But Reddit has benefited by appearing higher in search results.\n\nThe dynamic is different with L.L.M.s \u2014 they gobble as much data as they can to create new A.I. systems like the chatbots.\n\nReddit believes its data is particularly valuable because it is continuously updated. That newness and relevance, Mr. Huffman said, is what large language modeling algorithms need to produce the best results.\n\n\u201cMore than any other place on the internet, Reddit is a home for authentic conversation,\u201d Mr. Huffman said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff on the site that you\u2019d only ever say in therapy, or A.A., or never at all.\u201d\n\nMr. Huffman said Reddit\u2019s A.P.I. would still be free to developers who wanted to build applications that helped people use Reddit. They could use the tools to build a bot that automatically tracks whether users\u2019 comments adhere to rules for posting, for instance. Researchers who want to study Reddit data for academic or noncommercial purposes will continue to have free access to it.\n\nReddit also hopes to incorporate more so-called machine learning into how the site itself operates. It could be used, for instance, to identify the use of A.I.-generated text on Reddit, and add a label that notifies users that the comment came from a bot.\n\nThe company also promised to improve software tools that can be used by moderators \u2014 the users who volunteer their time to keep the site\u2019s forums operating smoothly and improve conversations between users. And third-party bots that help moderators monitor the forums will continue to be supported.\n\nBut for the A.I. makers, it\u2019s time to pay up.\n\n\u201cCrawling Reddit, generating value and not returning any of that value to our users is something we have a problem with,\u201d Mr. Huffman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time for us to tighten things up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe think that\u2019s fair,\u201d he added.",
