            "This is why whenever I see neurotypicals happily encouraging unknowing mentally ill people to call suicide hotlines, I feel sickly inside as to how ableist our world has really become.\n\nMentally ill people are essentially second class citizens, with reduced rights, protection, and treatment. We aren't seen as people with a problem, we are seen as the problem. Because in capitalism, it doesn't matter if you are happy or not, what matters if you can work and make money for the ruling class. Efforts to \"help\" us by neurotypicals are directed not to making our lives envious - something worth living - but to ensure that we stay alive and get back into the workplace at all costs.\n\nSuicide hotlines in particular are not to be trusted. They are legally required to call the cops on you to have you arrested and involuntarily committed if you are completely truthful about why you are calling them and don't hold back on your feelings. If you call them, that's fine, but do not ever give them an inch for them to think that you are genuinely thinking about suicide. They will lock you up, slap you with a costly bill, and kick you out feeling even worse.\n\nAgain, Capital doesn't care if you are happy or in perpetual misery. As long as you are a good little wage slave and it is impossible to end your life, Capital is satisfied. This bleeds into the ideology of capitalism that affects almost everyone who lives under it, creating an unfortunate reality - almost no one cares about you. Not even if you are severely mentally ill. But the moment others realize you are suicidal, that is when others suddenly \"care\" for you and spring into action to stop your choice, because it's not about whether you have a quality happy life or not - it's never been about that - it's about you staying alive so everyone else can continue to go on their lives as if nothing is different. The status quo is maintained. Even if you can't be treated, either because you don't have enough money or time (most mentally ill people are poor), or you have already tried so many medications that don't work and there is no end in sight, or even worse - your mental illness is treatment resistant - even if there is no possible hope for you in this living hell, you will be shackled, your autonomy stripped, needlessly enduring excruciating pain on a daily basis just so the status quo is maintained.\n\nSome of us are aware of this phenomenon, including me. Years ago in my final year of high school, a person in my class committed suicide. I didn't know him very well, but everyone knew him enough to know that he was bullied for all his years at elementary and middle school, and was avoided/neglected in his high school years. He only had a couple of friends. He failed all of his high school courses and wasn't even on the path to graduation. When the school announced his death the next day, it's as if everyone was suddenly his best friend. All around there was crying, people subtly competing about who knew him better. Even his former bullies joined in about how much they \"cared\" about this person and were sad that he was dead.\n\nAnd then a week later, they all forgot about it as if it was nothing.\n\nThis is the unfortunate reality. Had any of these people truly cared, they would have never bullied him, never avoided him, never talked behind his back, never denied him his humanity. The only time they seemed to care was to virtue signal so as to absolve themselves of their actions.\n\nCapital will do anything to force people to stay alive against their very will, even use deception to do it. For anyone who has been involuntarily committed before, they know what I am talking about. Every time you see a statistic about how no one ever wants to attempt suicide again after they fail once, that data often comes from hospitals who question the involuntarily committed if they are still suicidal. If you are foolish enough to say yes, you stay locked up even longer, accumulating a far greater amount of debt to pay. If you know what's up and say no, even if it is not true, they let you go. This is only one example of the statistics surrounding mental illness and suicide being warped through coercion and other deceptive tactics to deliver an ideal message. In reality, often once you have attempted suicide, your body and/or mind is too damaged to make another attempt, you are too afraid of failing again, and/or your circle of people who associate with you will be more careful and stricter to ensure that the opportunities for you to die don't appear again.\n\nThere is so much wrong with mental healthcare and the attitude towards mental illness in our world that I could talk about it forever. It wasn't that long ago that the barbaric practice of lobotomizing the mentally ill was considered so popular and \"effective\" that the person who started the practice was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize for it. I guarantee all of you that what our society has been doing to the mentally ill in today's era will be considered just as barbaric 100 years from now.... if humanity even lives that long.",

            "**No one:**\n\n**JK ROWLING:**  Harry's mouth dropped open as he stepped into the Gryffindor common room for the first time. Scarlet and gold drapes hung over windows that overlooked the lake, and the wooden paneling \u2013 far cry from what Harry had grown accustomed to seeing beneath the Dursleys' staircase \u2013 gave the entire space an atmosphere of regality.\n\n\"Your bed's over here!\" shouted Ron, pulling Harry's attention away from the finery. \"Look, it's got your initials on it and everything!\"\n\nIt wasn't nearly the most wondrous thing that Harry had seen that day, but the sight of the gently curling H and P brought tears to his eyes. He had only entered the room moments before, but already, he felt like he was home. It was unlike any...\n\n\"Um, excuse me!\" came a nasal voice from behind. \"It's impolite to assume that you are the only individual with those initials. That bed could very well belong to someone else.\"\n\nA brief tremor of shock caused Harry's heart to jump as he turned and regarded the boy who had spoken. For a moment, he had been certain that Dudley had somehow managed to follow him: A rotund, almost spherical body gave way to a piggish face, and the sneer of superiority (glaring out from behind too-thick glasses) was one that Harry had seen almost daily. In stark contrast to everyone else, the young man was clad in a bright shirt emblazoned with some oddly designed cartoon characters, and an enormous pillow was held tightly against his body with one pudgy hand.\n\n\"Oh, hello, Kevin,\" Ron muttered, rolling his eyes. \"I see you brought your... pillow.\"\n\nAn indignant snort preceded Kevin's next words. \"Um, actually, she's my waifu. I wouldn't expect normies to understand.\"\n\n\"'Waifu?'\" Harry repeated. \"'Normies?'\"\n\n\"No, don't...\" Ron began, but he was interrupted by a long sigh from Kevin.\n\n\"Yes, my waifu!\" The boy looked down at his pillow. \"Asuna-chan, introduce yourself!\"\n\nBefore Harry's eyes, the pillow suddenly came to be occupied by another cartoon character, this one female... and wearing very little clothing. Like the portraits Harry had encountered, the figure moved, blinked, appeared to breathe, and gave every indication of being alive. Her too-large eyes stared at Harry with an expression that almost seemed to reflect a kind of desperation.\n\n\"Please end my suffering,\" the pillow said.\n\n\"That means she's pleased to meet you,\" Kevin explained. \"Of course, she's mostly happy to see me.\" \"I don\u2019t want to be here,\" continued the cartoon woman.\n\n\"Yes, well, nice to meet you, too,\" Harry replied. He was uncertain of how else to respond... and something about the figure's voice gave him the idea that she wasn't exactly thrilled by her lot in life. Ron stepped forward, putting himself between Harry and Kevin. \"Leave it alone, Kevin!\" he snarled. \"Nobody wants to hear about your strange obsession with Japanese wizardry!\"\n\n\"Um, actually,\" the boy answered, once again sneering, \"the Japanese are far more advanced in culture than Britain could ever hope to be. I'm planning to transfer to Hont\u014d no bashode wa arimasen as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"Please don\u2019t leave me...\" the pillow muttered. Kevin responded with something that sounded mispronounced, then waddled off to a bed at the far side of the room.\n\n\"Sorry about him,\" whispered Ron. \"Just be glad you didn't get close enough to smell him.\"\n\nHarry sighed to himself. He still had a lot to learn about the wizarding world.",

            "I just downvoted your comment.\n\n\\#FAQ\n\n\\#What does this mean?\n\nThe amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.\n\n\\#Why did you do this?\n\nThere are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Rudeness towards other Redditors,\n* Spreading incorrect information,\n* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.  \n\n\n\\#Am I banned from the Reddit?\n\nNo - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.\n\n\\#I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?\n\nSure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.\n\n\\#How can I prevent this from happening in the future?\n\nAccept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: got suspended for spamming this",

            " Number 15: Burger king foot lettuce. The last thing you'd want in your Burger King burger is someone's foot fungus. But as it turns out, that might be what you get. A 4channer uploaded a photo anonymously to the site showcasing his feet in a plastic bin of lettuce. With the statement: \"This is the lettuce you eat at Burger King.\" Admittedly, he had shoes on. But that's even worse.\n\nThe post went live at 11:38 PM on July 16, and a mere 20 minutes later, the Burger King in question was alerted to the rogue employee. At least, I hope he's rogue. How did it happen? Well, the BK employee hadn't removed the Exif data from the uploaded photo, which suggested the culprit was somewhere in Mayfleld Heights, Ohio. This was at 11:47. Three minutes later at 11:50, the Burger King branch address was posted with wishes of happy unemployment. 5 minutes later, the news station was contacted by another 4channer. And three minutes later, at 11:58, a link was posted: BK's \"Tell us about us\" online forum. The foot photo, otherwise known as exhibit A, was attached. Cleveland Scene Magazine contacted the BK in question the next day. When questioned, the breakfast shift manager said \"Oh, I know who that is. He's getting fired.\" Mystery solved, by 4chan. Now we can all go back to eating our fast food in peace.",

            "Every person who is acquainted with the Marvel Comics\u2122 characters have the belief that Scott Lang, the \"Ant-Man\", could lead to the mad titan and ultra powerful being known as \"Thanos\" to implode and thus cease to maintain life by contracting to a micro size, ascending into the titan's external opening of the rectum, and retracting until he becomes of formidable size or larger. I, a fellow individual belonging to the species homo sapiens, have pondered over this exact scientific hypothesis, and, using inductive reasoning, have concluded that there cannot exist a possibility of a worse way for the hero Ant Man to cease to live. Thanos, given his unparalleled prowess,  is strong enough to withstand such petty adverse conditions. This fact can be proved by examining the following evidence: Bruce Banner, who transforms into the Hulk, has displayed feats of miraculous strength, and even he was not powerful enough to harm the mad titan with his barrage of blows. Given this premise it is not hard to assume that Thanos' own anus and other internal organs are just as durable and capable of withstanding the aforementioned barrage of blows dealt by Dr. Bruce Banner.\n\nIn this precise way that I happen to scrutinize the issue, if Scott Lang, known as Ant-man, was to be crawling up Thano's rectum abyss, expanding as according to the aforementioned hypothesis, the supposed (for a lack of a better metaphor)  chunky \u201chuman soup\u201d that resembles feces would be ejected at speeds that would be akin to the idea of \"flying\" out of Thanos\u2019 rectum area because the Ant-man would be trying to expand into a forbidden and strengthened area that is impossible to be affected with his own power.",

            "My relationship to academic writing is a tumultuous one. I don\u2019t even know where to begin, let alone how to officially start. For me, I don\u2019t utilize rough drafts and my thoughts come out in a disorganized fashion. It\u2019s difficult to find coherency with my inner dialogue when I\u2019m working on articulating what I need\u2014or more importantly, want\u2014 to say.  I am lead to believe that my writing style is an idiosyncratic one\u2014one that does not bode well in a formal context or assignment; whatever that is\u2014or most realizing, the one I\u2019m relegated to demonstrating here. There are challenges because I never quite learnt the \u2018proper\u2019 way to go about deciphering texts and investigate into the depths of the literal English language. There are many things that I need to work on; however, I am also blind sighted because I don\u2019t know where to point and seek advice on. Perhaps my stream of consciousness as I present here will foretell those who possess more mastery of such discipline who can not only identify, but guide, lead, and enlighten me in my aware but limited ways.\nWith such disclaimer said, the most challenging part of all-things academic writing and reading related can be the organized, logical, coherent fashion that language is structured. As a contrasting example, I had a short-lived stint in taking a foreign language in college preparatory school\u2014Latin\u2014where I vividly remember that the word order differed entirely from English. It offered more flexibility. Contrary to this, English from my understanding requires meticulous syntax; subject must come first, before the verb, then the object. Both languages, nonetheless, require exquisite detail and adherence to their respective grammar and proper conjugation. However, what bothered me the most is that English as a whole, is the stringent necessity of having strict syntax; it is very rule-oriented and for someone that is naturally disorganized; rules and organization for writing puts added pressure onto me as a writer. Sometimes I ask, \u201cAm I following the rules? \u201c\nAnother challenge to writing/reading of the academe is the necessity to quickly identify the thesis \u2013the point\u2014of whatever text is assigned to me. I am a person of wanderlust, yet only that lust is not travel but in my imagination. Focus is something that I woefully lack in academic reading.  I have many more questions that arise, and in turn, obfuscate my understanding of the topic at hand. I begin to deviate my focus from the subject/assignment and delve into variant topics. I am a thinker of limited capacity to response thoughtfully to what I\u2019m reading. To reference Anne Lamott\u2019s The Crummy First Draft is a pain and nuisance, if I let alone remember to do so. I often time feel I must deliberately pick superficial passages to find a sentence or two as \u201cexamples\u201d to \u201csupport my statement.\u201d Perhaps as Ms. Lamott says, \u201cAlmost all good writing begins with terrible first efforts.\u201d proves that my \u2018first effort\u2019 here is just that\u2014terrible.\nI suppose I don\u2019t have any direct knowhow of explaining things coherently, in an organized fashion, so perhaps my style has in attempts to pursue this writing Sample for Niteo Writing Seminar of the Fall 2015 semester resulted in satire about my inadequacies in commanding the English language. I hope to determine if my writing here can salvaged, let alone learn if it\u2019s worth being salvaged. Perhaps my efforts can be revitalized and reinvigorated into something more tangible and practical that is acceptable for the academe. Perhaps I\u2019ll be able to do this by the end of the class, or at least provide as a foundation and steppingstone to some pathway towards there. Perhaps not. What I do know is that I have a long ways to go in my writing from the point of leaving \u201cprep school\u201d and my academic writing/reading today.\n ",

            "I just downvoted your comment.\n\n# FAQ\n\n# What does this mean?\n\nThe amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.\n\n# Why did you do this?\n\nThere are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Rudeness towards other Redditors,\n* Spreading incorrect information,\n* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.\n\n# Am I banned from the Reddit?\n\nNo - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.\n\n# I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?\n\nSure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.\n\n# How can I prevent this from happening in the future?\n\nAccept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",
