And every time I'd burst into an insane, breath deprived laugh staring at the image as the words AMOGUS ran through my head. It's torment, psychological torture, I am being conditioned to laugh maniacly any time I see an oval on a red object. I can't fucking live like this... I can't I can't I can't I can't I can't! And don't get me fucking started on the words! I'll never hear the word suspicious again without thinking of among us. Someone does something bad and I can't say anything other than \"sus.\" I could watch a man murder everyone I love and all I would be able to say is \"red sus\" and laugh like a fucking insane person. And the word \"among\" is ruined. The phrase \"among us\" is ruined. I can't live anymore. Among us has destroyed my fucking life. I want to eject myself from this plane of existence. Make it STOP!",

These include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Being gay\n* Dank copypasta bro, where'd you find it\n* walter\n\n# Am I going to shit and cum too?\n\nNo - not yet. But you should refrain from shitposting and cumposting like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to shit and cum again, which may put your shitting and cumming privileges in jeopardy.\n\n# I don't believe my comment deserved being shit and cum at. Can you un-cum it?\n\nSure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I put shit back into my butt. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a hot load explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to retaliatory ejaculation within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of semen dies before it can fertilize the egg, and yours is likely no exception.\n\n# How can I prevent this from happening in the future?\n\nAccept the goopy brown and white substance and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated in my mom's basement. I will continue to shit and cum until you improve your conduct. Remember: ejaculation is privilege, not a right.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Not only have i not heard back from your Corporate headquarter of any further developments regarding my participation in your contest, i have also not received any notification by your company that my submission to your contest has been accepted. \n\nIt pains me to tell you that although no definite answer was given by Your company or any of its officials, my youtube video of me moving back my freshly re-attached foreskin post-Op has led youtube to censor my account and i have been suspended and locked out of my youtube account without further notice. \n\nPlz get back to me ASAP, i would really like to know if i am eligible to join the contest given the fact that my foreskin has only recently been reattached (yet before my submission) or if my submission was accepted. I'd also would love for your referral as to how I can get back my youtube account seeing how my livelihood depends on me performing puppetry shows for children.  It would really be the worst possible outcome if not only would i neither win the graphics card nor even know if i were eligible to win now that i am unemployed and chased online by a mob of parents for uploading a video of my foreskin reattachment to my youtube channel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank You and looking forward for further clarification in these messy times\n\nBob",

The Native Americans, who had more respect for nature than anyone, gladly dropped their spears and bows for guns, because guns were more efficient and humane. Third, the point of hunting isn\u2019t to go Rambo and prove how macho a person is. For a lot of us, that\u2019s how we feed our families.

You don\u2019t see all the early mornings, blood sweat and tears, trekking into the backcountry, and coming home empty handed. Those photos aren\u2019t to impress you or people like you.

            "Copied and pasted into the sub, here's the response:\n\n\nOkay. So, I\u2019ve been seeing this copypasta floating around about wanting to \u201cbang the Terraria Zoologist\u201d, and frankly- I think this is disgusting. First of all, her name isn\u2019t \u201cthe Terraria Zoologist\u201d, it\u2019s Astria. It\u2019s a beautiful name for a beautiful person, and you would all do well to refer to her as such. If you don\u2019t even know her name, than you have no right wanted to have sex with her!\n\nSecondly, wanting to bang her is just gross. Saying that you want to bang Astria is objectifying her, and it is not okay. If you\u2019ve ever wanted to bang Astria, you should be disgusted with yourself.\n\nUnlike you cretins, I however- respect her. Sure, it\u2019s possible I may consider her to be rather bangable, but I wouldn\u2019t dare do such a thing. Astria is a fucking queen, and deserves to be treated as such.\n\nI DO NOT want to bang \u201cThe Terraria Zoologist\u201d. I want to hug her. I want to be in a healthy and loving relationship with Astria. I want to wake up every morning in bed, with her lying peacefully next to me as the morning sun shines in through the window. I want to make her breakfast every morning, and tend to her every need. I want her to feel like she is truly loved, (because she is). I want her to be by my side for my whole life, because I know that she is the perfect woman for me, and I am perfect for her.\n\nI want to be to be with her every day, just so I can tell her how much I fucking love her. I want her to know how much I adore everything amazing personality, her incredible fashion sense, her extremely impressive zoology abilities, and her absolutely beautiful head to body ratio, and her beautiful, beautiful eyes.\n\nHowever, if I were to ever have sex with Astria, I wouldn\u2019t simply be \u201cbanging\u201d her. If Astria were to ever consent to me having sexual intercourse with her, it would be tender and loving and passionate. As we make love, I\u2019d slowly and gently caress her soft, orange fur as I slowly but deliberately thrust into her tight fox pussy. I would make her pleasure my utmost priority, with my own being secondary. But if she was willing, than oh god. What I wouldn\u2019t give to feel her adorable little paws running up and down the length of my shaft. I just wanna pet every inch of her body, and give her scritches on her tummy so she does that thing that foxes do where their legs spaz out. That\u2019d just be so fucking hot. I\u2019d probably end up cumming all over her, so it gets in her fur. But goddamn. I love that fur so much, that I\u2019d personally lick off every last drop of cum, just to I have another opportunity to get as close to her gorgeous fur as possible.\n\nBut if you just want to bang her, than you are a disgusting degenerate, and I hope you burn in the deepest pits of tartarus.\n\nBut the guide on the other hand. Now he\u2019s somebody that I\u2019d wanna bang.",

If you\u2019ve ever wanted to bang Astria, you should be disgusted with yourself.\n\nUnlike you cretins, I however- respect her. Sure, it\u2019s possible I may consider her to be rather bangable, but I wouldn\u2019t dare do such a thing. Astria is a fucking queen, and deserves to be treated as such.\n\nI DO NOT want to bang \u201cThe Terraria Zoologist\u201d. I want to hug her. I want to be in a healthy and loving relationship with Astria. I want to wake up every morning in bed, with her lying peacefully next to me as the morning sun shines in through the window. I want to make her breakfast every morning, and tend to her every need. I want her to feel like she is truly loved, (because she is). I want her to be by my side for my whole life, because I know that she is the perfect woman for me, and I am perfect for her.\n\nI want to be to be with her every day, just so I can tell her how much I fucking love her. I want her to know how much I adore everything amazing personality, her incredible fashion sense, her extremely impressive zoology abilities, and her absolutely beautiful head to body ratio, and her beautiful, beautiful eyes.\n\nHowever, if I were to ever have sex with Astria, I wouldn\u2019t simply be \u201cbanging\u201d her. If Astria were to ever consent to me having sexual intercourse with her, it would be tender and loving and passionate. As we make love, I\u2019d slowly and gently caress her soft, orange fur as I slowly but deliberately thrust into her tight fox pussy. I would make her pleasure my utmost priority, with my own being secondary. But if she was willing, than oh god. What I wouldn\u2019t give to feel her adorable little paws running up and down the length of my shaft. I just wanna pet every inch of her body, and give her scritches on her tummy so she does that thing that foxes do where their legs spaz out. That\u2019d just be so fucking hot. I\u2019d probably end up cumming all over her, so it gets in her fur. But goddamn. I love that fur so much, that I\u2019d personally lick off every last drop of cum, just to I have another opportunity to get as close to her gorgeous fur as possible.\n\nBut if you just want to bang her, than you are a disgusting degenerate, and I hope you burn in the deepest pits of tartarus.\n\nBut the guide on the other hand.

            " Ok, you're acting like there is so much difference between when the man is doing a survey and when he's not. But what is the difference honeslty? Why do you care? You're showing your tits in both scenarios, the man's intention doesn't effect me right? Beside, there can even be more scenarios than just weather or not he's doing a survey. There can be different scenarios with each its own amount of 'wanting to see tits'. It's not a black and white situation. We're not in the segregation era anymore. Do you now see now how ridiculous you sound?\n At the end, nothing matters. Beside, if I can show him my tits and make him happy - weather it be by helping him with his survey OR with sexual impulse - well, either way... It's a good thing, right? What matters is that we all have the ability make a man's day better by doing a very simple and easy task. Rich or poor, smart or dumb, spider-armed and good at multitasking or amputee, we all have the power to make change a male person's life. That is the only thing that matters, and possibly... our mission.\n So, ladies, let's all take our clothes off. Let's all fet to our knees or on all-fours and start sucking. This is what we were created for, and I am happy to be born the way I was. Every men on earth deserve die of pleasure form our bodies and our fucked up fetishes. Ugly, fat, weird kink - nothing matters, we all have the same power. Let's all run to the nearest man and lash out all our sexual desire to them without consent. And finally, let's brutally murder them - as they will never be able to experience a bigger pleasure in their life, it is too cruel to let them leave any longer.",
