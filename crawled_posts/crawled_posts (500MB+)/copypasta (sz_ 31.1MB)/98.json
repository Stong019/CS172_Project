            "Normal horses are better.\n\nHorse pussy is honestly a gift from god. Yesterday I was tending to my mares and just noticed that Beffica (my strongest white purebred) had the wettest equine pussy I had ever laid my peepers on. I immediately dove in headfirst and started eating her out. She whinnied in pleasure as I devoured her horsey snatch. Soon I could feel her about to horse cum so I reverse-vored myself inside her and tickled her ovaries until she unleashed a torrent of horse squirt on my eager face. I was far from done though, and so I decided to whip out my genetically engineered horse cock and give her a round two. Beffica looked at me with a horse lust in her eyes and I pounded the absolute shit out of her. Before long, all four of her horse legs were on their horse knees and his cock was 26 inches deep inside her. I felt a tightening in my whole body before surreptitiously unloading an absolutely monstrous explosion of ejaculate that emptied my sack and completely filled Beffica to burst. My seed started to leak out around my balls and Beffica collapsed in a cummy heap. My phallus retracted back into my lower intestine and I collapsed in exhaustion. All of a sudden, I was flipped on my stomach and my pants were ripped from me. It was Beffica! I craned my head to the left and noticed something I hadn\u2019t seen before. A monstrous horse donger was cradled in between her legs. I shuddered, never having gotten to 7th base (pegging) before. I had barely a second to prepare myself before what felt like at least 30 inches of rock hard femcock entered my tight virgin asshole, ripping me nearly in two. It honestly felt like I was being ripped in half, and of course after 3 or so hours she came. And when I say she came, I mean she came! I had filled her dripping wet Hussy with cum, no doubt almost a litre. She, on the other hand, unleashed what had to be at least a milk jug\u2019s worth of cum into my raw and bleeding asshole. I honestly didn't expect it to be as hot as it was, which definitely made up for being raped by a horse. I crawled to my knees, horse batter dripping from my pooter and shivered slightly. I still needed to tend to the other horses and it was already 7pm. Sigh. I pulled my ripped cowboy jeans back on and placed my leather cap on my head, and made my way to the door, I gave a wink to sweet Beffica, and she simply neighed and shot another glob of cum in my direction. I caught it, and used it to smoothen my hair. Did you know that horse cum is great for the skin, scalp, dandruff and as a hair gel? I learned that yesterday too.",

Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life. He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful, the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic... He could save others from death, but not himself.",

        "selftext": "\nEver since I was a wee lad, I noticed my penis was a bit large. I thought it was normal, untill my mom bathed me with my brother and I saw his little wee wee compared to mine, I couldn't help but point at it and mock it. A few months later when I started kindergarden, the teacher inspected our cocks for the monthly cock inspection, and noticed my large dick. I was very young but I could still see he was very envyous of my humongous cock, knowing he will never be as big, he called my mom and told her a doctor should see my penis. The doctor said he had never seen such an amazing specimen of a dong, that was the first moment I saw pride in my mom's eyes. I cherish these memories, as the cock inspection was the pinnacle of any month for me, seeing all the other pathetic little weiners. I loved watching the other kids take quick glances of my cock in fear and shame.\n\nA few years later when I was about 11 years old, my penis has started to become a burden for me. Having a 24.089 inch dick in 6th grade is no joke, I had to come up with creative ideas of where to hide the magnificent beast. Usually I hid it inside the right leg of my pants, kids always thought it was weird how my right leg was so \"muscular\" compared to my other, which meant I had to workout only my left leg in order to not arouse suspicion. I remember I went home depressed one day, crying to god on why did he curse me with such a shaft. I was tearing my pants with anger, when I started to feel tingly sensation in my penis. I started rubbing it, and suddenly it GREW EVEN LONGER, I was devestated because I thought it was already too large, but the feeling I had when I was rubbing it was too good to stop. I started holding it with both my hands and stroking it, but it was not enough, I could not satisfy my monster with mere hands, so I began using my feet too. The feeling was incredible, god was on my side again. As I was rubbing it faster and faster, I thought of my science teacher. My cock was throbbing, my nipples erect, my eyes wide and open. I was on my bed at the time, and I felt my Johnson about to erupt with tremendous force, I didn't know what to do so I hid under the bed, and then I came. It was like 4th of july. At first the stream was steady, of white cream in about 1 liter per second, then it was chaos. My penis was going up and down dancing with explosions of cum(Only later that day I found out my grandpa died at that moment of a heart attack because the sounds reminded him of bastogne when he was fighting the Germans). After a few second I realized I might drown because my juice covered the whole floor about two inch deep, I quickly slid across pools of cum gasping for air, I stood up and finally my cum gun started to relax. My mom came into the room shocked and disgusted, she yelled at me that I must see a doctor and get my manhood shortend or even removed. We had a fight for about three hours not noticing my grandpa was awfully quiet.\n\nThe day after my grandfather's funeral, I came to the doctor's office, and told him my story. After a lengthy cock inspection, he said that I have a rare condition, which makes my cock grow exponentially with each year, width and length. He calculated that my cock would weigh 200 kg when I turn 30, which is about the maximum weight my spine can support, beyond that and it would fracture and I'll die. I asked him if I could remove it, but he said no because I would die of blood loss. He also said I need to do blood transfusions everyday to feed my absolute unit of a scholng the blood it needs. Needless to say I was devestated, my once blessing, became a curse, again.\n\nOne day when I was 16, I was in my math class when I heard a terrible noise, it reminded me of the first time I was beating my meat, but it turns out it was just a gunshot. Kids all around me where shouting that there was a school shooter. I immediately got up and ran to the door, carrying my pack with my hands. Suddenly I heard shots very close to my ears, and saw dead bodies on the ground, so I ran into the closest door which was the janitor's room, closed the door and hid under the table making as little noise as possible. Little did I know, my crush was under the same table, hiding there in fear, when she saw me she almost screamed, but I put my hand over her mouth and told her to be quiet. I heard the shooter opening the door slowly and looking for me. I was completely silent, but then I noticed my crush's incredible bajongas, and I felt my cock starting to throb and expand. She seemed to notice, and I could see that she was impressed with my goofy goober. Her facial expression made my ding dong enlarge even more and I could feel my pants starting to tear apart. My shclong abong seemed to send electro-magnetic waves all over the room because the light above us started to flicker with every throb of my cock. The shooter noticed that and walked to our table. I knew I had to do something quickly or me, my crush, and my beaver basher would all die. Then it hit me, and I knew what I had to do. I looked over to my crush, and I started playing with her milkers. At first she was trying to resist, but then she figured out what I was trying to do and played along. My cock grew more and more, and when I felt it about to burst out of my pants. I got up and looked straight at the shooter. He hesitated for a single moment, which cost him his life. My pants exploded as my sexcalibur shot out a single hardened white cum shaped like a 7.62 mm sniper bullet right into the shooter's head. I was about to celebrate but then I noticed the smell of smoke in the air, turns out my massive cock shot not only the shooter, but also a gas pipe that was in the vicinity. Fire was all around us, as I held my crush close, I knew there was no way both of us would get out of there, so there was only one option. \"Get in!\" I said. \"What?\" She asked. \"Get in! There is no time!\" I said and pointed to my foreskin. She climbed inside the pocket between my foreskin and my cock. And I started running, breathing smoke and caughing, kicking doors and running through hallways, longing for fresh air. Finally I got out of the school, and I saw everyone looking at me and my dong. I slowly walked to the benches, and sat down to breath. Then I saw my crush's mother, and she asked me where her daughter is. I got up, and said \"I know where she is!\". I pulled my foreskin and there she was. I expected to hear claps and cheers, but when I didn't, I looked at my crush and saw she was dead. Turns out she suffocated inside my yogurt hose. The police arrested me, and here I am, with my massive schlong and 15 years in prison.\n\nIf your penis is small, do not despair, for at least you did not have to go through what I did. Farewell.",

            "Ever since I was a wee lad, I noticed my penis was a bit large. I thought it was normal, untill my mom bathed me with my brother and I saw his little wee wee compared to mine, I couldn't help but point at it and mock it. A few months later when I started kindergarden, the teacher inspected our cocks for the monthly cock inspection, and noticed my large dick. I was very young but I could still see he was very envyous of my humongous cock, knowing he will never be as big, he called my mom and told her a doctor should see my penis. The doctor said he had never seen such an amazing specimen of a dong, that was the first moment I saw pride in my mom's eyes. I cherish these memories, as the cock inspection was the pinnacle of any month for me, seeing all the other pathetic little weiners. I loved watching the other kids take quick glances of my cock in fear and shame.\n\nA few years later when I was about 11 years old, my penis has started to become a burden for me. Having a 24.089 inch dick in 6th grade is no joke, I had to come up with creative ideas of where to hide the magnificent beast. Usually I hid it inside the right leg of my pants, kids always thought it was weird how my right leg was so \"muscular\" compared to my other, which meant I had to workout only my left leg in order to not arouse suspicion. I remember I went home depressed one day, crying to god on why did he curse me with such a shaft. I was tearing my pants with anger, when I started to feel tingly sensation in my penis. I started rubbing it, and suddenly it GREW EVEN LONGER, I was devestated because I thought it was already too large, but the feeling I had when I was rubbing it was too good to stop. I started holding it with both my hands and stroking it, but it was not enough, I could not satisfy my monster with mere hands, so I began using my feet too. The feeling was incredible, god was on my side again. As I was rubbing it faster and faster, I thought of my science teacher. My cock was throbbing, my nipples erect, my eyes wide and open. I was on my bed at the time, and I felt my Johnson about to erupt with tremendous force, I didn't know what to do so I hid under the bed, and then I came. It was like 4th of july. At first the stream was steady, of white cream in about 1 liter per second, then it was chaos. My penis was going up and down dancing with explosions of cum(Only later that day I found out my grandpa died at that moment of a heart attack because the sounds reminded him of bastogne when he was fighting the Germans). After a few second I realized I might drown because my juice covered the whole floor about two inch deep, I quickly slid across pools of cum gasping for air, I stood up and finally my cum gun started to relax. My mom came into the room shocked and disgusted, she yelled at me that I must see a doctor and get my manhood shortend or even removed. We had a fight for about three hours not noticing my grandpa was awfully quiet.\n\nThe day after my grandfather's funeral, I came to the doctor's office, and told him my story. After a lengthy cock inspection, he said that I have a rare condition, which makes my cock grow exponentially with each year, width and length. He calculated that my cock would weigh 200 kg when I turn 30, which is about the maximum weight my spine can support, beyond that and it would fracture and I'll die. I asked him if I could remove it, but he said no because I would die of blood loss. He also said I need to do blood transfusions everyday to feed my absolute unit of a scholng the blood it needs. Needless to say I was devestated, my once blessing, became a curse, again.\n\nOne day when I was 16, I was in my math class when I heard a terrible noise, it reminded me of the first time I was beating my meat, but it turns out it was just a gunshot. Kids all around me where shouting that there was a school shooter. I immediately got up and ran to the door, carrying my pack with my hands. Suddenly I heard shots very close to my ears, and saw dead bodies on the ground, so I ran into the closest door which was the janitor's room, closed the door and hid under the table making as little noise as possible. Little did I know, my crush was under the same table, hiding there in fear, when she saw me she almost screamed, but I put my hand over her mouth and told her to be quiet. I heard the shooter opening the door slowly and looking for me. I was completely silent, but then I noticed my crush's incredible bajongas, and I felt my cock starting to throb and expand. She seemed to notice, and I could see that she was impressed with my goofy goober. Her facial expression made my ding dong enlarge even more and I could feel my pants starting to tear apart. My shclong abong seemed to send electro-magnetic waves all over the room because the light above us started to flicker with every throb of my cock. The shooter noticed that and walked to our table. I knew I had to do something quickly or me, my crush, and my beaver basher would all die. Then it hit me, and I knew what I had to do. I looked over to my crush, and I started playing with her milkers. At first she was trying to resist, but then she figured out what I was trying to do and played along. My cock grew more and more, and when I felt it about to burst out of my pants. I got up and looked straight at the shooter. He hesitated for a single moment, which cost him his life. My pants exploded as my sexcalibur shot out a single hardened white cum shaped like a 7.62 mm sniper bullet right into the shooter's head. I was about to celebrate but then I noticed the smell of smoke in the air, turns out my massive cock shot not only the shooter, but also a gas pipe that was in the vicinity. Fire was all around us, as I held my crush close, I knew there was no way both of us would get out of there, so there was only one option. \"Get in!\" I said. \"What?\" She asked. \"Get in! There is no time!\" I said and pointed to my foreskin. She climbed inside the pocket between my foreskin and my cock. And I started running, breathing smoke and caughing, kicking doors and running through hallways, longing for fresh air. Finally I got out of the school, and I saw everyone looking at me and my dong. I slowly walked to the benches, and sat down to breath. Then I saw my crush's mother, and she asked me where her daughter is. I got up, and said \"I know where she is!\". I pulled my foreskin and there she was. I expected to hear claps and cheers, but when I didn't, I looked at my crush and saw she was dead. Turns out she suffocated inside my yogurt hose. The police arrested me, and here I am, with my massive schlong and 15 years in prison.\n\nIf your penis is small, do not despair, for at least you did not have to go through what I did. Farewell.",

I thought it would be nice to have my mom take a shower with her sister and see the little one with me, and I couldn\u2019t help but smile at her. A few months later, when I won kindergarten, the kindergarten teacher checked the principal on a monthly basis and found that he was in a lot of pain. I was too young, but I was still hated when my older brother found out he was fine, so my mom called and asked the doctor to check on my uterus. The doctor said he had never seen such a strange wax, but it was the first time he had seen it in his mother's eyes. Enjoy this memory, I have seen chickens on TV before because I saw another poor carpet. I love seeing other kids soon with fear and embarrassment.\n\nA few years later, when I was 11, my penis became heavier. It's not a 24,089-inch flying joke in the sixth grade, so you need to find some creative ideas to hide. I hide under my right foot, and children often wonder why their right foot is \"more muscular\" than their other leg, as they often have to train their left foot. I remember one day when I went home crying in fear of God because he was insulting me in the hands of such a saint. When I felt pressure on my penis, I angrily dropped my pants. The shutdown began abruptly. I began to press with both hands, but it was not enough, I could not satisfy the animal with my hands, and I began to use my feet. God made me feel good again. When I was growing up, I was thinking of a master's degree. He saw a slightly swollen bird and his eyes wide. I was in bed, I thought Johnson was very upset, I didn't know what to do, I hid under the bed. The same thing happened on July 4th. At first the flow is smooth, about 1 liter of white cream per second, and then it is made from kebabs. The pen moved and she danced (I only knew that my grandfather had died of a heart attack that day because his voice reminded me that I was against Germany). A few seconds later I felt like I was drowning, because the juice covered the entire floor a few inches, I woke up in the tank and the gun finally started to rest. My shocked and tired mother went into the room and then took me to the doctor, who told her to reduce or eliminate masculinity. His grandfather, the sailors, fought for three hours.\n\nThe day after Anna's funeral, I went to the doctor, who told the same story as me. During a long penis scan, he revealed that he had been suffering from a supernatural disease that had been growing for years. My grandfather died of a fracture, 200 pounds, 30 pounds, thinking he could carry the maximum weight of his spine. I asked him if I could get rid of him, but he didn't tell me I was going to die for his blood. He also told me that I needed a blood transfusion every day. Needless to say, my curse was cursed again.\n\nOne day, when I was 16, I heard a horrible sound in a math class that reminded me of the first time I had hit my body, but only one bullet. The kids around the school yelled at me. I immediately got up and took the bag in my hand and went to the door. When I heard this, I immediately fell to my ears and saw my body lying on the ground, and I went to the side door of the house, to a locked room, closed the door, and hid under the table, and there was a faint sound. . . Little did I know that my love was under the table. I heard the sniper slowly open the door and look at me. I was devastated, but later lost my temper and realized that I had lost my friend. Bashar has passed away. Then he hit me, and I knew what to do. Seeing anger, I started playing with the milkmaid. At first I tried to resist, but I realized that this was just the game I was trying to play. His pants came out and I noticed that my penis was getting bigger. I got up and saw a security guard who had just stopped committing suicide. My target was a 7.62mm shotgun, a black and white cat hit his head and his pants exploded. I noticed that the smell of smoke in the air illuminates not only the chickens in the garden, but also the gas pipes around them. One of the reasons for this is that we know that we will not leave when we are surrounded by fire. -He offers! I said. \"What?\" They asked. \"Enter! I don't have time!\" I wanted to say. He put his hand between the cooks. Then I started running, taking a deep breath, knocking on the door, and starting to breathe fresh air. When I finally graduated from school, I saw a boat and everyone was looking at me. I sat down slowly and took a deep breath. So where was the girl when she saw her mother upset? I got up and said, \"I know where he is!\" I said. You reached out and stood there. I wanted to thank him, but when I couldn't hear his voice, I looked into his heart and saw him dead. I ate a bite of yogurt soup. He was arrested by police and sentenced to 15 years in prison.\n\nYou don't have a little sex, but you don't do what I do. Is happy",

            "My penis\n\n\nEver since I was a wee lad, I noticed my penis was a bit large. I thought it was normal, untill my mom bathed me with my brother and I saw his little wee wee compared to mine, I couldn't help but point at it and mock it. A few months later when I started kindergarden, the teacher inspected our cocks for the monthly cock inspection, and noticed my large dick. I was very young but I could still see he was very envyous of my humongous cock, knowing he will never be as big, he called my mom and told her a doctor should see my penis. The doctor said he had never seen such an amazing specimen of a dong, that was the first moment I saw pride in my mom's eyes. I cherish these memories, as the cock inspection was the pinnacle of any month for me, seeing all the other pathetic little weiners. I loved watching the other kids take quick glances of my cock in fear and shame.\n\nA few years later when I was about 11 years old, my penis has started to become a burden for me. Having a 24.089 inch dick in 6th grade is no joke, I had to come up with creative ideas of where to hide the magnificent beast. Usually I hid it inside the right leg of my pants, kids always thought it was weird how my right leg was so \"muscular\" compared to my other, which meant I had to workout only my left leg in order to not arouse suspicion. I remember I went home depressed one day, crying to god on why did he curse me with such a shaft. I was tearing my pants with anger, when I started to feel tingly sensation in my penis. I started rubbing it, and suddenly it GREW EVEN LONGER, I was devestated because I thought it was already too large, but the feeling I had when I was rubbing it was too good to stop. I started holding it with both my hands and stroking it, but it was not enough, I could not satisfy my monster with mere hands, so I began using my feet too. The feeling was incredible, god was on my side again. As I was rubbing it faster and faster, I thought of my science teacher. My cock was throbbing, my nipples erect, my eyes wide and open. I was on my bed at the time, and I felt my Johnson about to erupt with tremendous force, I didn't know what to do so I hid under the bed, and then I came. It was like 4th of july. At first the stream was steady, of white cream in about 1 liter per second, then it was chaos. My penis was going up and down dancing with explosions of cum(Only later that day I found out my grandpa died at that moment of a heart attack because the sounds reminded him of bastogne when he was fighting the Germans). After a few second I realized I might drown because my juice covered the whole floor about two inch deep, I quickly slid across pools of cum gasping for air, I stood up and finally my cum gun started to relax. My mom came into the room shocked and disgusted, she yelled at me that I must see a doctor and get my manhood shortend or even removed. We had a fight for about three hours not noticing my grandpa was awfully quiet.\n\nThe day after my grandfather's funeral, I came to the doctor's office, and told him my story. After a lengthy cock inspection, he said that I have a rare condition, which makes my cock grow exponentially with each year, width and length. He calculated that my cock would weigh 200 kg when I turn 30, which is about the maximum weight my spine can support, beyond that and it would fracture and I'll die. I asked him if I could remove it, but he said no because I would die of blood loss. He also said I need to do blood transfusions everyday to feed my absolute unit of a scholng the blood it needs. Needless to say I was devestated, my once blessing, became a curse, again.\n\nOne day when I was 16, I was in my math class when I heard a terrible noise, it reminded me of the first time I was beating my meat, but it turns out it was just a gunshot. Kids all around me where shouting that there was a school shooter. I immediately got up and ran to the door, carrying my pack with my hands. Suddenly I heard shots very close to my ears, and saw dead bodies on the ground, so I ran into the closest door which was the janitor's room, closed the door and hid under the table making as little noise as possible. Little did I know, my crush was under the same table, hiding there in fear, when she saw me she almost screamed, but I put my hand over her mouth and told her to be quiet. I heard the shooter opening the door slowly and looking for me. I was completely silent, but then I noticed my crush's incredible bajongas, and I felt my cock starting to throb and expand. She seemed to notice, and I could see that she was impressed with my goofy goober. Her facial expression made my ding dong enlarge even more and I could feel my pants starting to tear apart. My shclong abong seemed to send electro-magnetic waves all over the room because the light above us started to flicker with every throb of my cock. The shooter noticed that and walked to our table. I knew I had to do something quickly or me, my crush, and my beaver basher would all die. Then it hit me, and I knew what I had to do. I looked over to my crush, and I started playing with her milkers. At first she was trying to resist, but then she figured out what I was trying to do and played along. My cock grew more and more, and when I felt it about to burst out of my pants. I got up and looked straight at the shooter. He hesitated for a single moment, which cost him his life. My pants exploded as my sexcalibur shot out a single hardened white cum shaped like a 7.62 mm sniper bullet right into the shooter's head. I was about to celebrate but then I noticed the smell of smoke in the air, turns out my massive cock shot not only the shooter, but also a gas pipe that was in the vicinity. Fire was all around us, as I held my crush close, I knew there was no way both of us would get out of there, so there was only one option. \"Get in!\" I said. \"What?\" She asked. \"Get in! There is no time!\" I said and pointed to my foreskin. She climbed inside the pocket between my foreskin and my cock. And I started running, breathing smoke and caughing, kicking doors and running through hallways, longing for fresh air. Finally I got out of the school, and I saw everyone looking at me and my dong. I slowly walked to the benches, and sat down to breath. Then I saw my crush's mother, and she asked me where her daughter is. I got up, and said \"I know where she is!\". I pulled my foreskin and there she was. I expected to hear claps and cheers, but when I didn't, I looked at my crush and saw she was dead. Turns out she suffocated inside my yogurt hose. The police arrested me, and here I am, with my massive schlong and 15 years in prison.\n\nIf your penis is small, do not despair, for at least you did not have to go through what I did. Farewell.",
