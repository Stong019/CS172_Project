            "At this point there's no excuse for baby boomers still in the workforce to be technologically inept anymore It's just willful ignorance, this shit is not fucking hard \"Why is it asking for a password?\", Because you're logging into something, Martha. That's how it's been for the last 20 fucking years. \"How do I do this, Can you show me?\" No, Jeb, you can Google it like the rest of us. You've been an engineer and working with computers for 35 years. Why would I waste time when some 12 year old indian kid on youtube can walk you through it far more clearly? It requires one exposure to the concept of googling to understand how it work Your generation was smart enough to create a giant hole in the ozone, but not smart enough to realize you have the near entirety of human knowledge at your disposal just by typing in a few words? Give me a break \"I'm not tech savvy\", No, you just refuse to learn despite most modern software being idiot proof, stuck in your ways out of entitlement.\n\nThe worst part is after you help an old fuck 9 times out of 10, they'l give you some kind of bullshit passive-aggressive thank you along the lines of \"Oh, I guess you young people have to know something about those phones you're always on, huh?\" Give me a fucking break Greg. Maybe we're staring at them because it's less depressing to be distracted instead of coming to terms with the fact our planet is literally dying. It's not my fault your wife hasn't had sex with you since 2006. Go away.\n\nAND ANOTHER THING that just gets my blood boiling is their ability to get into their settings, completely fuck things up, and then manage to develop total amnesia about how it happened. What do you mean you set your phone to Japanese on accident Deborah? There's like 15 separate menus you have to navigate through to get there. \"I think it's because l got a virus\". No, Arthur, it's not a virus, the only viruses here are your rampant stupidity and the deadly pathogens carried by your unvaccinated and probably ugly grandchildren. I just absolutely loathe that the people who decide if women should be executed for having abortions or not are the same people who can't figure out how to work a blu-ray player with the instructions right in front of them.\n\n[Copypasta Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/dqnffi/technologically_inept_boomers/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)",

            "You Kids had It Easy\n\nTell you kids, back in my day, we had it so rough... or so much better, i can't tell anymore. anyway, every day, we would wake up at 2 in the morning and go to the table for breakfast. we all lived in a closet, you see, so it was one room. and we would ask, me and my 64 brothers and 27 sisters, \"what's for breakfast mum?\". she would smack us all with a shoe and say \"cold beans\". and if we complained and said \"but we had cold beans yesterday\" - because we had cold beans every day - she would smack us all five times with a shoe and say \"tough its all we can afford. i'm trying to feed a family of 93 with just half a silver buckington\", a silver buckington was about the same as half a penny back in the day. then we would head to school. we met up with the johnson kids from down the road, and walked the 1674 miles to school. on the way to school, we had to walk up a mountain so tall it extended to outer space. when we got to the top of the mountain, we would see the peterson boys on their fancy bikes - which they dont make like they used to, and we would race them down the mountain. then, when we got to school at 4 in the morning, the headmaster would come up to us and say \"you bloody kids are late\", then he would smack us all with the cane 10 times and tell us we had 7 years of detention. then, we went to class, and mr stevenson would say \"ok line up kids\", then he would spank us each 60 times, then hit us each with the cane 40 times each. then it was 7 at night and we had to walk home. then, when we got home, we'd ask \"whats for dinner mum?\", and she'd smack us each 50 times with a pan and say \"rotten cabage\". and if we complained, she would smack us each 100 times with a broom and say \"im trying to feed a family of 154 on just one islet sliver, just you wait until your dad gets home\" - now an islet silver was worth about as much as a grain of sand. then, when our dad got home from his job at the soot factory, he would hit us all 180 times with his belt. if we had been naughty, we would hit us all another 600 times. then, at 1:58, mum would say \"ok time for bed\". then, we got into our potato sacks, and she would hit us each with a shoe 8 times before we went to sleep. on saturdays, we went down to uncle bob's farm to work. we would have to walk 345 miles to the bus stop, then catch the route 4 bus for 56 stops. we would get on the bus and pay our fare of 3 teddy roses - now a teddy rose is worth about the same as a flake of skin. then, if the ticket inspector came to us, he would hit us all 4 times with his baton. if any of us had lost our ticket, we would hit us all 10 times again and throw us off the bus and we had to walk the rest of the way. when we got to the farm, uncle bob would drive to the gate in his tractor, hit us all 780 times with his crowbar, and tell us to get in his trailer so he could drive us to the farm house. then, we had to plow the fields with a toothbrush in the blazing summer heat - now, they dont make summers like they used to, so it was about 1345.4 degrees spencer, or 67 degrees centigrade using your new-fangled metric system. then, we would have to milk the cows - now, they dont make cows like they used to, so each cow weighed about 459 hog's heads, or 3.2 tonnes in your new-fangled metric system. if you touched a cows udder, it would kick you and you would die, so you had to be really careful when you milked the cows. then, when we were done, uncle bob would say \"ok kids time for your pocket money\". he would give us each 9 copper jemimahs - which are worth about one political promise each - and beat us each 6 times with his tractor before we left. on sundays, we would meet the johnson boys and go down to the river - now, they don't make rivers like they used to, so this river was about as wide as the whole of america, and as deep as the marianas trench, and it was filled with liquid tungsten. we would play by the old oak tree near the river, climbing on it and building tree houses and such. now - they don't make trees like they used to, so this tree had a trunk as thick as a city, and was tall enough that the branches on the top could scrape the moon. one day, little jimmy fell from the top of the tree. when he hit the ground, the only bit of his body we could recognise was his left eyeball. we picked up all his bits and rushed him to the doctors surgery. dr james said \"oh its just a scratch little jimmy dont worry pop a plaster on it and you'll be right\" and he gave little jimmy a plaster and a lollipop and he was ok. after we finished playing by the river, we would go into town and get some candy. now, back in the day, you could give the shopkeeper one bronze winglet - which is worth about as much as a ciggarette butt - and he would give you the entire stock of the store. so we would go and get our candy, and we'd go into the town square and eat it. now, we didn't have any of your fancy food laws back in the day, so there was all kinds of stuff in our candy. bleach, rust, bones--you name it. so we would always get a little hyper after our candy. one day, when we were hyper, we went up the mr boris's car, the only car in the town, and touched it. as we touched it, we saw dad storming down the street holding his belt. \"you kids, having fun while i work all day in the soot factory just so you can have grilled water for tea every night, i oughta smack you all\". we were sure he was going to smack us, but then he said \"no, i got a better idea, ill take you to see mr henderson, he'll set ya right\". now, dad had told us about mr henderson. mr henderson was a veteran from the great war, where he got a really bad injury, but we never knew what it was. dad walked us all down to the pub, and we saw a left testicle propped up on a pegleg. \"mr henderson,\" said dad, \"i have some kids here who need a good whooping\". then, mr henderson picked up the entire pub, and hit us each 4006 times with it. then, dad said \"right, i gotta go back to the soot factory, you kids run on home now\". now, by now it was 1pm, which meant it was curfew. while we were walking out of the town square, we heard a man shout \"oi you bloody kids, its curfew\". we turned around and saw the constable holding his baton. he hit us each 160265 times with his baton, then put us in gaol for 60123865 years. now - they don't make gaols like they used to - this one had 5 mile thick steel walls, and a single hole in the top let in some light. we were in there for about 13526 years, until mum baked the constable some cardboard pie so he would let us out. then, she hit us all 1292 times with a washboard, and grounded us for the rest of our lives. so don't you come complaining to me about nonsense like not having tv while hiking 25 miles to school.",

So in all, we work longer hours, as well as more jobs on average than any boomer ever did and ag the same time make less money. We tend to live at home with our parents longer as well now since wages don\u2019t pay enough to be able to live a self sufficient lifestyle. Landlords are overpricing rents, jobs are keeping wages low, tax cuts are going to billionaires rather than the working class, so don\u2019t tell me life was hard. At least your jobs came with many protected benefits.\n\nMillenials have less benefits on average and the more corporations are deregulated, the more brunt of the struggle we gain.\n\nSo when we say \u201cok boomer\u201d we are ignoring your words because all your generation ever did was make life more difficult for its children while creating a lot of alcoholism/drug addiction, as well as many mental health issues that spread to their children as well.\n\nAt least millenials are the ones pushing to improve the lives of people who currently live and future generations, hell, we even want to fix the social programs that are being cut for boomers.",

However, for most people, the change in a disease or disorder is similar to the change in porn life.\nIt is often believed that change has attracted this strange and exciting person.

In fact, the adjustment of all remaining removals features low self-esteem and requirements, though rare. But no change was noted. Lack of awakening is more common than awakening from a genetically modified sequence of normal life events.\nAs well as singers like the real character and Hatsune Miku, the physical body and Hatsune Miku had to be different from the singer.

            "Infinite cum. You sit on the toilet to jack off, but you begin to cum uncontrollably. After ten spurts you start to worry. Your hand is sticky and it reeks of semen. You desperately shove your dick into a wad of toilet paper, but that only makes your balls hurt. The cum accelerates. It\u2019s been three minutes. You can\u2019t stop cumming. Your bathroom floor is covered in a thin layer of baby fluid. You try to cum into the shower drain but it builds up too fast. You try the toilet. The cum is too thick to be flushed. You lock the bathroom door to prevent the cum from escaping. The air grows hot and humid from the cum. The cum accelerates. You slip and fall in your own sperm. The cum is now six inches deep, almost as long as your still-erect semen hose. Sprawled on your back, you begin to cum all over the ceiling. Globs of the sticky white fluid begin to fall like raindrops, giving you a facial with your own cum. The cum accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cum begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a bukkake themed slip-and-slide. Still on your knees, the cum is now at chin height. To avoid drowning you open the bathroom door. The deluge of man juice reminds you of the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, only with cum instead of molasses. The cum accelerates. It\u2019s been two hours. Your children and wife scream in terror as their bodies are engulfed by the snow-white sludge. Your youngest child goes under, with viscous bubbles and muffled cries rising from the goop. You plead to God to end your suffering. The cum accelerates. You squeeze your dick to stop the cum, but it begins to leak out of your asshole instead. You let go. The force of the cum tears your urethra open, leaving only a gaping hole in your crotch that spews semen. Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the cum. You smash through the wall, hurtling into the sky at thirty miles an hour. From a bird\u2019s eye view you see your house is completely white. Your neighbor calls the cops. The cum accelerates. As you continue to ascend, you spot police cars racing towards your house. The cops pull out their guns and take aim, but stray loads of cum hit them in the eyes, blinding them. The cum accelerates. You are now at an altitude of 1000 feet. The SWAT team arrives. Military helicopters circle you. Hundreds of bullets pierce your body at once, yet you stay conscious. Your testicles have now grown into a substitute brain. The cum accelerates. It has been two days. With your body now destroyed, the cum begins to spray in all directions. You break the sound barrier. The government deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cum sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the earth. You feel your gonads start to burn up as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new white paint job as you fly past. Physicists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. The cum accelerates. The cum begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of semen. Astronomers begin calling you the \u201cCummet.\u201d You are stuck in space forever, stripped of your body and senses, forced to endure an eternity of cumshots. Eventually, you stop thinking.",

            "Logan Paul Apology but I replace \"apologize\" with \"cum\" (from reddit)I've made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement and I don't expect to be forgiven. I'm simply here to cum. So what we came across that day on the woods was obviously unplanned and the reactions you saw on tape were raw, they were unfiltered. None of us knew how to react or how to feel. I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down, and stopped recording what we were going through. There's a lot of things I should have done differently, but I didn't, and for that from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry. I want to cum to the internet, I want to cum to anyone who's seen the video, I want to cum to anyone who has been affected or touched by mental illness, or depression, or suicide. But, most importantly, I want to cum to the victim and his family. For, my fans, who are defending my actions, please don't, they do not deserve to be defended. The goal of my content is always to entertain, to push the boundaries, to be all inclusive and in the world I live in I share almost everything I do. The intent is never to be heartless, cruel, or malicious. Like I said, I made a huge mistake, I don't expect to be forgiven, I'm just here to cum. I'm ashamed of myself. I'm disappointed in myself, and I promise to be better. I will be better, thank you."
