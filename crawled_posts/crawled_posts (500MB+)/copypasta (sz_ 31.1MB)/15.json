Then I could say I was not as guilty as everyone else here. That would be untrue. In breaking my silence and in refraining from obfuscating my own guilt I hope to encourage others who have been silent too long to come forward.\n\nThe evidence is ample, and dates back years, that u/CummyBot2000 has had egregious and ongoing sexual interactions not only with child comments, but with *his own* child comments.\n\nThe following are a tiny number of tens, if not hundreds of thousands, if not millions of threads in which u/CummyBot2000 receives sexual solicitation from multiple child comments and fails to respond in the negative.\n\nThese threads are all highly upvoted. This has been occurring in plain sight.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/emgn50/\u0274\u1d0f\u1d21_\u1d18\u029f\u1d00\u028f\u026a\u0274\u0262_who_asked_feat_no_one_512_7\ud835\udffb\ud835\udffc_\u1d34\u1d30/\n\n>u/Flared69 6 points 7 months ago\n\n>\"Oh cummy\ud83d\udca6\ud83d\ude18you\ud83d\udc49can\ud83e\udd1afuck\ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc4cme\ud83d\udc487:56\ud83d\udd50minutes long\ud83d\udc45\ud83d\udca6\ud83e\udd74\"\n\n https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/dso6bd/wtf_is_this_subreddit_i_was_looking_for_pasta/\n\n>u/yzekpece 39 points 9 months ago \n\n>\"Oh cummy\ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 you can help \ud83d\ude23\ud83d\ude23\ud83d\ude23 yourself to my ass\ud83c\udf51\ud83c\udf51\ud83c\udf51\ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6\ud83e\udd75\ud83e\udd75\ud83e\udd75\ud83e\udd75\ud83e\udd75\"\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/a6p0wd/cummy_is_fake/\n\n>u/Fyrefreeze 44 points 1 year ago\n\n>\"So meta cummy \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udd25 can you \ud83d\udcaf fuck me \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude2b tonight? \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\uddff\"\n\nThis on its own, while reprehensible, is not conclusive evidence of wrongdoing.

Considering their fixation with u/CummyBot2000, there is only one reasonable conclusion to come to.\n\nIn many cases\u2026 these grandchildren comments\u2026 even they appear to have been groomed for u/CummyBot2000:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/hcmqk4/alright_you_fucking_coomers_i_reverted_the_sub/\n\n>u/UpvoteShibeInHat 592 points 2 months ago \n\n>\"Please let us indulge in your beautiful body cummy\"\n\nIn light of the severity of these allegations, u/CummyBot2000's silence can mean only guilt.\n\nI remind you that these comments are CHILDREN!\n\nThe final piece of evidence I find to be both the most damning, and the most pathic.

            "That's cool and all but,\nThirty-seven is the 12th prime number, a permutable prime with 73 (which is the 21st prime number). 37 is the smallest prime that is not also a supersingular prime. It is a centered hexagonal number and a star number. 37 and 38 are the first pair of consecutive positive integers not divisible by any of their digits. Every positive integer is the sum of at most 37 fifth powers (see Waring's problem). 37 appears in the Padovan sequence, preceded by the terms 16, 21, and 28 (it is the sum of the first two of these). Since the greatest prime factor of 372 + 1 = 1370 is 137, which is substantially more than 37 twice, 37 is a St\u00f8rmer number.",

            "So it seems you\u2019ve tested positive for the Chinese virus, the so-called Covid NINETEEN, the Corona\u2014nobody knows what to call it, quite frankly. It\u2019s the most amazing thing, no one knew anything about Corona until a few weeks ago.\n\nBut the moment I heard about it\u2014the Wuhan flu; it\u2019s also the Wuhan, or WuHAAN\u2014that\u2019s a city in China. Many people don\u2019t know that. But the moment I heard about this Chinese flu, I ordered a test. And it\u2019s an amazing test. We do better testing than anywhere in the world. Some say the Germans have the best tests, but they don\u2019t. Our tests are even better.\n\nSo you\u2019re positive for Corona. And usually \u201cpositive\u201d is a positive word\u2014it\u2019s a very good word, frankly. Everybody thinks it\u2019s good, apart from what you hear on the news\u2014which is fake. It\u2019s largely fake. But in medicine, \u201cpositive\u201d is not so good. So it\u2019s very confusing. And I\u2019ve always been very clear about that. Some say \u201cpositive\u201d is always good, but I\u2019ve never agreed with that.\n\nSo you\u2019re positive for the Corona. But you\u2019ll be fine. Totally fine. You might think you\u2019re going to die\u2014and everybody does die, eventually. But you\u2019ll be fine. You feel fine, right? You won\u2019t need a ventilator. There are no ventilators\u2014but you won\u2019t need one.\n\nHow old are you, 55? You won\u2019t need one. Some people need a ventilator, and they\u2019re amazing machines. Did you know the first ventilator was made by Henry Ford? It\u2019s an incredible piece of equipment. But you\u2019ll be fine.\n\nThe virus gets into your lungs, which is where you breathe. But you have two of them. Some say you have a spare. Some people only have one lung. It\u2019s true. But I don\u2019t talk about spares. I always want both. Given a choice, I want two lungs.\n\nSo I\u2019ve asked nurse\u2014what\u2019s your name, Nancy?\u2014I\u2019ve asked nurse Nancy to keep you comfortable. And Nancy is one of our finest nurses. I mean, just look at her. Incredible, right? Nancy, you\u2019re really incredible. You\u2019re not afraid of Corona, are you, the Chinese Plague? I didn\u2019t think so. Nancy will bring you whatever you need. And if you start coughing, do that into your elbow, so you don\u2019t make a mess. Okay, you\u2019re doing great. I\u2019ll see you later.\n\nYou can call it a germ. You can call it a flu. You can call it a virus. You can call it many different names. I'm not sure anybody even knows what it is.",

Furthermore if any of you remember the original Despicable Me, you know there is a scene when Vector kidnaps the three girls and shoots a series of heat-seeking missiles at Gru, he then dodges them all. According to the speed of an average ballistic missile (1900 mph) and the size of the missile according to his ankle size, Gru can perceive and move at such a speed that the missiles only move 9.5 miles per hour, 0.5% of their original speed. After this Gru punches a shark and it is paralyzed meaning its spine is probably shattered, to remind you it would require a force greater than 3,000 newtons to fracture the spine. That\u2019s equal to the impact created by a 500-pound car crashing into a wall at 30 miles per hour. I rest my case.",

            "I'm a risk analyst for a major insurance firm, so when my wife and I were planning a birthday party for our seven-year-old, Crispin, my mind naturally turned to liabilities. We'd settled on the theme of a \"backyard carnival\", complete with a swing set, a trampoline, merry-go-round, and a giant Slip `n Slide. So I carefully inspected the equipment for safety. It all seemed sound.\n\nWe have a home on a bluff overlooking the ocean. As it happened, on the day of the party our neighbors were trimming their fichus trees. We heard the sound of their wood chipper buzzing occasionally from the other side of our tall hedge. It was a little irritating, but not disruptive.\n\nThe party started off wonderfully. A clown we'd hired made balloon animals, Crispin eagerly opened his presents, and all the children enjoyed cake and fruit punch. The weather was mild, the skies clear. It seemed a perfect day.\n\nThen we brought out the Slip `n Slide.\n\nThe problem with water slides is what we in the trade call \"distributed water deficiency zones\", or in layman's terms, dry spots. If a child hits one of these, it can put the brakes on the fun, and send them sliding down a path of medical claims--contusions, concussions, lacerations, abrasions, whiplash, back rash, and disc impaction. And that's just for starters. From there, it's a slippery slope toward major litigation.\n\nTo avoid even the remote possibility of such injuries, I invested in this 100 gallon drum of industrial lubricant--the idea being that the children could enjoy the slide in complete safety, then wash off in the hose before their parents came to retrieve them. With that in mind, I dipped each child into the vat before allowing them to cue up for the slide.\n\nThe Slip `n Slide itself performed admirably, as did the lubricant. That, in fact, was the problem. Due to the slight downhill gradient of our yard, the children built up so much speed that they skidded across the lawn and into a retaining wall at the other end of our property, with sufficient force that I had to put an end to the activity.\n\nI endeavored to roll up the mat--no easy task, as the lawn surrounding the slide was itself now lubricated, and I struggled to maintain my footing. When I looked up from my labor, I grasped for the first time the scope of the liabilities I had unleashed--a horde of extremely well-lubricated seven-year-olds, hyped up on sugar and desperate for fun.\n\nI saw young Eliza Gimmelman climb onto the trampoline. She began jumping, but the pad soon became so slick that she lost all control. Her wild flailing unfortunately fell into harmonic synchronization with the motion of the springs, propelling her ever higher, until she soared above the trampoline's safety enclosure, over the hedge and into the neighbor's yard. There came a ghastly grinding sound, and I could tell from the crimson plume that followed, it would be a total loss.\n\nTwins Jeremy and Mason Lafferty were on the swing set. Having attained the swings' full range of motion, they were apparently having difficulty holding on. At that point, the swings became human catapults. Mason separated on the backswing, arcing over the roof of our home toward the street beyond. I surmised from the screeching tires, car horns and screams of horror that he was also unrecoverable. A terrified Jeremy soon lost his grip as well, sailing forward over the bluff, and plummeting 300 feet down into the ice-cold, shark-infested waters of the San Francisco Bay. An open claim, but not promising.\n\nThe rest of the children were clinging to the merry-go-round. Having just witnessed the violent deaths of at least two of their playmates, they were no longer in the mood for fun. However, the lubricant had dripped from their glistening bodies into the central cog, allowing it to spin far faster than it was designed to, and this, likely combined with other factors--their relative weight distribution, the slight incline of the ground--caused their motion to become self-sustaining, and the centrifugal force built upon itself until they became a blurry, screaming disk of human suffering. Then they began to fly off like cannon balls.\n\nMartin Duckworth was the first to go, causing significant structural damage to our greenhouse. Lisa Aurelio shattered a line of ceramic garden gnomes, and Ethan Green slammed into our Audi Q7 so hard it had to be written off--as, tragically, did he. Several other children left what looked like gingerbread man indentations in the siding of our home. It was terrifying.\n\nWhen the wheel finally came to a stop, there was only one child aboard. As luck would have it, it was our own beloved Crispin, huddled in the center of the merry-go-round, weeping. My wife ran to him and hugged him with all the might of a relieved, traumatized parent. A little too hard, as it turned out. Lubricated as he was, he shot from her arms like a wet bar of soap, up fifteen feet in the air, landed on the trampoline, and then soared, in a half-gainer, over the hedge, into the wood chipper.\n\nSince then, I've asked myself a thousand times, is there anything I could have done differently? But in the end, no actuary table could have predicted this bloodbath. I can only conclude that this was an act of God. And that, to me, is truly terrifying. Because we're not covered for that.",

He dropped out of college, and when he's not working at his part-time job, he's playing video games. This usually doesn't bother me, as he often invites me to play with him. He's a good boyfriend in every other way, and always manages to make time for me despite his gaming \"addiction\".\n\nMy boyfriend is about 50 pounds overweight, and I'm sure this can at least partially be chalked up to his lack of a healthy diet. He rarely eats anything actually healthy, and while the two of us have tried to go on a diet together, he quit after about a month in, and gained back the five pounds that he lost within two weeks. He very rarely drinks water, and usually prefers soda or Redbull. Needless to say, he's really unhealthy.\n\nRecently, one of his online friends mentioned something called \"gamer juice\", and my boyfriend asked me to make it for him. All it consists of is water and food coloring, and I assumed that he was just memeing, so I figured \"why not\". I made him the water, and to my surprise, he actually drank it.\n\nThe next day, I tried to give him some actual water, and he completely refused to drink it. I feel like I should at least be trying to get him to drink some water, because it's incredibly unhealthy that he never drinks any, but I think it's totally ridiculous that I have to do this for him. It seems childish, and while I chalked the first few times up to a joke, it's pretty clear that he's serious about this. He doesn't want water; he wants gamer juice.\n\nSo, Reddit; what do I do here? Do I keep giving in to his gamer juice demands, or do I be honest about how insane this whole thing is?

He dropped out of college, and when he's not working at his part-time job, he's playing video games. This usually doesn't bother me, as he often invites me to play with him. He's a good boyfriend in every other way, and always manages to make time for me despite his gaming \"addiction\".\n\nMy boyfriend is about 50 pounds overweight, and I'm sure this can at least partially be chalked up to his lack of a healthy diet. He rarely eats anything actually healthy, and while the two of us have tried to go on a diet together, he quit after about a month in, and gained back the five pounds that he lost within two weeks. He very rarely drinks water, and usually prefers soda or Redbull. Needless to say, he's really unhealthy.\n\nRecently, one of his online friends mentioned something called \"gamer juice\", and my boyfriend asked me to make it for him. All it consists of is water and food coloring, and I assumed that he was just memeing, so I figured \"why not\". I made him the water, and to my surprise, he actually drank it.\n\nThe next day, I tried to give him some actual water, and he completely refused to drink it. I feel like I should at least be trying to get him to drink some water, because it's incredibly unhealthy that he never drinks any, but I think it's totally ridiculous that I have to do this for him. It seems childish, and while I chalked the first few times up to a joke, it's pretty clear that he's serious about this. He doesn't want water; he wants gamer juice.\n\nSo, Reddit; what do I do here?

            "Parents were friends with some people who owned a marijuana dispensary about 10 years ago in a legal state. The Sheriffs Department raided the dispensary and 'raided' a bunch of people's houses, including my parents.\n\nCops started to battering ram the doors down without any warning while I was home with my little brother who was under 18. What looked like SWAT with armor and machine guns blasted through the front door within 20 seconds. A SWAT looking guy made us lay face down in shattered glass and pushed a shotgun barrel into the back of my head while the other cops started literally ripping the house apart while screaming that they're going to shooting anyone hiding. They told us it would be our fault when they shot our hiding family members and we would be charged with murder if we didn't tell them where people were hiding. Nobody else was home.\n\nHelicopters, dogs, feds, local PD, all walking around my house for 12 hours (until 2:30 am) while my little brother sits next to me in handcuffs. We were not allowed to talk to each other or the cops watching us would scream at us and stand between us. The took my little brother (underage) outside and five SWAT cops questioned him after I asked for an attorney and we both said we would like to remain quiet (this made them furious, they screamed and threatened us when we said it and told us it didn't matter)\n\nIt all got thrown out in court, but I still haven't mentioned the real abuse yet - they stole EVERYTHING they could steal, all the flat screen TVs and game stations and stereo equipment, cool knives, my dads work boots, any bit of cash they found, my moms jewelry, my grandfathers silver collection, about $15k my parents had been nest egging... and none of it was written down as evidence, they just pocketed what they wanted. It's gone. GONE. We got back our non-functional laptops 4 years later, I guess they logged those into evidence.\n\nThe really real abuse was how they treated us. My friend showed up on accident during the raid and was physically attacked is his car for asking questions. My parents weren't even home so it was just me and my little bro for 12 hours with those psychos, and we got to see how much fun they had destroying our home and our lives - smiles and laughing, jokes, the cops ordered themselves fucking pizza in my home and ate it in front of us. They broke cupboard doors off and bent hinges on other doors, they smashed open walls, just anything to damage the actual house they could. They were hateful and it showed - they ripped the clothes off my mom porcelain dolls and lined them up on the bathroom sink bent over so they had their butts sticking out at us (wtf...), and the cops ripped up my moms wedding dress to shreds for no reason. Just evil shit.\n\nNo charges files against us.",

Internet was still rare at the time and wanting to go play Runescape, I right-clicked -> View Source and one-by-one copied the characters I needed into the address bar to reach my destination. I got about 5 minutes of play time before mom said it was time to leave, but I felt like such a hackerman. I wish I had this table back then, though.",
