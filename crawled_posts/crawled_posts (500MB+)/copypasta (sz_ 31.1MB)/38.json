After a few minutes, a production member comes out and announces the show will continue with him as the host, to uproarus applause. New Host: \"Name something that makes a man's voice deep\" Contestant, smriking: \"Crown Jewels\" Beads of sweat form on the new host's head. For several minutes, he merely stares at the contestant, who is grinning from her answer. Then, in a fit of primal rage, he pulls out a pair of scissors and starts stabbing the contestant to death. For 3 minutes, the new host screams as he plunges the scissors in and out of the now lifeless contestant's body. After his final stab, he gets up, covered in blood, and says in a horrifyingly calm voice, \"survey says:\" crown jewels comes up as #1 The new host starts screaming an unbearable scream, then runs to the off set, returning a minute later with a blood splatttered pistol. He begins his scream again, going for 2 minutes with the gun pointed at his head, stopping only when the second gunshot of the night goes off. As the new host's insides come flying out and his body is flung to the floor, the theme song starts playing, zooming out on the now empty studio. Only the dead body of the new host remains in the middle of the stage, serving a reminder of the cost of the Feud.",

            "The year is 2018 and Japan has just finished there super weapon, they have been planning this since the bombings of Nagasaki, revenge against Americans and the world that forgot about them, they have created the infectious Waifu pillows, now they have to unleash it, and where else to start except America, there secret enemy, now they must find the gayest kid in America and convince him to take on the challenge of creating a glorious Anime empire. \n\nIt's 11:38, pm and Alex has just finished busting a fat nut to some gay hentai, when he hears a bang at his window, he opens it to find a random Waifu pillow, he takes it and starts to fuck it, but then it relays a message, it tells him why it was and what his purpose is for. He understands and starts the apocalypse.\n\npatient zero, his brother Ryan. Alex walks into his room as his brother is doing autistic fortnite dances and smothers him with the pillow, he continues until his whole neighborhood is infected, now they start breeding WaifuPillows as weapons and start there assault. My God, it's a massacre, half of the east coast is infected in 2 weeks and they are spreading quickly. A young boy named jonch flees to Europe to escape, but not before viewing his own father get turned into a gay fag, Alex continues infecting and building his empire.\n\nHe is now crowned king Alex, king of the weebs, he wonders if what he is doing is wrong, if all these lives were worth the cost, but then he nuts to some hentai and forgets about it. The UN holds an emergency meeting as all the countries meet to discuss what the hell is happening, every single country arrives to discuss the apocalypse, all except Japan, \"of course\" the countries thought, only Japan is gay enough to pull off this fuckery. Then they settle it, the only way to stop this onslaught is a full scale assault on Japan, the UN rallies the largest military offence the world has ever seen and heads to Japan, but Japan was ready, they shoot Waifu pillows into the attacking Helicopters and shoot dildo torpedos into attacking ships, the casualties are insurmountable, the UN is forced to retreat, King Alex claims victory and the UN is in shambles, all that remains against the Anime empire is a few UN soldiers and a resistance newly created by Jonch, there seems to be no hope.\n\nMore than twenty years have passed The year is now 2041, king Alex and his weaboo army now control Asia and 75 percent of the America's, the survivors flee to Europe, the last safe haven from the Anime Apocalypse. No one thought it would be like this, the Japanese had been planning this ever since 1950s, they have a grip on the world, King Alex now seeks out survivors and infects them by smothering them in Waifu pillows it's the most catastrophic event in history.\n\nBut there is hope, Commander Jonch and the resistance have been holding the weaboos on bay from Europe, but Jonch knows they will soon break through, they need a full scale assualt. He gathers his troops and marches through to the capital of the weebs, it's a bloodbath, the resistance mows down the weebs with lmgs, as the weebs keep coming with Waifu pillows, they keep on coming, the casualties are insurmountable.\n\nFinally, Jonch and the survivors Strom the capital, King Alex sends his remaining men on the resistance and runs like a bitch, Jonch keeps his men to Defend against the attack as he runs after Alex. Jonch finds him, but Alex punches him with a pillow, jonch recovers, but he knows Alex is too powerful, but then he remembers, his secret weapon. He throws a real women at Alex, stunned, Alex is confused he has never seen anything like it behind his hentai. jonch takes advantage and kills him, it's over, the remaining weebs are taken to concentration camps as the world recovers, we nuke all of Japan to end it once and for all, Jonch is hailed a hero, but deep down, he feels he could have stopped all of these deaths by just convincing Alex in 2018 to not be gay and change his phone background back to rainbow six siege not some anime girl.",

You want elders, I have to want to be a child. It seems to be seen in the Anime and all these people, because it is up to the rest of the coming, and you speak for yourself at the time.

            "I want to have a girlfriend\n\nI want to have a girlfriend so bad. Girls are so cute, and sometimes I just really want to hold their hands, or touch their face. I\u2019m alone in my place and I have anime girl posters all over in my room. My heart melt a little whenever I see those cute anime girls smiling at me with their soft, tender eyes, but deep down I still know they\u2019re just pictures. I want a real girl who is cute and can actually react to things I say, cheer me up when I\u2019m down, who can breathe and is warm to hold in my arms. \n\nMore importantly, I started to realize that without a girl my life is meaningless. I\u2019m told I need to get in a good college, I need to get A/A+ grades, i need to take the pain to go through all the leetcode, and get a good summer internship, and finally I need to get a job at google earning 200k. But so what, even if I earn 200k, instead of 80k or something at a medium company? So that I can drive a BMW instead of a Honda Accord? So that I can live in a luxury apartment instead of a studio? I have literally no interest in those stuff. A Honda and a BMW is the same to me, so is a studio or a house. I\u2019m told to work so hard towards stuff I literally don\u2019t want and don\u2019t need either. I spend 90% of my time trying to get a 200k job, while a 80k job can satisfy me just the same, and requires much less effort. \n\nWhat do I want then? A girl. A girl who\u2019s moderately cute in appearance (most do), and who can understand me and loves me. That\u2019s all.  She doesn\u2019t even have to be smart or go to Cal. That\u2019s trivial. With a girl, my life will be filled with purpose again. I\u2019m an only child, from a big city where people don\u2019t connect with each other, and I\u2019m not so close with my parents. In childhood, I always feel alone in this world. Same in college. Friends come and go. After the semester is over, I seldom contact or get contacted by any of them again. I feel like something replaceable. I\u2019m a replaceable student, a replaceable intern, a replaceable lab assistant, a replaceable friend. But with a girlfriend, I will have someone to love, to protect. I\u2019ll know what it\u2019s like to be cherished by someone. I\u2019ll know that I\u2019m this girl\u2019s one and only boyfriend, and potentially future husband, and have the responsibility to keep her happy that I can share with no one. I will have a purpose in life. Weekends and holidays will actually be joyful, not dreadfully boring. I can come home every day not facing a dark and empty room, but to a cute girl whose eyes are filled with tender love. Money or leetcode or google or MIT PhD offer, they mean nothing to me. If can choose, I would rather be born in a much poorer family, or as a person with less academic talent, but with a girlfriend who can understand me and loves me. I really don\u2019t want to be alone anymore.",

            "\nYou will never be Japanese. You have no ancestry, you have no citizenship, you have no skills that would make Japan ever want you. You are a shut-in self-hating white man twisted by delusions of mythical Japanese superiority and exposure to Japanese media into a disgusting mockery of nature\u2019s perfection. All 'validation' you get from other people in this position couldn't be worse in making you believe that spending years of your life learning a globally useless language to a first-grader's level was a worthwhile use of your time, but one can't expect that an individual as pathetic as you will ever know the value of the youth you threw away in doing that. Actual Japanese are utterly repulsed by you. Thousands of years of linguistic evolution have allowed natives to identify frauds from mannerisms and vocabulary alone. Even if your written text of self-hatred and attention begging akin to a stray dog's somehow passes as normal (it won't), any Japanese person will immediately cut all ties when they hear the voice and accent of someone who is not only a basic Japanese speaker at best, but worth no more than garbage in skills, accomplishments, and likeability. You will never be happy. You wrench out a fake smile and laugh to yourself believing that watching a content creator that you understand 20% of at best is somehow superior than watching your own kind, as you project your disgusting traits onto your entire kind. However, deep inside you feel the depression creeping up like a weed, ready to crush you under the unbearable weight, and you know that. You know that all you do now is have an entirely new linguistic medium in which to be ignored, and not even the exotic trait of being foreign makes up for just how uninteresting of a person you are. Eventually it\u2019ll be too much to bear - you\u2019ll buy a rope, tie a noose, put it around your neck, and plunge into the cold abyss. Your parents will find you, heartbroken but relieved that they no longer have to live with the unbearable shame and disappointment. They\u2019ll bury you with a headstone marked with your birth name, and every passerby for the rest of eternity will know a Western man is buried there. Your body will decay and go back to the dust, and all that will remain of your legacy is a skeleton that is unmistakably Caucasian. This is your fate. This is what you chose. There is no turning back. Hate yourself and apologize for being white to some Japanese entity that exists only in your mind while actual Japanese people put in effort to learn English for the valid reason of it being the global language.",

            "My dick is mad beefy and I possess some of the juiciest balls known to man. You can hear the testicular waves and electrical process humming from a few meters (that's right, I'm not British) away. Sometimes when I walk, my testicles, swollen with the vicious semen I used to decorate the puffed up sex mounds that belong to the love of your life, furiously clap against my toned, impenetrable thighs creating a deafening sound wave that promptly renders everything in the immediate vicinity incapable of their auditory function. I march on my lava-hot gonads just to feel something down there.\n\nI cannot stress this enough, it's not easy being bigger, better, sexier than most. A word of advice for those who aspire to be me, don't. The only way to get as big as me is to be me. And even then, you'd be far inferior to me. The sheer girth of my raunchy cock adds 10 points to my BMI, and that's not even taking into account the rotund meat sacks under my fuck stick.\n\nI am quite literally more defined than any dictionary man has made. I'm seriously fucking jacked man. I kid you not, just for experiment's purposes, I tried to stab myself. You will not believe what happened. The knife MELTED, including the heat-resistant handle. Take note: it didn't even make contact with my skin. It melted from the surface heat of the jacked labyrinth that is my body.\n\nTo all the females who shoot me a PM asking me to honey ham the ever living fuck out of them, please stop sending me your gushy burrito flaps and massive frosted tits. Women, you have to understand: I'm cum depleted, my cum fuse has blown, my cum dam has run dry, I've tried to go cum shopping but there's no cum left to buy. I'm over my cum budget and I'm now in cum debt.\n\nSo I ask once again, can I see the full tit?",
            "Japanese you will never be. No ancestry you have, no citizenship you have, no skills that would make japan ever want you you have. A shut-in self-hating white man twisted by delusions of mythical japanese superiority and exposure to japanese media into a disgusting mockery of nature\u2019s perfection you are. From other people in this position couldn't be worse in making you believe that spending years of your life learning a globally useless language to a first-grader's level was a worthwhile use of your time all 'validation' you get, the value of the youth you threw away in doing that but one can't expect that an individual as pathetic as you will ever know. Utterly repulsed by you actual japanese are. Allowed natives to identify frauds from mannerisms and vocabulary alone thousands of years of linguistic evolution have. Text of self-hatred and attention begging akin to a stray dog's somehow passes as normal (it won't) even if your written, all ties when they hear the voice and accent of someone who is not only a basic japanese speaker at best any japanese person will immediately cut, but worth no more than garbage in skills, accomplishments, and likeability. Happy you will never be. 20% of at best is somehow superior than watching your own kind you wrench out a fake smile and laugh to yourself believing that watching a content creator that you understand, as you project your disgusting traits onto your entire kind. However, the depression creeping up like a weed deep inside you feel, ready to crush you under the unbearable weight, that and you know. That all you do now is have an entirely new linguistic medium in which to be ignored you know, foreign makes up for just how uninteresting of a person you are and not even the exotic trait of being. Too much to bear - you\u2019ll buy a rope eventually it\u2019ll be, a noose tie, it around your neck put, and plunge into the cold abyss. You your parents will find, to live with the unbearable shame and disappointment heartbroken but relieved that they no longer have. They\u2019ll bury you with a headstone marked with your birth name, a western man is buried there and every passerby for the rest of eternity will know. Back to the dust your body will decay and go, a skeleton that is unmistakably caucasian and all that will remain of your legacy is. Your fate this is. What you chose this is. No turning back there is. White to some japanese entity that exists only in your mind while actual japanese people put in effort to learn english for the valid reason of it being the global language hate yourself and apologize for being.",

            "You will never be Japanese. You have no ancestry, you have no citizenship, you have no skills that would make Japan ever want you. You are a shut-in self-hating white man twisted by delusions of mythical Japanese superiority and exposure to Japanese media into a disgusting mockery of nature\u2019s perfection. \n\nAll 'validation' you get from other people in this position couldn't be worse in making you believe that spending years of your life learning a globally useless language to a first-grader's level was a worthwhile use of your time, but one can't expect that an individual as pathetic as you will ever know the value of the youth you threw away in doing that. \n\nActual Japanese are utterly repulsed by you. Thousands of years of linguistic evolution have allowed natives to identify frauds from mannerisms and vocabulary alone. Even if your written text of self-hatred and attention begging akin to a stray dog's somehow passes as normal (it won't), any Japanese person will immediately cut all ties when they hear the voice and accent of someone who is not only a basic Japanese speaker at best, but worth no more than garbage in skills, accomplishments, and likeability. \n\nYou will never be happy. You wrench out a fake smile and laugh to yourself believing that watching a content creator that you understand 20% of at best is somehow superior than watching your own kind, as you project your disgusting traits onto your entire kind. However, deep inside you feel the depression creeping up like a weed, ready to crush you under the unbearable weight, and you know that. You know that all you do now is have an entirely new linguistic medium in which to be ignored, and not even the exotic trait of being foreign makes up for just how uninteresting of a person you are. \n\nEventually it\u2019ll be too much to bear - you\u2019ll buy a rope, tie a noose, put it around your neck, and plunge into the cold abyss. Your parents will find you, heartbroken but relieved that they no longer have to live with the unbearable shame and disappointment. They\u2019ll bury you with a headstone marked with your birth name, and every passerby for the rest of eternity will know a Western man is buried there. Your body will decay and go back to the dust, and all that will remain of your legacy is a skeleton that is unmistakably Caucasian. This is your fate. This is what you chose. There is no turning back. \n\nHate yourself and apologize for being white to some Japanese entity that exists only in your mind while actual Japanese people put in effort to learn English for the valid reason of it being the global language."

            "Today in school we had a substitute teacher in one of my classes and I pulled an epic prank on the whole class. When he had to leave the classroom for a few minutes, I went up the whiteboard and wrote TROLOLOLOL in all caps (for those of you who don't know, this is the catchphrase of the Troll Face from Rage Comics). It took up like half the white board xD By the time he got back, I was sitting at my desk pretending that nothing happened, but all my stupid classmates were staring at me (they didn't get the reference). When the sub asked \u201cwho wrote this?\u201d I was trying really hard not to laugh and I stood up while making the same facial expression as the Troll Face meme and I asked \"problem?\" I was expecting AT LEAST one of my classmates to laugh, but nobody did (like I said earlier, they didn\u2019t get the reference). Still standing, I thought of a new joke. I made the facial expression of Doge (a different internet meme) and I said \u201cmuch troll, very epic\u201d so everyone would get that it was a joke about the Troll Face. To my surprise, not a single person laughed, and after a few seconds of me waiting for everyone to get the joke, a kid said \u201csit down faggot.\u201d I asked if he went on the Four-Chan forums because they made up that word, but he just looked at me like I was the stupid one. By now, pretty much the whole class was yelling at me to sit down and shut up. I took this opportunity to make a Four-Chan reference, so as a joke, I yelled \u201cFUCKING NORMIES\u201d (because that\u2019s what Four-Chan calls people who don\u2019t get memes) and ran circles around the desks with my arms behind my back like in anime xD I got a lunch detention from the sub but it was worth it because I got to troll the whole class.",
