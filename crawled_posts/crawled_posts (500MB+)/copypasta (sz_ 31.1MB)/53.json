He penetrates my butthole. It hurts so much, but I do it for Bernie. I can feel my butt tearing and eyes watering. I want to please Bernie.

            "Frum atheist gang \ud83d\ude0e\n\nFuck you. You useless piece of shit. You absolute waste of space and air. You uneducated, ignorant, idiotic dumb swine, you\u2019re an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole. The magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as moniker of evil for heretics. Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did. When Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality. After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society. No wonder your father questioned whether or not your were truly his son, for you'd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member. Your birth made it so that mankind is worse of in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover into a state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune. I would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell. You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted sac religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair. You are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. Rhodes Island would have been better off if you'd never joined us. You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being. Even this worlds finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are. Anyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe. In the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now. You are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet you manage to make it so that that is only a small part of the evil that is your being. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an eldrich abomination, but here you are. It\u2019s hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you. Even if time travel some day will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to before this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors if they failed would have to many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it. I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did. The countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant. Right from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring. You are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the infected plague apparently only happened with the goal of teaching humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankind\u2019s greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created. If you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched. You are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again. The sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe. I could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating working as hard and efficiently as possible, yet there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world. You are an irresponsible, idiotic, disgusting, unloved, horrible excuse for a living being who\u2019s soul contains less humanity than every ginger in history combined. The absolute disgust I feel when thinking about anything that has even a slight resemblance to anything that might have to do with you and your unholy actions is so incredibly great that when I am honest about it I think that even I do not posses a consciousness great enough to comprehend my own feelings about it. When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children, they did not give their lives to have you fuck the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject become more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to understand what your failure actually means for the universe. My hate for you and everything you stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take the entire Lungmen population down there and back up around twenty million times before you would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I think that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world combined would not be able to stack up to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that when being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless. There is no one in this world that has ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, no one will ever love you in the future either. There is no hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will ever change for the better, and in fact quite the opposite might be true. By making the mistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will only devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are. The only possible way in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is would exclusively be because there is absolutely no conceivable way that you would even be able to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in.",

            "I know I don't usually review anime books but this one seemed important enough that I probably should cover it sooner than later. I would prefer to review the anime instead but thus far they have not adapted the entire thing yet, only a few chapters. And from what I have seen the anime adaptions have been pretty shitty. (Dramatic whipping scene with creepy ass baby plays). WHAT IN THE FUCK. I DO NOT REMEMBER THAT BEING IN THE BOOK. Oh, wait yeah it was right here. Revelations chapter 6 verse 14 \"And then Jesus turned around and saw a creepy ass mother fuckin' baby, and he thought to himself \"WHAT IN THE FUCK IS THAT FUCKING SHIT?!\"\". The Bible has got to be the longest anime book ever written. I read this whole thing cover to cover and it is pretty fucking boring. I'll admit there are a few interesting things that pop up from time to time but for the most part, it's extremely dull. But that's not even my biggest problem with this anime book. The biggest issue I have has gotta be the FANBASE. If you thought bronies were bad, if you thought those Sonic the Hedgehog fans were bad, then you haven't seen anything yet. Die-hard fans of the bible refer to themselves as \"Christians\" named after the book's main protagonist \"Jesus Christ\". These \"Christians\" take anime book fandom to a whole new level (clip of \"Christians\" being lifted into heaven plays). They try to get laws and legislations and shit changed because of what the Bible says. That's fucking insane isn't it would be like if some guy said: \"Hey everyone should be legally required to wear headbands signifying where they are from because that's what they do in the Naruto anime book\". If someone said that shit then everybody would look at them like they were fucking insane. But when fans of the Bible anime book do the same exact shit nobody seems to give a damn. Its fucking double standard bullshit is what it is. These \"Christians\" think that gay people shouldn't be allowed to get married and don't even get me started on abortions. You know what? Fuck it I'm pretty pissed I'm gonna solve this abortion debate once and for all. If any of you congressmen are watching Mumky's anime review then ya better grab a pen and paper because I'm about to give you the answer to the abortion debacle. You always hear the same two sides of this debate. There is the \"Christian\" pro-life people who think that abortions shouldn't happen and there's the pro-choice people who say women should get a pick if they want an abortion or not. Let me be the first to say that both of these ideas are equally stupid. I'm not pro-life and I'm not pro-choice. I'm pro-abortion, I think that every single woman should get an abortion every single time. Even if you don't think you're pregnant you should go get an abortion anyway just in case. It should be a fucking routine like going to the dentist or something, like every six months women go in for their biannual abortion. Because here's the thing it has been scientifically proven that 99% of human being are fucking assholes. So the way I see it we don't need any more people being born. So let's take the fucking vacuum and suck those fuckers out before they have a chance to grow and be a dick all the time. Honestly, we don't need any more people being born, there's already like billion and that's way too fucking many as it is. Ladies I don't care if you are in your third trimester abort that little fucker before it's too late.",

            "YandereDev is actually a talentless leech. He has been developing his game for 6 years, all the meanwhile taking donations from people who actually want to see the game developed. He is narcissistic and uncooperative despite having the coding skills of a 5 year old child with penguin flippers instead of hands. He is barely on the first boss of the game after 6 years and spends most of his time slouching around and streaming. I hope people stop giving him money and he is forced to do something with his life.",

I am the Sin Archbishop \u201cGreed\u201d Regulus Corneas. The most satisfied existence in the world! The most indisputably asserted, an existence without any wavering aspects! It\u2019s supposed to be like that, so why do I have to go through this?! Don\u2019t mess around, this is no joke. Each and every one of them, what\u2019s wrong with them that they accept such nonsensical absurdities as if they are a matter of course. That man, that woman, and that knight too, just because I showed a little mercy are getting too ahead of themselves, if I had been serious from the beginning then I could have had torn them apart in bits and pieces, but aren\u2019t they misunderstanding their own power? That you can shamelessly make misunderstandings, that are from my point of view, hilariously wrong, is why I hate getting involved with others! Obnoxious, annoying, irritating, infuriating, vexing, dirty, unsightly scum. I\u2019ve always always been doing well, for years, decades, centuries, this way for all that time, I have been faithfully serving as a Sin Archbishop more than anyone. When I was first chosen as a sin archbishop and received this witch factor, I killed them all, the father who despite his poor earnings was plagued with bad drinking habits, the mother who prattled on endlessly complaining day and night, and the greedy brothers who used to ravenously eye the portion that rightfully belonged to me, were all killed by me, the villagers who looked at me like I\u2019m an idiot too, the people of the town who pushed me and my house into that hopeless village too, the inept heads of the country who carelessly abandoned the village and the town to that state in the first place too, I tore them all apart into bits and pieces, and when everything was gone I finally noticed a way I could live! I don\u2019t need anything. Everything is just annoying. I am already satisfied. It\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t have it, I just didn\u2019t need it. Unlike the intrusive scum, I\u2019ve never needed anything. Despite that, giving me something, doesn\u2019t that mean that from outside, from your point of view, that you looked at me and thought that I was a pitiful lacking existence. Everyone who wants to impose unneeded things on me should be killed, so only those who will leave the satisfied me alone should be allowed into this world. No matter who, just talking about their selfish nonsense, those shits. Who has the right to pity me. Who has the right to pity me and drive me to despair. As if I would let them. I don\u2019t need anything and neither did I ask for anything. A father who despite his poor earnings was plagued with bad drinking habits and yet still occasionally buys gifts for me is scum better off dead. A mother who prattled on endlessly complaining day and night while saying obvious things like \u201capologies I\u2019ve troubled you\u201d is scum better off dead. The greedy brothers who despite ravenously eyeing the portion that rightfully belonged to me used to divide my part of their bun when my food got spilled are scum better off dead. Stop you shits, being arbitrarily kind towards me. Being kind, it must mean that you think I\u2019m low, that you\u2019re looking down on me. Someone who looks the goddamn down on others, especially someone who looks down family, It\u2019s natural that they would be hated. It\u2019s natural that they\u2019re dead. It\u2019s not my fault. I\u2019ve done nothing wrong. It\u2019s your fault, you you pitypitypity me, treat me like I\u2019m pathetic, and leave me all alone. Have a taste of what it\u2019s like to be made to feel like the most worthless person in the world. Surrounding me should only be those who do not pity me. Those who do pity me should disappear from the world. I hear laughter. You\u2019re looking at me, aren\u2019t you. You looked at me and laughed, didn\u2019t you. What\u2019s so laughable about me. What did you see in me that made you laugh. All of them laughing and laughing. A bunch of powerless scum who are only good at running their mouths. Why does my heart have to break so much because of them. Don\u2019t stand in my way don\u2019t obstruct me don\u2019t pity me I\u2019m not the I\u2019m not the pitiable one, it\u2019s you helpless and ignorant but still with \u201cGreed\u201d! You have to crawl throughout your entire life just to satisfy your incomplete selves, you\u2019re the pitiable greed! I\u2019m different I\u2019m not like that I don\u2019t want anything. The desireless me is better than your incomplete selves. Don\u2019t pity me. The truth is that you\u2019re jealous of me, envious of me, you admire me and because you can\u2019t reach me you\u2019re just running your mouth off. That\u2019s right that must be right it\u2019s obviously right. Wait, wait, just wait. Just stop. Don\u2019t look at me don\u2019t say my name don\u2019t talk about me. Good or bad, just stop it, don\u2019t pay attention to me, ignore me and leave me alone. Even though a complete existence has a heart that should not be able to be trampled on how come the likes of you are so insistent on interacting with me. I cannot comprehend it in the slightest. Both you and I are different people. Even thinking of getting a return by taking risks, no matter how you think about it, could never be reasonable would always be a mistake. You\u2019re sick in the head. Calm down and think about it and you should be able to understand. All humans except me are just floating in a fever. Asking of others, that very fact that it is understandable is meaningless, useless and irresponsible should be easy to understand. It is all a fantasy of yours which you call it love love is friendship and trust what foolish idiocy reproductive activities themselves are the utmost disgusting acts. I don\u2019t understand what it means. For what are you doing this. Whether it\u2019s for being a mother or a child, although it makes a family, even if it is decorated with such words, it will be different from myself, whether that thing dies out or not, what does that have to do with me. If they continue to live when I die, I\u2019ll be over. If they are dead while I live would only mean my continuation. Love and affection only makes it so that people cannot be independent. A person is independent in the first place. Out of concern for those who operate under such delusions, to be looked down by others is foolish and so I found companionship by gathering well looking women, and in order to not be betrayed I ask for only virgins, what more do you want of me. Don\u2019t skip such a selfish act. Infringing on me to this extent, but you still ask whether you can infringe upon me even more? To think you\u2019ve hit this point! To think your thoughts could be so twisted! Inflicting all this upon me, what more could you even ask of me. Just what do I have to do to not be pitied. The most pitiful person in the world, or whatever! There is no way anything said by that a lady plagued with such vulgar \u201cGreed\u201d who wants to to connect with one she li\\~kes is justified!",

Kill your victim by asphyxiating them, or  hitting them in the head really really really hard.\n\n2.(route A)If you're planning on dismembering the body, make sure to do it where you can easily get rid and clean the blood A.K.A a bathroom. \n\n3.Cut the body into smaller pieces. remove the head first, then cut off the arms using a butcher knife. (if you want even smaller parts cut the elbow and hands off), then cut off  the groin off the main body. after doing this cut the knees off the thigh so the thigh and legs are separated. then cut off the feet. also don't forget to cut off the fingers to prevent identification.\n\n4.You can now put the dismembered body parts in random places and no one will suspect a thing (as long as its well hidden ofc. dont just go dumping it jn a forest thats stupid) **OR** you can use maggots. buy them from the local pet store and have them eat the corpse. the smaller the body part the faster the maggot can eat it. after its done kill all the maggots to prevent flies from emerging from it (you can do this in a medium sized aquarium) you can get rid of the bones by burying it or crushing into smaller parts.\n\n2.(Route B) if you're not planning on dismembering the body, pour yohurt into the anus and mouth to speed up decomposition. \n\n3.Bury the body. Bury it in your background to make sure no one will ever see it or bury it somewhere no one visits so no one will see you digging a hole. \n\n4.Make sure to have a decoy. after you're done burying the body put a dead animal over it so the police dogs wont find the body. \n\n5.Pour water around the soil where you buried the body so after it dries it doesn't look as suspicious.",
