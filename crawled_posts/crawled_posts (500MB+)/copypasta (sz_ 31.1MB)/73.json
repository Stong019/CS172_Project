        "selftext": "Fuck this is so embarrassing. I'm literally shaking so hard rn. So like the randy horny mf I am, I was jerking off and edging myself before one of my online classes. Then the class started so I joined. Our teacher's pretty strict and all and expects cameras on at all times. So I just sat there whilst everyone joined, still horny as hell. I had my dick pressed between my legs still. Teacher's going round asking us how the weekend went yada yada. So now it's my turn to speak. I unmute my mic to say my stuff and whilst I'm talking I squeeze my legs a little too hard and come hard as fuck causing to me to literally moan LIKE A FUCKING WHALE and make my horrid contorted orgasm face RIGHT ON FUCKING CAMERA WITH MY MIC UNMUTED WHILST THE ENTIRE CLASS OF 40 STUDENTS ARE WATCHING. LET'S NOT EVEN FORGET THAT MY FACE WAS FULL-SCREEN WHILST I WAS SPEAKING. In a total crazy panic, I leave the class.\n\nI'm dropping that class asap. No, scratch that. Dropping out of college altogether. No way can I go back there again. Might as well drop off this earth while I'm at it.",

Usually when we have these types of calls I just keep the video running in the background and I walk around the room doing things to pass the time and distract myself from the monotone presenters. Well today I forgot that I left the camera on (I usually always have it off but earlier today I had a call with the partner to discuss my upcoming promotion, so I had to have it on). I had no clue I had left the camera on and in the middle of walking around and muttering to myself as I was zoning out, I flipped it out and started to rub one out. I did so with complete confidence, openly and ferociously, stroking faster and faster until I heard the presenter stop and kindly asked me to turn my camera off. Mortified, I lifted my pants up and rushed over to turn the camera off. Soon after the training was over I had a call with HR and they let me know that I was being terminated. I hated the job anyway so not so bummed about that, but I\u2019m not sure what to say in interviews now if I\u2019m asked why I left this job. Any advice?",

Yes yours! I first saw her in the Wal-Mart pickin out your drawers. Big Dolly Parton hair like an 80s prom queen But her ass was lookin good all up in those mom-jeans. I approached her in the checkout line, and said yo baby wassup? She had two gallons of milk, and I was starin at her jugs. Five minutes later she agreed to get with me So we went and rocked the minivan like Giggity. Giggity. Giggity. I was ridin your mom like she was Mario Kart. I gave her a lift back to her crib cause her car wouldn't start. She invited me in the house, and we started makin out again. How many times I tap that ass? OVER 9000! Yeah. She called me Pledge cause I knocked the dust off it. She later made me a sandwich and she cut the crust off it. Cause she knows how I like it, and that I'm a little young To be in the bed, butt-naked doin your mom. Doin your mom doin doin your mom Doin your mom doin doin your mom Doin doin your mom doin doin your mom You know we straight with doin your mom Doin your mom doin doin your mom Doin your mom doin doin your mom Doin doin your mom doin doin your mom You know we straight with doin your mom I like your mamas big butt, and I cannot lie. You other brothers can't deny that she's fly. We make sexy time, yes and every night I tap that. She saw me butt-naked, now she thinks I'm half black. But your moms the best, the super M.I.L.F. Cause she loves to toss the salad even though she ain't a chef And I blame it on the al-al-al-cohol But If I were you, I wouldn't kiss your mom on the mouth at all. She likes the Donkey-Punch. She likes the Dirty Sanchez. Sometimes she even likes to fool around in your bed. She likes rough sex with handcuffs and I'll be honest She likes me to Chris Brown her when she acts like Rihanna. She's so therapeutic. When I need to cure my restlessness I br-br-br-br-br-br-br-br motorboat your moms breastestess. I didn't wanna tell you, but I had to write this song Cause I'm in your house every night doin your mo-om. Doin your mom doin doin your mom Doin your mom doin doin your mom Doin doin your mom doin doin your mom You know we straight with doin your mom Doin your mom doin doin your mom Doin your mom doin doin your mom Doin doin your mom doin doin your mom You know we straight with doin your mom I'm havin sex with your mother That makes me better than you. I'm havin sex with your mother That makes me better than you.

And then, the Han freezing in carbonite scene came, and when Leia said 'I love you' to him, I kissed my gf. She was taken aback, and soon she started kissing me too. I slowly pushed her down on the bed as we had more steamy, passionate and romantic kissing. In no time, our clothes were off, and I was ready to put it in. But our dumbasses forgot to pause the movie... As soon as I was putting it in, the 'I am your father' line came and I instantly got harder. My gf was loving this. I put it in her. She screamed with joy. I was also having fun. But then, the Imperial march started playing. I felt something come over me. The Sith shall rise. In my anger and lust for power I force choked my girlfriend. My journey to the Dark Side was complete. Luke's resistance and weakness to join the darkside completely enraged me. I am now marching all the way to Los Angeles to beat up Mark Hamill with my lightsaber.\n\nIf you only knew the power of the Dark Side, Luke",

            "### Chapter 6\n\n# The Power of the Force\n\nI think we've all at one point heard the song. Even if we didn't, we probably know the words. The song is the Star Wars anthem. I don't remember how old I was when I first heard this song, but it is definitely a defining moment in my life. I still think of it as some of the best music to be put in a movie.\n\nI saw Star Wars at a theater in middle school with my friends. I was eleven years old. I was immediately in love with the movie. I still love it. It really was a defining moment in my life. I remember watching it and really loving it. I couldn't wait for it to be released so I could see it again.\n\nAfter I watched it the first time, it became a defining moment for my brother as well. He saw Star Wars for the first time the same time I did. He was probably about fourteen. I was eleven. He loved the movie so much. So much so that he had a huge collection of the toys. This was the late eighties. There wasn't the internet like there is today. It was a pretty big deal if you didn't have the internet. So, he took to collecting all the Star Wars toys. He still has some of those toys. He even has the Star Wars book with all the toys in it. He keeps the collection in a box. There was a picture in the book of a kid with his mother at his house. I didn't understand why they needed to go to the store when all they needed to do was look at that book. In the picture the kid had a box with about fifty of the toys. It was a big deal.\n\nSo, then I watched Empire Strikes Back. I'm probably about twelve when I saw that. I loved it even more than the first one. I kept on watching it with my brother.",

            "So my gf(f19), was over and we were casually watching The Empire Strikes Back(I am 19 btw). And then, the Han freezing in carbonite scene came, and when Leia said 'I love you' to him, I kissed my gf. She was taken aback, and soon she started kissing me too. I slowly pushed her down on the bed as we had more steamy, passionate and romantic kissing. In no time, our clothes were off, and I was ready to put it in. But our dumbasses forgot to pause the movie... As soon as I was putting it in, the 'I am your father' line came and I instantly got harder. My gf was loving this. I put it in her. She screamed with joy. I was also having fun. But then, the Imperial march started playing. I felt something come over me. The Sith shall rise. In my anger and lust for power I force choked my girlfriend. My journey to the Dark Side was complete. Luke's resistance and weakness to join the darkside completely enraged me. I am now marching all the way to Los Angeles to beat up Mark Hamill with my lightsaber.\r  \n\r  \nIf you only knew the power of the Dark Side, Luke",

            "Okay. So, I\u2019ve been seeing this copypasta floating around about wanting to \u201cbang the Animal Crossing dog\u201d, and frankly- I think this is disgusting. First of all, her name isn\u2019t \u201cthe Animal Crossing dog\u201d, it\u2019s Isabelle. It\u2019s a beautiful name for a beautiful person, and you would all do well to refer to her as such. If you don\u2019t even know her name, than you have no right wanted to have sex with her!\n\nSecondly, wanting to bang her is just gross. Saying that you want to bang Isabelle is objectifying her, and it is not okay. If you\u2019ve ever wanted to bang Isabelle, you should be disgusted with yourself.\n\nUnlike you cretins, I however- respect her. Sure, it\u2019s possible I may consider her to be rather bangable, but I wouldn\u2019t dare do such a thing. Isabelle is a fucking queen, and deserves to be treated as such.\n\nI DO NOT want to bang \u201cThe Animal Crossing dog\u201d. I want to hug her. I want to be in a healthy and loving relationship with Isabelle. I want to wake up every morning in bed, with her lying peacefully next to me as the morning sun shines in through the window. I want to make her breakfast every morning, and tend to her every need. I want her to feel like she is truly loved, (because she is). I want her to be by my side for my whole life, because I know that she is the perfect woman for me, and I am perfect for her.\n\nI want to be to be with her every day, just so I can tell her how much I fucking love her. I want her to know how much I adore everything amazing personality, her incredible fashion sense, her extremely impressive caretaking abilities, and her absolutely beautiful head to body ratio, and her beautiful, beautiful eyes.\n\nHowever, if I were to ever have sex with Isabelle, I wouldn\u2019t simply be \u201cbanging\u201d her. If Isabelle were to ever consent to me having sexual intercourse with her, it would be tender and loving and passionate. As we make love, I\u2019d slowly and gently caress her soft, golden fur as I slowly but deliberately thrusted into her tight dog pussy. I would make her pleasure my utmost priority, with my own being secondary. But if she was willing, than oh god. What I wouldn\u2019t give to feel her adorable little paws running up and down the length of my shaft. I just wanna pet every inch of her body, and give her scritches on her tummy so she does that thing that dogs do where their legs spaz out. That\u2019d just be so fucking hot. I\u2019d probably end up cumming all over her, so it gets in her fur. But goddamn. I love that fur so much, that I\u2019d personally lick off every last drop of cum, just to I have another opportunity to get as close to her gorgeous fur as possible.\n\nBut if you just want to bang her, than you are a disgusting degenerate, and I hope you burn in the deepest pits of tartarus.\n\nBut Digby on the other hand.

            "Fuck it. I\u2019m setting the record straight. I\u2019m sick and tired of people always worshipping Isabelle. like yeah buddy I\u2019m sure you know your way around a cartoon dog like the hentai casual you are. If you actually wanna talk to me don\u2019t come back until you can tell the difference between a sophisticated original unique hentai piece and a cookie cutter big titty dog. You wanna know who\u2019s really deserving of the number one spot? Raymond. Now before diving into his beauty let\u2019s look at how just standing alone he\u2019s better than Isabelle. For starters Isabelle has been used over and over can you really tell the difference between an erotic picture about her from new leaf to today? She\u2019s consistent stayed that same boring dumbass buck toothed dog and people just eat it up. But Raymond? Fresh meat. And already hitting the stride Isabelle lost long ago. Raymond\u2019s art can reach anywhere from gay, trap, and much much more. Trust me, iv seen over 350 different erotic pictures/videos of him and iv masturbated flawlessly every time. Just thinking about him is enough to get me going. His adorable outfit, charming eyes, and kind attitude just can\u2019t resist the thought of dominating that adorable cat. Did I mention the last time Isabelle ever Gabe me an erection was over a year ago? But ever since new horizons launch Raymond has given me countless erections. The consistent of his beauty is just overwhelming compared to Isabelle\u2019s cookie cutter attitude. I doubt you\u2019ll ever full appreciate Raymond. But I\u2019m glad. While you\u2019re scrounging rule34 for futanari Isabelle my Raymond comes a cock straight out of the box, you can even find reverse gender Raymond. So please by all means, eat up your basic Isabelle art and leave the finer, more beautiful Raymond hentai to people who can tell the difference between an overused character and something wi5 atleast the smallest bit of beauty? Great. Now I have to go masturbate again. All this Raymond talk has already left me about to cum. I hope you\u2019re happy, I promise myself I\u2019d only masturbate to Raymond 14 times today. But after all this I\u2019m gonna have to go another three times. But I can\u2019t blame myself, Nintendo purposefully gave Raymond that charm I can\u2019t seem to grasp. From head to toe Raymond is just beautiful. The clothes he wear just merge into his soft, elegant fur. His tail compliments his firm, tight ass. Sometimes I get lost in his eyes for hours. People always put Raymond into a maid outfit and I can\u2019t blame them. That sort of outfit really makes you want to dominate him. And that truly is the definitive way to appreciate Raymond\u2019s beauty. Although personally I wish there was an option for him to go full nude. There really is no wrong way to masturbate to Raymond. My \u201cfriends\u201d always mock me saying \u201cRaymond isn\u2019t real, you\u2019ll never be able to fuck him!\u201d I tear up hearing this. I know they\u2019re wrong. One day it\u2019ll all come true. But for know I have to fave the facts. I have no game with him. And even if he was real would he bother with me? I could never match up to his standards. But then i remember how sweet he is, he\u2019d see me for who I truly am and we\u2019d be together forever. I smile at the thought. One day I\u2019ll know someone will turn my fantasy into reality. But then I remember Isabelle would probably turn real too, my blood boils at the thought of that buck toothed hooligan existing in the same plane of existence as Raymond. But it\u2019s a cost I\u2019d pay to have a chance at Raymond. I\u2019ll always be waiting for the day I can marry Raymond. I\u2019m always counting the seconds.",

There is nothing more fucking hot than Isabelle, and the new game's release will (If my calculations are correct) cause a massive flood of new Isabelle rule 34. I have harassed everyone I've found with an early copy, and I've tried to convince them to give it to me in every way I know. That includes offering my mum's credit card (that's fucking revenge for trying to take away my 3DS you bitch), death threats, begging, and other typically effective means.

            " So I was getting home to our apartment when my girlfriend asked me if I wanted to have anal sex. I was so excited that my eroction level rose over nein thousand. I responded with a big yes, and ran to the apartment so fast that the green hill earrape music began to play as I ran. When I got to the apartment, I rushed to the bedroom, my girlfriend was getting ready in the bathroom. As soon as I reached the bedroom, I imediately started taking my clothes off down to my bocksers. Then my girlfriend came in the room, and said \"what do you think?\" in sly, lustful way. I turned around and saw my girlfriend completely naked with her beautiful tits, aluring figure, and massive co-wait... massive cock? I never expected to her with a pickle, I never saw her with one before, I started getting nervous, as I didn't like wear this was going. the length of her eggplant put mine to shame. She then lustfully told me \"Bend over...\" I didn't but I was getting scarred. \"Bend over, slut!\" she told me agian even more lustful and demanding than the last time, I still refused, butt was starting to get really scared. \"BEND OVER, YOU SLUTTY BITCH!!!\" she yelled at me, I did so, and was really scared. \"Good boy, now, tonight we're gonna do things MY way.\" she said followed by maniacal lafftur. I felt the tip of her massive 15 inch ding dong brush against my boxers. She then took them off, and was about to penetrait my azzole with her man-fruit. She then proceeded to plunger her fonker into my pooper forcefully, \"Oh, your so tight, Gabe.\" she moaned as she humped the shit out of me. She only continued to thrust in and out harder and faster as it went on, I was even starting to bleed out of my ass. The experience was humiliating and painful, as her jungjung tore away at my angus. \"Oh, you are such a slut.\" she moaned, thrusting even harder and faster inside of me, causing me even more intense pain. \"Jazzy, please stop...\" I whimpered out in pain. \"NO!!! tonight IM fucking YOU, BITCH!!!\" she yelled at me and slapped my in the face, and started t0 thrust even hareder. \"IS THIS HOW YOU LIKE IT, YOU SLUTTY BITCH, IS THIS HOW YOU LIKE IT?!?!?!\" she yelled at me sadistically. I was leaking tears and blood, tears from my eyes as I was crying from the pain, and blood from anas as it was being destroyed my girlfriend's massive schlong. \"OH FUCK!!! OH GOD!!! OH DEAR FUCKING GOD, IM ABOUT TO FUCKING CUM!!!\" she screamed as I knew she was almost finished, I felt some relief, my suffereing was almost over. She began to moan loader as she neared her orgasm. \"OH FUCKING GOD!!!\" she screamed, as I felt he klonker gush out her lust juice into what was left of my anal cavity. She then pulled out of me, ending my suffering. \"You may not of enjoyed that, but I certainly did!\" she said proudly. I then went to the hospital to get treated for my injuries. However, the experience traumatized me.  \nGuys, what should I do about my GF?",
