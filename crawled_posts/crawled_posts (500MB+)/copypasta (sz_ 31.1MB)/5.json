            "I keep having dreams where I call Obama the N-word and I want it to stop\n\n\nThis is a throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\nSome background. Politically, I've been a Democrat my entire life and an Obama supporter for as long as I can remember. I volunteered for John Kerry's presidential campaign back in 2004 which is where first registered on my map. I watched his speech at the DNC was was instantly enamoured. \n\nWhen he announced his candidacy for president in 2007, immediately threw my weight behind him. I knocked on doors, educated people about his policies and did the best I could to get people to vote for him. When he was elected, I was ecstatic. In the past, when I had supported candidates, it was out of cold reason; because I thought their policies and acumen would result in the best net result for this country. But this was a person I could get excited about, someone I could *believe* in.\n\nWhen it came time for his campaign for a second term it was largely the same. I had slightly soured on him. Granted, he was not the president I had hoped he would be but that was not his fault. I had built him up to be so huge in my head it was impossible for him to live up to expectations. Republican gridlock in Congress also prevented him from getting through the policies he wanted. Nevertheless, I still supported him, still volunteered and was still happy when he won his second term.\n\nThe problem started about three weeks ago. I had a dream involving Barack, which is not uncommon for me, I was working with him and Michelle on their upcoming Netflix show. We were looking over demographics and how they related to various geographical locations. Without even realising it, I said \"Yeah, N***er, we should do pretty well in (area near me)\" He just looked at me and stormed out with Michelle behind him. I woke up and went into the bathroom to splash cold water in my face. I dismissed it. I don't have a racist bone in my body. This was just one of those dreams, right?\n\nA week and a half ago, I had a similar experience. This time I dreamt we were going wine-tasting together. I don't remember the lead-up but I ended up saying something to the effect of \"The sommelier said we should be detecting earthy tones in this wine, but it's just not registering with me, N***er\" This time, instead of storming out he replied, very sternly \"Why did you feel that was an appropriate thing to say?\" I began to stutter and explain it was an accident but I had once again woken up.\n\nThe most recent incident was last night. I dreamt I was at a family barbecue with the Obamas, just his family and mine. He was manning the grill and i was speaking to Michelle while the children played with each other (I know Sasha and Malia are adults now but I still think of them as children) I said to Michelle very politely \"excuse me for one moment\" and marched right up to Barack and tapped him on the shoulder. He turned around to look and me and I just said the word and nothing else. I can write off this happening once or twice in my dreams but three separate events is too much.\n\nI don't know what to do. I don't want to do this. Every time it happens my work suffers the next day. I've started lying to my wife saying I've been having nightmares but I'm not sure she fully believes it. Lately, I've been worrying I might start saying it in my sleep and she could hear. I'm at my wits end and I want it to stop.",

            "I just downvoted your comment.\n\n# FAQ\n\n# What does this mean?\n\nThe amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.\n\n# Why did you do this?\n\nThere are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Rudeness towards other Redditors,\n* Spreading incorrect information,\n* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.\n\n# Am I banned from the Reddit?\n\nNo - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.\n\n# I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?\n\nSure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.\n\n# How can I prevent this from happening in the future?\n\nAccept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",

These include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Being gay\n* Dank copypasta bro, where'd you find it\n* walter\n\n## Am I going to shit and cum too?\n\nNo - not yet. But you should refrain from shitposting and cumposting like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to shit and cum again, which may put your shitting and cumming privileges in jeopardy.\n\n## I don't believe my comment deserved being shit and cum at. Can you un-cum it?\n\nSure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I put shit back into my butt. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a hot load explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to retaliatory ejaculation within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of semen dies before it can fertilize the egg, and yours is likely no exception.\n\n## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?\n\nAccept the goopy brown and white substance and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated in my mom's basement. I will continue to shit and cum until you improve your conduct. Remember: ejaculation is privilege, not a right.",

It was his suggestion that I try this \u2014 i had never even thought about it before, but jumped at the chance.\n\nInitially, it was quite difficult to get to sleep with a big dick buried in my mouth, but after a while, I just got really tired and fell asleep for about three hours. I was woken by his cumming in my mouth while he was still asleep! I swallowed it all down like a good boy and sucked him clean while he moaned softly in his sleep. I got back to sleep about thirty minutes later, but then got woken again about two hours later, to my lover actively grabbing my head and \u201cface fucking\" me to his second orgasm, a much larger, more powerful orgasm that I nearly choked on because I could hardly swallow fast enough.\n\nI tried to sleep again afterwards with his penis in my mouth but it was difficult. I think it fell out of my mouth a little later and I slept with his dick on my face. He woke up about an hour later, fresh as a daisy, while I work up so tired, with jaw ache\u2026but with a nice taste of my lover's orgasm in my mouth.\n\nThat's the second answer I found.",

            "The answer is Yes, I had a boyfriend that I did this with multiple times\u2026 at least three occasions that I can remember. Having a penis in my mouth is very soothing, like a pacifier to a baby.\n\nHere\u2019s how it worked: he would lay on his side, and I would spoon around his knees with my head propped up by a pillow so that my face was even with his Cock. We would both be excited by it at the beginning so there was always an initial intense session resulting in an orgasm, and once that was out of the way we would drift off to sleep. He would lose his erection after that first orgasm, allowing me to snuggle up against him and just relax with his limp Cock filling my mouth. While I would gently suckle on him while drifting off, once I was asleep that stopped and my mouth would just hold his Cock while we slept.\n\nREM sleep causes erections, so several times during the night I would be woken up by the Cock in my mouth growing too big for my mouth to contain. (Sadly I\u2019ve never mastered being able to deep throat.) Let me tell you, there is no greater feeling than the initial moment of confusion of crossing over from a dream into reality and realizing your mouth is actually full of Cock. Upon waking up I would start sucking again, which would lead to him cumming again, and then we would both drift off to sleep again, neither one of us having said a word. And then the whole cycle would repeat again and again until morning.\n\nNow the drawback to all this is that we were both having our REM cycle interrupted all night, and we would both be exhausted all the next day. As a result we didn\u2019t do this all the time but saved it for a special treat. The memories of those nights and that feeling of waking up with my mouth full are some of the best sexual memories of my life.",

            "Is it possible to sleep with a man\u2019s penis in your mouth all night long?\n\nThe answer is Yes, I had a boyfriend that I did this with multiple times\u2026 at least three occasions that I can remember. Having a penis in my mouth is very soothing, like a pacifier to a baby.\n\nHere\u2019s how it worked: he would lay on his side, and I would spoon around his knees with my head propped up by a pillow so that my face was even with his Cock. We would both be excited by it at the beginning so there was always an initial intense session resulting in an orgasm, and once that was out of the way we would drift off to sleep. He would lose his erection after that first orgasm, allowing me to snuggle up against him and just relax with his limp Cock filling my mouth. While I would gently suckle on him while drifting off, once I was asleep that stopped and my mouth would just hold his Cock while we slept.\n\nREM sleep causes erections, so several times during the night I would be woken up by the Cock in my mouth growing too big for my mouth to contain. (Sadly I\u2019ve never mastered being able to deep throat.) Let me tell you, there is no greater feeling than the initial moment of confusion of crossing over from a dream into reality and realizing your mouth is actually full of Cock. Upon waking up I would start sucking again, which would lead to him cumming again, and then we would both drift off to sleep again, neither one of us having said a word. And then the whole cycle would repeat again and again until morning.\n\nNow the drawback to all this is that we were both having our REM cycle interrupted all night, and we would both be exhausted all the next day. As a result we didn\u2019t do this all the time but saved it for a special treat. The memories of those nights and that feeling of waking up with my mouth full are some of the best sexual memories of my life.",

I did not know he was watching me. I followed my condition. Roadside. But one day Hugh called me Annie Chan. It was a shame, but when she started screaming like candy to make fun of me, things got out of hand.\n\nI know it's annoying, but evil is my superstition, so I started drawing, and after a while we fell in love ... we got to the point of a kiss.\n\nOne night my parents were not home and we had sex with him. In a race. It was the best night of my life. We did this over and over again, and when I complained and called Oni-chan, I lost control. We're secretly a couple ... she's twelve, so I never thought I'm going to get pregnant ...\n\nWhen I heard she was pregnant, she was at my grandparents' house. I could not sleep that night and did not know what to do so I thought of torturing my brother ... I think the main character of this story is happy ...

            "\ud83c\udf5d\ud83c\udf5d\ud83c\udf5d\n\nYou trolls need to shut the fuck up. I'm so tired of being disrespected in this goddamn group . All I wanted to do was post my opinion. MY OPINION. But no, you little bastards think it's \"hilarious\" to mock those with good opinions. My opinion. while not absolute, is definitely worth the respect to formulate an ACTUAL FUCKING RESPONSE AND NOT JUST A SHORT MEME OF A REPLY. I've been in this group for 6 months: 6 MONTHS and I have never felt this wronged. It boils me up that I could spend so much time thinking and putting effort into things while you shits make fun of the intellectuals of this world. I've bored you? Good for fucking you. Literally no one cares that your little brain is to underdeveloped and rotted to comprehend my idea...MY GREAT GREAT IDEA. I could sit here all day whining, but I won't. I'm NOT a whiner. I'm a realist and an intellectual. I know when to call it quits and to leave the babybrains to themselves. I'm done with this goddamn group and you goddamn immature children. I have lived my life up until this point having to deal with memesters like you. I know how you work. I know that you all think you're \"epik trolls\" but you're not. You think you baited me? NAH. I've never taken any bait. This is my 100% real opinion divorced from anger. I'm calm, I'm serene. I LAUGH when people imply I'm intellectually low enough to take bait. I always choose to reply just to spite you. I won. I've always won. Losing is not in my skillset. So you're probably gonna reply \"lol epik trolled\" or \"u mad bro\" but once you've done that you've shown me I've won. I've tricked the trickster and conquered memery. I live everyday growing stronger to fight you plebs and low level trolls who are probably 11 (baby, you gotta be 18 to use Facebook). But whatever, I digress. It's just fucking annoying that I'm never taken serious in this group, goddamn"
