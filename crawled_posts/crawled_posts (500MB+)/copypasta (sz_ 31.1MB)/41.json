            " \n\nChicken Little review\n\nChicken Little is an enduring 1884 classic made by Walt Disney and Barack Obama it is incredible masterpiece and potentially the best movie ever with stunning visuals, deep and rich dialogue and a plot deeper than the Mariana trench it is wonderous seeing this movie the actors nail these characters with highly acclaimed actors such as Will Smith Jonny Depp and Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson it is perfect 10/10\n\nIt has a legacy that no other work can even remotely challenge the movie it is timeless and is the second coming of Jesus Christ no matter who you are where you are you need to see this movie it will change your life it even cures cancer it was so incredible that a sequel was cancelled because nothing can live up to this masterpiece.\n\nIt has a sense of childhood wonder into every word it can be hilarious and dramatic at the same time. The main character named Chicken Little played by Albert Einstein is a child in Oakey Oaks who gets bullied by everyone in the town because of his intelligence because he realizes that the sky is falling before anyone else but the people do not believe him because of how stupid they are except his friends which we will get to later and Buck Cluck possibly the best father figure in all of cinema. Buck Cluck played by Barack Obama is supportive of his genius son as he is also one of the most intelligent characters in the story. Then we get to chicken little friends Abby Mallard is played by Travis Scott from Fortnite and she is a vocalist often doing karaoke sessions that consist of the lyrics\u00a0\n\nThey told him, \"Don't you ever come around here\" \"Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear\" The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear So beat it, just beat it You better run, you better do what you can Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man You wanna be tough, better do what you can So beat it, but you wanna be bad Just beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it) No one wants to be defeated Showin' how funky and strong is your fight It doesn't matter who's wrong or right Just beat it (beat it) Just beat it (beat it) Just beat it (beat it) Just beat it (beat it, uh) They're out to get you, better leave while you can Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man You wanna stay alive, better do what you can So beat it, just beat it You have to show them that you're really not scared You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare They'll kick you, then they'll beat you Then they'll tell you it's fair So beat it, but you wanna be bad Just beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it) No one wants to be defeated Showin' how funky and strong is your fight It doesn't matter who's wrong or right Just beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it) No one wants to be defeated Showin' how funky and strong is your fight It doesn't matter who's wrong or right Just beat it (beat it, beat it, beat it) Beat it (beat it, beat it) Beat it (beat it, beat it) Beat it (beat it, beat it) Beat it (beat it, beat it) Beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it) No one wants to be defeated Showin' how funky and strong is your fight It doesn't matter who's wrong or right (who's right) Just beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it) No one wants to be defeated (no one) Showin' how funky and strong is your fight It doesn't matter who's wrong or right Just beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it) No one wants to be defeated (oh, no) Showin' how funky and strong is your fight It doesn't matter who's wrong or right Just beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it) No one wants to be defeated Showin' how funky and strong is your fight It doesn't matter who's wrong or right Just beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it) No one wants to be defeated\n\nAnd is Chicken Little\u2019s love interest and is one of the best designed characters whit a great dental plan and an amazing voice she is one of the best characters in cinema.

These include, but are not limited to:\n \u2022 Rudeness towards other Redditors,\n \u2022 Spreading incorrect information,\n \u2022 Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a _/s_.\n\nAm I banned from the Reddit?\n\nNo - not yet. But you should refrain from making downvote comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.\n\nI don't believe my downvote comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?\n\nSure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote on a downvote comment. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.\n\nHow can I prevent this from happening in the future?\n\nAccept the downvote on your downvote comment and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",

But I realized that features a guy, with a penis, and is therefore 50% gay.\u00a0 So I started looking for some girl on girl action, till I realized that is lesbian, and is therefore 100% gay.\u00a0 \n\nSo clearly, I had to look into alternative options.\u00a0 I started to consider hentai: since no one in it is real, it can\u2019t contain guys, so it\u2019s not gay, right? Well, hentai is anime, which not only is gay, but also makes me a weeb. The worst option so far.\n\nI considered traps. I\u2019ve long heard debate over whether traps are gay, so I decided to do the math.\u00a0 The gayness of traps lies in the premise. Let\u2019s consider the 5 base premises:\n1) a guy and a trap, where the guy initially thinks he\u2019s with a girl: effectively guy on girl, 50% gay\n2) a guy with a trap, and the guy knew it was a trap:\nDude looking for some dick, that\u2019s gay\n3) a girl with a trap, where the girl doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s a trap: that\u2019s lesbian, and is gay\n4) a girl with a trap, where the girl knows it\u2019s a trap: effectively guy on girl, therefore 50% gay\nTherefore, on average traps are 75% gay, with a minimum gayness of 50%. Not an improvement.\u00a0 The 5th option, trap on trap, is a singularity of the 4 prior possibilities, and is therefore on average 75% gay again.\n\nSo I got into specifics. What if it was girl on girl, and the premise was at least one of the girls was just bi-curious, and not actually fully lesbian? Well, in that case, their curiosity makes them a cat. Cats are furries, and furries are gay\n\nSo how about a girl soloing? Well that\u2019s a girl touching girl bits. Lesbian and gay.\n\nMy conclusion is that the only way to live a life free of homosexual sin is to liberate oneself of sexual desire at all, and become an asexual.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk.",

            "Last night I was looking for some porn of the not gay variety.\u00a0 Obviously gay porn is gay, so instead I went looking for guy on girl porn. But I realized that features a guy, with a penis, and is therefore 50% gay.\u00a0 So I started looking for some girl on girl action, till I realized that is lesbian, and is therefore 100% gay.\u00a0\n\nSo clearly, I had to look into alternative options.\u00a0 I started to consider hentai: since no one in it is real, it can\u2019t contain guys, so it\u2019s not gay, right? Well, hentai is anime, which not only is gay, but also makes me a weeb. The worst option so far.\n\nI considered traps. I\u2019ve long heard debate over whether traps are gay, so I decided to do the math.\u00a0 The gayness of traps lies in the premise. Let\u2019s consider the 5 base premises:\n\n1.\t\u2060a guy and a trap, where the guy initially thinks he\u2019s with a girl: effectively guy on girl, 50% gay\n2.\t\u2060a guy with a trap, and the guy knew it was a trap: Dude looking for some dick, that\u2019s gay\n3.\t\u2060a girl with a trap, where the girl doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s a trap: that\u2019s lesbian, and is gay\n4.\t\u2060a girl with a trap, where the girl knows it\u2019s a trap: effectively guy on girl, therefore 50% gay Therefore, on average traps are 75% gay, with a minimum gayness of 50%. Not an improvement.\u00a0 The 5th option, trap on trap, is a singularity of the 4 prior possibilities, and is therefore on average 75% gay again.\n\nSo I got into specifics. What if it was girl on girl, and the premise was at least one of the girls was just bi-curious, and not actually fully lesbian? Well, in that case, their curiosity makes them a cat. Cats are furries, and furries are gay\n\nSo how about a girl soloing? Well that\u2019s a girl touching girl bits. Lesbian and gay.\n\nMy conclusion is that the only way to live a life free of homosexual sin is to liberate oneself of sexual desire at all, and become an asexual.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk.",
